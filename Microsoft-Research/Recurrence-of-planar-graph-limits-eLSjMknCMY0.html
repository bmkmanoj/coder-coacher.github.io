probability seminar and we're very happy
to welcome back asaf necklace as our
first speaker and he was a postdoc here
among other places and he's now over the
border at UBC and he'll talk about
recurrence of planar graph limits thank
you can anyone can everyone hear me okay
so thanks for the invitation and it's
nice to be back in Seattle especially in
this beautiful weather I'm going to tell
you a story about recurrence about
planar graphs and they're going to be
circles involved and things like that
excellent so let me just jump ahead
alright so we're interested in
triangulations triangulations there are
planar graphs embedded in the planes
such that every face is is a is a is a
triangle forgot to mention that this is
all joint work with the width of a
global average sitting right here
reminding me so we're interested in like
our choosing one of these objects at
random it could be a triangulation it
could be a quadrangular shin where every
face is a is a square there are several
of course you know technicalities about
like you several ways you could define
triangulations but lets you know ignore
all of them and just assume all our
grafts are simple they're all embedded
in the plane and we never care about you
know the homotopy class you know we just
have an embedding we don't care if it's
you know we all we've all seen planar
graphs we want to choose one in random
and see how it looks like from oops from
afar from far away and I apologize for
the pictures you will see a lot of nice
pictures none of them was made by us we
really childish pictures is the one that
we actually were capable of doing and I
I put the credit for the for the
pictures the nice ones like this one
this is a random quadrangular shun
ignore the ignore the lines around it
we will get to this later but you know
of course we understand that this is a
finite space so we can always draw
things that random from here and we're
interested you know when n is large the
number of vertices perhaps the number of
faces perhaps the number of edges this
is all relatively immaterial right now
how does it look like here's a picture
of how it looks like at a large scale
and it's the credit for this picture and
what you're seeing here is what you get
when you rescale the you have you draw a
random triangulation on n vertices it
turns out this is absolutely not a
trivial statement that the typical graph
distance between two vertices is n to
the 1 quarter ok this is a interesting
fact and but much more much more
exciting is the fact that when you
rescale all the distances by n to the
minus one-fourth you have a random
metric space it converges in the usual
groom of hausdorff limit to this random
compact metric space that turns out to
be homeomorphic to the sphere and this
is you know a very very nice you know
heavy result by legao and miremont and
there's another way that you could take
a limit in this for random
triangulations you know instead of
scaling the distances don't scale the
distances and you know and you want to
get in your limit an infinite connected
graph right and this is this is the the
you know kind of the canonical way of
doing it the distribution a limit of
graphs which I will now define that it
was invented by a bin yamini and SRAM so
this is this is how it works you have a
sequence of finite graphs GN they could
be random but they don't necessarily
have to be random they could be fixed we
will see examples you choose this is an
important part you choose a random a
uniformly chose random vertex of this
graph and you look at the you look at
the ball in graph distance right here
around this typical around this uh
around this random vertex and you say
that the
the sequence of graphs GN converges to
now this is a random rooted graph so
it's a graph and it's an infinite graph
and the root if for every for every
radius R when you look at the when you
look at the balls of radius R in your in
your fine i graph they converge right
it's a assume the degree is bounded so
this is all finite spaces this converges
in distribution to the ball of radius R
in your limit okay this is the important
definition of this of this talk so let's
see a couple of examples just so we will
be in there in there and the right
mindset if your finite graphs are a line
just uh you know a path of length n or
perhaps a circle of length n then no
problems obviously you choose a you
choose a random point it's going to be
somewhere in the middle r is you know
are you think about our is fixed and
tending to infinity so of course what
you're going to see around you is just a
path of length are so it converges to
just the the infinite line if you start
now here's an example where your random
where GN is a random graph you start
with the erudition many random graph the
complete graph on n vertices and then
you you you erase each edge with
probability 1 minus c over and and
retain it with probability c / n it's a
random graph and you can think about it
a little bit and you know in the truth
is this is converges to a galten Watson
tree right because when you when you
start exploring your neighborhood of
length of radius R right from a typical
point in your in your area any graph
you're not going to see any circle so
it's definitely going to be a tree right
ah and it's going to be a puss on tree
with uh with mean see you can here's
another illustrative example take a
binary tree of level n of height end and
it converges well you would think that
it converges to the infinite binary tree
as you would but this
not true and the reason that this is not
true is that we're choosing a vertex at
random and a vertex at random is very
likely to be a leaf or a level close to
the leaf you know level minus one minus
two you can figure this out and you get
what's called the canopy tree and this
is a picture of it we do this as you can
see right here this is not the binary
tree right it has for instance it has
just one line infinite line going to
infinity not more than that all right
any questions about the the definition
of a distribution or limit alright so
the first thing that we want to do since
we're talking about random apps is you
know we choose one at random the average
degrees is constant you know at most six
does it have a distribution the limit
and the answer turns out to be yes and
this is a very famous paper by Angela
and Shawn in the case of triangulation
and by cocoon in the case of
quadrangular shun this limit exists okay
and it gives you an infinite
triangulation or quad regulation of the
plane okay so it's not degenerate like
there you could cook up some examples
where everything converges to a point
and the they called it this uniform
infinite planar triangulation or
quadrangular shun you I PT or you I PQ
so it's a random infinite triangulation
of the plane this is what we currently
know about this and these you know um
I'm not going to spend a lot of time on
this issue but this is just an issue 24
we expect you know so of course we could
choose triangulation quadrangular shin I
didn't mention pentakill ation or the
other whatever you call the one with six
edges you can continue but we expect
that all of these things behave roughly
the same we don't expect to see in the
limit you know these are these small
little you know
petty matters of like what what what the
size of faces you chose and this will
also be evident in this work which i
will show you right now here is a nice
picture by nicola korean of a
quadrangular shin and this is a picture
i like more because i remember it
emphasizes the point that we are our
graph is always rooted so we always have
a root you know you're always sitting on
the root and looking towards infinity so
uh this is why I like this picture and
this you know and this is a quadrangular
shin ah it has an interesting geometry
right this is a this is a this is a
graph we could study it no graph
distance it's a graph embedded in the
plane you can also study aspects of that
and it has a lot of similarities with z2
it is one ended that means that if you
remove any finite set you only have one
infinite component left so this was
proved by on Joe and SRAM the critical
percolation probability on it is a half
just like on on z2 so is proved by ax by
Angela it is level it's ok we want the
it means that it doesn't exhibit
non-trivial harmonic functions that are
bounded this is due to Binyah minion
kweon this happens also for z2 z3 and
and more but it is not z to this this
graph it has all sorts of like bizarre
behavior it has an unbounded degree for
instance this is a remainder this is a
fact it's not immediately clear but when
you draw a random triangulation on n
vertices your maximal degree is going to
be of order log in and you're going to
have you know degrees of all spectrum
between login and the constant and this
is actually a major difficulty also has
a completely different growth than Z to
the ball of radius R in the graph
distance grows like our to the fourth
state of r2 square and this was proved
by Angela for the triangulation case in
chasing
in shaffer for the quadrangular shin
case and it's a it's a fractal it's it's
not a nice graph it's it's it's quite
crazy so it's it's the for instance the
random walk behaves much slower on it
it's strictly sub diffusive and that's
because it has all these like giant
dangling ends which don't connect to
infinity like a cactus right then the
random walk instead of like going in
this you know straight line towards
infinity being very efficient waste all
is time on the branches of the cactus
and this is you know a behavior that we
see in many examples of especially a
random nature but also of a
deterministic nature like you know
sierpinski gasket I didn't tell you in
all of this whether it's recurrent
whether the random walk is recurrent or
transient on this graph and and the
conjecture which by benjamini interim
and also Angelyn shrub is that this
graph is recurrent I could I don't
really want I don't really know have a
feeling why they conjecture they flake
you can cook up example that all of
these things hold and it's transient
perhaps Omer would be a better candidate
to ask it but okay but they did get very
close in the sense that if we had if
this graph had bounded degrees you
wouldn't be able to solve this this
problem and here's a theorem of Binyamin
ian shrum in the same paper where they
define the concept of a distribution a
limit of graphs and they and they have
the following statement when you have a
distribution a limit of finite graphs
with the two extra assumptions one is
bounded degree and second is planarity
very very important of course then the
resulting graph the the limit right is
almost surely recurrent remember these
graphs could be can be deterministic but
the limit since the limit you know you
always choosing in your finite graphs
you're choosing a random root then the
limit is a random graph it doesn't
necesito so hence you know the almost
surely should be there even
if even if we're choosing the terminus
de Graaff I will try to show you a
sketch of this proof later so an example
is Z Z to that we saw that we got the
the canopy tree but that we that we also
saw and you really do need there is no
hope of proving that the UI PT is
recurrent using this theorem or because
because this theorem really does require
that the bounded degree condition
because ok I here's a graph similar to
the canopy tree it has waits on it but
you can always you know mimic the
effects of the so the the random walk is
going to walk according to the white
when it's a here it's going to walk with
the with probability what two-thirds
upwards and one-third downwards this
graph is is transient sorry yes time I
got yes yes there's another one yes
thank you this graph you can convince
yourself as transient and I'm also it's
a weighted graph we didn't talk about
weights at all I agree but I'm you can
always mimic these weights by having
multiple edges this is easy thing and
you can convince yourself that like
we're taking a binary tree with you know
with these multiple edges you can get
this as a distribution of limit so
indeed the theorem does require the fact
that you have bounded degrees so here's
our main result instead of bounded
degrees require that the root has an
exponential tail which means that the
probability that the sorry that the
degree of the root right the vertex
degree of the root the probability that
is bigger than K decays exponentially in
K so we have that assumption replacing
the bounded degree plus planarity gives
you almost sure recurrence and it's good
because we do know these facts the
exponential ah the exponential tale of
the degree of the root for the UI PT /
you I PQ this is a result of Angela and
SRAM in being a meany in Korean
and we really do need this and a comment
that I won't explain much about we
really do need the exponential tale
anything any tale that is a little
fatter we have in an example for that
that that is transient any questions
about the the result I would more
slightly right how much slightly fatter
up anyway any-any if it decays like e to
the minus K to the Alpha for any Alpha
smaller than one then then then there is
an example we could push it more to
anything you know but it's a it's a it's
a necessary thing so if there's no
question let me let me try to tell you a
few words about the proof in the little
time I have the proof is ax we like it
that's cute because it has circle
packing in it so let me tell you what
give you a brief brief introduction into
a circle packing is a very interesting
theory and it's very elementary and it's
like easy to get into so i highly
recommend it it's a there's a really
nice paper by stefan or the charm from
circle packing to SLE that is very nice
and here is the the basic concept you
have a finite simple planar graph here's
a I'm giving you an embedding in the
plane here it is right here but we're
looking for a canonical way of embedding
it what does it mean canonical I'm
actually not that sure what is another
way that people describe it this way
this way to represent the graph it's
conformally natural I read it in your
paper stuff and I'm still trying to
figure out you know this but you know we
have we have I can convince you you know
perhaps that these are correct terms to
use but let's let's not get into the
there's a lot of connections to
conformal maps but you know I want to
keep this you know very simple but the
main theorem that we use is this k bear
and
thurston theorem Kaiba discovered it in
36 it was kind of forgotten and Thurston
realized rediscovered it and then found
out that it was a you know found that
there was a corollary of theorem by and
rave on polyhedrus and it says that any
finite simple planar graph can be
represented as a tangency graph of a
circle packing dawn on the right so a
circle packing is just a bunch of
circles in the plane with disjoint
interiors some of them may be tangent
some of them are not and we're just
growing them in the plane and if two of
them are a tangent we put an edge
between them this is this is the
tangency graph and obviously if you have
a bunch of circles satisfying this and
you draw this tangency graph it's going
to be planar that's there's that's easy
to see but the the strength of this
theorem is the fact that the converse
holds any any simple planar graph can be
you can find a packing of circles in the
plane that realizes it and in fact when
your finite graph is a triangulation
then this drawing is unique up to you
know trivialities and maybe use
transformation that mean that keeps the
keep circle sense circles the circle for
nothing really changes all right this is
the this is the theorem ah what does it
have to do with probability right this
is a this isn't this is a geometric
theorem it's nice you know ah but it
does it does have like a lot to do with
probability and this is you know the why
it's very fascinating and we're just
trying starting to discover all sorts of
things that oh did SRAM knew of course
many years ago but okay so here's a
here's a very nice theorem of a hand
Sean so completely there's no randomness
in the underlying graph so if you have
so the this theorem states that if you
have an infinite circle packing in the
plane right such that it covers
everything of course you can imagine
circle packing that don't cover
everything in their infinite right you
can you know you have you know this is
the disk can you put a circle here in a
little circle here and like more and
more and more and they converge to like
like little points here
they become smaller and smaller and
don't cover the entire plane and the
theorem a tantrum tells you ah that when
it covers the entire plane it is
recurrent i will show you a proof of
this and in fact sorry ah so there's
going to be an annoying question yeah so
it means if you look at the union of all
the circles and all the space between
them right the inter STIs sorry well
just face all the bounded space between
them then it covers everything ok so
here an accumulation point I mean you
know exactly something so you don't have
like you know a sequence of circles
converging to a point that does not
happen and when this happens your graph
is record and in fact they also have the
the converse when you're in a situation
like this when the graph is packed in a
bounded area it is transient so you have
a dichotomy ah this is very nice also
bounded degree here is necessary ah
because here's the here's the circle
packing of the usual triangular lattice
and now i'm going to change it i'm going
to turn it into i'm going to rule I you
know I will I will not have bounded
degree here I want to create a drift to
the right right so I'm going to add a
bunch of little circles I hope that you
can see them here in here so whenever
you're in a big circle just because
you're performing a simple random walk
you have way more chances of going to
the right and when you're here here I
put way more like twice as much circles
then I put here so you still have more
chances of going to the right so here
you have once you like you you your
random Walker travels around here once
he gets to hear he sucked into infinity
so you do need this bounded degree
situation and let's see how you would
prove the mini mini Tramp theorem let me
remind you what it is any distribution
the limit of planar bounded degree graph
is almost surely recurrent let's go over
the mini mini shown strategy so GN is
our finite plane of wraps
we apply keveth's theorem and find a
circle packing whatever circle packing
that we want it doesn't it doesn't
really matter we are going to normalize
it by choosing a random a random circle
this will also be a random root right so
we chose a random circle ah and we can
always you know we have a picture we can
always shrink it nothing changes really
you know and and move it around same
grab so we're just going for it to
normalize will put the route to be the
unit circle at the origin and we're
taking a limit of this thing right we
have a sequence of graphs we chose a
random road we do it in the plane we
took a limit and now so what we need to
prove here of course is what we get is
something that covers the entire plane
right and then we can appeal to the
hands from theorem and this is this is
you know absolutely not trivial to show
there is a lemma there it's it's short
but it's fascinating it's really
interesting and the lemma is you know
it's not that it covers the entire plane
there are situations that you can have
an accumulation point but it's only
going to be one it's going to be an
isolated accumulation point so of course
I'm not applying immediately hand Trump
but one accumulation point in fact that
any isolated set of accumulation point
is easy is easy to handle by inversions
I won't go into this but by it's easy so
we apply the hems from theorem or
perhaps a slightly stronger version of
it which allows some accumulation point
and we get that the graph is recurrent
we use the bounty degree assumption
because we use the hand Trump theorem
here's a nice picture by maxime cocoon
of how a random triangulation may look
like
okay so in order to prove that the UI PT
is recurrent we needed to new
ingredients in to add to the strategy
one is a quantitative result of the
henge from theorem the henge from
theorem tells you a graph is recurrent
we're going to study the effective
resistance between the origin and you
know balls of radius R in your circle
packing and see how know the fact that
it's recurrent tells you that this
effective resistance the electrical
resistance goes to infinity we'll see
how fast it does oh I already told you
it grows logarithmically in the radius
of your packing right you look at the
effective resistance between well go
through that and the second the second
ingredient is to is to take these like
these you I PT large degrees right they
are you know we think about them as
stars and we're going to replace them
with a tree that has little have degree
3 and will come embed it and and we'll
need to study how this changes the
effective resistance will use the
quantitative version of the hands from I
won't be able to show you the entire
thing but I hopefully I'm hoping to
convince you ah I'm not sure about that
but hoping to convince you that it's
correct and that you can easily read
this our paper is short it's elementary
so i guess i'm considering this talk as
a sales pitch alright so let's tackle
the first the first ingredient we have a
circle packing of a bounded degree
triangulation before i tell you how to
prove our that the effective resistance
grows logarithmically in the in the
radius let me tell you about this
important ingredient called important
dilemma called the ring lemma by Rodin
and Sullivan and it tells you that if
you have a circle here in the middle
which is completely surrounded by other
circle as you can see as you can see
here then the ratio of the radii is
bounded between event of any two circles
the you know the inside one in one of
its neighbors is uh is bounded
from above and below in a number that
depends only on the bound you have on
the degree okay so this uh this is a
very you know that's know once you think
about it it's it's relatively easy let's
say you have you know circle here and a
giant circle here you'll need to you
will need to take you know you'll need
to put a lot of little circles here if
this one was in the middle you need to
put a lot of circles here in order to
make it completely surrounded and this
is the basic idea I guess perhaps you
could put another large one here but
then you will have a problem I realize I
can see by russ's smile that I'm giving
you a very shady proof of this fact and
okay about for the same sizes data
center uh well um not if you make this
as you know big as you want you want to
come do it the left circle would be very
very very smart and the one adjacent we
would also be very smart when I think
somebody who I call so you believe all
the others or less the same size as a
simple one you have a small circle than
a one of the two either pre-title left
is also smaller at least one officials
let's let me know this circus at this
view is not smile i guess i could
neither the sticker that is one meeting
with a radius so nobody has various one
the central one has various on that one
has where somebody who had all the
others have ideas about what I can't
have that I to going yeah I'm not gonna
try to drive
so time is up first Jessica and then
time to talk to me well just a couple no
no this is not as bad as a wreck you
found your government but then you can
get lots of circles around the Big Sur
yeah so okay right yeah here here you
would have to have a lot so yeah I guess
I guess I guess I was wrong actually as
I wrong the ratio of the raid tangent
rate yeah what imagine hydrophobic
organizer so I want ya to the episode
yeah there is a result what's written
here is my record but I made it my deck
sound as if like just this picture but
you think about this pic we know you
have an infinite triangulation you want
or everything is everything is
surrounded right this this is not a
triangulation because the outer because
the outer face has more than three edges
in it if you if you want okay let's
let's move on from this point so here's
the here's the lemma that I want to
prove to you the effective resistance if
you have a triangulation a bounded
degree the effective resistance across
an annulus a fixed proportion is at
least a constant here is a picture right
so I'm simply looking at the effect of
the electrical resistance between all
the points here in the middle and all
the points here outside and just like
you have in Z to the effective
resistance here is at least a constant
and also at most a constant why is that
here is a proof the effective resistance
is in a visa is a minimizing problem
right you look at all the functions ah
that are 0 on one side and one on the
other side like so functions that are
going to be 0 here and one here ah you
compute their energy my energy is just
the sum over all the edges of the
difference square of the function and
you take and you take the infimum of
that that gives you the inverse of the
effective resistance right so to show
this lemma I need to
exhibit a function that has ah that has
a finite energy right for any for any
circle packing and this is just going to
be a very simple simple function it's
just going to interpolate between 0 &amp;amp; 1
and so on the circle packing so if this
is a if this is your an you lie right
and you have a point here the function
is simply going to the is going to give
the value of this point simply going to
give it the distance from the smaller
from the smaller circle and this is this
is a Lipschitz function and let's let's
look at the contribution to an edge of a
to the energy right we're looking at FX
minus FY square right so if this was an
edge right here right then FX minus FY
is simply you know is that most the
distance between the two points right
this is this is just a triangle
inequality but now we're coming to the
useful fact that we have a circle
packing this is the the you know right
the distance square right here are the
two circles can you see this yeah the
distance square you know because of the
Ring lemma everything all of the radio
here are comparable the distance square
is simply the area of these of this
circle right you have bound the degree
you sum over all the edges so what I'm
going to get is approximately a constant
of the area of the entire of the entire
annulus right and that is our square we
also had you know this is normalized so
the function is 0 here and one here
right so we get exactly the area is 1
over R we we divide by 1 over R square
and this little computation here gives
you gives you the result any questions
about this it's very very simple and now
of course to get the sum is bounded the
energy is bounded so the effective
resistance is at least a constant and
what do we get of course that we have
when we have an infinite triangulation
and now of course we can you know put
more and more and you like growing die
ethically and we get and each one we
have effective resistance at least a
constant we're using again the ring
limit to say that there are no large
edges between far away and you lie and
we just add the whole thing up and we
get that it grows logarithmically in
particular its recurrent so this gives
you also a simple proof if you want w
hand trauma theorem alright so in the
last five minutes I'm going to try to
convince you that this already gives you
enough information ought to to be able
to control the resistances once you
replace the degrees in your random
planar map from when you replace the
large degrees which is a star you
replace them by a tree so this is what
we do this really you know you know a
fix for this problem we do it in two
steps just to be consistent first we put
you know on every edge we put a point a
vertex in the middle that has degree 2
right here and then all the the vertices
marked in black here we are going they
look like a star and after the first
step and we're going to replace it by a
balanced well as balanced as we can
binary tree right in such a way that we
maintain planarity right we oh we can
always think about it already embedded
in the plane instead of this vertex we
put a tree and we we connect it to the
previous neighbors that were here before
so we've transformed the graph let's
call it G Star and you know it's
important that this graph has degree at
most three as you can see by the the
picture so of course we are here where
you know ready to you know and you know
another important fact that you can like
easily convince yourself that if you
perform this transformation on the
distribution the limit on the UI PT
right you could also perform it on the
finite graphs and you get the same and
you get the same limit so there's a
continuity issue that is a relatively
technical so we know that
this graph is recurrent this g-star but
we know more than that we know a
quantitative version of how recurrent it
is in a given circle packing so we we
also need to we have that and we need to
you know related relate the effective
resistance back to the old graph and
this is this is the the key lemma and it
is the fact that the effective
resistance every time we change so of
course you know if you look at the
effective resistance say if this was
your entire graph the effective
resistance between these two vertices is
too and now it's it has it is more than
two you know so the effective resistance
in in the new graph is bigger right as
you would expect and if you know it's uh
you know it's recurring right so there
is we are losing something here but we
want to quantitate we want a
quantitative estimate of how much we're
losing in the fact that every time we do
such a thing we're losing a factor of
the degree to the effective resistance
here's a what is exactly here's a
precise statement if we put smaller edge
resistances on our new graph and by how
small we put on this edge we will put
resistance which is one over 71 over the
degree of the original vertex right ah
then so now we decrease the degrees that
we decrease the resistance of of g-star
but we're claiming that the resistant in
this new in this new thing the
resistance between you know big circles
between the origin say in big circles
remain the same okay so here this is a
statement that i'm not going to prove to
you its a calculation with with
resistances in this in this
transformation it's a relatively
straightforward so what we need the last
the last thing that we need is that in
this UI PT or any distribution the limit
the the degree grows practically
logarithmically what is that what do I
mean by that right because we have we
take our this g star of ours right we
pack it in the we pack it in the plane
right and we want to say or and we want
to
so this has bounded degrees so I let me
rephrase we look at our say you I PT we
pack it in the plane and we want to say
that the so we already know right that
the degrees you know of the in the graph
distance right you look at the ball of
radius R in the UI PT in the graph
distance the degree there is at most
logarithmic but we need a different
statement we need a statement that says
that once you pack it in the plane and
you look at a ball of radius R the
degree there is also at most logarithmic
it's not the same metric now we have two
vertices and we're looking at the
Euclidean distance between them in the
packing versus you know the the metric
of the graph distance all right so this
is a so my whole point of this was to
say that if you know that say you know
in a ball of radius R the degrees at
most logarithmic by the previous by when
you do this when you do this
transformation g-star right we on g star
we know by the quantitative version of
hand SRAM the degrees grow
logarithmically if you believe that I've
only lost a factor of the degree then
the new resistance in G between say the
ball at the center and the and the rate
and the circle of radius R the outside
of it is at most log are right sorry so
it's by the quantitative hand SRAM you
have here this log R and you divide by
the maximal degree right so the
resistance is at least a constant of
course we need to prove that this is the
resistance is a goes to infinity but the
point is that the resistance is at least
a constant not only when you look at the
vertex at the center but from any finite
set the same the same calculation works
and it's easy to see that if for any
finite set the resistance to infinity is
at least a constant that means the
resistance that the graph is recurring
the resistance is actually infinity with
this is this is easy
