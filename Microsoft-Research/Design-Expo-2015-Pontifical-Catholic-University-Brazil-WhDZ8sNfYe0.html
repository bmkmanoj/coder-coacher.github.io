you
hello hello welcome welcome to design
Expo 2015 in case you're wondering about
the slide show that was going as you
guys were arriving this was an inclusive
visual identity that we came up with it
was a joint effort here Microsoft and
outside we created the main symbol that
you can see in color and we ask other
people to reinterpret that symbol which
is a capital letter D in a way that it
represents inclusive design so that's
what you were looking at and this event
is public open to the public so feel
free to tweet and if you tweet use the
hashtag d expo 15 which is our hashtag
for this event how was the first one to
use it so please fill it up so starting
with out just a bit of feedback about
background about this they're doing so
much feedback I'm little it's kind of
getting out of that mode background
about design Expo it's about identifying
some key challenges that the world is
facing and giving them out to top design
schools around the world and see how
they interpret the problem and we
another goal is to enhance long-term
relationships across the schools and
with between Microsoft in the schools we
had a couple success stories from the
past when a couple of schools met in
here design expo a Brazilian school and
a school from the Netherlands and they
started an exchange program we also had
one of our design Expo alums go found a
company to happen to be four square so
she passed through this room just like
you guys so we like to foster this
community between with Microsoft and
also across the schools and this is the
12 theater we're doing design Expo so
we've been doing this for a while so the
process we start at the end of the year
we start by selecting the topic and then
we select a set of schools and it's
usually a schools worldwide and we
rotate through the schools and then we
assign Microsoft liaisons which are
people who travel to the schools to meet
with them and and give them feedback
throughout the process and each school
starts a semester-long course on the
project and then the liaison goes back
to the school to select the final
project that is here so you guys if
you're here is because you're a winner
so be happy for yourselves and you made
it and we're super happy to see what you
have and today's the day they present
and they present for eight minutes and
then get feedback from the amazing
critics here the design challenge this
year is inclusive design and in 2014 the
World Health Organization has radically
revised their definition of disability
they're defining it as a
context-dependent condition versus an
attribute of the person so in this way
of looking at disability makes us
realize that we all go through
disabilities throughout our days and
throughout our lives from being in the
sun and not being able to see my screen
to being somewhere that's really noisy
and I'll being able to hear or when I'm
driving I am cognitively disabled and
visually impaired when I'm doing that
task so we ask the students to look at a
spectrum from permanent disability to
temporary to situational an example of
permanent would be somebody who
amputated their arm to a temporary case
which is a new parent who has to do
everything one-handed because they're
holding a baby on the other end the
other hand to I blinked ah sure yeah
just to situation when you have like a
broken arm for instance or when you're
carrying groceries outside the store so
this just to say that it happens it
happens to order days and throughout our
lives and we we think that by designing
for the one-percent we end up benefiting
everybody so just think is a good design
process
these are our participating schools we
have pontifical catholic university from
rio brazil university of applied
sciences Potsdam Germany Carnegie Mellon
University from the US Korea advanced
Institute of Science and Technology case
from Korea both kiest and put Korea are
there it's our first year during design
Expo we have delft university of
technology from the Netherlands NYU
Shanghai program Art Center College of
Design and our neighbors University of
Washington we have amazing critics
sitting right here in front of you and I
will go ahead and introduce them I hope

and thank you to the liaisons and thank
you too lunati Danny for coming up with
the visual identity and the whole visual
identity team thank you we're ready to
start with our first team rio de janeiro
pontifical catholic university with mesh
reliving memories emotions and
impressions hello first of all is a huge
pleasure to be here today we are from
poky he'll the cattle university of rio
janeiro in brazil and my name is
Patricia and these are my team
colleagues it is Jessica and her file we
are here today to present our project
which is focused on the visually
impaired so there are about 285 million
people visually impaired worldwide and
according to the world health
organization there are about it sorry
there are four levels of visual equity
that goes from normal vision to
blindness we decided first to focus on
the the tree less levels are chewing
trivial so our first conclusions were
that sorry first you ask who are they
what do they like to do we challenge
they face and our first conclusions were
there are some subjects that came up
like they talk about the feelings about
where do they like to travel to how they
interact with people
and there was this particular subject
that was memory we thought with aleni
this is alina she's a girl serially with
severe severe visual impairment and she
has the habit of keeping a journal
actually she blogs so she likes to share
her experiences and feelings on online
and talk to share with people and then
we started talking about memory also
with the other interviewers and they
talked about storytelling and relating
memories to events and places so realize
this strong connection between people
and the recalling of past experiences
among these statements we found three
three three of them three quotes that
were interesting for us to work with so
like most of tools of the tools designed
to keep memory rely on vision my memory
is like a photo album to me the effort
our means nothing to me the most
important is what I've done that so
those week those three phrases and
shoulders that memories are related to
places and events and as for fullest
fully sighted people and they are they
really relies on visual aspects such as
photography and video and how about the
village visual impaired they don't have
this they don't have been they don't
rely to visual aspects but they owe this
to have the connections between places
events in their moments that's the point
there is so much more to memory that
only visual aspects so so what about you
guys what do you remember what is memory
to you we have a lot of
ways of keeping memory on a daily basis
well for instance when you check-in or a
favorite restaurant or when you go out
with someone special in your target and
on social media the bottom line is
remembering is our way of trashing our
past and that's why we created mash the
memory sharing match the system that
allows users to capture relief and share
memories through and wearable device
using an online platform with mash you
can capture in relief sensations and you
can share and discover memories to and
from others but how do you capture a
memory well every interaction done with
mesh service is done by this little
device here and for you to capture a
memory you just need to tap in the
bottom of the device and for doing that
all the objective information will be
recorded by the microphone here the
temperature of your skin will be will be
recorded in the back of your ear and
their beer sensor near the users temples
that will record the heartbeat all the
representation of this memory will also
be done by this device in the same tree
part and for relieving the memory you
just need to search it using those three
as three characteristics the name of the
user that recorded this memory the place
that it was recorded and the date it was
recorded by instance I'll show just like
you just have to tap here and say
relieve my memory on maybe or 15
2000-2012 on rio de janeiro and if
you're not looking for any specific
memory and you want to search for for
something interesting you just have to
tap it here again and say relief
memories randomly and then walk around
looking for memories that will astonish
you but every memory by default is only
personal and private and you need to
share it for make it public for other
people and you can do that by two things
you can share directly to someone's mash
or you can use social networks such as
Facebook on Twitter you just need when
you
if we record a memory or just relieved
then you tap and say share on my
facebook and then tag your friends such
as back Mario Bonetti so you might be
wondering for whom mesh was designed for
by all means for everyone with different
visual a different levels of visual
acuity
you
Oh
my love i miss you a lot i wish you
could be here with me
t-minus 45 mornin Philip appreciating
the other HP and partly still a half-wit
common Marsha Chan provision
thais bad signal yes
is the best of them
thank you
thank you now off to the judges comments
want to start Rob um what a commendable
job guys I saw I'm cheating a little
because i saw the presentation on monday
and we had some concerns with the way it
was presented and you guys totally
addressed all of that and then some and
totally nailed the timing and you've
done a great job so congratulations on
on that component of this which is an
important component right the
storytelling of your your your your
method and process I'm really struck by
the power of the video to convey the
idea I think the simple voice user
interaction for a call based on place
and and voice key key phrases are is
probably a pretty good start at the UI
there's going to be some challenges
there with on that April twelfth day in
2012 there was quite a lot of activity
and it trying to sort of just
disseminate between different types of
activities could be quite challenging
but but I think that's a it's a
commendably simple user experience at
least in at this level and I think the
the form factor as well deserve some
some nice it's very discreet it actually
looks quite fashionable there's a kind
of nice wearable kind of aesthetic to it
and so I just wanted to congratulate you
guys on a job well done in communicating
the the power of your idea in a quite
challenging space so well done I really
agree with that feedback I I really like
the the result I love the way that you
ultimately post this to facebook and you
have a visualization of the experience
and that little kind of heartbeat please
I think the more that you guys expand on
that piece and that resulting product
the more you'll drive people to want to
engage in that behavior so that's that's
really really emotional and really
really like human and really great so I
think that will transcend nicely on in
social spaces I mean I'm not so sure
out you know kind of the hardware
components or the wearable components I
you know I think that you've done a
phenomenal job with it so far and i look
forward to seeing you guys progress on
the on the hardware piece so yeah
terrific well done i have worked on
something that goes around your ear it's
really hard getting things to fit
people's ears so I think that was nice I
mean very kind of simple and you thought
about that I thought it's a very
interesting space to think about you
know as you say most memory related
things tend to be visual um although
people have you know for centuries
written novels and journal was in but
you know it's an incredibly important
thing for people so I think that was a
very interesting space to focus on I'd
have liked to have seen a little more
prototyping happening I think to
understand both what you're capturing
and then and then the prototyping of
kind of playing it back and kind of
having some sort of showing that you
know this is how people felt about it
and this is how it worked and this is
what what a memory was made of I think
that would have been really come you
know an important part so I think for
another project that you know kind of
bringing that out would be really
important very nice thank you we're all
terrified of being over time
hey we have three minutes for questions
but you should you guys should switch
what I mean the next team should start
coming and then we'll we'll open for
questions yeah Phil I'll repeat the
question so the question is it just
needs to repeat the question for folks
in the video that you guys talked about
recording sound but ambient sound is
another great thing to be recorded have
you included actually yes we haven't we
decided to cut this from the
presentation because of terms of time
but we have two devices and each one of
them will have one microphone so we used
kind of binaro but a sound capturing
form for an environmental sound
recording and was in the process of the
project but we decided to cut off
because we're not the focus of the user
experience any more questions from the
audience yeah in the back two in the
back what's the length of the recording
what's a length the duration hi we
didn't really decide for a link but you
should have because you could yeah but
if you can can record forever because
you can forget to that the the device is
on and it's going to be recording
everything so yeah we have to decide on
the way thank
thank you each year microsoft research
