we've been looking at how to use color
plus depth cameras such as the Microsoft
Kinect for immersive communication let's
take a look at some of the benefits that
Kinect can provide for remote
collaboration around an electronic
whiteboard of course Kinect can offer
audio and visual communication and here
you see my remote collaborator Zen you
in a video window next to our shared
writing surface but Kinect can be used
for a lot more its depth information can
be used to remove the background around
Jing news head giving him some privacy
and it can also be used to frame him
automatically keeping him in frame
wherever he moves more importantly
Kinect can be used to provide a level of
immersion that has not been possible
before here we see what we call a two
and a half D visualization in which then
you can actually reach out of this his
video window to write on the shared
writing surface this is important
because I get to see where he is writing
where his focus of attention is where he
is about to write to understand why
that's important to me we're going to
play a little game so in this game you
see a set of 20 symbols they come in
pairs two red squares two blue squares
and so forth I'm going to erase one of
them and saying you have to erase the
corresponding one
now we're going to play the same game
again without the ability to reach out
of the window
here's a new has no idea which one I
actually hit so you can see it's
important to be able to tell our
partners intention of where he's about
to touch the Kinect can also be used to
provide a full 3d visualization for a
more immersive communication
here we see Zen you and the shared
writing surface in perspective this
makes it easy for us to look at each
other check for understanding as if we
were standing side by side in front of a
physical whiteboard because we're gonna
play some tic-tac-toe I'll go first
how would you different color Oh too
easy but for more serious brainstorming
for example we may have a lot more
writing to do we can always rectify the
screen so that we can record our points
right what we need to write and toggle
back and forth between that and the 3d
visualization our second 3d
visualization is called mirror mode in
this mode saying.you appears to be
writing in the mirror alongside me here
gaze proximity gesture direction are all
almost perfectly preserved the visual
quality is not so good because the
Kinect can only see half of his body but
we're working on improving the visual
quality by adding a second camera
so in conclusion color plus depth
cameras such as Microsoft Kinect enable
remote collaboration more immersively
we're able to see where our partner is
writing where as gazes gesture direction
and makes us feel like we're in the same
room together
