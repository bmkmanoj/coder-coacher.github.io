you
oh yeah thanks Matthew for inviting me
and it's great to be here this is my
second stop in a tour around England I
was in loughborough the past few days
and I'm heading over to Oxford the end
of the week so it's great to be here and
hopefully get a new perspective and some
new feedback on on some of these ideas
and I wanted to start out by
acknowledging that my funding sources
for most of this work which for the US
National Science Foundation and
Department of Energy and also i'll
mention a number of students former
students and collaborators throughout
who have helped out with various
components of the project so i think
this is a great venue to try to think
about how we can incorporate
microorganisms and the complex microbial
systems that occur in soils into our
global predictive models and our ability
to try to understand the coupling
between carbon cycle processes and and
climate processes but as i was just
discussing with matthew earlier these
types of new ways of looking at coupling
could apply to many other environmental
questions as well besides just climate
change so many of you may be familiar
with these important roles of
microorganisms but i just thought i
would emphasize that microbes really do
control the world at least by geo
chemically speaking so this is an image
from nasa showing ocean productivity
with greener areas showing higher levels
of productivity so oceanic
photosynthesis is mainly controlled by a
microorganism cyanobacteria in
particular they're also involved in
biological nitrogen fixation both in the
oceans and on land nitrogen-fixing
bacteria are symbiotic with plants other
aspect of nutrient cycling as well so
most aspects of soil fertility are under
the direct control of microorganisms and
carbon sequestration both in soils and
in the ocean is a phenomenon that's
heavily controlled by microorganisms and
the the lost pathways that they
determine out of soils are out of
sediments in the water column so
microbes are critical
and the specific component of the earth
system that I want to focus on today are
the role of microbes and soils and this
is because oil is a really fundamental
element of the global carbon cycle
storing greater than 2,000 pedda grams
which is about three times the amount in
the atmosphere as co2 and here's a peat
bog which kind of illustrates the
potential for this high carbon density
in soils is a peat bog actually from the
UK and to emphasize that soils are
vulnerable to climate change and
environmental change so this is just one
simulation picked out of the most recent
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change report and a simulation for what
climate would look like in in 2100 and
you see the change in temperature up to
7 8 9 degrees centigrade and some of
these higher latitude ecosystems 425
degrees in this kind of worst-case
scenario over much of the earth's land
surface so what's going to happen when
we start to intermix these high levels
of carbon stored in soil with these
large environmental changes that's kind
of the focus of my my research these
days so in terms of making predictions
there are tools that we have to make
predictions going forward into the
future or representing the world today
even and these are what we call earth
system models some of you may be working
with these models but basically what
they do is to couple together the
different components of the planet so
they have cloud dynamics atmospheric
dynamics those interact with the land
surface which includes vegetation and
soils and also with processes in the
ocean ocean circulation and energy
balance and so these models
mathematically put all these processes
together and put all these sub
components together and then can be run
forward to make predictions across the
coming centuries so if we do that and
this is another figure from the most
recent IPCC report we can predict how
much for instance carbon will be taken
up by the land surface or the ocean and
the blue line here is the ocean the
green area here is the land surface this
is kind of the average or the the range
from all the different earth system
models that are out there and
you can see that there is a huge range
in terms of carbon uptake from the land
surface that range varies qualitatively
from essentially no change in in soil
carbon or land carbon up to maybe 400
pedda grams of storage and on the land
surface vegetation and the ocean so this
is a large amount of uncertainty that's
about half of the amount of carbon
that's currently in the atmosphere and
we're not sure which end of this range
we're going to end up on and so there
are ways that we could potentially alter
these models and try to reduce that
uncertainty so the key questions I think
we need to address before even getting
into that uncertainty our first of all
how good are our current models and in
particular how good are they we're
looking at soil processes and second of
all if they aren't as good as we'd like
how can we actually improve them and
what new elements are what changes might
we make to them that might make them
better and furthermore then how can we
actually test that they are better when
we do that so when you're building a
model there are several essential steps
that you have to go through and kind of
the most academic and earliest phase of
the model is this development phase
where you're taking your conception of
how the world works and converting that
into mathematical terms so pools of
carbon in this case and the flows of
carbon between those pools that's the
idea of model development putting down
the processes on paper or in a computer
and then we need to actually go out and
make some measurements in order to
represent the coefficients that are
included in the equations that represent
our model so those can be from the field
from the lab or from remote sensing or
any kind of source of data that allows
us to measure those parameters and then
there's a process if we're going to look
at global predictions of scaling up so
to say how do these model structures and
parameters interact with the environment
to result in a larger scale prediction
of some some process or pool so for
example we might want to have soil
conditions so a moisture or
agitation types for an area up say Great
Britain or the entire world and then we
can use those pieces of information to
scale up this model from one particular
location to to a much broader geographic
locality and then we need to test how
good the models actually are so there's
a very important evaluation step where
we can either compare models to each
other or compare them back to data again
going back to these observations and see
how well the models perform and then
there can be feedbacks where we can say
well if they're not performing well then
we go back to the drawing board and
alter this development stage there can
also be interactions across these
different components so we may in the
course of our evaluation sharpen our
parameter values or change the way that
we scale up the the model so my talk
today is going to try to focus on these
four components and up there I'll show
the different components and where we
are in this in a set of processes and
it's not necessarily that I'm going to
go in in order but we'll go in the the
order that's most logical for the
presentation but we I will start with
the development phase and this is simply
to give you an idea of the basic
underlying structure of the models that
are currently out there and currently
being used so most of the models that
are included in the current IPCC report
have this structure actually all the
models boil down to a very simple
mathematical structure where we have
inputs from plant growth so net primary
production is NPP and these models have
soil carbon pool or multiple pools they
range between one and maybe ten of these
pools and then there are losses of soil
carbon that are represented as a
decomposition constant and some of that
material once it decays is released to
the atmosphere as co2 some of it
recycles back into these soil carbon
pools so to represent that
mathematically it's very simple
differential equation we have inputs
from primary production we have losses
due to this decomposition process and so
this is a first order linear equation
right it's a very simple way to
represent many processes including
radioactive decay or the loss of
material from from
oil pool and now this this k value is
kind of important here it's it's a
constant but actually if you look in
detail the models it's a function so
other environmental parameters
environmental conditions can affect that
that decay constant so it's a function
of temperature and moisture in all these
models in some of the models it's also a
function of nutrients and it could be a
function of any environmental parameter
you wanted but it have to be represented
by its effects on on soil carbon through
this this decay constant yeah this is
happy to explicitly back in my family
back from age is a slower back cause it
looks like a first glance I just sort of
take that off flako where you go some
coming out and going back into the
difference i'm a genius not quite as
simple as out there right so yes this
I've just represented this as one pool
and in fact you can you can take that
out and we've done that analysis and it
doesn't make a lot of difference but the
the actual models include often multiple
different pools of carbon that have
different decay constants that are
intrinsic to them so that that means
that you're diverting this material back
into a pool it has a different property
okay so now we're going to step to the
evaluation part and you know a funny
story here is that when I started this
work I kind of thought that we had this
all all settled that we understood what
the distribution of carbon was in soils
around the world the models were pretty
good and I really didn't see a need to
even do this step but my colleague jim r
anderson at UC Irvine said no no I don't
think anybody's ever actually tested
whether these models generate something
looks like the real world so I said okay
well that does some kind of important to
test and the first stage of doing that
is actually to see what the real world
looks like and this is the result of
that that first analysis this is Cathy
Todd Browns work she was my former PhD
student and work in collaboration with
Mack post at Oak Ridge National Lab and
jim r anderson at UCI and some other
folks as well so what Cathy did was to
assemble a global map of soil carbon
density so this is simply showing in
kilograms per square meter how much
carbon
is located in various areas of the world
and what you basically see her in terms
of patterns is that there's more carbon
hired carbon density stored in high
latitude systems like tundra and boreal
forests ranging through Alaska Canada
Scandinavia and Siberia and also in some
tropical regions in tropical rainforests
their relatively large amounts of soil
carbon as well and lower amounts tend to
be in desert ecosystems that have lower
rainfall so we have this nice map that
we could then use to compare to some of
the outputs from our predictive models
so this is just reformulating those
observations in a new way so we can
compare them to some of the earth system
model outputs here's soil carbon in
terms of pedigrees so our analysis
showed that the observations tell us
there's about 12 to 13 hundred pedda
grams of carbon in soils globally and
this data set doesn't actually have any
formal uncertainty estimates on it so we
did a kind of ad hoc approach to come up
with a qualitative estimate of
uncertainty range and that came out to
be between around nine hundred and
seventeen hundred pedda grams of carbon
so we allowed for some uncertainty there
and the different colors here show the
different biomes of the world so
tropical rainforest up here in the red
croplands grasslands and boreal forests
and tundra are in the green colors of
the high latitude ecosystems so then we
could compare the distribution of carbon
around the world as well with the
observations in the models so here are
the the results for the models these are
about a dozen different Earth system
models that have been included in the
the IPCC reports and you can see there's
a range here so some of the lowest
carbon models have only about 500 pedda
grams globally whereas the highest
models have nearly 3,000 there are some
models that fall within our
observational range that's that's
promising there is actually some
agreement with some of the models and
the data but we also can look at the the
distribution by biome some of these
models like this model from Princeton
here are putting the majority of the
world's carbon in these high latitude
systems others like this mock splunk
model have actually relatively low
proportion of carbon it's stored in
those systems so the models differ in
their distribution of carbon around the
world too and we'll see that in more
detail in a second so to make some of
these comparisons we can do it by biome
but we can also look at the individual
grid points or the individual locations
around the entire planet here's the
observations again just as a reminder
and here is I'm going to show you
outputs from four of these selected
models and up here is the correlation
coefficient between individual points on
the model map and the observational map
so ideally we'd like that number to be
one in this case for one of the US
models coming out of Boulder Colorado
the correlation is point 18 so not very
good this map also shows that you know
the blue color here is representing the
overall tendency of this model to
underestimate soil carbon globally it
does have some reasonable features there
hi relatively higher stocks of carbon in
some of the tropical rainforests and a
few of the higher latitude areas but
again point for point the correlation is
not very good this is actually one of
one of your models the Hadley centers
model and it actually has one of the
higher correlation coefficients around
point three and so you know if we square
that to get a rough r squared R estimate
of variance in global soil carbon that
comes out to be around ten percent maybe
some of these models get up to fifteen
percent of the variance explained and
that in this case is because it is again
representing some of the features of
that global distribution with more
carbon and higher latitudes and some
more in the tropics but then it kind of
gets worse for some of these other
models this is that mocks plunk model
again with a very low correlation to the
data set and you can see that there are
some features in this model that are
kind of fundamentally questionable as
you if you're a soil ecologist weird if
you're just out there observing the
world with your eyes right there are
massive amounts of carbon stored in the
western United States which is a very
arid region in fact this model has most
of its car
stored in temperate latitudes and very
little in higher latitudes and in
tropical systems yes this is it
Tuesday's represent tons of measurements
or um it represents a lot of
measurements but the coverage is spotty
and it varies by continent and so that's
why we we wanted to include some
uncertainty in those data and in
particular in the high latitudes this is
this data sets in under estimate we
actually use the second data set for
comparison as well to the models but the
models actually don't compare to the
other data and the high latitudes any
better than this one although we do
think it is yes hmmm it's an
interpolated data set if you want to
think about it that way yeah where they
fit it too um they're usually fitted to
laboratory experiments so conditions or
something something like that yeah not
exactly that but something like that
yeah letting already worse or once wells
in Mosul um these white spots are areas
where there are zeros essentially so
it's actually no no carbon there that
this this representation has it has a
zero there but I don't know why those
are not filled in it maybe they didn't
interpolate through those those arid
regions there may have been some cut off
to say if there wasn't some measurement
in this area but on this map pretty much
all the white spots are are going to be
very low carbon or pretty much zero yes
other studies that made on the ground
observation sir yeah so it is this is
based on on the ground observations
where people go out and they dig a hole
in the ground and take a sample and
measure the bulk density of the soil and
the concentration of carbon in the soil
and then then there's
this extrapolation process right so the
soil scientists who make those
measurements only do it you know they
probably did it thousands of
measurements in the in the united states
at pretty good geographic coverage but
maybe you know only ten measurements of
here in siberia and then there's some
kind of extrapolation approach which is
based on soil type so there's somebody
who has a soil type map which is based
on previous soil scientists measurements
and they say well you know we got this
average for this soil type so we're
going to apply that average across that
entire soil type the uncertainty also
will vary from place to place yes global
answer that's right mm-hmm so that's for
this very approximate qualitative
uncertainty metric different versions of
global soil maps of the last 10-15 years
but they all those different maps trace
back to the same underlying data sets
and none of them have ever been really
rigorously analyzed for their
uncertainty that's something we'd like
to do that that would be a whole other
publication it would be to go back to
those data you know mess around with how
you do that extrapolation and try to put
the uncertainty values on different
regions and on particular measurements
and scale that up that's something that
really needs to be done because we can
criticize these models and put up these
correlation coefficients but you know
could you ever expect to get to one
point oh no because you're never you
know you're you're aiming at a moving
target because the data you know the
data may be wrong in a sense generally
we assume that the models are more wrong
than the data but there are also issues
with the data lots of thing qualitative
pattern globally has remained see there
might be surprises if you start
recognizing to the days of carbon you
start adding tongue I you know carbon
locked up in ice probably quantify that
right yeah so that's yeah that's another
issue and so I could spend all day up
here telling you about all the reasons
why the models are not so good but that
won't know won't let me get to the part
about my contribution to these models
but then I think we can improve so but
yeah it's a whole can of worms once you
once you start looking at the structure
of these models
and it is comforting though that there
are groups of people who recognize this
now and are working on all those
different components but yet we
shouldn't be surprised that we don't see
a very good correlation so here this is
just a final example model this is the
Princeton model it's got more carbon in
the high latitudes but it's it's too
much and Tibet's probably got too much
carbon here too so overall this is just
to make the point that you know these
are models developed by independent
researchers in most cases and they make
very different predictions they have
very different depictions of how global
soil carbon looks and you know they also
all fail in some some respect to
represent the data as we know it so
nonetheless we knew these these models
have issues but we wanted to do an
analysis of what their actual
predictions were for the 21st century
right so the way I showed you is how
well do the models represent the world
as we know it today but policymakers
want to know what's the world going to
look like in 2100 you know what are the
feedbacks going to be between soil
carbon the land surface and the
atmosphere so we did an analysis where
we use the same basic models and
calculated the change in soil carbon
between today and 2100 see whether soils
of the world we're going to be storing
carbon or losing carbon as we go forward
under climate change and increases in
atmospheric co2 those are the main
environmental differences that affect
these biogeochemical models so the
results of that analysis are shown here
this is the change in soil carbon and
pedigrees for those dozen or so
different models so as you can see there
are a number of models that actually
don't show much change in soil carbon
that's kind of the mote the modal result
is that there is no change a few of the
models show losses in soil carbon which
if you ask me as a biochemist that's
what I would have expected to see with
with massive climate change throughout
the 21st century you warm up the soil
metabolic processes go faster you burn
off carbon but then there are these
models that show massive gains in soil
carbon up to 250 pedda grams which is
you know a tenth of the world's current
soil carbon these models are
particularly is going to Hakeem
late further throughout the 21st century
so overall if you look at kind of an
overall average there's not much
evidence for massive losses there are
some minor losses in some models and
also some pretty big gains and others
and no change in most of the models so
what's underlying that pattern well as I
showed you the model structure before
there are it's a first-order linear
model so we have inputs coming in and we
have first-order losses so we can look
at what's coming in from these models
and what's coming in is a lot more
carbon from plant growth so plants in
the 21st century in these models are
responding very strongly to increases in
atmospheric co2 so we're fertilizing the
heck out of the biosphere by adding a
lot of co2 and that results in some of
these models like the Hadley Center
model in greater than fifty percent
increases in plant productivity and so
the models that have these really big
increases are also the ones that show
some of the highest gains in soil carbon
so you shove more carbon into the soil
more will stay in the soil in these
models now this is the component that I
would have expected this is the change
in turn over time so basically how fast
is the carbon turning over in the soil
more negative numbers mean that it's
turning over relatively faster so the
models that have the highest declines in
turnover rate like this Japanese model
also the ones that show greater losses
so essentially this is the the net
result of these two factors here and in
many cases these two factors basically
balance each other out that's why we
don't see a change and when they're out
of balance that's what we do see a
change so this is due to primarily
warming up of the soil profile making
making that K value a little bit bigger
making things turn over faster so what
we concluded from this is that the soil
the soil models could certainly be
better in these earth system models I'm
not matching our current data very well
and they're in some cases not even
matching the total amount of carbon that
we estimate to be in the world and
furthermore they make very divergent
qualitatively different predictions of
the future
so some are gaining carbon some are
losing carbon some are showing no change
so that makes it hard to to make policy
if you don't even know whether you're
going to gain or lose carbon to say it
was a concluding that as these models
don't much so I don't make realistic
predictions about productivity as well
now would also be correct yes i glossed
over that so interestingly when earth
system models are calibrated to to
simulate productivity they are based on
what are called face studies free air
co2 enrichment studies that are field
studies where you spray a bunch of
carbon dioxide onto a forest or
grassland or something and the more the
more carbon you spray on the more plant
productivity there is in general but
these studies have all stopped at about
five hundred fifty parts per million
which is a little less than doubling
current levels of co2 these are coupled
model simulations many in many cases are
running up to about 900 parts per
million so they are running into a range
of co2 concentrations that hasn't been
seen for you know millions and millions
of years and we have not even simulated
in our field experiments and so that's
where I think as a biologist that those
models are outside the range of where
they can actually make that prediction
and that's why I don't think that the
biosphere is going to you know increase
in productivity two-thirds by 2100 it
just doesn't seem likely for all the
other constraints that could affect
plant growth and finally all of the
current models have similar first order
underlying structure so they're
essentially non-independent in that way
if you think about different ways of
conceiving of the world they may have
different numbers of pools or slightly
different parameters but the underlying
structure is actually all all the same
that soil decays itself spontaneously
according to a relationship that matches
radioactive decay so this kind of
motivates are some of our efforts to
make changes to these models and there
are some changes you can make to the
existing models that will probably make
them closer to the data so you could
change the way they represent net
primary production make the co 2
responses more reasonable you could
change
temperature the way the model simulate
temperature so other other changes in
these couple models could feed back to
influence so a carbon and make that
prediction line up with the data better
we can make more measurements constrain
the parameters more accurately we can
tune the models to the the current data
so there are ways you can get these
models to converge a lot more and and
the modeling centers have just not
really tried to do that so far and one
thing which is what I'll focus on from
now on is adding new mechanisms so going
back to that development stage and
saying what if we conceive of the soil
world in a different in a different way
and this is where it's going to come
back to the microbes right so I'm a
microbial ecologist and by geochemist
and if you look at these models it's
really interesting because you know soil
carbon is spontaneously decaying there
is no representation of the direct
influence of soil organisms on soil
carbon cycling and we've known since the
early 1900's probably before that but
someone Waksman wrote it down in a book
in 1927 saying that quantitatively and
qualitatively soil organic matter
depends on the activities of soil
microorganisms which are influenced by
environmental conditions including
moisture oxygen soil chemistry in the
presence of nutrients so that's the
paraphrase but basically what he's
saying is that microbes eat soil carbon
this is the fundamental biological
process underlying the carbon cycle so
we've been interested in developing new
models that couple microbial biomass
microbial activity to soil carbon pools
in a way that we think is more
biologically realistic and then to
explore how these new models respond to
changes in the environment like
temperature or changes in productivity
and see if those responses are more
consistent with what what we would
expect so it's actually in some ways a
very subtle change so all we're doing is
taking out this constant and saying that
microbes are now going to control this
flux of carbon into co2 or recycling
back into the soil so now the losses are
a function of microbial biomass and
activity and of course you know these
microbes are sensitive to environmental
conditions just like the K values are in
the first order models so we've got
temperature and moisture and nutrients
can all affect microbes in their
activity but the key mathematical
difference here is now we make the
microbial biomass dependent on soil
carbon so now we no longer have a first
order linear model we have a nonlinear
model yes fool of microbes you wouldn't
expect them to depend on so carbon make
a new pool of microbes 2pm oh yes yeah
so they're there yeah there is that
that's in there too but that pool has
but that pulls already in these models
most of them have a pool that's microbes
but it's just not it's not coupled to
the other pools mathematically the
microbes are there but they just respond
in terms of losses in the same way
according to a decay constant so that
that pool is not influencing the other
pools in a direct way so that's that's
why it's a kind of fundamental change
even though it looks a little bit subtle
that is a static function is a BF my
equals so it's it it doesn't depend for
instance on the previous mike is that
mean i do the microbes going to catch up
for it you know so if we're giving
carbon temperature etc the idea to the
form itself very quickly equitably aids
to them did that value yeah so why did
you buy the TV for instance of microbes
here right so it's not like it's not
like say the growth rate your mind
really depends on carbon and whatever
it's actually the stock and micros as a
relationship no it's the growth rate
yeah so dumb this is this is probably
for less sophisticated audiences than I
have here today yeah yeah so actually
i'm going to show you the more detailed
structure just just know so we took this
structure in collaboration with wool
wieder and gordon bonin who are climate
and biochemical modelers at a 10-car in
the US
we represented some of these mechanisms
in a new version of a model that we
could scale up to the global level so
the kind of underlying structure the
model is as follows we have productivity
coming in through through plant litter
this is littered dead plant material and
that dead plant material is then
consumed by microbes so here's that that
microbial pool and that transfer is
regulated by enzyme kinetics which is it
just a nonlinear function of microbial
biomass pools and so that that can then
so these parameters then will affect the
size of this microbial biomass pool
losses are represented through an
efficiency term so mge is microbial
growth efficiency so the more efficient
a microbial cell is the more of the
carbon that's taken up across the
membrane is actually stored as biomass
rather than being lost as respiration as
co2 and we have a parameter that
controls the turnover so rather than
just being a k value we think about this
as a mortality term so whatever's
controlling the death of the microbes
and when they die that material is
transferred into the soil carbon pools
and we represent this in the litter
layer so the surface of the soil and we
are represented in to subsurface layers
so what we would call an organic rich
horizon or a mineral dominated horizon
so clay dominated horizon what's the
same set of of feedbacks and structures
but at these different depths so we can
couple this in this case we did it
offline but for sit with the climate
data from the CLM model the community
land land model and embed this new
biogeochemical structure the model into
that into that coupled framework so then
we can go back with this new model and
evaluate it based on the same data so
what we have here is the database
observations that I showed earlier but
just in a different color scale and I
have to what I'll call conventional
models so the models that I had been
showing you earlier that are like the
ones included in the IPCC
see reports is based on the century
model if you're familiar with that this
is the the CLM Community Land model that
that end car works with so one thing you
notice is that the correlation
coefficients here are actually quite a
bit higher than I was showing earlier
and that's because well weider went back
and tweaked the net primary production
inputs to be more essentially more
representative of the real world and
that alone increased the the correlation
quite a bit when we did that as well as
incorporating our new model structure we
get an even better correlation R squared
R our correlation coefficient around 0
point 7 so now we're explaining closer
to half of the variability in the data
set which is we thought a pretty good
improvement yeah this moment they said
in any way or um the only fitting that
we did here was of the the microbial
kinetic parameters so those were fit to
some data that I collected in my lab but
no they are yeah they all are by a root
mean square error approach so it said so
we did do some tuning here right yeah I
mean seven is he's pretty you know yeah
considering all the things that can go
wrong here I was shocked point I said
them for a model that isn't you against
the data set is kind of like I mean for
this area's I know about primes
territory yeah pretty much of its to put
it into a model and got point seven for
a global pattern you become pregnant
quite quickly yeah I mean tuning it I
mean I'm just based on our experience oh
yeah you're right yes Carl of a model or
any other model I think I mean general
that's really pretty good right who do
you say that's the case of my theory
point seven we'd be pretty happy with
that right most of the time yeah that's
right yeah it's funny cuz you know we've
done more sophisticated tuning with
microbial models or not one with
multiple layers and you get something
similar to that it seems as though or a
stacking where you can do much better
with Sora model this one
still fifty percent of the variation but
we have no kind of we don't know how big
the target ease we're shooting up don't
exactly much Russia yeah that the
perfect model might only my only
represent seventy-five percent of the
variation of in an imperfect imperfect
data set so yeah so we had some
confidence that the model was was
working at least at least as well as
some of the conventional models so he
ran some simulations to see what would
happen in these different models when we
we forced environmental changes so the
the first change that we made was this
twenty percent increase in litter fall
which represents an increase in plant
growth in production so somebody that
might happen under elevated carbon
dioxide this is a 30 35 year simulation
showing changes in the global amount of
soil carbon conventional models as I
indicated earlier you add more carbon
into the soil more carbon stays in the
soil these build up carbon microbial
model initially does that in a transient
state but then what happens is that
microbial biomass pool starts to respond
it starts to grow larger and there's
more microbial biomass to eat the soil
carbon so they drive that value back
down and sort of does this damped
oscillation and equilibrates right back
where it started so in this particular
representation the equilibrium amount of
carbon in the world is independent of
inputs from plants right not in the
transient phase of course right there
has to be something there's a solution
to the model that has zero inputs will
have zero carbon but once there is some
carbon coming in equilibrium value is
going to be dependent strictly on those
microbial parameters the v-max the km
the microbial growth efficiency and the
turnover so that's that's a pretty
radical difference in the way that these
models function and you know we were
kind of we're still a little bit worried
about that although if you take the data
and represent the data based on other
data on plant primary production there's
actually not a good relationship right
because we think about it in the Arctic
there's very low productivity right
there's not a lot of plant growth
because it's too cold and too dark all
the time but there's very high levels of
soil carbon whereas if you go to the
tropics
there's very high levels of plant
productivity and also high levels of
soil carbon and so and that the
correlation globally is actually not
that great because it that primary
production is is filtering through a
variety of steps in the ecosystem so I
don't actually know whether that you
know which one of these we should be
aiming for it's probably somewhere in
between here but we're working on that
yeah original model from the nature kind
of change paper does not show that same
effect what could you do an experiment
that's that is this yeah this is from
that it's the same model but that's but
this is from the underworld scale yes so
back to the micros to the small scale
and reproduces like to the Lotus dish
around the colony and t20 oh yeah it
will yeah yeah we've done yeah so this
is like one of a family of models where
we've done work at specific points or
globally and I was surprised to see that
it's still held at the global level
actually but it but it does yeah yeah
you can do analytical solutions to these
models and we've done some some work
with that and and it's clear that you
can just calculate the you know the
equilibrium carbon just just
analytically based and it comes out
based on those parameters because that
would limit type of conventional models
of your skull right so at least one of
the conventional models it's CL MCN so
it does have nutrient constraints are
microbial model I think does not so it's
how the microbial models need elaborated
to some of them are now the other people
picking it up and looking at somewhat
yeah somewhat they then adding the
nutrients does does add some different
complications and additional constraints
I can't say off the top of my head
exactly what they are and what
situations but but you can in some cases
see some pretty big differences when you
constrain it with nutrients cuz it's all
actually
the couple you wouldn't get such a rapid
transient response that when it hits a
neutral annotation effect and the
microbial community is limited and so
soil carbon would build up in because it
builds up because decompositions
retarded someone right yeah that's it
that's a reasonable prediction and like
so there's a whole set of people working
on that those issues right now so I
think in the next year or so we'll see
that that you know the mathematical
solutions to that question yeah yeah I
don't I'm too busy giving talks about my
chromium last trip back and address the
next set of really interesting questions
so here's an example of what happens in
these models when we warm up the earth
so here's changes so a carbon again with
a five degrees C warming over the 21st
century so these particular conventional
models show some modest losses and we
can compare that to the microbial models
in the green lines and what do you
essentially see here is a much wider
range of possible outcomes in soil
carbon and those outcomes depend as you
might expect on the microbial parameters
that we're using so in the solid line
the microbial models predicting almost
no change in soil carbon and this is a
scenario where microbial growth
efficiency is highly sensitive to
changes in temperature so what we're
assuming there is that as it gets warmer
microbial respiration has to go faster
to keep up with you know all the
turnover in the cells and so the
efficiency of growth is much lower so
when you reduce your efficiency of
growth then you end up with less biomass
at equilibrium so with less microbial
biomass there's less microbes to eat the
soil carbon so we end up retaining more
of that soil carbon despite the increase
in temperature because the biomass pool
is actually a lot lower whereas if we we
call it adaptation but essentially if we
don't allow a microbial efficiency to
vary with temperature or do you know
adaptation part would be if microbes
were somehow able to evolve or adapt in
a way that prevented them from from
having it
sensitivity to their efficiency so they
could maintain their biomass in the face
of warming then we get much larger
losses of carbon because now the
kinetics are faster and the biomass is
not is not declining right because the
efficiency is staying the same so we get
much bigger losses there so that you
know that's kind of disconcerting
because now you know it's great that we
have this new set of processes
represented but it doesn't actually
narrow on uncertainty at all because now
we just have to figure out these these
new parameters that we've introduced but
the advantage i think is at least they
are parameters we can go and measure and
that they have a real biological
relationship in the model some other
parameters are may also it turns out the
temperature sensitive this is a new data
from a group at Northern Arizona
University that I collaborated with and
showing that the microbial turnover
parameter probably also depends on
temperature in some soils so this is the
turnover rate this is a lab incubation
temperature in peatland soils from
Minnesota so showing organic soils in
the black and mineral soils in the white
and you see this increasing relationship
is actually quite a dramatic change in
the turnover rate and so then we can
using a more a simplified model look at
the impacts on microbial biomass and
soil carbon so here in the first part of
the panel is a scenario with constant
turnover in constant growth efficiency
so like I showed you just a slide ago if
we keep those parameters constant
microbes maintain their biomass so
there's no bar here because there's no
change in microbial biomass and the
kinetic effect the warmer temperature
takes over and we lose so low carbon if
we keep turnover constant and reduce
growth efficiency with warming as I
showed you earlier this is the microbial
biomass effect microbial biomass
declines that results in less less
microbes eat the soil and then we end up
with a little bit more carbon in the
soil we get the same qualitative pattern
if we increase turnover with increasing
temperature but it's even more dramatic
because the model is highly sensitive to
that turnover rate so this real
the with a slope like this you end up
really killing off a lot of microbes at
higher temperatures and they don't
actually know I didn't do the experiment
I did the modeling part of this paper
but they speculate that viruses and
vertebrate predators in the soil could
be different preferentially stimulated
by the higher temperatures which could
increase their turnover and if that
happens then again we get more soil
carbon in these models in response to
warming are these old soon he was the
half being observe or Arthur kinda is
the third one may or not graph on the
right most consistent with data or are
you notice i simply the experiment
smoking done well so which we so what
you really want is a long-term soil
warming experiment right because you can
do this these types of measurements in
lab microcosm or something but then
you're changing all kinds of things and
changing inputs from plants and all so
yeah we have gone and looked at what
happens in these soil warming
experiments and that was actually the
motivation for some of this initial work
is that in Harvard forest for instance
they warm the soil for now it's been
almost 25 years and they saw an initial
stimulation of carbon coming out of the
soil but then that response drop down to
essentially zero after 10 years so there
was a science paper published on this
and they spent a lot of time speculating
about why the response of the
temperature change of his five degrees C
would would attenuate like that and so
this is one reason why it might if the
microbial biomass pools and they did
measure that and biomass pools did
decline and you know the initial models
that I was developing were kind of
around that question was it a change in
microbial biomass and activity or is it
a change in the substrate pools so you
know so one approach requires these
microbial a couple Ryker bewley coupled
models the other approach doesn't it
just requires that you have a very
accessible pool that's even more
accessible under under climate warming
that
then burns off so the data are still
sketchy as far as as far as which models
support it because we don't have enough
long-term warming experiments to know
yeah this is a five percent change or
maybe ten ten percent change you would
you would start to measure be able to
measure but it takes it takes a long
time before you can measure a ten
percent change and so a carbon in
typical ecosystem because of the
variation spatial temporal variation in
your measurements yeah I've heard I've
heard that I haven't actually seen the
data set though so but that would be
interesting because our model does
predict oscillations I would I'm highly
skeptical with that that is actually I
mean that's not the only explanation for
that pattern so yeah come on and you
mentioned sweet in verse verse then I
wanted to ask I've been since the
beginning about what what role like soil
microphone or indeed above-ground I just
want to play second order my finger on
that is that it's fairly second order
however it would influence this turnover
parameter so if you wanted to represent
that and these models you could do it
but you'd have to have another pool
essentially that would also have
dynamics and have to be parameterised
now when I was a PhD student I looked at
this question of why is there so much
carbon in soils around the world and one
potential explanation is that is this
top-down control which is an idea from
from plant ecology from the 1960s that
if you're a plant and you have you know
caterpillars eating you for instance
then if in an ecosystem where you have a
lot of birds that eat the caterpillars
that's going to result in higher plant
growth so you could say same thing for
soil if you have microbes are eating
soil but those microbes are being eaten
by predators then then that that could
explain why there's so much so a carbon
but if you look at the data there's
actually very few studies that have
evidence of a very strong top-down
control from inver
Brits and the problem is that they feed
at all levels on the in the soil food
web so it's not that much of a direct
coupling which you really need to get a
dynamic in those pools okay so the last
part of the talk is just asking the
question of how we might constrain some
of these parameters because they seem to
be so important in controlling soil
carbon dynamics so for example we might
want to know whether microbial
efficiency is going to adapt or or
change with with so low temperature and
it turns out that a lot of
microbiologists have actually studied
the factors that control microbial
growth efficiency and one of the key
factors is the rate of resource use and
it's it's commonly known as the rate
versus yield trade-off and it simply
states that if you're going to use
resources at a high rate then that
microbe is going to require more
metabolic machinery more about metabolic
machinery means lower growth efficiency
because more machinery requires more
respiratory effort whereas if the
resource use rate is low then the
microbes can get away with lower
machinery lower biochemical investment
and they can have a relatively higher
growth efficiency and I'm very
interested in extracellular enzymes so
enzymes that are used to break down
complex substrates in the soil and so
I've made an assumption that if microbes
are investing heavily in that kind of
extra silent machinery they're going to
have potentially higher resource use
rates but but lower growth efficiency so
we can take that kind of well
established relationship from the
microbe microbiological literature and
superimpose on that a hypothetical
warming experiment and say if we if we
assume that warming is going to result
in greater respiration and lower growth
efficiency we can ask whether a
microbial community will respond to that
or adapt to that change by moving up
along this this trade-off relationship
so you know compensating for that
warming effect by reducing investment in
resource use would that happen and so
this is where I can incorporate some of
the much smaller scale they read
modeling that I've been doing lately
this is the decomposition model of
enzymatic traits or de menthe and the
goal of this model is to represent
relationships among microbial traits so
actual physiological traits that you
could measure or infer from genetic data
or laboratory studies and so this model
is spatially explicit it represents
essentially processes occurring on the
surface of a decaying plant material or
soil aggregate or something like that we
have inputs coming in to chemically
complex pools of substrate that were
kind of representing plant litter inputs
and various microbial processes
occurring so respiration we have enzyme
production here catalyzing the formation
of monomers chemically microbial uptake
of those monomers diffusion microbial
reproduction and ultimately a prediction
of the rate of decomposition or the rate
of decay and production of co2 from the
system so we can with this framework
simulate an increase in temperature and
look at how the community responds in
terms of its intrinsic or I'm calling
its intrinsic microbial growth
efficiency so that would be the
efficiencies you'd measure under
standardized conditions for these
different tax or microbial types in the
model so here's some model outputs and
again this is a very very tiny area
right less than a millimeter in size if
you think about it that way but scaling
up to microbial density here across a
multi-year simulation and in this plot
the microbes that are investing in high
resource acquisition rates and have
relatively low growth efficiency are in
blue whereas the converse with with low
rates and the conservative strategy with
higher efficiency are shown in red and
so you see that under the control
conditions 15 degrees C there's kind of
a mix of the different strategies here
some blue and some red and they're kind
of oscillating and throughout
the simulation if we warm up the system
we do in fact see what was predicted by
that that trade off and actually you can
put in
that trade-off in a simple analytical
model for comparison so we see that some
of the blue hi investment tax are
dropping out as we might expect and we
can calculate this biomass weighted
shift in intrinsic microbial growth
deficiency and the system has actually
gotten more efficient by point zero to
three units so about 2.3 percentage
points in terms of efficiency so that is
consistent with with movement along that
trade-off surface yeah this is all
simulations I mean the the trade-off
though is based on laboratory like a
body of literature from the laboratory
so but it's implemented in a simulation
just not this is not real data and so
you can run the simulations in a
replicated fashion and get a statistical
estimate of the amount of of adaptation
or shift along that trade-off surface
and we get a significant effect but it's
only about 1.2 percent so the magnitude
of adaptation and movement along that
trade-off is actually pretty small and
we can compare that for instance to the
amount of change that's imposed by five
degrees warming in terms of efficiency
and that's point zero eight units and we
can also go back to that simple
analytical model and say and without all
this community complexity what's the
maximum potential adaptation we'd ever
expect to see and that ends up being
about exactly half of the warming
induced change based on the growth
properties of these these microbes so
we're not even getting the the potential
predicted by the the simple analytical
model so why is that so what how can we
interpret that result what do we expect
to see in the real world if we're going
to try to extrapolate these theoretical
results and I tend to believe the
simulation model more because it's
representing these community
interactions that can actually influence
what traits are most prevalent in the
microbial community so there are this is
just a sampling of five different
microbial groups out of 100 in the
simulation so to fungal groups and three
bacterial groups over the 5000 a
simulation and you can see that for
instance in this bacterium here there
are patches that are forming and that's
because they're they're competing with
with fungi that are in those regions and
so if you go analyze the results of
these models there are some pairs of
taxa that are pairs of microbial types
that are that are facilitating each
other and others that are competing with
one another but the point is that
they're they're closely coupled and that
means that you know if the whole
community is trying to move along this
trade-off there may be some constraints
and doing that right because if you lose
some of the low efficiency taxa the ones
that are investing heavily in resource
acquisition you're also going to lose
some of the high efficiency taxa that
are coupled to them that are dependent
on them so that I think constrains the
the response of this model and that's
something we'd have to think about in in
a real soil system to that those
interactions might actually limit the OP
terms of potential so bringing that back
and this is kind of a qualitative way to
just scale up those results and you know
we think about what's happening in these
different scenarios at the global scale
if microbial turnover and growth
efficiency are both constant that is
they don't change with warming then as I
indicated before we get this pretty
substantial decline in soil carbon
whereas if microbial turnover increases
or if growth efficiency declines with
warming then we're in this better case
scenario where there's relatively little
change in soil carbon relatively weak
feedbacks to the climate change and so
our the simulation model at the small
scale is actually saying that microbial
communities might remain in this range
because they are going to remain unable
to cope with the higher temperatures
essentially so in terms of global carbon
cycling that would be a good thing but
if you're a microbial community maybe
not so good so anyway that's that's just
one quick attempt to see if we can use
Theory derive from microbiology to try
to in
warm what outcomes are more likely at
the global scale obviously there's a lot
of quantitative steps that should go in
and feedback between those types of
models but this is just the beginning so
I'll wrap up here and just kind of leave
you with these conclusions which I think
are probably pretty obvious by now that
the the global models we're using today
are not as good as we'd like and they
differ from each other and the data and
if there are massive differences in the
dynamics between conventional models and
these newer microbial models we've been
developing and I think that's a strength
and a weakness right it's nice i think
as a biologist to think that we can
measure these properties and incorporate
them in a more realistic framework for
representing the earth system that's
also the the catch-22 because you know
now we have to develop a whole new suite
of models and the correct parameters for
those models and make sure that we are
studying the right quantities in order
to make sure those make sure those
predictions are actually right and so
these these parameters are still poorly
constrained but I think that you know I
I and other people could spend a career
measuring those parameters and actually
learning something interesting about the
biology too so that's an opportunity as
well thank you there's a lot to learn I
had no idea when I started this any
questions first I thank you very much
these are probably not your questions
but I've got quite a few why is about
the difference between natural soils and
agricultural soils whether you expect to
see whether whether some of the
disagreement between models and the real
world is to do with some Aquino
perturbation of soil when you get to the
self incl structure differences
location I neither wants to do with the
marine realm and whether this whether
this general approach of microbial pool
is applicable also in marina benthic
systems right so for your first question
so some of the most of the existing
models do represent you know a cropland
biome and but I don't I mean there's no
nothing really fundamentally different
about that it's still forced by the
whatever anticipated product
productivity there is in those cropland
biomes and I don't know if it's clear
yet the extent to which agricultural
systems function fundamentally
differently from from natural when we
call natural systems right and of course
in the context that all systems on earth
have been modified to some degree by
human activity so in some sense i think
that it's a common set of mechanisms and
there are just slightly different
drivers in agricultural systems but I
will also say that agricultural systems
and the perturbations that they
regularly experience are a great way to
test these alternative models because a
model that's fundamentally biologically
correct or supported should be able to
replicate both of those environments I
think and if it can't then then that
suggests a problem taste pharmacist it's
the great kind of the heterogeneity in
the soils so you'd expect the things
fail for longer agricultural so they
sort of light too mm-hmm well makes
system right so that's exactly the
perturbation that we would want to
impose and test the the two model
structures in response to until I it's
you know you can debate how you would
how you would impose that forcing how
you impose the mixing essentially but
they'll be pretty straightforward to do
in models that have some kind of depth
layering which instantly most of these
don't buy the new earth the newer
versions getting so much so it was
disturbed absolutely yeah thnkx said
that that's the whole can of worms
there's a lot of issues with these
models and you know you can only is it
one investigator focus on sort of wanted
it one or two at a time but
I'll get to your next question but yeah
dis just to say to wrap that up that
there are people who are incorporating
permafrost dynamics into these models
which permafrost is not represented in
the selection of models I showed you you
know these the depth profile just to say
that we compare the data sets to the
models we had to assume in the models
that all of that carbon was somewhere
but the models don't report what depth
that carbon is located that it's just a
number for the entire profile the data
are reported by depth 30 centimeters to
a meter but there's some sometimes you
have to make about just to compare those
two those two quantities so there's
three other changes that are on the way
marine systems so in some ways the the
marine biogeochemical modelers are a
little ahead of the soil modelers in the
way that they couple microbial processes
with biogeochemistry and that's mainly
due to the fact that microbes controlled
the primary production in the ocean so
that's water column the representation
of heterotrophs in the ocean is very
crude as it is in soil but still a
little bit better coupling then then we
see in the soil systems right that there
is a heterotroph pool that actually does
catalyze the microbial loop in the ocean
in sediments I'm not as familiar with
that most ocean models that I have
experienced with our the water column
type models
well so I imagine when carbon increase
in the soil that means it's coming teach
because it's just accumulating and when
carbon decrease in the soils become
desert that's a um possibly yeah seemed
to blow away or just gets accumulation
in this oil right so there's basically
two different options one is that like
you're saying it literally piles up and
gets deeper and if you have an organic
horizon this you know mostly
recognizable or unrecognizable dead
plant material that can actually get
thicker alternatively it can be stored
on mineral surfaces so the soil volume
won't change it'll just be particles of
carbon that are attached to mineral
particles in the soil so both of those
mechanisms can occur we have to curve
where the soil carbon increases enables
back down to zero thanks you've a big
burst of bacteria or fungi or whatever
breaking up the carbon growing up but
then what's happening it's start their
rest firing at all and it's all in blown
away soon yeah that's blown away co2
that's right the others know there's no
real leeching or other fates for the
carbon besides either storage in another
soil pool or respiration as co2 the same
amount of leisure is falling every year
mm-hmm but it's just not the populations
bacteria is able to deal with that
amount of litter yeah over in that in
that simulation over a three to five
year time scale so it did take initially
a few years before so it was piling up
and then then the biomass caught up to
it and then drove it down again you're
predicting death certification was
really the main
response where we have the huge drop in
it yeah yeah I'm in soil carbon under
those specific parameter values where we
had no change and turned over no change
in efficiency yeah if you're next you
tested your microvia soil model ncl MCM
mm-hmm but the micro be so model itself
doesn't have nitrogen see how long does
en does have as the CN stands for carbon
and nitrogen so it does no but I mean
you know microb model that you put into
that yeah we took that part out for that
for these is that a little inconsistent
if you have not been represented and the
model not to have it in the micro be
part of the model because it needs
forever represented their microbial
activity is made a determined of the
nitrogen cycle yeah no yeah we had that
discussion before we implemented it and
yeah yeah so we considered it but for
the first round we just thought her
simplicity so we knew what was going on
we would we would take it out I guess I
should ask well I don't actually know if
to have my head if he it's possible to
run c CL MCN without the nitrogen
component so maybe he did that maybe the
for the purposes of comparison that was
turned off i deftly i have to check the
paper or ask him that that's a good
question though
yes I push these high efficient
organizers where's the low efficient
organisms and hints letra mean that the
low efficiency organisms to leave behind
material that the high efficiency
organisms can use they don't necessarily
they did so all the microbes in that
model die and then there then available
for reuse in essence but the key factor
there is that the low efficiency
organisms are producing a lot of enzymes
that are acting on the substrate in that
system so that's that's the issue right
when you when you force the community to
drop those members then there becomes
lower resource availability for everyone
including the high efficiency types so
they really are closely coupled together
you force me to think about this you
know I've seen in marine realm the
looking at trade-offs and allocation for
a different plankton stressed yes now to
understand succession and plankton
community needs to predict changes and
geek system types on climate change
things about soils it says it's so much
more complicated because it's got Mahesh
dat on top so you've got interaction
with dispersal ability when we bility
define things to feed on I presumably
there's trade-offs not there's a size
you have to go in order to navigate
soils and things like that I've never
seen any models of looked at that's what
this models that the trade based sore
the demand model is force or words that
and and the problem with that model now
is that what I showed you it's just it's
pull out of my own brain it's just made
up and we really need but there are
tremendous opportunities to mine genetic
data metagenomic data even physiological
data to actually quantify those those
trade-offs and if we do that then that
model becomes real and we can start to
incorporate whatever traits are relevant
so it could be dispersal trading off
against resource use or something like
that and it's in a specially made truly
and things like that with in soil
community oh yeah there's a whole body
of literature on on soil freewebs
massive literature yeah he take your
brain about yeah right thank you very
much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
