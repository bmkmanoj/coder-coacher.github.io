Microsoft Research and I'm going to tell
you about the guard project the guard
project is about making the world a
safer place by protecting programs
written in C and C++ every day we hear
about cyber attacks about machines being
hacked attacks that steel man your
information from people in organizations
and guard is about preventing that we
are more and more dependent on computers
we run computers everywhere to do all
kinds of things governments have lots of
computers we have personal computers in
our electricity supply depends on
computers or water supply depends on
computers and so it's really critical
that we make these computer systems
secure and and right now they are
vulnerable computers were not that fast
when these languages were were designed
at least compared to our computers now
so it was incredibly important to be
efficient and write efficient code so
you know security was not that a bigger
of concern at the time because you know
computers were not connected to each
other there was no internet it was a
completely different world so there's an
awful lot of code that's written in
these very powerful languages like C and
C++ but unfortunately these languages
make it very easy to write bugs in the
code and there's an awful lot of code
that was written at the time when
systems are not necessarily connected to
the Internet
and so now you've got these rather old
fragile bits of code being connected to
networks where there's all these nasty
bits of code malware out there
attempting to break into these systems
you know why do we need white we have
windows updates well it's because it's
extremely difficult to make everything
totally flawless all of the time okay
even very high quality diamonds are
flaws in right when you did with a
microscope there's a kind of an arms
race where Microsoft and other software
companies try and researchers try and
develop new methods of securing computer
systems and organized crime and other
malevolence are continually trying to
find better ways of breaking in so
there's a kind of an arms race so the
issue is that and we have lots of
programs and that have vulnerabilities
they have low level defects that can be
exploited by attackers to gain control
of the programs and that's that's where
guard can help well what's going on
under the hood is that one of the things
that an attacker normally tries to do is
to find something which is called a
control flow transfer so where the
program is executing way in one place
and then it's going to start going and
executing somewhere else the change from
A to B is a change that's potentially it
can be controlled by the attacker
because they've sent you some particular
malformed rubbish for example mmm and
they might trick you to go from instead
of going from A to B to go from A to C
so that what's going on under the hood
is that at compile time we analyze the
program and we find all of the places
where it's hard to identify at
compilation time exactly where the
program might be going next and so what
we do is we insert at the point where it
actually makes a transfer from a to
somewhere we can't quite tell where it
could be many good places maybe it's
also a bad place if the attacker is
managed to do something bad and we can
sort of check there to make sure that
it's going to one of a large set of
possible good play
when the program is running if we see
that the program deviating from the
correct behavior we immediately stop the
program so we don't allow an attacker to
to gain control of the problem the extra
safety checks are added at compile time
so when you take the source code it's
the same source code it's not changed in
any way but those extra safety checks
are added by the new feature that we've
added to the c compiler and so what that
means is by making a small number of
changes to the c compiler we can then
take all of the existing code and
recompile it to add the extra safety so
it's a way of getting a very broad
coverage of extra safety checks without
needing to modify a huge amount of code
we've partnered with the this m.tech
organization with which is part of the
trustworthy computing division inside
Microsoft which is this division
responsible for finding security policy
for the whole company and we also
partnered with the server and tools
division inside Microsoft in particular
the tools organization these are the
groups that are responsible for the
development tools putting together this
sort of system requires both changes to
the NT kernel that need to be done by
the kernel team as well as changes to
the compiler the demurrer compiler team
as well as changes to the linker and a
loader which are done by both of the
people in the compiler team and also
people in the kernel team so to get the
whole story to line up we need to have
everybody agreed about what we're going
to be doing across lots of different
groups within Microsoft
we have many different types of attacks
we don't have that many root causes of
the problem so with God we we attacked a
significant fraction of the root causes
so we think it's broadly applicable and
it can prevent many many of these
attacks and so finding the sweet spot
which is hide eventually improved
security in a way that doesn't reduce
the performance cost to the end user and
doesn't increase the engineering costs
to the developer now how do you add you
combine all of those aspects so what
we've achieved with the guard technology
is a way of doing that something which
measurably significantly increases the
difficulty of attacking the computer
system and at the same time provides
only very minimal performance cost and
almost no engineering costs there's no
question this is a very very powerful
technique which will make whole classes
of exploits completely irrelevant and
with one fell swoop the bar has been
raised massively for all the Tigers out
there and it will improve the lives of
millions of people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
