you
so very happy to have today markridge be
cheating mark is a professor of computer
science at Johns Hopkins he works in NLP
and a machine learning and in particular
death work some of the methods he uses
our graphical models use force
excavation extraction and one of the
application areas he's got into is
medical informatics medical information
applications and I think he's going to
talk to us a bit about some of that work
and also mark got his PhD at UPenn and I
think the overlap and he knows a few of
the others I do Jen and Hannah in
particular so welcome mark and really
looking forward to your top thank you so
much so I like to start by figuring out
who's in the audience so I can customize
a little bit what I say so I'm going to
make some guesses as to what you guys do
and you can raise your hands if I guess
correctly at the end you can if I don't
say anything that's relevant to you with
the end I'll give you a chance to define
your own area so how many people here
would call themselves machine learning
people you can raise your hand more than
once by the way machine learning okay
social science from economics
information retrieval mobile devices I
just threw that one in there I don't
really know what else systems no okay it
day miss an area all right good bye
really and if you're online I don't know
if anyone's watching or they're watching
this later but you can email me if I
missed your area how's that um so mining
web data for Public Health so what I
want to do today is start by telling you
a little bit about myself so you get all
the sense of where I'm coming from for
the rest of the talk some of you know me
I know some of you I see a lot of new
faces so let me just tell you who i am
and i think it will help you understand
what i'm going to be talking about so I
work in a couple different areas machine
learning and I've just listed I kind of
went through recent papers and wrote
down things that i published on recently
just to give you a sense of what I do so
one areas machine learning the other I
spend
time is natural language processing the
NLP community and then the area I've
really moved into recently is a public
health and I'm not listing what those
areas are because I'm going to talk
about some of them today and of course
really interesting work happens when you
overlap these areas and so never or
rarely am i working in one circle I'm
usually working in two circles at once
very rarely do we get something in the
kind of middle where you get to do all
three things at once so that's who I am
and specifically I'm a computer
scientist I'm trained my PhD in computer
science I my undergrad degree in
computer science I'm in a computer
science department and so that's really
perspective on bringing today so I'm
trying to talk to all of you as a
computer science scientists who has
become interested in public health and
trying to convince you why this is an
interesting area and why this is
something that we as CS people should
care about for those of you who got
degrees in other fields you are computer
scientists the rest of today you work in
Microsoft so I feel like that's a fair
generalization tonight okay so what I
want to say is that we have an
opportunity to save lives all right and
this is not something you hear very
often in the cs talk and that's
partially part of the reason i'm saying
that is because i really believe that
this is an opportunity that we don't
really see very often in a technical
field where we can make a difference on
the quality of people's lives the more
specifically and actually saving
people's lives right extending lives
preventing disease etc and so what i
want to do is back up this dramatic
claim by telling you about some examples
first I'll say why I think there's this
opportunity exists then we'll give you
some examples of work we've been doing
at a very high level to give you a
flavor of the sorts of things I think
are possible and then I want to drill
down and spend most of the day I want
specific example and talk about some of
the methods that we've innovated in
order to handle these sorts of problems
so today will be some convincing you
some overviewing of work and then some
in-depth machine learning methods okay
so I meant
in this area public health which is the
prevention of disease prolonging a life
promotion of health those all sound like
very good things what does Public Health
actually do and there's a lot of
examples that you guys are probably
familiar with that constitute public
health things like disease surveillance
which is very much in the news at the
moment because we're in the mobile flu
epidemic or at the beginning of a flu
epidemic self-medicating bieber's
vaccines drug use tobacco use medical
education these are all things that
public health people think about and if
you were to take a class on public
health you would learn about the public
health cycle which is a ten stage
process this is not a public health
class so i boiled it down to a two stage
process okay and the two stages are we
have your doctor's which all of you can
be for the sake of this argument and the
population which you guys are also part
of and the first step of the cycle is
surveillance and what this basically
means is doctors want to know things
about the population what's going on
alright once they know that they can
come up with interventions which are
policies ideas procedures what at
campaigns that are going to be designed
to improve the health of the population
and this is a cycle that you probably
see all over the place if you're in
product design and testing it's a very
similar cycle right you look at the
population you look at the problem you
understand it you come up with a
solution you deploy the solution and
then you see did it make a difference
what are the reigning problems and you
repeat right and again if we were in a
public health setting there's eight
other steps in this cycle i'm not
talking about so the key here is that
this requires data we need data on the
population order do any of these things
in order to craft any policy evaluating
the policy we need data understand
what's going on in our population so I'm
particularly interested in the role of
web data as a data source for doing this
what do I mean by web data so I mean
very broadly things like social media
search behaviors web forums really a
larger variety of different sorts of
data sets that are available online in
different ways health is a really big
part of these data sets right if you
look at I mean if you use any of the
is you see people talk about
health-related topics there are
obviously health related forums people
do health related searches and so to the
public health community and trying to
learn about a population these are
really good resources for giving us
information on that population and this
is where we as computer scientists come
in because we're very familiar with
these data sources and how to manipulate
these data sources and how to use them
to learn various things about our users
and so those same techniques and same
ideas are applicable to learning about
the health of a population so the
probably the best example of this has
been the large amount of work on using
search or our Twitter or Facebook or
whatever for disease surveillance right
and I say it's got a lot of attention
there's been a lot of news stories about
a lot of companies and start around this
idea and this is great for a number of
reasons we can learn about flew faster
using you know Google or there's that
paper on yahoo I don't know if there's
been a paper with being queries but
there's been one done by do so there's
there's a lot of papers that show this
we can do a better job of measuring flew
faster in different areas etc etc this
is great and this is why it's received a
lot of coverage but I actually think of
all the opportunities this is probably
the least beneficial it's least
beneficial because what we're doing here
is really improving on a technology that
already exists by making a little bit
faster a little bit better maybe a
little bit cheaper but where I think the
real opportunity for us to focus on is
in an area where there is no equivalent
datasets that are no equivalent data
sources and that's really in behavioral
medicine and so I just have to define
behavioral medicine it's becoming
obvious why we have an impact here how
people's thoughts and behaviors affect
their health right that is again a very
large broad area what is behavioral
medicine that seems like a lot of
different things I'll give you some
examples it's things like obesity drug
use smoking vaccines gun violence where
these are public health topics that are
primarily driven by choices people make
right obesity are is primarily driven by
choices people make about their diet
smoking is made by people choosing to
smoke right vaccines right i'm not
talking about developing vaccines and
talking about people using vaccines
again choices that people make whether i
do it and this is behavioral medicine
understanding how these choices are that
people are making are impacting their
health and impact in the health of
population so how important is
behavioral medicine so it's very sad but
this is a CDC page is actually
bookmarked on my computer because I go
to it so often these are the leading
causes of death in the United States I
think these numbers from to 2010-2011 if
you've never seen these numbers before I
let you take them in the shrimp behaving
not surprising the number one killers in
the United States are cancer and heart
disease such that combined I think there
may be more equal to everything else on
the list combined like those are the
major killers in the US but you see
other things out up here like diabetes
is big influenza and pneumonia are big
etc accidents these are like car
accidents skiing accidents less so
things like that so how important is
behavioral medicine so all these things
here have some behavioral component to
them right so cancer is tied to
lifestyle choices I'm sorry heart
diseases types of lifestyle choices
obesity cancers tie to smoking diabetes
obviously is tied to lifestyle choices
intentional self-harm this is suicide
there's obviously a lot behavioral
component there so behavioral medicine
is really important if we just look at
what kills people in the United States
behavioral medicine has a lot to say
about it and so improvements to what we
know about behavioral medicine and know
about populations really make a
difference in terms of saving lives so
why web data how does that fit into all
this picture like why am I here talking
about this well it's because online
activities reflect user behavior and
this is obvious everyone who works with
web data knows this but what it means is
that by using this data we can learn
about behavioral medicine we can learn
about what choices health choices people
are making and how people make these
decisions in the population and the
reason I think there is much better
opportunity is we're not replacing
something that already exists you can't
really get this information any other
way right the current best ways to get
information of Public Health is you talk
to doctors you go through medical
records and you call people and do
telephone surveys all right and knowing
that and then thinking about the sort of
online trails people leave those trails
are clearly contain a lot more
information about their health and their
and their health behaviors so that's
really the opportunity here so what are
the core questions in behavioral
medicine that we want to answer anything
these questions are very familiar to
people the first is how people make
decisions right how do people actually
make the health decisions they make how
do they go about that decision process
how do people weigh evidence this is
referencing a study having a lot of
people recognize but how do people look
at different factors different pieces
evidence and consider them and people
don't do this in an impartial way people
have a lot of biases people treat
information differently way it
differently how do people way that
information and in order reach their
decision how are other people
influencing that decision how do your
social circles influence your decision
how do the people you connect with your
family etc impact the decisions you make
alright so these are not behavioral
medicine questions these I think our
general questions we encounter in a lot
of the social sciences all right but
understanding these questions in the
context of health is key to
understanding behavioral medicine and
that's really why I think we have the
opportunity to save lives because the
data I think that's critical for
understanding these issues is data
familiar to people in this room and the
sorts of key questions here are the
questions they are familiar to people in
this room and they're not methods and
they're not ways of doing business that
public health researchers typically
engage in all right and so that's really
what I think people like us can come in
actually make a difference so that's my
argument the rest of today I will try
and give you some evidence for for this
if you don't believe me yet if you're
already on the bandwagon you can wrap up
your lunch and go or stay it's fine but
if you're if you would like to see some
evidence I'm going to split the rest a
day into two
sections I'm going to first give you
three quick examples of work we've done
and I don't think any of this work has
answered any of these fundamental
questions right it hasn't answered how
do people make decisions right but what
we can do is start to look at some of
these factors and start to peel back the
layers and get some understanding and
answering these questions is going to
look a bit different depending on the
health area and application you're
looking at but I want to give you some
flavor of the sorts of things we're
asking and the second doesn't want to
look at one in depth case which is drug
use and talk about how this is an
opportunity for methodological advances
where the sorts of problems that we want
to solve are not problems that we
necessarily have answers ready to go on
our machine learning toolkit shelf or
whatever and so I want to talk about
some of the at work we've done there on
new methods to address some of these
problems okay is everyone with me still
any questions okay no one's asking
questions which I assume everyone else's
so let me do says so by drug use I mean
illicit drug use and you you have to
find a picture that is showing drugs but
also the illicit nature so putting money
in the picture is usually really good
way of doing that just pills don't
necessarily do it money is like really
the tip-off that something's wrong I
don't know why because normal medication
costs money too but that's all that all
the pictures of illicit drugs to tend to
have like money in that met I use okay
all right and I try not to have the
actual pictures of faces of people so
like you all my smoking pictures will be
like of cigarettes not like a person
smoking that's also I don't want to
implicate anyone especially like stock
images of people smoking all right so
let start with some examples all right
so the big story a couple years ago 2008
if you were paying attention was 2008
2009 was the financial crisis right and
this was what was driving the news right
this is driving what everyone's focused
on and of course this is going to show
up in health all right because there's a
question or a theory that the financial
status of an individual has an impact on
their health right and
so here we have an article will the
public's health fell victim to the home
foreclosure epidemic all right and
you'll notice something it says only the
very top left essay which means this is
not a research study this is a
conversation piece of prospective piece
trying to answer this question because
from a research standpoint what kind of
data would you get to answer this
question right this is a very very
difficult question to answer what is the
health impact of the Great Recession all
right and so the work on this topic pics
little things here there but it's very
hard to get any handle on this so what
we did was we looked at search data and
the search today we have here some
google trends which makes trend data
available and what we did is we looked
at question queries that we relate to
house concern we looked at hundreds of
these and you can see there are plod
here and the solid line is the trend
right and what you can see from the
picture a little bit and we have lots of
numbers showing exactly what happened is
when the recession started there was a
noticeable uptick in these sorts of
queries right you can see some specific
examples like stomach ulcers and
headache symptoms and what we are able
to show is the number of people queering
for these health related concerns
increases during the Great Recession
much more so that you'd expect the
normal progression to be looking back I
think we look back to like 2004 or
something like that all right I'll get
your question one second so I'm not
going to all the details of how you
actually do a study but the point here
is this is a question that in public
health is very hard to get any kind of
handle on are a kind of answer and here
is a very straightforward way of using
search behavior to try and give some
evidence suggesting what's going on
obviously this is improving anything one
way or another but it's giving evidence
in the area where there would normally
be no evidence to speak of do a question
the y-axis is it's complicated it's like
normalized query volume yeah google does
not want to tell you how many users they
have so they give they do these
normalizing things and to get the data
require lots of tricks to make sure
everything's on the same scale and if I
had access to your data I would not have
to do any of those things because
I would know the real numbers but
there's a lot of tricks and how to do
these correctly but that's what the
y-axis is it's no no it's not the
percentage of all search queries it's
it's normalized for a lot of these
things it's so so if you've used google
trends this is its but they do a lot of
normalization to trying to account for
this and so it's more of they do
actually do like a per query
normalizations when they give you the
results just show you how this query has
trended over time and that counts for
all this stuff and then in order to get
those to be comparable denominators
require some tricks about how you
download the data yeah these are all
good questions and the answers are
actually like really long complicated
and it's really based on the interface
google has if you would have to store
raw data you could do a lot of this
yourself where you could just directly
account for things like new internet
usage and where and and etc okay yeah
you know that's a good question on this
plot cuts off in 2011 and that's based
on when we were out the period we're
focusing on I don't remember what it
does after that I should also say on
this topic my colleagues have a lot more
papers about specific things like the
effect of like the S&amp;amp;P 500 the effect of
foreclosures and they actually go into
showing which kind of financial
situations have the more of an impact on
health this is just the study i'm
showing you is a very broad kind of
analysis okay so another example on
mondays how many people heard of the
monday effect in medicine okay one good
so so it means a lot of different things
so if you ever can choose when you go to
the ER don't go on Mondays mondays are
some of the worst days for going the ER
there's a lot of theories as to why this
is but in general a lot of areas of
medicine there are there's a Monday
effect where things seem to be more
pronounced on Monday all right and here
are some papers looking at very specific
areas of Medicine where that's happening
there's actually a whole nonprofit
organization called the Mundy campaigns
that is trying to build on this and say
mondays are day of how people seem to
have more of an interest in health on
mondays and so let's do health promotion
on Mondays let's make monday the dead
health well the question is is monday
actually a day of health meaning our
people more interested in health more
engaged in how we're thinking more about
their health on mondays right and I'm
kind of asking is this worthwhile doing
or should it be the Tuesday campaign or
is there any day and so again this is
something that we can do with search
queries where we can look at large
numbers of queries related to health and
see which days they're actually trending
on and where we have more and again we
see this is uh many queries aggregated
by day a week and you can see that
Monday's do have more queries in the
other days almost as many as two
Tuesday's almost as many and it kind of
goes down during the course of the week
so I'm not commenting on why this is and
there's a lot of different theories
about why these effects exists but the
point is is another way where there
wasn't a lot of evidence on a broad
scale about health interest in Monday's
until we came along and look these sorts
of query bad behaviors and if you know
about how to use these query how to use
query traffic this is not a very hard
thing to measure so the last example I
want to give is um looking at Twitter
data so trying to understand when people
are interested in smoking is very
important into a smoking cessation all
right and so not only day of the week so
for example it's well known that people
are more interested in quitting smoking
around new years or some other days but
New Year's is a big one so there's a lot
of quit smoking pains that run right
after New Year's because they know
there's a lot of interest but there's
interest beyond that just time of the
year but in general winner people
interested in smoking and when do people
go to get cigarettes right so there
here's an example of a paper what they
did is they collect about 400 people and
they have them journal when they were I
had cravings when they smoked over two
weeks and they are gave the data and
this is an example the sorts of studies
that people are doing very small scale
very hard to run the obviously it's
going take a lot of work to recruit the
number of people to journal at this
level so what we did is something very
simple we looked at tweets and we just
look for tweets
and how we did machine learning and I'll
p the details unreported we look for
tweets that said basically I want to
smoke I want to cigarette things like
that right and then we just showed what
the day looks like all right and you can
see here and the the trends of what we
actually found are not that important
but the point is it's not that hard to
plop these kind of trends to see this is
a 24-hour period of when people are
actually saying these sorts of things
and again this is over now millions of
people so it's a really fast and easy
way in order to measure these effects
not over a couple hundred people in a
really labor-intensive way but over much
larger population and you can imagine
doing much more interesting things and
much more nuanced things with this data
this is just a really simple example so
those are some examples i want to give a
very high level of where i think there
are really easy things to do for us that
can have a big impact in in behavioral
medicine in public health the next phase
i want to go through was talk about one
specific example and some of the methods
that we develop for that before i went
there are there any questions about the
examples I gave any okay great a
baseline meeting oh we normalize oh we
normalize that yeah you have to
normalize that otherwise you don't get
anything interesting yea yea sorry I'm
glossing over a lot of details than
trying to give the high level thing but
yeah you have to be careful how you do a
lot of this stuff this is actually a
very very preliminary result it's not
published before I actually went publish
this there's a lot of other work I don't
want to do to follow up on it and also a
lot of questions that I have yet to
answer about this but yes it's you have
to normalize it and also we did the
timezone shift so that we're not just
respect I mean this is not global gmt
time but it's per time zone yada yada
okay all right so i want to talk about
drug use so let me first tell you the
data set we're using so we're not using
a search data here we're using forums
and we're using a site called drugs
forum and we have about a hundred
thousand messages from the site and
roughly speaking this is a website where
people go to talk about illicit drug use
okay so that includes things like
Kane also alcohol marijuana uh it's
really quite a huge diversity of of
drugs and what we're interested here is
mining people's reports about
experiences of using drugs so why do we
want to do that so the landscape of drug
use has changed a lot in the past decade
it used to be that new drugs came along
very rarely and they kind of made a big
impact when they came what's happened in
the past couple years is we've shifted
to this community where or this
marketplace where there's a lot of new
drugs that come out all the time and
only a couple of them make it and that's
primarily because a lot of these are
synthetic compounds so there are labs
all around the world churning out new
compounds all the time in order to get
people high in new and interesting ways
so in 2011.the there is an EU report out
that there are 49 new drugs that came
out that year so that's about one a week
which might not sound like a lot but if
your job is to figure out what's going
on and what these drugs are and who's
using them what they're called that's a
lot of drugs to keep up with all right
one a year is something more close to
what they can actually handle so this is
a landscape that's rapidly changing lots
of new things are coming online and when
you talk to policy makers or you talk to
people who actually do addiction
counseling they're really at a loss of
information because they have people
coming in talking about drugs they've
never heard of they don't know what's in
these drugs they don't know what the
names a lot of times these names mean
they're synonyms or the same name can be
very different things and there's a lot
of confusion and if you want to treat
people or come up with policy it's very
very difficult to do so so kind of
running examples bath salts how many
people heard of bath salts not the kind
you put in your bath okay they
completely unrelated the name is from
something else so that's also something
that really hit the news I think like
two years ago does anyone remember why
if it's seen sounds ridiculous you're
remembering correctly does anyone know
why bath salts one of the media a lot
because people thought they cause
cannibalism
they don't but there was a guy in
Florida who tried to eat someone else a
little fight it was a couple years ago
just like eat someone else and the
original reports were that he was high
on bath salts and that was like what
people did on bath salts that's not true
um but in general there's this idea that
bath salts made you feel like superhuman
and these weird things actually the Navy
I think was the Navy made an educational
video for the soldiers about bath salts
as really fascinating to watch because
they have like an actor pretending to be
on bath salts so this is this is a drug
that's new it's from 2007 actually but
no one really knew about in a popular
way to about 2012-2013 right and that's
a long time that's a long time of people
using it and it being popular in
communities but not really reaching the
level of awareness of policymakers and
addiction specialists and that's because
there's so many of these things out
there they're coming on line coming on
the market it's very hard to track and
keep track of what's going on so where
we come in is we have access to this
large data set what people are talking
about these things so when our data set
bath salts first shows up in 2007 with
people describing their experiences and
giving a lot of information about these
drugs and so researchers are starting to
turn to these online resources to learn
more about these drugs and what they're
doing is they're just reading messages
and they're just sitting there reading
through his main message as we can which
is not a very efficient way of doing it
and so what we want to enable is what we
call exploratory data analysis is
probably turning Ford before which is a
way of using unsupervised learning to
organize the data to help people answer
questions and so we're going to rely on
topic models to do this so how many
people know topic models are great
because I have hannahs slides as backup
in case people don't but everyone knows
so I don't have to use our slides on so
let me just go on so let's say we have
this data set and we want to apply topic
miles to say is that what would we
expect topics to be so a reasonable
assumption was topics would be drugs and
in fact if you run lda or Lda to derived
algorithm on this you get topics as
drugs right because people talk about
cocaine or people talk about &amp;amp; M feta
means our alcohol or whatever
that sounds great but we're also
interested in the route of how they take
these drugs so we're interested not just
in partitioning the data by the drug but
by how people take it so were they
taking it orally or injecting it smoking
it's turning it there's actually like 10
different ways to take drugs if you can
think of the other six I'll give you
extra credit but I don't want to discuss
them in public but we're also interested
in the aspect so people talk about the
chemistry so what's inner drug they talk
about the cultural context of drugs the
effects they have the health impacts
they have how you use it these are all
ways of dividing up the data we care
about and we're interested in
unsupervised learning because we just
have this massive data and we kind of
want to throw it algorithm the lattice
cover these things and so a topic model
is only so useful because the topic
model will essentially pick out one of
these divisions but not all the
divisions so we realize this is a
problem that's more general so if you
look at these this is a product review
of speakers the topic here speakers but
there are other things that are
impacting this review besides the fact
that it's about a topic of speakers for
example the sentiment and the sentiment
is going to impact the word use in this
as well all right if I looked at journal
articles right so here are two papers
they're both about clinical natural
language processing but this one is from
a medical journal miss one is from a
computer science conference and so not
only do they get formatted differently
but they're actually look different they
speak in different ways and so even
though the topic is the same the venue
makes a big impact on the presentation
these are all things that we want to
capture different dimensions of the data
we want to capture and topic models are
really going to capture one or the most
prominent one which is topic so our goal
is to jointly model multiple factors of
text we want to consider not just one of
these things about multiple things along
these lines at the same time so let me
explain to you how we do this so this is
how we generate documents under a simple
topic Moloch lda all right so each
document will have a distribution over
topics from that distribution we're
going to pick a specific topic and here
i'm going to use
topics that you might see in machine
learning NLP conference like speech
speech is now back in invoke it nips for
those of you who are there it's not new
it's like the last two or three years
and then actually thanks to microsoft in
part but and then from that topic speech
i have a distribution of words i'm going
to pick one word for my documents i'm
going to repeat this multiple times by
picking another topic another work right
so what we want to do is augment this to
not only consider the topic but let's
call it for the sake of argument the
approach of the paper is this a
theoretical paper or is it empirical
paper all right and so no I don't want
to have a distribution over topics I
want to have a distribution over these
factors right so the factors being the
topic and the approach together and my
distribution is not going to just be the
topic but it's going to be the
theoretical speech topic or the
empirical speech topic and from that
topic I'm going to draw a word in my
document so far so good this is going to
be yeah there's going to be a
distribution over these tuples does
great question so um a couple of reasons
and they have to do with the structure
of the model so let me present the model
and then we'll talk about it aside from
the fact that you actually don't get the
kind of results we do if you just
increase the number of topics so the
baselines we run against our if you
increase the topics that they match the
number of tuples and the answer is the
model as the power to learn it but it
doesn't actually learn any of those
things and you'll see why when I talk
about the structures great question
everyone at the next poster asked me a
question too okay so let's look at el
dÃ­a as having a vector with a vector
corresponds to topics right so here's my
vector I'm going to have theta as a
distribution over this vector right so
faded self is a factor and every
position in this vector is going to
correspond to a distribution over the
vocabulary which is five right so I have
a vector of length K and I've k phi is
associated with that so in the multi
dimensional case and here I'm just going
to show you two dimensions but this
extends the end
shins you can't make em that big if you
want to learn but 56 we've done no
problem we're going to have the topics
now in a matrix but we're also going to
have what will call the approach the
theory theory or empirical and so now
theta is a distribution over this whole
matrix right so it's the probability of
picking theory information retrieval or
empirical Mt and every one of these
cells now has a distribution over the
vocabulary associate with it so as a
distribution for impure I information
retrieval empirical another distribution
for speech theory okay and now I have
essentially what I set out so now when I
want to generate documents i have my
distribution over these two poles which
is the distribution over that matrix I
pick one cell on that matrix to be
what's going to generate this word that
indexes a Phi which is distribution of
vocabulary and I draw from that Phi a
word in that document all right and so
now documents are not about speech and
maybe a little empty they're about
speech theory and maybe a little empty
theory or something like that or
empirical empty okay so if we just did
that it wouldn't work because there's a
couple challenges we need to overcome
the first one is similarity across these
columns so I have a 5 for every one of
these columns but obviously and every
one of these every every website I have
a 5 for every cell but obviously the
rows and columns have a relationship
right the speech theory and speech
empirical distributions should look
similar because they're both about
speech similarly speech Syrians mt
theory should look similar because
they're both about theory so what in the
model is going to encourage this and
this is where you start to see the
divergence from el dÃ­a because LD
doesn't have those kind of structures to
encourage that behavior so lda is going
to select every 5 from a single dear
ashley distribution in our case our
multi-dimensional topic model every fire
is going to be drawn from madeira schley
that's specially parameterize just for
that southam atrix so every cell the
matrix is going to have its own dear
clay but all those zeroes will encode
the relationship between them so that
way when I draw a 5-4 speech theory and
a 5-4 speech empirical they will be not
from the same dearest lady but related
Deerslayer distributions that ensure
that there is some overlap between them
where that overlap is going to be in the
speech works how do we do that so we
start with a list of speech words and
this is all learned unsupervised so I'm
talking more from a generative process
standpoint we start from the list of
speech words and a list of empirical
words and these are words that we expect
to show up in speech topics no matter
what the approaches right and these are
words we expect to show up an empirical
work no matter the topic and obviously
they're going to you know the what
actually shows up might be different
depending on the topic or the approach
all right but here's kind of words and
you see this is actually examples women
by a model you know this looks like
speech recognition and this looks like
empirical work tasks performance I
improve accuracy this is your guide to
getting a paper in empirical paper so
each factor is his own weight vector of
a vocabulary when we want to generate a
5-4 speech and empirical that tuple
we're going to take these combine them
and get a new word list right that's
going to reflect both alright and so now
you see it's going to mix in speech
words and empirical works together the
key is that this is only what our model
thinks should be the case but we want to
allow our model to deviate in the data
from what it actually thinks meaning
given what we know about speech and
given what we know about empirical work
this is what we think those documents
that our empirical speech look like but
there of course going to vary in some
way and so we use this as a prior and we
use this as the parameters the dershlit
and we sample from there are actual
distribution and this is the actual
distribution you see so this is the
speech empirical distribution if you
know anything about empirical speech
work these words should make sense to
you write dialogue system speech tasks
right and now you see a mixture of the
speech topic and a mixture of the
empirical approach
so the key is we do is both for the
Phi's like I've been saying we also do
it for the distribution over two poles
for each document and what that means is
a document that's talking about speech
theory will be more likely to talk about
speech empirical and more likely to talk
about other theory then it will then
other two poles right so when you have
one cell that becomes more likely
everything else in that row and
everything else not column also will
become more likely in a document and so
that's a way of encouraging related to
polls to show up together all right the
second challenge we have is unsupported
tuples so if you think about it if
you've been thinking well you have a
whole matrix these things and you want
to go to third dimension some things
don't make sense right so there is a
really I'm gonna make this argument it's
not really necessarily true but there's
no really mt theory machine translation
theory right that's a very empirical
feel every paper must show blue score
improvements there's not really a theory
behind that and so it's not really
expected to see that we would actually
have any documents that show up in the
mt theory box so what we want to allow a
model to do is opt out of learning that
box we want our model to say this cell
cannot happen and so we do this in a
very simple way we have another matrix
of the same size that's going to be a
binary matrix that will serve as a bit
mask and here the shaded in things you
can it doesn't really matter which what
you want to do it but one of these is a
one on one of these is 0 depending on
what you prefer and so what we do is we
take these two matrices right we
multiply them together in our dear
schley and that's where we actually
sample our distribution over tuples from
and so what that means is if that bit is
off we can never have that to pull up
here and so now if we want to say
there's no such thing as theoretical
machine translation all we do is allow
the model to set that bit to be 0 and
now there's no data that can ever have
that and we don't have to worry about
learning Phi's to account for that all
right so this is one of the details in
practice if you actually try and do this
with the binary matrix it's very
difficult and we can talk about why it's
difficult to learn binding
matrices for sampling and in the ibp and
all this stuff but if you've tried it
you know it's very difficult to get this
to work so what we do instead is we
approximate it with a real-valued matrix
so b is actually real valued but we put
a u-shaped beta prior in it so we want
values that matrix to be as close to one
as close to zero as possible and this is
what we actually get when we learn it so
the prior is the dashed line and you can
see the histogram here is the values we
learn so most values are on which means
our model says yes I see this to pond
the data there's a lot that are off and
the this actually is very interesting
there's oh there's a small number here
they're not quite off but close to it
they're very few on the other side of
that point five line and when it
basically says is there's a lot of
things the model sees where it would
like to shut it off and say this tuple
can exist but it ends up relying on it
because it really can't explain the data
very well without it and so that's not a
problem we allow the model to do that
and we actually presented to users we
threshold here and we only show users
tuples that are the side of the line and
that works very very well I really don't
want to say much about how we do
parameter estimation here because it's
really not interesting it's turns out to
be not a big change from LGA where the e
step we're replacing the dear ladies
with these structured parameters and
that's now the same as lda and then the
m-step you have to learn not only the
parameters which you can do with hyper
parameter estimation anyway but you also
have to learn this bit mask which is not
that hard to do once you make that
approximation so if you are curious more
about this model we published this a
little bit of goat nips called factorial
lda we have a new paper coming out that
generalizes this called sprite
generalizing I think I can't remember
with sprite stands for it's like
structured priors topics I can't
remember the rest of it but this will be
out shortly and it generalizes this to a
lot of other cases that I think are
really interesting that I don't have
time to talk about yeah
one dimension is about topic and one
dimension is about approach good
question could just be some topics here
are some different times okay so against
some details about running this so um so
the most experiments we've done a
completely unsupervised which means we
just take them out on we run it and all
those weight vector lists and all that
are completely learned from the data I'm
going to deviate from that in a moment
so as a general guide when you say to
the model I want you know I give you a
hundred to a hundred components we call
them a factors it uses those to explain
the most the largest the words that
cause the largest just variations in the
data which is basically always topic
every day so we run on it always learns
topic so what we do is we make the first
component like 100 or 200 whatever you
normally make topics and the other
components we make very small numbers
and so every day is that we get
something a little different for like
running it on a computer science
abstracts we get something that looks
like topics in the first dimension the
second dimension get you see like
approach and then the third one um you
know I'm playing him what it is it's
like the second was like in Pierre
empirical in theory and the other one is
like something like data versus methods
I'm trying to remember exactly what it
was and we have a name for that on other
days that you will use the other things
we've run this on like web forms not
really to this for other web forms and
we get like topics is the first thing in
sentiment is the second thing so it
depends if you're really running this is
a very unsupervised way you get
different things depending what the
dance that is and then you can set the
number of parameters you have I mean the
number of dimensions you have so if
you're doing a two-dimensional three
four dimensional whatever you can set
that to capture whatever you want is
that okay good but this short answer is
make one number really big and that's
always topics that's what that's why
topic models by the way our topic models
and not models of authors or whatever
right because they're capturing the
largest discriminators in the data which
is topic okay that's why domain
adaptation methods work the way they do
etc that's just a thing about language
all right so let's go back to this so
let me show you some examples what our
model gets
so if we think of cocaine storing and
health we get something that looks like
this and even if you've never used
cocaine hopefully that you can still
recognize this as negative consequences
of stoning coke cocaine your health nose
bleeds if we just change this to usage
we should see things that are only
different from the previous one by the
fact they now talk about usage of health
and you see you get things that are
still about snorting cocaine but now
very different how you should work
cocaine lines small cut these are words
that some of you may be familiar with
the no we don't do any stemming so
generally we need to do whenever you
talk about topic models there's a list
of things that you can do when you
actually want to show this to users I
don't consider you guys users so I
didn't do all those things but like
stemming and stop words and all these
sorts of things okay so one just small
note on the training here to explain
this so here we're treating the drugs as
supervised and that's because the way
the data structured every forum post
long every post belongs to perform so we
know what the topic is and we what we
know what the drug is so we just say
well that supervised the other ones we
derive priors automatically from the
data and I'm not really going to talk
about that because it's a whole nother
learning step but we have a lot of
different applications this model where
we use to provision in different ways
and sometimes completely unsupervised
sometimes it has complete supervision
like here sometimes we use automatically
drive prior sometimes we use manual
priors and it's very very flexible and
long as you do lots of different things
depending on your date so how do we
actually use this right so does it work
for the case we care about so I started
by telling you there are people we work
with in the department of behavioral
camera the whole name of the department
but it's the one that has all the drug
use researchers it's a complicated name
and they want to use this model so how
do they want to use the model so they
have questions about like how are people
using salvia and so the way we answer it
is we say well let's take this tuple
salvia smoking usage let's find the
sentence that is the most representative
of
a tuple and show it to the user here's
another example salvia oil usage this is
the most representative sentence and you
can see this is clearly about how to
take salvia how to use it by pills and
this is how to use it by smoking it
right and so what we did was we showed
this to users and we showed them
alongside these excerpts technical
report descriptions that actually based
on research answer these questions and
we showed them a lot of these sentences
from different baseline models and we
said which sentence best answers this
question and they picked our sentences
more than the other sentences that's my
high level summary of our results and in
addition to the quantitative result of
the those sorts of quantitative results
we've done a lot of qualitative studies
showing these to our colleagues who
think this is really great and they love
it right so this is just one example of
how you might use a model like this any
questions about this okay so last thing
I want to do is tell you a little bit
about what I'm thinking about doing next
and where I'm going and let's go back to
these fundamental questions in
behavioral medicine alright how do
people make decisions how do people
weigh evidence and what are the
different factors socially that impact
how people make those decisions and I've
been brainstorming what I can do with
data they are normally have access to so
you've heard a lot of examples with data
I have access to but you guys have data
I don't have access to so I thought what
would it be like to have the access you
guys have and that might be like search
sessions which I can't get or it might
be things like browsing behavior or much
more social data that you guys have data
says I'm not even thinking of mobile
right what what are some interesting
things to tackle I'll just give you two
quick examples the first one is vaccines
so that scenes are really interesting
because vaccines are an area research
where we basically cure disease right we
have a vaccine for smallpox if you take
the vaccine you basically don't get
smallpox and glossing over how bad
scenes work a little bit all right this
is phenomenal but we have an epidemic of
sorts in the immunization community
because of the anti-vaccine movement
right where people are
for variety reasons not taking this
there's your money again by the way so
this is obviously a big problem and for
those of you following this this year
has been a resurgence of things like
measles and mumps in the United States
it's also researchers of polio in Syria
for other reasons because people are not
vaccinated so there have been studies on
how we can try and make people vaccinate
right and so what they do is they sit
people down and they educate them in a
variety of ways as a randomized control
trial so you try different educational
approaches to try and increase their
awareness of vaccines and you guys will
probably be familiar with this sort of
result the studies show that the end of
these interventions the people are have
less misperceptions about vaccines
they're more informed and they
demonstrate and test that they're more
info on Bob they work but they are less
likely to get vaccinated okay people
have seen results like this before no
this is not a this is a very common sort
of result in a lot in like political
science and such where you educate
people and they seem to be more educated
but they're more convinced fundamentally
their actions betray that education and
their action suggests they're even more
committed to their mistaken beliefs this
is incredibly depressing because this
represents exactly what we're trying to
do in terms of educating people this is
how we educating people people are
becoming more educated about the
benefits of vaccines are less likely to
use them that's terrible alright so this
really goes at a lot of those core
questions like how people wait
information how people make decisions
how people social information makes
influences that and we really need to
understand these things in the context
of vaccines we want to do anything about
trying to increase their usage and this
is I think a lot of this is beyond the
sort of data access to I think looking
at the sort of people the sort of search
sessions people have over time what sort
of websites they visit how they browse
the Internet the sort of social
interactions they can have you really
can try and try and answer some of these
questions and really when you look at
the demographics I think is key because
it's not just the fact that everyone
believes something about vaccines but
the best perceptions vary tremendously
by different demographic groups right so
vaccine refusal is high in kind of like
bourbon la upper middle-class families
and inner city right for very different
reasons all right and so you don't want
to just throw data at this you want to
throw at this where you understand the
demographics and I don't have access to
those sorts of search right so I can
look at search trends but I can't do
anything with demographics because I
don't know anything about who these
people are it's all I read it so I think
you can do tremendous value here and
learning about the population and they
also think and we thought about this
later there are possibilities for
interventions as well right trying to
run a study like I just showed you on a
much larger population where you target
messages to different demographic groups
and see what the impact is and if they
actually changes their behavior one
other quick example I'll give from
tobacco control electronic cigarettes
how many people hurt electronic
cigarettes okay this is big how many how
many people have learned about them in
like the past year or two okay so this
is like the biggest change in the
tobacco world in past ten years every
time I go talk to tobacco control people
this is what they're thinking about to
them it's huge all right and as a result
there's been a lot of pressure put on
the FDA by States and to about control
experts to regulate electronic
cigarettes which are currently
completely unregulated and the FDA has
said we are willing to regulate them and
we're interested in regulating them but
they have a problem which is they don't
really know much about them so give you
a really simple example one of the
things the FDA wants to do is task the
contents of electronic cigarette cartons
to see what's in them and they have a
really simple problem they don't know
what to test they want to test what
people are using they have no idea what
people are using should they go down to
see vol CBS doesn't salad anymore right
so they go down to write a pic on rite
aid and by blue do a lot of people use
blue they don't know and so what they're
doing is please don't laugh what they're
doing is they're paying people to go to
stores and write down what they see all
right and they're going to use that as a
measure to figure out what the most
popular cigarettes are ecigarettes are
now that's crazy and we have papers that
are that are hopefully coming out soon
that sure you can do this by looking at
search traffic and see what people are
querying for and that's much cheaper and
easier way to figure out what my popular
brands might be but another question
they have is why do people use
cigarettes electronic cigarettes and
answering that question makes a big
impact
and how you regulate them so we did
something really simple we looked at
Twitter data and this is actually all
manual coded but you can automate this
and we looked at the reasons people
wrote in Twitter about why they were
using electronic cigarettes all right
and so quitting smoking is the single
most popular reason and this is how
they're typically advertised right and
you can understand why they might be
advertised that way but supporting
smoking is also really popular almost as
popular and supporting smoking basically
means I want to go out with my friends
but I want to smoke New York City bars
don't allow me to smoke think all
there's ecigarettes I can keep a smoking
inside the bar and that way I can
support my habit that's very very very
bad right these other things aren't so
good like they make me look cool I like
the flavors they're cheaper these are
reasons that are more promotion of
cigarette use than quitting right and so
they want to know things like why are
people using them how are people using
is are these a gateway drug do teenagers
start by using electronic cigarettes and
move to tobacco right they don't know
these question they don't know the
answers to these things and again I
think these are questions that the data
that you guys have here can shed light
on and these are active questions the
FDA has where if they have the answer
they would actually change regulation
policy because we go I'm sure you guys
can think of other things that I can't
think about and I'd love to know what
those are because again you guys have
access to data and ideas that I just
don't access to but that's some ideas
where I'm thinking about going thank you
very much thank you to all the people
who helped out with this there's a lot
of work here from la different people
and I'm happy to take whatever questions
you guys have guy exhaust your questions
or exhaust you it seems like you think
about public health and in the initial
two-phase approach where the sort of
like surveillance and there's action
yeah fourth click
I guess to me it seems like a lot of
behavior problems are almost certainly
very personal mm-hmm so it's not like I
surveillance approach will work more
like you need to figure out how to
intervene yes so that's exactly why it
said the demographics are keenest
vaccines so when you when so take
vaccines right the typical way they
learn about why people refuse vaccines
is they do phone surveys right so phone
surveys are a very expensive and course
way of getting at specific groups right
and the group's you can get out are very
limited alright and this is in political
campaigns we don't have infinite number
of funds to throw it surveys right
running one of these surveys costs a lot
of money there's some slides i took out
which had on gun violence and have time
and they had one result that we're able
replicate that result cost about a
quarter million dollars alright because
after on these service right so they
don't think that much about the
questions that you just ask cuz they
can't get that data but when you look at
web data you absolutely can look at that
data so i have another version of that
last charter showed you of why people
are using cigarettes broken down by
gender right and we want to break it
down by demographic group all right i
think that's key to addressing a lot of
these issues and it's just completely
beyond the resources and the ability of
traditional public health that's
probably reason I'm really excited here
is because now you can do things with
this data that you couldn't do otherwise
and specifically I think it's not that
you can do them better but in the case
of vaccines and you can actually do
something a productive and effective
that in the current regime you can't
even do so I agree but it's not that
they don't know it it's more they just
don't have the resources to do it I
think I mean so obviously saying that
the data is there to do it but so did it
not there because if you really want to
get the causality things need to be oh
right
yeah so right so so I'm still at the
phase of how much can we do in a very
passive way so if you notice every
example I gave us passive surveillance
there are actually people doing active
surveillance to and not me and we can
talk about that as well I think there's
so much to do in just kind of this
passive surveillance that I haven't even
gotten to the kind of active stuff but I
think when it comes down to things like
vaccine I think we do want to do
interventions right so just think about
like this computational advertising
which is something everyone here is
familiar with when I talk to people in
tobacco control that's a revolutionary
idea not the idea that you do
advertising in line that you customize
things to people right they ran so the
CDC ran the tips campaign you probably
saw this a couple years two years ago
were people former smokers the
television commercials and they often
had visible physical implications
because they were smokers and the whole
idea was it would scare people right and
those are sorts of things if you look at
the diversity of those messages given
messages where we will resonate with
different groups right that's kind of
obvious to anyone who does advertising
and when you do online advertising
that's that's what you bank on that's
not even on the radar yet right so I
think that's why I said we have an
opportunity because there's these things
that we do that we're like of course
that's what you would do and in that
community it would make such a big
impact because they aren't even thinking
about it yet and in fairness then make
they can't easily do it even if they
want to oh they did spend anything two
hundred million dollars on tips so they
had some money maybe not a lot maybe 20
million is not a lot of influence room
