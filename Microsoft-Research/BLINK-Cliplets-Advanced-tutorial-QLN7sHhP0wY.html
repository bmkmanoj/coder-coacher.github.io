we left off in tutorial 1 you can edit
your most recent clip luyt project by
tapping in the lower left corner if you
remember we had two layers a background
frame with a looping layer on top the
background depicts the girl suspended in
air while the loop shows Pinocchio
pedaling his bicycle here we'll add some
new layers
tapping new layer brings up a new green
layer again defaulting to a loop if you
touch loop you will see there are a
number of other choices here I'll select
to create a play layer if you look on
the clip the timeline at the bottom you
can see the play layer covers a single
short span of time which I can place at
some location in my clip lit I'm going
to make it a bit longer in time to slow
it down it'll also place it towards the
beginning of the clip late' there's also
a hold frame at the start and end we
will discuss later we need to create a
mask to define which part of the video
is seen in this layer here I draw in a
line from top to bottom I'll then use
the fill tool to fill in the right side
the bit of the input that plays is
defined on the input timeline here I'm
going to adjust the end to find a nice
smile on the girl
I'll leave the start to match up with
her suspended in the air let's see what
this looks like I tap play we see the
girl up in the air when we reach the
play layer she jumps down and freezes
cycling back to the start she pops back
up in the air and this repeats I want to
add one more layer this one will also be
a play layer but I will now choose a
reverse play which will make time go
backwards this time I will set it near
the end of the clip lit and make it a
bit longer as before and again I will
create a similar mask by drawing a line
and filling in to the right to cover the
girls jump let's see what we have
oops I did not set the input saw pause
and let's adjust the input to exactly
match the previous green layer I'll
slide the whole thing to the left and
then use the right handle to match the
endpoint let's see what we have by
playing the clip --let at the start
cheese down and when we hit the new
reverse play layer she jumps back up
this is not exactly what I wanted I also
want to see her jump down you'll notice
there are two other handles on the play
layers they represent when and if the
first and last frames of the play layer
hold still I'll slide the left one over
to remove the hold on the start frame
now when I play the clip --let we see
her jump down as defined in the green
play layer and she jumps back up from
the purple layer this creates a nice
repeating clip late-- with no sudden
jumps this clip luyt has a total of four
layers the background
Pinocchio pedaling in the orange loop
layer the girl jumps down in the green
play layer and finally jumps back up in
the reversed play purple layer this clip
litter is ready to export and share as
we showed in the first tutorial that's
about it for this tutorial I hope you
can see how to be creative with blink
clip let's have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
