you
okay so let's get started I'm very
pleased to introduce mark gonzales she
has a very interesting background she
was trained as a neuroscientist and she
did the PJD in immersive virtual-reality
and she has written many places am i
teaching wine university and mesa she
did a wonderful internship with us two
years ago and she will talk about some
human behavior and also designed some
tests for immersive telepresence and I
will be monitoring the online questions
so for people online you can ask the
questions through the web page and i
will ask question for you okay ma please
thank you thank you thank you okay first
of all I want to say wow it's very
exciting to be here today and I have
prepare a talk that they will mostly
show in precal evidences of how we can
alter human perception and behavior
through immersive virtual reality in
order to do so you'll see al introduce
several experiments so we will go
through that most of the work that i
will present here is immediately related
to my PhD with malice later in
University of Barcelona and MIT as well
as my postdoc at the built environment a
computer graphics group at the
University College London you'll see
during the reason the research here that
it has a strong component on computer
science and neuroscience which are my
two backgrounds and let's go into it so
I want to start by proposing the two
main methods that I've used to generate
immersive virtual reality during my
research the first one is the cave
systems which combined with real-time
computer graphics of course so the cave
is a room in which the walls are screens
and the ones the participant enters all
the projections of the screens are
rated from his point of view so
everything is rendered from his position
this is a stereo video and it creates
the illusion that you enter another
space a brutal reality the second
approach for generating this immersive
virtual reality is using head-mounted
displays we can render the virtual
reality from the point of view of the
participant using this technology and it
has similar effects to use in a cave
there are some differences we will go
through that later but let's focus on
the common effects and one of the common
effects that I find fascinating is that
when people enter an immersive virtual
reality they experience what is known as
the president solution and is usually
described by a combination of two
factors the first one is the play
solution the solution that you're
somewhere else and the possibility
Lucien which is the illusion that the
events that are occurring are really
happening which is more important
because when participants are given a
plausible situation they behave
realistically a clear example of this
realistic behavior can be seen here in
this experiment by Mahan arilinn
siggraph 2002 they asked participants to
cross a room with a cliff you can see
the real scenario here the birth of
reality and it's interesting to see that
all the participants went through the
wall even though they knew there was no
real cliff not only then they referred
reported feeling like they could fall
and also the other when a strong
psychological a physiological changes
such a her rate increase so we do find
realistic behaviors and reactions inside
the return environment so and these
responses are also realistic when you
interact with an avatar for example
imagine you enter an immersive virtual
reality and the avatar that you're in
acting with nieces so it's very likely
you're going to say bless you so it
would just feel impolite not to do so so
this realistic behavior can potentially
be exploited for sociological or
behavioral experiment so using immersive
virtual-reality for that and precisely
at UCL in the cave at UCL we carried out
a reproduction of the Stanley Milgram
experiment on obedience to authority
this is an experiment where people are
asked to give increasing electroshocks
to a learner when the answer is wrong
and I Milgram's findings he did this
with real people so Milgram's findings
were shocking he found people would
provide life-threatening shocks under
the command of an authority figure okay
we have to think of these studies under
the background of a how could people
behave like that during the Second World
War they were trying to figure out how
can people follow that authority this
way so even though the shocks were not
real participants didn't know that and
they they were simulated of course but
there was an unethical area there
because there was a deception a scheme
and this is kind of band by ethical
committees at the moment so but in
brutal reality we can do it anyway
because it's no deception their
participants now they are interacting
with a synthetic avatar so I want to
show you a video of this VR experiment
so we recorded the motion capture from a
real actor on the audio the participant
has to read aloud all these words the
first one has to be multiple one of the
four choices below and the only correct
one is the one that is highlighted so
can you sew with the Stars pretty pretty
soft the shots they increase its prey I
know unison experimenter to do this
because you feel people don't really
like to do it okay so we see at some
point the Avatar stars trying to fight
the experimenter answering
I don't want to continue don't listen to
her it's kind of funny because I'm
triggering also the avatar no but do you
know what to keep me here let me so
let's just keep it here but it goes
worse and worse and at the end the
Avatar doesn't respond anymore so let's
go into the actual experiment so we run
20 participants in this condition where
they interact with the avatar and 20
control participants that did not
interact with the avatar they just read
the words continuously like giving the
choices okay um we find the same results
as Milgram people follow the authority
and authority being me in this case the
experimenter but anyway so they are
given a task and they follow it and but
we do find something interesting which
is they increase their anxiety level the
more they feel this is realistic so this
is the somatic perception a
questionnaire that you provide before
and after the experiment and see whether
they've been like having harder stronger
har adore these kind of things so it's
something that people perceive how much
do you perceive your heart right Dean
and a after the experiment so you do the
difference pre post and we find that
people that were believing the realistic
environment they plop civility illusion
they had a stronger perception not only
that we also find that the participants
try to help the avatar so here we have
the experimental condition and the
control condition and this is the the
sound pressure level of the words that
they read aloud and this is the coreward
and these are there
other options so they are significantly
saying louder the correct word trying
kind of helping the avatar even though
many of them they don't actually notice
and we wanted to rule out that it was
only because they work was in capital
letters so that's why we run the control
condition but this doesn't happen in the
control condition okay so we find this
realistic behavior and we find that we
can use immersive virtual-reality to a
study and change behavior in people and
not only that we can also use immersive
virtual reality and the advantages of
the head-mounted displays to not only
make people feel like they are on a new
location but also that their body has
been substituted by a functional body
and this process is sometimes refer as a
embodiment so let's have a look at how
can we substitute this real body for a
virtual body there is more information
on how to do technically this in here
okay so basically when a body is
co-located with the participants body
and it moves like the participant does
this generates about the ownership
pollution let's see the video so you can
see there is a motion capture system
working in real-time and this is what
he's seen he can see basically as he
moves around okay so there there is
quite a bit of technology working here
in real-time as I was saying the head
mounted display the motion capture and
it creates the solution of you being
embodied on a different body and I want
to enter a bit more on the underlying
neuroscience factor that allow for a
participant to really feel this body
ownership pollution and their multiple
studies have been done in in perception
without any technology at all only
mannequins or rubber hands and it's
possible for people to perceive this
external body part as their own under
they procure a proper multi sensory
stimulation
this is synchronous with so tactile or
diesel motor emulation so I'm going to
show you a video so you really
understand what I'm saying so this is
the participant he puts his hand behind
a curtain and we put a rubber hand just
in front of him so he only really sees
the other hand but he feels synchronous
touch in both hands so at the end he
thinks this is his hand because he's
seen the touch I'm feeling the touch and
their ways of measuring dissolution
you'll see now one of the ways to
measure is very drastic okay so there is
a response to a harm and this is not a
fake this was an actual participant I
mean he really felt the ownership
pollution and the stimulation lasted
what the video lasts less than a minute
you already feel this hand be in your
hand another interesting way of
measuring this illusion is by
appropriate cept if drift if you ask
them to close their eye and point like
were there Hanley's many people don't
say where their actual hand is but
somewhere in between the rubber which is
something that doesn't happen when the
stimulation is a synchronous so there is
a proprioceptive drift some people have
found temperature drop as if you were to
reject in your own hand so the
temperature drops but well basically
there a underlying proprioceptive I
sorry a multi sensory integration ways
of generating the illusion and of course
the illusion can be also generated over
the whole body I run an experiment it's
one of my earliest scientific
contributions to show whether
dissolution coming hands a using
real-time mirrors a during the
experiment you have a mirror that you
can see your body there and here we
don't do be so tactile like we don't
touch you are selfish stimulating by the
motor action so
you see you're moving and the body moves
so i'm going to show you the video here
is the person moving around so we can
see also that we don't need to have the
whole body tracked sometimes we can use
here inverse kinematics to do the rest
of the body a movement m so this mirror
wasn't it was like just a one of my
first developments at the lab I was a
research assistant and we were I was
helping the researchers in the
laboratory preparing open GL graphics
and here you can see all of a sudden
there is a harm in this case the harm is
something that comes to you and people
try to avoid it only in the synchronous
condition so let's see
they don't want to get in the middle but
at the same time okay so that's what we
find so let's now focus so that mirror
you'll see it repeats over many other
experiments that people have done in the
lab later because it really enhance the
illusion so what is interesting of this
technology is that we can modify the
first one body in almost impossible ways
for example enlarging your hand people
don't like this experiment by kilt any
people would touch a surface and the
virtual hand Buddhist spanned as they
are touching people wouldn't notice that
the hand was super large until it was up
to 2 meters or 40 inches which is super
big other experiments they've shown
people accept larger bellies and then
they have appropriate safety drift when
you ask them where your bellies they
think its larger and you can change the
age of the participant you can change
the gender or or the race also so you
can embody people in different race
avatars and everything and interestingly
using this multi sensory stimulation we
can also embodied people in robots and
here i'm going to show you this work is
part of the you future and emerging
technologies project very which aim at
enabling strongly paralyzed people to
reenter the physical world important
love the electrodes measure brain
impulses enabling a person to control
the robots actions without moving their
own limbs the idea is to enable severely
disabled people to enter the world via a
real-life avatar a look around what's
our case the actions are associated with
squares that are flashing with different
frequencies and the operator can trigger
an action by simply focusing attention
on one of the squares the frequency of
the flashing will be reproduced in the
brains visual cortex
so we can detect which square the
operator is looking at espace Miren lo
doy giving a ride I'll kind of gesture
ok so we presented this to the vice
president of the european commission le
cross in vilnius in 2013 it was kind of
interesting hit and you can read a bit
more about how this can be used in a
social environment in this paper so
overall it seems like we can substitute
this body and it also seems like this
field of self body perception can
clearly benefit of using biotechnology
and there is associated research to this
having beer tour bodies so one of the
things we can study is all these
thresholds like how can you accept this
radical changes and which changes are
actually not accepted another is to
study the implications of the body
modifications for example in this
pyramid of taboo topic on the racial
bias he would put calculation
participants into black avatars and that
would reduce the racial bias towards
black people so we can find attitudinal
changes behavioral changes and of course
it seems very interesting also just to
study how can this really happen how is
the body represented in the brain and
how do we manipulate it so how can it be
that a Bertrille is Tim Lee
computer-generated is process maybe as a
realist amoli and how can we prove that
so the next three experiments that I
will present are more into the
neuroscience perspective and they are a
dry directly related with my PhD so I'm
going to show the these three ideas is
the first one this is like okay an axis
and the first one is how can I believe
this is
my body this ownership we're gonna test
it and see what's going on in the brain
and how do I accept changes to the body
then okay I can control it so I have
agency over it what happens if for
example you're controlling a robot and
all of a sudden somebody hacks into it
and moves the robot in another direction
how are you going to perceive that error
and the last one is what if it looks
just like me no it's that gonna affect
how I how much I feel embodied into it
or so to explore all of this I'm gonna
just because we want to see how the
brain interprets the virtual is timidly
so we actually turn into EG and many of
you already know EG has a great temporal
resolution we're talking about
milliseconds but it has some bad signal
to noise ratio like I cannot see
anything here and also it has kind of
bad a spatial resolution I mean how many
neurons are being one of these
electrodes but some of these limitations
can be overcome using a very
methodological approach if this is for
example using event-related potentials
when we know the exact moment in which
we are presenting an estimate we can
measure how this stimulus processed okay
right after if we present the same
stimulus several times we can average
and erase noise and non related activity
so we can see that when we present this
expert this stimulii 80 times we find
this response with these components
negative component in 100 milliseconds
sorry a positive and negative etc and
this happens in different parts of the
brain and different stimuli will produce
different signals so here this is the
typical oddball paradigm word odd
stimulii are having a stronger p300 okay
so we'll just go with that and figure
out these are micro bolt so
would you blink and they are out so we
have to be careful with that I will
focus on the first experiment now on
this aspect of the body substitution so
if people really believe that this is
their body if somebody threads that body
they should have a realistic response ok
we're going to basically have two
conditions this person is embodied in to
this avatar when it's looking down sees
exactly the day avatar and we present
these two stimuli here and we miss your
ed oui Monsieur whether they move their
hand we asked them not to move the hand
we really want to see what happens in
the brain before any conscious decision
it's going on like deciding to move and
I have a little video here so you seem
okay so you see this is the first person
perspective the participant I look
around this in a different environment
wing is looking down his body or
everybody has changed for its it's been
changed and then we have these two
conditions
and we repeat them many times and see
what happens so what happens is we find
an activity in the motor cortex there is
a motor activation both in time and
frequency domains we're going to focus
on the readiness potential to start with
so there is a readiness potential
starting about 250 milliseconds after
day the best emule is presented I want
to explain you a bit more what is this
readiness potential this readiness
potential is the different cymbalta JH
between the two hemispheres of the motor
cortex and from Benjamin leave at the
studies on free will we know that this
potential happens for movement
preparations unconsciously before the
conscious urge to act so Benjamin finds
that we actually inhibit motor actions
rather than than create motor actions
and these are the typical responses of a
motor action that is being prepared ok
furthermore when we look only at the
contralateral hemisphere of the right
hand as you know if you move the right
hand you find the activity on the left
hemisphere and we find a new rhythm
desynchronization mill rhythm is between
10 and 12 Hertz is related with motor
action only in the hand condition after
1 minute 1 1 second after the stimuli
and here we can see the baseline versus
the response one second short time a
power spectrum we see clearly there is a
a motor a preparation here similar to
the motor imagery if you have worked
with the brain computer interfaces not
only that we find all these voltages are
correlated with the strength of the
ownership pollution so the more you feel
the illusion the stronger you react to
the to the attacks ok refer to this
paper for more details
and well we find that if we are really
in the virtual body when we attack it
the motor cortex prepares for a hand
movement and the level of ownership
modulates this activation not only that
there is a role of this year p
amplitudes on the pain perception i
haven't talked about pain perception but
you can check on on the paper if you're
more interested on that and basically we
can say that people are accepting these
beautiful bodies on a very unconscious
level not only this level they are
preparing like very realistic response
if somebody attacks me I would like to
move out from there okay so let's move
to the next experiment in which we know
the body has been accepted and we know
we can move it so how does this control
really happen and what if we generate
external errors so when we execute and
motor action normally we experience a
certainty about the ownership of the
body and the agency of the actions if I
move this hand I know this hand is mine
and the action of moving the hand is
mine however when there is conflicted
information we undergo a break on agency
this is something that rarely happens to
healthy humans but existing pathologies
such as the anarchic hunt syndrome where
people can not inhibit certain motor
action so one hand it can possibly go
somewhere you don't want it so probably
due to a disconnection within the
contralateral amis fear on the frontal
lobe but we don't want to enter that
much into here we want to create any
scenario where they are motor errors so
we create this rapid decision-making
task which is an Eric same flanker task
this flanker task you have to follow
what they are all says they will arrow
in the middle and there can be
distracted arrows pointing in the other
day
excellent to kind of make it more
complicated or in the correct direction
so let's watch a video well
interestingly when you're doing this
experiment of course people go very fast
and they make their own errors so
self-generated errors I had to go there
but I went in the other direction but in
Burton environments we can also generate
external errors in which the participant
did go in the right direction but the
avatar went in the opposite direction so
let's have a look at how this task
really works the participant is here his
body is substitute and the hand is
tracked again with inverse kinematics so
the task is going to start ok you miss
this one ok brong so actually when you
observe it is you also generate this
similar response yes by observing
somebody making mistakes and there it
went one of these externally generated
errors we will see another one I'll let
you know when it happens so every 20
trials we introduce an externally
generated error in which the avatar
you'll see will go to this side and they
sorry the person will go to this side
and the Avatar to the other side and
you'll see it here now ok so we can see
we have these a these two conditions
really congruent movements incongruent
movements and we asked participants to
go 100 1280 trials which is like 15
minutes of this task and what we find is
that when people make their own mistake
like they are robust pointing here I'm
going in the other direction there is no
error related negativity happening 100
milliseconds after the motor action
starts only for the real self generated
error and this doesn't happen with the
externally generated there are nor the
co
responses hey you see both are very
similar but here in the posterior
electrode we find that for the
externally generated errors there is a
strong negativity that happens much
later about the 400 milliseconds so here
we can see more clear without this is
the difference why waveform minus the
correct so it's real air or minus the
correct and external errors minor the
color you can clearly see one is
fronting the other is parietal also
temporarily they have done different
spans and let's look at the these two
errors so this error is well described
in the literature is called every lady
negativity is maximal at the frontal
electrodes and this other one we call it
m 400 and it only happens when they
there is an agency disruption and when
we look at the literature we find
similar errors for semantic violations
if I say I was going to eat a house
you're going to have an m4 hundred but
if i say i'm gonna eat a pizza it
doesn't sound so strong so we believe
that there is a semantic violation of
how you perceive the world you've really
thought the hand should be there and
it's going the other direction so both
components are associated to different
error monitoring loops and I don't want
to enter too much in the neurocognitive
models of error monitoring but I want to
just show you let's go very quickly
through these basically when you have a
motor action you create a motor command
and you execute the movement so in our
brain what's happening is we we have
several controls to see whether the
movement was the one that I wanted to to
execute so I create a copy of this
efferent movement and I compare it to my
original state like where was I supposed
to go and if there is an error here I
find this error related activity okay
this is the one they are always pointing
here and I'm going the other direction
so but our brain has a second mechanism
which is once I've produced a movement I
get my sensory input so this is an
afferent feedback and I compare it to
this copy that I had and they intended
the state and if there is an error here
we'll find it this n 400 these models
are from Gallagher and Fritz so there
are these two error may monitoring
mechanisms happening concurrently and
just to finalise with this experiment i
want to show you that this n400 strength
so the more negative them is stronger
they then the agency disruption is
correlated with the sense of ownership
of the virile body the more you feel yo
this is your beautiful body the stronger
the break on the agency is ok so just
want to say that we find two different
kinds of errors is different you the
brain recognize the internal errors and
externally generated errors as different
so if somebody hijacks my robot I'm
gonna notice it and we find that as an
agency violation trace in this and 400
we find a correlation associated with
the illusion of ownership and we also
support these theories of error
monitoring models because they have been
proof but it's been very hard for them
to prove actually this specific error
loop external air or loop because in
reality is very hard to actually produce
that sensation that you go in one
direction but the hand goes in the other
one which in a Burton environment we can
do okay so let's move to the last
experiment here
so we've seen the body can be accepted
unconsciously that we can control it and
if there is a break we break the agency
over dead bodies so we lose this
ownership Aleutian kind of and what if
it looks like me so we run an experiment
because there is some research here
before us that about this how people can
be induced in ownership illusions on
avatars of different races genders that
share more or less similarities with the
participant and some studied says that
the stronger the more the avatar looks
like the participant there is a stronger
identification but we want to find
whether this is perceived also on the
neurological side so we prepare an
experiment where we bring participants
and we create an avatar that looks like
them like an unknown person and like a
friend okay we use the face yen software
for that so each of the participant is
observing the images randomly during 30
minutes and its face is shown for 300
milliseconds so this is super fast and
we do subjective scoring how much this
avatar looks like the real person okay
so what we find is that well this is the
visual cortex is over here on the back
of our head and we find the traces of
object recognition okay usually when
they object is classify as a different
category we find a difference in the
n170 so this is this object is different
than that object so this is 170
milliseconds after the stimulus so it's
super fast and we don't find differences
here so they are same class objects but
we do find differences p200 altered
referees and to hundra
50m here is when we first access the
memory and we see that the self is
process with much less power in sorry
voltage than the other images both for
the real faces and for the bear doll
faces so that means somehow this beetle
face that looks like you and this is
significant difference this better face
that looks like you is actually been
accepted or or process in a different
way than the other faces not only that
we find a correlation between the
subjective and the unconscious
identification by unconscious I mean
this rapid 200 milliseconds the brain is
already making a distinction and the
subjective is the questioner like how
much this face looks like you for the
self faces we find that this p200
difference between the real face and the
virtual face of the self so the closer
to zero the better it means you are
processing them exactly the same the
difference is zero and the higher the
score so actually there is a correlation
in the way we are combining a higher
cognitive function with a very low a
like voltage result okay so here this is
very interesting and basically we find
that of course if the avatar looks like
you do you can be more identified with
it but not only that also at the
neurological level so they can recognize
a las a look-alike avatar the
correlation between the first
recognition mechanisms and the
subjective scoring and of course this
has many applications because maybe this
way we can introduce a stronger
self-identification towards avatars for
behavioral studies or maybe even measure
the identification on look-alike avatars
because well this looks like him to a
degree but maybe we could generate a
better auditor and then we generate
better we could
the uncanny valley and okay so basically
we have seen that we can use immersive
virtual reality to study the aspects of
our alter the behavior and perception to
embody people into robots or avatars and
also in the last part to study the
mechanisms involved in this body good
representation in the brain okay and
well I after all these empirical studies
show in many ways in which we can use
the immersive virtual reality to alter
human perception and behavior I really
want to end this talk going back to the
bigger picture so up until now consumers
have interacted with many different
technologies from a first-person
perspective I hand I have the phone I
can move it I can touch it I can see but
the content has remained constrained
inside the device most of the cases of
course there have been a metaphors of
tangible interfaces some very great but
the reality is that those initiatives
have no reached the market in a
standardized way but I think this is
about to change because lately we've
seen all these boom on immersive
technologies HMDs that are aiming to
consumers at consumers oculus Samsung VR
hollow lens and these technologies have
the potential to blend the digital
content and the real physical world
which will allow us to interact with the
content from a first-person perspective
not only with the device okay for me
that means two things the first one is
that we have to create a technology that
can provide the highest quality of
experience for the user so they can be
able to literally feel the digital
content with their senses from a
first-person perspective and do so
through natural interactions we will
need a much higher degree of ambient
intelligence of course better tracking
systems tangible metaphors haptic
displays etc all of them working
together in real time but
the other thing that this means to me is
that we must be aware than in a fully
blended reality where digital content is
blended with physical content the way
these things are going to be processing
the brain as real physical content may
affect how people behave or perceive
their reality okay so well for me there
is no now that MSR with so many experts
in different disciplines is the perfect
platform to really shake the future of
immersive technologies and well that's
it thank you so you should that people
really know if it's not correctly people
fear that what they do in the virtual is
actually doing it and experiencing so
obviously one of the first uses of these
tutorial be games so what would you say
that if if a person playing a shooting
game immersive shooting game does he
feel the same experience as if he shy
person well I I think it's more close to
reality than on a screen as we were
saying just now the content it's a you
can feel the content or you can just see
the content inside a device and that
makes a difference and we've seen that
for example if i see i clicked on my on
my screen i'm not going to have a heart
rate increase but people do when they
are actually inside a barrel clip so at
least in the short term we will find the
physiological responses we will find
behavioral changes I'm percept one
changes maybe people get used to it and
it's it's kind of related to me with
some people suffering hallucinations so
real people suffer Allison nations all
the time I have the feeling that my
phone is vibrating but it's not and I
really have that feeling it's a
bottom-up coming from the sensory input
but when I
is not and I'm able to distinguish
what's an elucidation from what's not
but for example people with the
schizophrenia some of them they are not
able of making us this fiction so maybe
in the future basically we're able of
distinguishing what spiritual from
what's real but we have to make the
conscious thought about it because our
brain is actually thinking the sensory
input is saying me this so must be real
and I think it's very similar to an
elucidation in a sense and so I do think
people will make the difference between
three alem beard one of course but the
this testimony are going to be physical
like a physical object so people will
just perceive them as real things yeah
sorry you mentioned nearness combated
the m's example of when world world's on
radio you people really thought that
alien segmented and part that was
because radio was indifferent you people
hadn't activated to what might be true
or not true there and imitated a news
report mm-hmm so I'm wondering is there
any way to control for the novelty of
the experience because people don't
haven't yet figured out how to separate
this from reality yeah so um I think the
answer is not really in fact when you do
give the oculus or one of these devices
to a first person who first enter they
either get super sick because of the non
good multi sensor in the Grace and the
vestibular because we are not
stimulating all the sensors and or they
are just like wow you know it blows your
mind when I enter to that experiment or
to dad this I signed guides right you
know so I really think it's a matter of
time so the first time you try it it's
you know like the first time you got a
phone you just don't remember because
technology goes so fast it changed so
fast but the first time you do
technology of course it has a different
impact on you well I mean that my view
but I would say so i would say the first
time it's going to be a stronger than
than others poachers yes related
questions on your first experiment you
had kind of the knife up here and the
table cutting the hand mm-hmm um you did
that 60 times I think did you see a
difference in people's response over the
60 trials especially in like did there
well there-there's psychosomatic
responsive decrease today also like you
and did other things change academics
narrator question yes they do decrease
but we don't have enough trials to
really do very different averages the
same happens with the faces the more
time you're supposed the more do you see
that avatar look like you for the people
that have say that the avatar looks like
them and the list for the people let's
say the avatar didn't look like them so
you either reject or accept and you get
a costume yeah there is a time
approximation noise would you say that a
virtual experience become less immersive
over time as they don't compute with our
other senses no I I would say it's more
about the surprise effect like the first
time you get a tweet like what I don't
know and then when you have so many of
them do just don't have the surprise or
am I think the surprise effect is very
important don't hurry aware of any
research that compares the surprise
effect like somebody watching a horror
movie will jump when something bad
happens on the screen compare that to
the virtual reality yes similar to kind
of jump scare experience I having them
that myself by the colleague from UCL
Sylvia pants he was running an
experiment on moral dilemmas and
basically this was a museum the avatars
were like not not really human looking
just like drawers and one of the
auditors would enter and there was this
elevator you were manipulate
in the elevator so that was your task
and with the elevator you move people to
the second floor of the museum or to the
first floor and all of a sudden one of
the party of one of their little avatars
start shooting and you have to move the
elevator you know either you decide to
kill the four or if done if you don't do
anything you kill the four if you move
the elevator down you kill the one but
then is your action you have decided to
kill that one versus the other thing is
so there is a moral dilemma there I
don't want to enter into this but see
Rhonda the experiment in a cave and in a
desktop and she found is very strong
differences in physiological response so
when people really feel they are in the
place and this is everything we find
like in the Milgram experiment here we
find that the more plausible the
situation the more present solution the
stronger they are their responses and
some people have a stronger illusions
and I think over time for example if i
enter a new scenario i immediately have
a very strong illusion after having been
to many scenarios I know what it is not
real or anything but every time I put
myself into a new body it's like wow I
love it and some people are just like
you know I think these grows on you but
it doesn't happen when you are on a
screen so there is a difference or
stimuli very good- yeah I so bad I no
wonder holders of you lie so in general
is very difficult to measure how
embodied you are until you break the
embodiment or how much agency you have
until you break the agency or so this
it's funny because it comes from the
rubber hand illusion so this is like
NATO 1998 already and they are using a
harm they are attacking the hand to
measure the response a name so it's
pretty consistent over the research in
perception that you attack something we
done some workshops in the laboratory to
think of new ways not having these bad
negative impulse but really it's very
hard for example there were some
experiments in which they both we would
do a beep and then they would have to
read like how much and body they thought
they were and then you would do the
average over time but it's much faster
if you show a thread and you see what
happens like then you really see whether
they were embodied or not so but on the
other hand you break the illusion so you
cannot continue the experiment so well
sometimes this is has a balance no sorry
that just sounds like fresh reality then
there's only going to be used test
convince me that bad things are
happening no no nobody actually very
nice things happening birth or reality i
would say no it's nice because you enter
a new space you can visit you know you
may be running with leon and messy on
the new football camp but the truth is
for us to measure this kind of illusions
is sometimes very hard so that's why a
some other experiments don't you say
harm they use propia safety thrift for
example for the thresholds these things
of how fat you are how long your armies
you don't really need to thread their
hand you just say like where is your
hand and then your hand is farther away
you know there is a bit of everything in
my experiment I like this because it's
super instant on your system only and I
need that for the ad because i'm talking
about milliseconds this thread um wonder
if they're so wait you only the EEG
signals will have different some people
i'll feel happy or your fears have only
film i think that could be but because
but that would be like general- state
and because we are a other aging just
the stimulus related component
so we just focus on the stimulus related
information at the end you average that
out the same as you average the noise
out or I mean there are many things you
cannot miss your with eg really and I
I'm very accepting all about the people
that use when electro-land they say
they're measuring emotions like there
are so simple with one electrons you can
measure them and I'm so yeah I don't
think you can even measure that here I
have a question the question was do you
have any comments on the impact on some
gamers that the first person mode of the
gt5 and if you could feel uneasy yeah I
noticed you have a topic maybe we know
soon because there listen you today are
starting this amusement park with berto
reality and it looks very exciting to go
there and they are putting a shooting
game so maybe well you there is already
a problem in this country with that but
maybe we'll see it growing is it that
way so in juta yeah I don't know but if
you look you da a brutal reality
amusement park you'll find it it came
out last month they they are building it
and it looks really cool and really
sorry so many hands hey yeah so besides
gives what do you think that virtual
reality feels like for example I can
learning environment yeah I think any
environment really like a for example
here I didn't show now I work for Airbus
and we're doing research on how to use
this technology for a training scenarios
and there are many interesting things
like many of the jig's that we use for a
assembling they are super expensive so
if you have to Train somebody and render
space out while this is not being
productive so if you can generate a 3d
version of that and then you can really
work on that
without having the physical object in
front of you and so for learning I think
it has really stronger applications okay
so you did some experiments on having
people in bodies that didn't quite look
like their own did you do anything with
same embodiment for non-human bodies
like if you had a yeah robot hander and
tens of dollars so a we did the robot
embodiment and that worked pretty well
so it's crazy how the brain accept and
how flexible the brain is into accepting
modifications and well you have here
jaron lanier in this building who is
very much into these things and I think
you accept a very strong changes like
for example having a different body or
having three hands or like if it works
like you think it should work like if I
move this can and then the third hand or
something you know I mean for example
for digital acting I think if the actors
would have this in real time maybe they
do better like I'm embodied in a foreleg
whatever so they are better at acting
because right now there's is so abstract
for them they are just doing the motion
capture and in my in their scene okay
yeah this moves like these of course and
then I do this and all the hands go you
know like a waiver okay how much do you
think that virtual reality will have an
effect on like a person's personality
and behavior because I know that like I
read something somewhere that people who
watch more violence in the media are
more accepting of violence and they
actually become more violent themselves
yeah and so if you know virtual this
virtual reality is like more exposure to
this will that have a higher impact on
students yeah for they without further
back for example man is running now with
the
Justice Department in Spain we have a
violence in the homes you know male
abusers a scenario and the European
Union is strongly pushing into working
for that and we gotta grind on there and
we have found that they are currently by
owning offenders are being sent into the
brutal reality with mel's later and and
they are having an effect I mean to
distended you can do because they are
not exposed continuously it's a one-off
but the judge is sending them to hear it
it's sort of a another therapy method
you have role-playing you have maybe
this scenario in this scenario the
violent offender seats on the victim
place so it's like a role playing and
then he watch this because it's not
really violent it's maybe verbal
violence many cases there are not that
many offenders that actually go all the
way maybe they're just being very very
bad people whatever you like controls on
this local population just come more
violent early sir I don't think there
will be I mean why I mean it's free will
kind of thing unless it's starting to
affect the rest of us for real in a very
dramatic way anything can happen but I i
don't know i mean i think it it could be
that some therapies really benefit from
this and they are already working on the
flight they fear no or a this kind of
scenarios because you take it out and
you're in real life so before you decide
to go on an airplane if your fear of
heights or peer to fly Oh other people
who are not affected by this same like
who clearly create separate virtual
reality reality sorry I don't carry my
arm is good yeah some people are some
people but we can see that I mean people
are affected to different levels that's
why we have these presents solution or
presents questionnaires that we ask for
this kind of things how realistic you
think it was and did you feel you were
in a different place this kind of
questions really let you know how much
somebody feels that but this also
happens for example with the rubber hand
illusion some people don't have it at
all so it really it's a matter of how
you perceive things your brain is some
other of your brain briam percentage er
no it's free low i would say it depends
some people need more time some people
you know they're like but i would say
about a five percent or something like
that and i won't second question so does
it affect my say it's in virtual reality
i crashed cars over them when i play
games we'll have you studied like
permanent brain effects to my behavior
and go for it i should really be more
prone to crashing well i guess i don't
know i mean this is a pretty unknown yet
but i would say it's like that Lucy
nation case i was mentioning before if
you know you're in the reality if you
lose your mind you know and we better
detected before you start rushing but
the yeah i would say that this a matter
of you having your mind able of
distinguishing what's real what's weird
on could you comment on the
disadvantages of the cave versus another
display being equal differences so I I
did the main difference is that in a
cave you're represented by your own body
and in an hmd your body can be
substitute and in fact well if you have
tried the oculus one of the things that
to me are strikingly bad is that I don't
have a body and in reality I have a body
and if not I'm just an observer so I I
think attendees need to have a body we
don't conceive life without the body
like what are we out of what illusions
are we ghosts are we know we need the
body to interact to do things otherwise
we don't have this real scenario and in
a cave there is a stronger illusion that
you enter something because you
physically enter but at the same time
you remain in the in the same place so
there are different connotations that I
would say we for example we used caves
very much for behavioral studies and not
so much for perception i would say
because in a cave do you really have
this very very big field of view for
example because you are actually inside
somewhere so if there are many avatars
and they are interacting with them for
example 80 Ribeira in du ciel he is
working with violence scenarios where
some people start a fight and they
you're looking at the bystander effect
if the there are many people around you
don't want to act but if you are the
only one there then you will intervene
and stop the fight and this is known in
a cave because I think it's better for
you to really have but I think at the
moment the head-mounted display really
has the same field of view and then we
are rubber case they're done both okay
nature yes measures a sense of presence
for example yeah what is that for
example day
a shameful and melts lab is he's worked
in name fear of heights in a cave and in
an AMD I don't think you really found
much difference because you say you have
a body in both the difference for
example is if you wouldn't have a body
but I I kind of like better day
attendees because they they give you
this chance to substitute your body also
your third experiment wasn't clear me
too when you have real faces in virtual
phases where they kept in separate
treatments of this is all real faces
that were either familiar and familiar
and these are all virtual relational
they would be a totally random all of
them but for analysis purpose and I put
in like this otherwise you could see
like many lines and not understand and
mom and so when you and the person to
the they're kind of avatar of themselves
was there a measurable difference
between that and the real photo of
himself I mean they were going to
measurably like identified as so whose
are still adults between the two of them
yes for some participants this was very
low difference for some it was higher
and that's say what we were saying here
that this difference exactly the one we
were talking about the voltage
difference between the Briton and my
real self was actually correlated with
the identification so the more i really
think that avatar face looks on me the
more my brain process it like me so be
interesting if there be any kind of
follow up on what aspects or differences
of the face map to correlate better to
identify himself like if you change the
ico for example of that easy doors and
change it it's okay yeah i think there
need to be a they would be very strange
changes because look this ammeter it's
not super perfect and it's already been
identified as the self so i'm not sure
if you would really see many differences
but if you have like a strong
differences maybe you will in fact some
experiments they actually fade from one
unknown person to your face without
avatars and they find the difference you
know when you start recognizing the self
or when you start recognizing the other
interesting to correlate with different
components so I know like all the eye
shape is more important than the job
yeah we're getting more commercial there
are some experiments in this field of
face perception in which for example
they move around apart like to lift eyes
or these kind of things and people are
still recognize themselves and so when
recognize the face sorry I'm okay yeah i
mean really internet and work good air
example here we gotta take their voices
I was going to eat a house uh and yeah
that's an error but it's an area you
might find in poetry and that it would
affect it maybe change the way you look
at the world something like that yeah
and I'm curious are people trying to
think through the the idiom of VR and
somebody might think of full house
doesn't correlate to eat and people are
people trying to create new experiences
for the sake of like expanding Valley
like creative experiences yeah resistors
well this is done on our daughter
auditory stimulation so there is no
better reality for this kind of
experiments and they were first found by
a researcher in the Netherlands and he
basically in the Netherlands I don't
remember now but the trains are just one
color like yellow and he would tell
people the train is blue and people
would have this response and when he
would say the train is yellow people
wouldn't have that response and then he
was like okay this is a violation on how
they understand the world and
so he continued working on this on this
area of research and the reason I showed
this here is really because it's it's in
the literature is very similar to what
we find is it doesn't mean that this is
virtual reality it's not but the naming
that because here you have perceptron
input so afferent signal that they needs
to be integrated and it gets integrated
here and it has the same temporal
dynamics as of the other afferent
signals which in our case is this one
and so it's really kind of matches so
this is our discussion of course when
you have EG they don't tell you anything
about the interpretation so you have to
look at the literature run and find out
what can it be or if other people have
found similar things but this is not
just about better reality this is about
you feeling that body as yours and
moving it and then the break on the
agency rather than just spirit or
reality so it's about your own body ok
oh my yeah want to thank you when
excellent oh ok thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
