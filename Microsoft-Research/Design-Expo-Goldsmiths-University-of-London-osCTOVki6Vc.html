you
we have Goldsmith's come on up from the
UK and they are going to be showing and
talking to you about the wire died hi
everyone I'm Sam I'm from New York and
my backgrounds in sociology and I'm Anu
and I am from India and I have a
background in new media and electronics
so we started our project off by
thinking about the different ways in
which we give away our personal data to
companies and services most of which are
online so whether it's through netflix
twitter spotify our main question we
were dealing with was where is our data
so where is the data that we're giving
away where is it going and then
eventually where is it stored so we were
interested in both if we could have
access to this information can we find
out where it's going and we also wanted
to keep in mind that it's not just an
individual issue but it's also one at a
governmental level as well so what are
the privacy policies of different
countries that are affecting how our
data is handled so we want to approach
our project by using design as a way to
engage and provoke people into these
issues and we looked into similar
projects within this domain that serves
examples of design which have looked
into these issues before so so on the
left you can see this project by James
bridle who is a writer and an artist and
this project is about how he distorted
google map images to comment on how we
use maps in a way straightforward way
and to the right you can see Thomas
Thwaites is nebo project which is this
all knowing god like device which
dictates how dictates what is being
recommended to us because it knows what
is good for us so and these are some
highlights from our research we spoke to
students at our university asking them
how they feel about companies and
organizations having access to their
data a lot of people expressed both
skepticism and frustration around this
lack of clarity and lack of consent in
how their data is being stored if it's
being stored and where and how and in
general there was
an emphasis on a desire for more
transparency in the process we also made
different probes this is an example in
the middle of an image probe we made to
try to get at this issue of the public
versus private divide what sorts of
areas do we want to leave off limits
what do we still feel as private and we
just want to get reactions from people
on that and then we also conducted
several interviews and one that really
stuck with us was with a designer named
Thomas Thwaites and we spoke with him a
lot about the important role that both
faith and superstition play in our
relationship to our data and how those
things affect both our behavior and our
beliefs around that so taking off from
what we interviewed with Thomas Thwaites
so what came out strongly was the fact
that was the fact that humans are
naturally irrational and then we have
very strong beliefs and superstitions
about systems that we don't entirely
understand and sometimes we lend these
ideas to objects such as art like act
like objects such as the nozzles that
you can see in the image to the left
which are which are devices which people
use to order your board of evil and we
were thinking how what would it be like
if you could actually use these charms
to protect your data and then going back
to this theme of transparency that
emerged as an exercise we looked at an
IP traceroute of where our data is going
when we request a certain website so in
this example we tried to we requested
facebook com from our servers at
Goldsmiths and then we were able to map
the different IP addresses we link them
through google maps and were able to
have that visual of where data was
really going right so at this point we
became more interested in where data is
stored and lessen the journey that it
was taking so we started investing our
time and trying to physicalize this
whole idea of how do you know where your
data is and how can we make these places
more visible and so where we wound up
was with the wire die which is this
object here that lets you that shows you
aerial images of data centers where your
data is going and it shows them to you
through a kaleidoscopic lens and we felt
that this was really important for two
different reasons one being that
the distorted imagery creates these
really beautiful intriguing visuals that
make you want to look and make you want
to find out what these are images of and
secondly the distortion was also a way
to comment on the blurry nature of ever
really knowing where your data is going
so it's posing the question can you ever
really know so let me unpack this a
little for you so what it essentially da
essentially does is that it takes an
individual browsing history from your
personal device and puts it into an IP
geolocation service which gets your gr
of geographical coordinates of that
particular IP address and then get the
satellite imagery for it and then which
is beamed into the LCD screen of the
wide eye and what you see is this
beautiful image of your data center and
these are just some images from the
process of making the final prototype on
the left these are just some technical
drawings but you can see that it was
really important for us to incorporate
the visual language of these charms like
the nads ours that are used to ward off
evil and also to create this optical
illusion when looking at the device from
the top and then this is just an image
of the cnc router we use to make the
object and the pieces of acrylic that
fit together to make it so we also
created an accompanying publication and
we selected 20 different data centers to
show the spread of where your data might
be around the world yeah and to find
these 20 data centers these are just the
steps we took with a particular website
you can then find the IP address using a
terminal in your computer and then with
that IP address you can put it into a
geolocation service which there are many
online websites and then through the
geographical coordinates that you get
from there you can use the service like
Google Maps to locate the aerial image
right so this is a sample view through
the publication it clearly shows you a
name of sample view through the wire I
and the data center that the
geographical location of it its address
along with the IP address of the service
that you're using to make that
relationship complete click here and
this is just a sample view that you may
see through the wire die in this example
it's the Equinix data center and dubai
and it's actually one of the data center
the Amazon users so this is a prototype
demo of how it feels to use the wired I
the experience of it and what you see is
this transitioning of images of date
different data centers which are similar
to the ones that we used in the book and
these are just some images from our
initial deployment of the object and it
was important for us we were curious to
see how it might fit into people's lives
where they might keep it in their homes
and the object lends itself to a more
personal individual experience but at
the same time that also invites people
to peer over other shoulders and they
were asking questions and wanted to know
more about what the what was going on
with the object and that was really nice
right so there were several challenges
that we encountered during the process
the first and the most important was how
do you confront such a complex topic
with a playful approach something that
we want to engage people and want people
talking about and the second was that we
had to acknowledge the technological
challenges and I'm actually knowing how
to find your where your data is and also
think about new directions in which we
can take this idea forward and the third
was the fact that if people do have
access to such a device will it
eventually change the relationship
between people and the companies that
they trust and just where we want to
take the project further in the future
is it's important for us to give it to
more people for longer periods of time
to get a better sense of how it might
fit into their lives would they use it
what sort of reactions would it would it
spark and that sort of thing and finally
it's also important for us to take the
object more exhibits and public spaces
to engage more people about these issues
we've been thinking about and with that
in mind we hopefully will see you later
at demo fest ya thang
excellent thank you guys all right looks
like Tom wants to dive in yeah so I mean
the idea this is really interesting to
me and it happens to coincide with my
own money one of my own interests I'm
glad to see it the design object itself
to me is feels incomplete and it's
because just picking it up to use it I
guess my question for you is how do I
know what I'm seeing without you
standing next to me to explain it or the
book there to explain it what is there
in the affordances of the design itself
to tell me what's going on so in within
the like the form of the device does not
necessarily speak about what you see in
it but then went but then the idea is to
is to have this object in somewhere
around your house where it actually
provokes some curiosity to actually peep
and look into it in this in a similar
fashion way if you see any kind of toy
and you immediately want to tinker
around with it and that was the
intention of having such a form itself
and then when you look into it and
that's when you know that there is
something as a connection to you what
you actually take your data itself yeah
I would just add to that that it it
isn't necessarily about providing
clarity as to what particular data
center you're looking at when you're
looking through the object but more to
get you thinking about on a larger scale
where your data is going and where are
these places around the world as opposed
to specific clarity with that data
center sure but I mean I guess just
thinking clearly about the phenomenology
of it right yeah when I look into that
and it's a gorgeous object i have to say
i could sit there play with it all day
long but I without the previous
explanation I don't know that i'm
looking at a data center so I don't know
that that's what it should provoke in my
thoughts right yeah
yeah so did this I've been thinking
about this project for two days now
because it it's interesting because it's
different than the other ones we've seen
and it illustrates something else about
where design fits in because it's really
provocative yeah I don't get part of it
and that's its beauty you've left me
thinking and I'm trying to think why are
you doing that and that notion the
design doesn't have to be functional
specifically but rather to be a catalyst
for thought yeah and and I just got to
tell you that you succeeded in that
regard and so the you know it's I could
questions about how you represent the
the place is you've already dressed the
other thing is that if there is time but
it won't do it is this notion about what
is the what thoughts you've had about
what you define place because when you
say where is the data center in what
calculus right the Cartesian I could be
where is it on the map versus where is
it legally or where is it ethically and
those are things with other notions but
again you don't maybe you don't even
have to answer that question because
it's your presentation forced me to
think about that in a way right and and
it's it's help service purpose but it's
just thank you thanks so building on
that comment this made me think about
the kaleidoscope as a way of looking at
the world differently and I was started
to think what would a kaleidoscope in
which you were looking at say war look
like or what what a kaleidoscope look
like unless what you were looking at
love relations look like you see you see
what I'm saying using the kaleidoscope
as a way of thinking thinking about
relationships and and data in a way that
you know and I think you could have a
lot of fun with it just playing with
that tool as a way of thinking about all
different data and meaning in our relay
life very very as built it very
provocative
in terms of thinking about data thank
you thank you all right anyone else have
any comments questions all right thank
you guys for the provoking thank you oh
and Toby yes otherwise one sorry yeah
Tom yeah
well thank you anyone else and I was
like Professor Toby carry Thunder it
soon there he is thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
