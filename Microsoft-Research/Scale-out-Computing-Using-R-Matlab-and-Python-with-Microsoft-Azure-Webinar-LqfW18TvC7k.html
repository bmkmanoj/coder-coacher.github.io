today's event entitled scale-out
computing using our MATLAB and Python
Microsoft Azure to learn more about the
ways you can participate in today's
event please click on the Q&amp;amp;A button in
the lower left-hand corner of your
screen if you have any difficulties
viewing the stream please refresh your
screen by pressing the control f5 on
your keyboard I would like to turn
today's event over to your presenter wen
Ming Yi senior research program manager
wen Ming you now have the floor Thank
You Stephanie
my name is wen Ming yi I am a senior
research program manager at Microsoft
Research and here at the bottom you will
you can find my Twitter alias if you'd
like to follow me and especially if you
have further questions after the web
webcast I'll be very happy to answer the
questions that you may have so today's
topic we is on scaling out on Windows
Azure so as many of you know that cloud
is scalable by design we have multiple
data centers and we have many many
millions of machines in each of these
data centers that are able to handle
workloads at the global scale and the
ability to use the cloud at a scale is
also a very desirable technical skill
these days many companies are looking
for developers and as well as users that
are able to take advantage of compute at
scale the second part of the webinar
here is to look at some of the options
for technical computing as scale on
Windows Azure or Microsoft Azure as we
have just renamed it some of these
options are for running executables that
you compile yourself and you optimize
and that also includes MATLAB R which
are very popular for
people who are doing technical computing
or machine learning or any type of
statistics work we also have Python
which is an open-source ecosystem it's
actually much more than just a
programming language now in fact Python
is actually happening in Montreal as we
speak so we'll look at some of these
options for scaling out those computer
goes beyond simply your desktop which is
where the value comes in for cloud
computing and finally we I would like to
introduce you to the Windows Azure for
research program that Microsoft Research
is running we have over a hundred
projects in progress right now we're
working with its various academic
institutions trying to really bring the
people together to innovate based on the
fact that we now have the ability to do
collaborative research in a common
platform which is Windows Azure so the
first thing I want to talk to you about
is the global footprint that we have so
if you look at some of the blue dots
here those are the data centers that we
have around the world we have data
centers in the US there are four of them
north north central south central east
and west we also have two data centers
in Europe and one in China and we just
opened up two in Japan as well and there
are there's another one in Hong Kong
which is relatively smaller and then we
have a very large data center in
Singapore that serves the that region of
the world some of these data centers as
you can see are extremely large and they
cover many football fields worth and
they are generally in the cost the cost
can range from hundreds of millions to
billions of dollars for these data's are
usually located very close to
electricity sources that are cheap
that also allows us to keep the cost
down and passed that savings on to our
customers which many of them are
internal such as Bing and Office 365
and many of other services that runs on
Windows Azure continuously and every day
the first item we want to discuss here
is the the paradigms or the various
offerings of cloud computing this is
important because these different
computing paradigm target different
users and this is something that is very
important when it comes to selecting
what you want to actually years is it's
very popular it's probably one of the
most popular cloud computing I would say
paradigm or platform so the idea is that
you simply the idea is that you simply
host a machine that is using using a
virtual of the virtual hard drive I just
saw a PowerPoint went out for a second
now we're back the the idea is that you
can take a virtual machine image and put
it in a cloud and you can also download
that if you need to use that on your
local machine so this is really targeted
towards IT administrators and sometimes
developers and users because you're
simply hosting a machine in the cloud
this is more or less a server that you
own and you administrate so there's
there's no additional things that you
will have to learn to be able to use it
very quickly but the problem was that
approach at scale is that you will have
to have a virtual hard drive attached to
each of the machines as you are
deploying them as you can see there's it
can become a fairly large task if you
started building a cluster using many
infrastructure as a service
servus virtual machines so you can
essentially go started to have a
hundreds of discs laying around they all
each have their own states
so the second paradigm here is the
platform of the service which is very
much what Microsoft has invented this is
what we initially started to use so the
idea is that you have stateless machines
meaning that you don't save anything to
your hard drive locally even though we
do have local hard drives and what's
really important here they do scale they
scale very well and ok and a lot of the
scalable services are built on top of
that platform the service we have
services that are running that can go
beyond thousands and even tens of
thousands of machines by just you know
simply clicking a button and deploy that
but unfortunately that's mostly
targeting developers so you have to go
into visual studio and run a lot of that
yourself so you have to build the
software yourself and a lot of the
software the service the systems are
built that way so you do need to
developers skills to be able to do this
the second part the third one is
software is a service which which is you
know very easy to use this is something
that someone has built for you or
developer has built for you and we have
an example of that it's mostly targeting
domain users so you're simply consuming
a service such as your email service
very simple simply put and what's
important here it's targeted towards
domain users for people who are not
developers who are not IT administrators
software the service is what you really
want to do here are some of the example
or clothes that really need a cluster to
be routed to be able to use one is one
of the most popular one is that digital
media rendering and encoding and it
turns out many of the supercomputing the
capacity today are actually used for
that
sergers of law CGI or computer-generated
images or animations that are done that
way and financial and risk calculations
those are also very popular that extends
to Windows Azure as well we have
financial companies that have hundreds
of thousands of course they use each day
to do risk calculations and finally
engineering and modeling and simulation
this is more traditional and HPC
application where it may require some
specialized hardware such as InfiniBand
which I'm very happy to report that
Windows Azure does now support
InfiniBand and high compute instances
and finally the computational life
science which I'm seeing a very large
growth in the u.s. especially the
funding agencies are starting to do
provide a lot more funds or areas having
a shift towards traditional science
towards computational life science which
demands a lot of computational power and
so let's take a look at some of the
different scale out scenarios or
applications that people have been using
so the first one is MPI so this is the
traditional HPC crowd essentially you're
running matrix solves at a large scale
solving OD ease solving PDEs those type
of applications requires InfiniBand or a
very very low latency and high bandwidth
interconnects so Windows Azure does have
that and you have to use Windows HPC
well look at those software options in
the second section of this webinar the
the second per the second scenario is
embarrassingly parallel applications
which are essentially each of the
compute units or each unit of work is
independent of each other and this is
very much suitable for the cloud because
cloud has hundreds of thousands or even
millions of commodity machines that you
can simply spin up and run applications
since they don't necessarily the generic
instances don't necessarily have
InfiniBand you can simply spend the
hundreds of them up and be able to scale
linearly so since they don't really have
to communicate with each other very much
so we'll show some examples of that as
we go and forward and also finally
there's this i/o intensive application
which are starting to become much more
popular
there's the MapReduce paradigm the idea
is that you take your computer where the
data is essentially a lot of these
compute nodes have a huge amount of disk
space and very fast access to the disks
and you're trying to build a virtual
file system on top of it such as the
HDFS and then it will do the
partitioning for you automatically so
and then you have a scheduler that sits
on top that knows where the data is on
each of the nodes and how they're
partitioned and would be able to
schedule to have that code run on that
machine so we're not going to cover that
because this is a different topic but
instead we're going to focus on compute
intensive applications that includes
many of the technical computing software
so I have a demo here which shows you
the windows that you're in action so
this is a piece of software that we've
written or a software service that we've
written that sits on top of the platform
as a service which I explained earlier
meaning that the VMS are all stateless
so you don't keep any states on the
virtual machines that allows you to
scale so when you first deploy these
applications to platform of the service
you would actually have a startup script
which copies the necessary software onto
each of the machines and
then you submit jobs to a global
scheduler and they're run in parallel so
here is a here is the simulation so one
of the really important thing about the
cloud it is extremely reliable and it
takes care of all the patching all the
other things for you so you don't have
to worry about it for example my service
here which originally was intended to
run for two days turns out it has been
running for two years because it's so
easy for a lot of us to be able to demo
as well as you know our some of our
attendees like for conferences like to
just simply check in and out so the
service has never been taken down if any
hardware has been broken it will be
swapped out for me automatically if the
operating system is out of date
it will be swapped out for me
automatically if there is any patches
that needs to happen it will do that
automatically and I don't have to worry
about any of that
I simply focus on showing the demo and
just you know having the service running
reliably so that is something that no
one else was able to have before cloud
was available so we've run 2300
simulations over the years and we're
simply running a very you know very
small sample and when you go to that URL
right now so it will take a few seconds
for me to switch over so and it's just
be patient and just watch the screen
change over and in meantime I will go
ahead and go to the website and start
that service hopefully everyone should
be able to see that website right now so
Dee the website is done in such a way
that we have some web front-end so you
have a web front-end we also have some
back-end that does the actual
computation so so the website should
show up on your screen right now so I
have a cab
here which shows all the simulations
that has been run in the past and you
would be able to look at the simulations
that has run we also have that's
interesting it looks like I have lost
some connectivity here and what I will
do is I will go ahead and show you show
you how windows azure works and and look
at some of the different heat maps so
right now the website is is running on
Windows Azure and let me show you where
the cloud services so this is the
Windows Azure portal which is the back
end of this particular service so if I
click on the if I click on the service
it looks like the service has actually
stopped for some reason I can go ahead
and start that start that again looks
like there has been done by mistake
so the idea is that we have the
dashboard which allows you to look at
what the cloud service looks like so I
actually went ahead and started the
service again so the configuration and
there's configuration monitoring and
scale so if I look at a scale you would
be able to see that you can move a
slider and increase the number of
instances that you can have so for this
particular service I have three
different type of instances as you can
see there is an instance count of four
this is the actual compute services so
the compute services does the heavy
lifting it does the actual web forecast
for you and the and then there is a web
instances as you can see there's a web
instances which is the front end so I
have two of them to allow the ski
allowed the SLA to be to be really good
at 99.95%
it doesn't really help if you turn off
the service so
emotionally redeploying it again but as
you can see there's two of them up front
and we also have some head node we also
have the head node that's running here
one of the hopefully it will take a few
minutes for it to actually deploy if I
haven't stopped so so what we will do is
we'll kind of go back to look at the
looking at the slide and it will come
back to it so see if it actually deploys
for us properly
the other interesting thing here is that
I have a heat map it which shows the CPU
so at running at 99.9% which simply says
that the service has four jobs currently
that are currently running so we will
have this deployed again and show it to
you in a bit
so I'm gonna go back to the slides and
perhaps perhaps we will be able to see
some of the slides that I have recorded
earlier so that you have a few of what
it looks like and once it's up again
we'll take a look at it again so we're
back to the slides yeah great thank you
go back to the site so here's what it
actually looks like there's the website
and there's the the services that are
running so on the left hand side it
shows all the simulations that has run
over the last two years and if I didn't
accidentally just turn it off today it
would have been running for exactly two
and a two years and three months for a
while and the second pieces are showing
you the Bing Map overlay of the actual
forecast each of these forecasts run for
about eight hours and once people have
submitted them they will be queued up
and run in the backend let's take a look
at the architecture a real quick so as
you can see there's a front end which is
just simply a website I hope that are
running and then the back end we have
some compute our worker nodes that are
running running the actual simulations
so the jobs are submitted through the
forecast front end and then there's
submitted they're run by each of the
compute nodes and they're usually
on-demand and I can scale them up and
down by simply moving a slider and then
this there are almost I think 50 million
objects that are currently stored in the
azure blob storage and that includes the
images that are overlays and so also
some of the log files and as well as the
simulation results data that are post
processed for this so the important
aspect of this is that we built
something that is that is using a
platform of the service which I simply
deploy a package on through hundreds of
machines and without having to worry
about without have to worry about the
you know actual saving things to the
disk if I let's just say I just turn it
off right so if I want to turn it back
on again it will be exactly where it was
so just to give people a progress we're
actually deploying it's copying all the
files as we speak the second interesting
thing is that you can take a monitoring
tools which allows you to see whether
your CPUs are running so it put this
particular instance there are twelve
cores running and you can have you're
seeing that 98% CPU utilization that
simply means that you have all the
instances running at full capacity and
you can simply as I said move a slider
for the extra large instances to be able
to run the compute so we also have Auto
scale so if there is a lot more demand
coming in if you allow that to happen it
will Auto scale to multiple core many
more cores if needed so here are
instances I showed you earlier we have a
head node which has two instance has two
instances and we also have a front end
which I have two web frontend for people
to be able to hit against in a ROM robin
fashion and then also of course we have
in the backend we have a compute service
here is actually a heat map of 96 cores
running this is a essentially eight jobs
that are actually twelve jobs that are
running so you're running a simultaneous
simulations on twelve cities as we speak
and
what the portal looks like which I would
have showed you alive right so there's
the many cities that you're running
simulations on they will show you the
progress that they're updating once
every minute or two and then this is the
actual processing steps so wrf by itself
which is the simulation code that
happens has to go through a workflow
which does all the post-processing and
pre processing for it to happen so in
the real world there's really no easy
embarrassingly parallel application a
lot of times they involve
post-processing and pre-processing that
actually happens so what a why cloud
computing you know that's actually a
really good question I love many people
that ask me I have you know concluded
that the abstraction for hardware and IT
infrastructure is probably the number
one reason you would not you want to do
cloud computing so for example I have
three large Cray desktop that's site
machines which has 128 a cores total so
I really use those machines anymore
because the fact that I can simply go to
the Windows Azure portal click on a
button deploy a cluster and it's running
so if you were to do that yourself you
have to firstly install the operating
system you have to tune it you have to
make sure everything is working you have
to install each of the machines and then
you have to install the software and
that's really a one week process if you
want to deploy any type of applications
and centralized computing and data
storage so the idea is that if you have
all the compute and data store in
central location you suddenly have the
ability to give access to your
collaborators which is extremely
convenient for any type of
collaborations you want to do
and finally the always-on feature is
really important the fact that your
services always can be running unless
you turn it off of course the they will
be they will be guaranteed
to work essentially the downtown equals
about maybe two or three hours per year
so the second piece I want to look at is
the technical computing options which
are very important to many of our users
here one is that if you want to build
something scalable what are the things
that you will have to do right so Visual
Studio and Azure SDK which you can use
to build pretty much any type of
scientific applications or business
applications you like so the way of
dword and what work is that you go to
Visual Studio you say file new project
you can add the type of roles you want
so it could be a web role as your front
end and then worker roles that are
sitting in the back end and then inside
the worker roles they can call Python
MATLAB or are through a system process
essentially you're doing P invoke and to
run these for these executables this is
very easy to do and for most developers
they have no trouble but if in order to
make something that is reliable and
robust and has the web interface it
takes maybe days or even weeks worth of
work so there's a project that I
recently started to build which would be
available to many of you and if you are
part of Asherah for research program we
will even help you to use it but we're
also trying to make up the community so
that I'm looking for people who would
like to test it so the idea is that for
researchers they're not developers they
don't necessarily want to write code or
you know spam they don't necessarily
even have the time to be by the right
code form in a month or maybe even weeks
so I think week what we can do is we can
actually consolidate a lot of the work
that has been previously done so I built
the simulation runner so you can simply
go to a web page put your input file in
a drop box and run a parametric sweep
application which is very much suitable
for the cloud
and we will pre install things like
MATLAB R or Python so and we have give
you options of selecting different ones
so it gives you the flexibility of not
having to learn a new system as well as
the ability to scale out your
computation at a very clean way or very
good practice using this piece of
software which it will have some demos
later in the process so the second part
of this the third option is Windows HPC
server so we actually have a commercial
product which is called the HPC pack
which you can install on Windows Server
so it's a very nice piece of software
but it's almost running like running a
slurm or or load leveler or any of those
job scheduling tools or running your own
server farm that requires you to know
Windows Server sysadmin this admin
knowledge so you have to be able to run
a cluster and I'd have to understand
domain controllers and a lot of these at
Windows server administration it's not
difficult but it's not necessarily
something that one researcher would want
to do which is to do administration and
all that and the other interesting thing
you can do with Windows HPC server first
is that you can install the MATLAB
compute server a computer compute test
cluster server so the way it would work
which I saw a question in the audience's
the you would connect they will you
install the software on Windows HPC
server and the individual nodes would do
a dial in or call in into the MATLAB
license server on the Internet and we'll
have some screenshots of that in a later
later part of this and the second part
the third part is the actually the
fourth one is the Linux cluster so this
is IaaS so the idea
sorry I got disconnected just for just
one second I apologize so we were just
talking about Linux clusters so the idea
that Linux clusters would work is that
you can simply deploy a Linux cluster
however you like these could be images
that we create for you or these could be
images that you have yourself or you can
simply you know build them one by one so
you can do them by hand or you can
deploy them through a script so I
actually do have a demo of that and you
can find that in a hands-on lab of the
Windows Azure training training site and
the idea is that you would be able to
run all that through a script create a
cluster but you will have to do
administration on your own Linux
clusters and currently we only support
Linux as an IAS option which means all
these Linux machines that you created
will have to attach have an attached to
disks to DOM and finally the we have
support for multiple languages so that
includes Fortran and nodejs net Java PHP
so all these languages are supported so
pretty much anything that runs on
Windows is supported so the other thing
I want to do here is to actually look at
the generic implementation of a scalable
solution so which is the simulation
runner so many of you would probably be
using it for some of your work
especially for the azure for research
program so while we're at this maybe
so I am loading the desktop as we speak
it will take probably just a few minutes
ah great so as you saw at the very
beginning of the presentation I
accidentally turned off a cloud service
which has probably a hundred cores
deployed and as we are simply speaking I
just had to press a button and redeploy
it and it's all up and running as we
speak
so there's absolutely this is absolutely
or the best platform you could possibly
have when it comes to running compute
and think about the complexity of this
if I were to do that myself right so if
I accidentally did something to a
cluster that I've built and now I would
actually have to do all kinds of
troubleshooting and instead what I have
done is that I've been talking to you
through the slides and the windows azure
has been doing work in the back end for
me so so the service is backed up and
you can see in the gallery it shows the
simulations that are has been run in the
past
you can also look at the processing
queues you can see that some of them are
being downloaded some of their being
computed so this is a live service that
everyone has access to so it really
shows you the power of software as a
service and I can submit it's submit a
computation if I need to so I can simply
go to perhaps let's just say we'll pick
San Diego here oh how about some
somewhere warm
would just put somewhere warm here we'll
just put somewhere or I want to have
vacation there you go so yeah I can go
ahead and save that in eight hours it
will have a simulation done for me so
this is the power of software service so
that brings us to talk about the
simulation Runner the simulation Runner
is a work in progress but it has gotten
to a point where it's stable enough that
I'm ready to look for
some testers if you're part of the
Windows Azure program and you're also
welcome to use it in the next two weeks
once we have it once we make it public
so here's something interesting here
which is the simulation Runner allows
you to simply go deploy a cluster by
setting the sum of the environment
environmental settings so the way we've
envisioned it is to allow you to go to a
web page and simply say here's my
Windows Azure credential and I want to
go ahead and deploy a cluster with any
of these installed so what I have
included here is the canopy Python just
a generic Python canopy is something
that is done by a company called
in thought so it's a 64 bit version so
includes all the machine learning
packages all the computational
scientific computational packages that's
there and there's a another company
called continuum which includes the
Anaconda software at so that also
includes many of the software that you
want up suffer packages that you want so
you can simply click these packages and
say save and it will deploy them onto
your cluster and we also included MATLAB
runtime from 8.1 I'm sorry 8.0 through
8.2 as well as R so this once you have
deployed it you're going to see that
you're gonna have a little cluster and
you can also scale so this particular
setup has the ability to scale to as
large as of your account is I can
currently have nine nodes running you
can scale to 100 or even 320 which is
the limit of this a particular account
if you want so you can also when you
deploy you can also choose between small
instances which have one core as well as
two up to eight core instances which
which is extra large so you will have to
make sure that your application scales
at a thread level if you do use
large course and we will allow you to do
core based scheduling as well later
so let's actually look at some of these
uh code that I run earlier as you can
see I'm doing some testing on the system
here so this is actually a blast run so
to many of you know that blast is a
genomics code which which allows you to
search for certain features through a
database right so it has a 4 gigabyte
database that you have to download and
it has an executable that you're on and
then the results are simply the results
that you're gonna see if there is a
match or not so it clicks through thee
matches and you will see that in this
particular one there are some matches
that actually occurred in the sequence
that you gave you gave to the program
which is blast X that you run so before
to submit a job it's actually pretty
simple as well so here you can select
from local files and you can select them
from Dropbox this is actually a feature
that people ask me because people don't
want to deal with lots of files if I
have a package that has let's just say
15 files it's just a directory
executables and support files you can
simply put them in a Dropbox and it will
pick it up and put them in each of the
nodes to run you can also pick them up
from Azure blob storage you can upload
them locally which has to be a zip file
and then you can run your parameter
sweep application and just simply submit
the job or save it so you can't also
resubmit jobs if they fail right so
here's a job that I see that ran very
well I can simply click on resubmit and
it has all the different options as well
as you know things that has been filled
out for you
so apparently this is actually from
Dropbox you can see the structure it
read from the Dropbox and allows you to
be reviewed of running here so that's a
demo of this piece of software if you
would like to try it out or use it
please do drop me a line or you know you
sent me an Ewald shoot the email to
email to me or tweet me so either way it
would be great so we would love to get
your
get your ideas or any new ideas that we
can we can do it will also make it open
source so that you can use it yourself
the nice thing about it is that it's
simple and it uses platform this as a
service at scale which means you don't
have to write any software to be run
your scientific code so we support our
Python MATLAB any executables that you
want to do a PowerShell even you know
Ruby if you wanted to run that so let me
switch back to the presentation again so
as we're waiting for the presentation to
show up here again there you go
so the nice thing about the simulation
Runner is that I will be able to help
you with a lot of it if you and also I
would be able to add features if you
would like to have that so just a quick
review of what it looks like so this is
the Dropbox used to play take all your
stuff into Dropbox and it will be picked
up and it will just run whatever you
specify in the simulation Runner so as
you can see that these are the what it
looks like
I'm secreting a Linux cluster so this is
something that you can find on the Azure
training training content which is
listed at the back of this presentation
the resource section the virtual
machines for Windows Azure that support
Linux we have different flavors of Linux
and they're always updated our partners
are very keen on working with us to make
sure that they're up to date there's any
security problems they have it'll be
fixed it will be patched so these are
all supported distributions you can also
upload your own so you can create a VHD
and upload that to be used on Windows
Azure there are tools that allows you to
convert VMware images onto VHD and then
you can upload them onto Windows Azure
so it's pretty straightforward
and as I was telling you guys earlier I
have scripts that can deploy clusters of
them
so it's simply using the Python SDK to
spin up instances so in this particular
example here is that if you go to the
training kit it goes through step by
step shows you exactly how to deploy it
so I'm simply using the ipython notebook
which connects to the I pee can i pee
engine or the ipython compute engine in
the backend and have a small cluster to
be to run a Monte Carlo simulation so
there are many ways for you to run
embarrassingly parallel applications and
we also support multiple platforms the
only downside to linux cluster is that
you have to roll your own and you'd
probably have to secure them yourself
and the other important thing about it
is that they have to each carry a disk
so if you have 25 machines you have 25
disks that are sitting near a blob
storage and you probably have to
maintain but if you just use a script to
deploy them you may simply say ok I
don't really care about these disks I'll
destroy them and I will
you know redeploy them again but they
have to have the disks when you deploy
them but it's certainly an option if you
have to have Linux be able to use Linux
so here are some other infrared links to
how to use Windows Azure command-line
tools
so there's command-line tools that
allows you to copy files deploy VMs look
at your subscription automate a lot of
the creation processes this is where you
want to go so go to the Windows Azure
comm and search for CLI tools so the CEO
i2 is written in no js' and it's usable
on all platforms so another option I
want to talk to you about is Windows HPC
server so Windows HPC server is really
about IAS which requires administration
so the idea is that you create a head
node in the cloud by your system admin
so he'll create an ad create all these
different things it takes maybe 2 or 3
hours which to do so for
the sufferers service options you simply
deploy it and you don't have to worry
about it but here you're actually
installing a server you have to learn
how to do administration on Windows
Server which is really fun it's
definitely worth doing once at least in
your lifetime and drone how it works but
probably not for a researcher that would
want to administrate a large windows
cluster and then the stateless nodes
those compute nodes are platforming
services that allows you people to scale
so it is an option for people who want
to be able to do who have you know some
sysadmin knowledge but want a very
robust solution that is supported by
Microsoft to be able to run
embarrassingly parallel applications so
we do have commercial customers that use
this but they do have sis admins that
takes care of their cluster here are
some that's the animation and here's an
animation of how it works
so the Windows HPC server you can also
take that head node and leave it on
premise so you can do that as well it's
very flexible but it's the same problem
you have to know how to do
administration on a Windows Server then
there's you you are allowed to add notes
that are local machines so for example
there's actually companies that run this
on on their desktops and the you can
also add Windows servers which support
Symphony band and then you can add
Windows Azure notes and so this is the
platform as-a-service nodes that you can
add to it we also support HPC SKUs now
so this has to be done through the HPC
server we support 120 gigabytes of RAM
QDR
which is 40 Giga bps InfiniBand so this
is my understanding it's only available
in the Amsterdam data center and I think
it's becoming available in the Chicago
data center as well
we have probably thousands of these
machines that you would be able to
access and run real HPC applications if
you're needed to so it supports MPI
supports all the things that you will
need for a complex schedule
so if you want to do that which is
traditional HPC type of work please use
Windows HPC server it works and here's
some here some screenshots so if you
want to create a node it simply
right-click and say I want to add your
add some Asha notes make it a hundred
make it a million and and here's what a
job submission looks like as you can see
it's very similar to the simulation
runner which I simply copied some of the
interface from HPC server so the
difference is again it's user versus
sysadmin target audience right so you
can essentially run your jobs you can
see two jobs submitting this is actually
a MATLAB job so so we're running in some
MATLAB runtime work on here
and sure here's another simulation that
we did so this is something called
motorcyle we did some very compute
intensive work using the HPC server in
the cloud to process Mulder's satellite
data and that takes years that
essentially if you were to do that on
desktop or take you I said I remember it
was thirty years or even more so we were
able to do that in the cloud by scaling
out to hundreds of nodes and obviously
that didn't take a long time to take
maybe I would say a month or so for the
computation to complete redder than
thirty years
here's and the cost is also becoming
much cheaper so these are some of the
older numbers right now the compute
service has gotten a 35% off and also
the storage services now 65% off I think
you can store a gigabyte per month is
that two cents three cents two cents I
think it was and the compute instances
are four cents I believe you can get
that done so here's a map preview of
what MATLAB cluster installation looks
like so you can't install MATLAB so it's
not a problem on Windows HPC server and
it would actually have the licensing all
done four years so in fact you can see
that I ran through the cluster
configuration and it finished up just
fine so you have the so you install
all HPC server installed a MATLAB
compute cluster and and it will just run
but there's a minor issue you have to
install VPN so those are still things
that we're figuring out for you and we
will have a more detailed write-up for
you later on and for the future I fps I
would encourage you guys to look at so
if you're using MATLAB please do and
we'll be very happy to help you to get
that working on Windows your so that
brings me to on number three which is
let us help you to scale your research
so we have some training schedules we
have we've been running almost a hundred
trainings I worldwide by now
maybe dozen that maybe not that many but
we do have also the content available
it's 200 megabyte downloads which shows
you a lot of things that I showed you
today and also you can apply for the
Windows Azure for research RFP program
which I will go into in detail as well
and also use Windows Azure too and you
can get help that through our support
program so this is the azure for
research program and you can go to asher
for research which is the URL here and
you'll find on the main page you'll find
that this this is the actual proposal
that you have to fill out as you can see
it's really not that many things you
have to do so you'll fill this out your
institution which university or good
your from and also you need to write a
2-page proposal about what you would
like to do on Windows Azure it will be a
free gift to your University and
includes almost half a million more than
that actually more than half a million
compute hours so if you like to take
advantage of the program it will also
help you to use some of our programs as
well as help you look at some of the
design so I the Asscher windows azure
program is really about bringing people
together and that's really the
definition of innovation when you bring
people together onto
compute platform together I think this
is where we can really scale not just
simply for the computation you're doing
but also the knowledge that you'll have
as well as the innovation that we can
have so do you hear some URLs that are
very interesting so Windows Azure com
this is constantly being refreshed
there's there's a a team of writers that
does a fantastic job of keeping things
up to date we also have the Windows
Azure for research website which you can
go to you can look at training schedules
you can look at technical papers and you
can also you know ask questions if you
wanted to so this is actually a URL for
technical papers so it goes into details
of a lot more so such as big data such
as how do you use Windows Azure storage
how do you use compute so these papers
will continuously be updated and you
should go there for your technical
resources we also have an online
training this is a very light version of
our you know you know hands-on training
which is two days so this is probably
takes you an hour to look through these
videos and they're done by Peter Wong
Peter Wang who is a fantastic developer
for for scientific applications and a
founder of continuum and finally we have
a LinkedIn group which you can join and
also here's my Twitter which you can
follow and if you need to ask questions
that's probably the easiest way to reach
to me and finally there's a few more
URLs that you can look at and we'll make
this deck available to you any questions
I think there is one so I'll read it out
so when using the simulation Runner how
do you install custom libraries which
requires compilation such as Python
modules involve C extension or a
simulation instances so that can be done
through Dropbox you simply drop your
compiled code into Dropbox and it will
probably be in the bin directory and you
specify and it will just work so we're
trying to make this as easy as possible
and
you can also use SkyDrive we haven't
built the support yet but you can also
just zip up we were a code and say
upload and distribute and it will
distribute on to each of the nodes so
that's something that we saw as a pain
point for the users and we're trying to
make it really simple for you and the
other questions there is one more
question I'm gonna submit that to you
fantastic Thank You Stephanie so the
simulation Runner project packages is
that currently not yet available fund
for download but we'll make it available
very soon and so you should probably
ping me in I would say in eight days so
by Friday of next week we should have it
up and up and running and if you have
something specifically you want to run
or test we would love to get you know
the the specific program you want to run
and we can test it for you so you can
send me a tweet and I will be happy to
work with you offline to do this and
what we really want to do is to make
this part of a community and make it
really simple for all of our researchers
because there really aren't any good
free web-based scheduling tools out
there so this would make things so much
easier and to make it better it requires
a community effort
so please do send me even those and it's
actually running right now a simulation
runner cloud app net you can play with
it it's a it's very very rough shape at
the moment but we'll make it work I've
already tested on Python I've tested on
MATLAB I've tested on you know complex
simulations like the blast which is
non-trivial because you have to copy a
lot of database files over I've also
tested it for
some other programs that I
cross-compiled
NPI does not work on across many many
nodes but it works on a single node I
did test that earlier so you just simply
package up MPI onto it and you just run
MPI using in each individual nodes so I
think that concludes our webcast and if
you have any further questions please
send me send me a tweet if you like and
I'll be very happy to work with you
and I look forward to your submissions
for the RFP program for the next
deadline which is April 15 and I
apologize that coincides was the tax day
and once again I'll hand it back to you
Stephanie thanks everyone for attending
okay great
