this is a recognition of the working
computational thinking that we've been
doing with CMU I think now for six years
is that my tattled six years is so it's
a very interesting set of talks and we
have Randall talking first and then
Golan Levin talking from the College of
Fine Arts Arielle from computer science
guy and Frank all from computer science
and I look forward to learning about
what you've been doing about
computational thinking and this
afternoon and tomorrow morning we have
our mind swap on large-scale computation
for large-scale machine learning this is
really a hot topic as you know for both
academia and Industry and not all the
Microsoft the searchers could attend but
we'll have a virtual discussion I hope
when they can attend virtually so it's
my privilege to introduce Dean Randy
Bryant who has been a longtime partner
with us at CMU and Randy has a long and
distinguished history and has achieved
widespread recognition for his work he's
a fellow of the I Triple E in ACM as
well as the National Academy of
Engineering and the american academy of
arts and sciences and has won an
impressive array of awards and
contributing to the development of the
symbolic model checking as well as
things like electronic design automation
automation so i look forward to hearing
what randy is going to tell us about
computational thinking and i just reread
the other day jeanette wings ca-siem
article on computational thinking so I'm
very keen to hear Randy talk about
Center for computational thinking and
thank you Tony I thought I'd start off
with a bit of a historical perspective
on this because the senator really
started six years ago and the idea
computational thinking really arose you
a little bit earlier than that around
2005-2006 and by the way I'm doing my
best to channel Jeannette wing and all
of this because she really is the person
who pulled that all together and pulled
together the center and so I'm doing my
best to imitate hair although I know my
hair isn't long enough for black enough
um but just to kind of take you back not
that long ago temporarily but very long
time ago thinking wise in 2005 the
computer science in academia we were in
sort of a state of demoralize a
demoralized state in that it seemed like
nobody loved us anymore in particular as
you see this chart those blue bars show
how many applicants we had to the
computer science undergraduate program
here at CMU and it had peaked at the
dot-com boom and then dropped by almost
a factor to is too few short years is
part of the dot-com bust but at the time
it seemed to be more than just a normal
boom-bust cycle it seemed like something
fundamental had gone wrong in that young
people which always had been stood of
computer science has been this magnet
for young people including most of us
since the beginning of computers and
always affected really smart people at
least we like to think of ourselves as
smart and we just never we never had to
I go out and do any kind of recruiting
because people would come to us and yet
here it seemed like things had fallen
away and there is a sense of this sort
of malaise that computer science has run
its course now there's new and more
exciting things to do and this is going
to lead to best dead-end career
is you might be paid a hundred rupees a
day to do and you know you'd be stuck as
a coding monkey and some cubicles and
also you know all that you know computer
science did some pretty cool stuff we've
got email we've got the internet but
that's kind of it I mean there's nothing
much going to happen anymore so that
really was the sort of something of a
viewpoint going on there and people
including Jeanette and others really
started to think about what y is you
know what's wrong with this picture and
what do we need to do to better express
the idea that we're not just a bunch of
coding monkeys that there's something
about this subject that's actually very
deep intellectually very challenging
captures oh you know a lot of
understanding and thinking and writing
the code is just inserted a final
expression of a long process of coming
up with the right algorithm the
structure for the program and so forth
and also the sense that there's more
about what we do it's applicable not
just to creating better programs but
sort of this way of of reasoning about
systems and competing agents that is
actually a football beyond our own
domain and finally that there's another
possibility this isn't just a dead-end
thing there's plenty of jobs and there
was very good study done by a people
with the ACM with Moshe already in
charge where they actually did a pretty
serious study of the global software
industry and showed that even though it
had expanded tremendously in other parts
of the world of the actual number of
jobs in the u.s. in this area had stayed
the same slight decrease during a
recession but all the the predictions
were it be probably the largest sector
of growth for the jobs in the future so
that sort of gets you the picture of say
around 2005-2006 and so Jeanette wrote
as
don't mention this essay in ca-siem
which was when she kind of went public
with this message of computational
thinking of a way to capture and bundle
up the sort of intellectual core of
computer science and say this is a very
important area and it's not just a some
superficial set of tasks so the idea of
computational thinking is though there's
many different variations on this theme
but for example we started sending out
to our perspective undergraduate
brochures that said come to CS I come to
Carnegie Mellon study computer science
learn computational thinking and I think
this is actually a fairly good summer
it's as CT computational thinking is how
computer scientists determine what can
be computed and how to compute it by
looking at the world through the lenses
of algorithms abstraction Carnegie
Mellon computer science this will be
problem solvers for the 21st century and
so that's sort of a core idea that what
we used both to describe who we are and
what we are and then the idea as i said
is this is a way to express what we're
doing and why our discipline is
challenging fun and exciting to the rest
of the world and also this idea of hey a
lot of what we want to do what we've
been doing for years are actually good
design principles that could be used in
solving other complex problems so i
think again if you a lot of this
question about what is computational
thinking i've heard various different
takes on it but i thought this was an
interesting one because some people go
well isn't computational thinking just
mathematical thinking isn't it just
algorithmic thinking isn't it just
systems engineering thinking and I think
the answer is it's got a little of all
of that but that's not all that it is so
in particular there is this idea of an
algorithm that's obviously something
that we all know but we even understand
deeply this idea of extra
acting out of some problem a sort of
core of mathematical structures that
we're trying to compute or create and
then designing the best possible way to
do that analyzing it as well but there's
also logical thinking I'll mean logical
in two ways one is sort of a layered
abstractions system design style that
you have interfaces that are the
specification that are distinct from the
implementation and so forth and the
other is the logic of programs and
program execution reasoning about
programs invariants and other properties
like that as well as type theory the
logic of programming languages and then
there's certain elements in system
design that we've come to understand
well this idea of as much as possible
trying to loosely couple your parts make
things think from the very outset how
you going to scale from this size to ten
times larger two hundred two thousand
times larger we've dealt with these huge
range of dimensions to our problem much
more so than you'd have in the physical
world the idea that our system
components are inherently unreliable but
we want to make highly reliable systems
out of there via various forms of
redundancy and fault tolerance so all
those suit of principles that a good
system designer knows and understands
and I think part of the idea of
computational thinking of this effort
was to all these kind of unwritten
principles that were sort of scattered
around and we'd all ingrained in us
through our careers to try and condense
that into something that could be
expressed and described other people so
that was sort of the the starting point
of the Center for computational thinking
and of course it's also designed to be a
very collaborative effort between
Microsoft Research and CMU looking into
new problems new challenging research
areas where there's a sense that these
are of mutual interest and so in
particular there's a steering committee
the idea for the
a projects is that faculty would propose
projects using a very short kind of
proposal but they'd be reviewed by a
steering committee that included people
both from CMU and MSR to decide which
ones to actually fund and then also a
way to engage more directly one-on-one
via of mine swaps in other words sort of
little workshops to bring people
together on particular themes and and
find where there's sort of share ideas
and and formulate plans for how we could
go from there so in particular going
back through the schedules oh the the
kickoff was not really a mind swap it
was a series of presentations but each
had a CMU person and each had a
Microsoft person sort of describing some
general theme an area and what promising
types of research the work and then
there were two actual mind swaps and
then there's another one later today
where it really was researchers from CMU
and researchers from Microsoft getting
together and fairly closely interacting
and sharing ideas so the first set of
them then included a discussion about it
was titled computer human synergies and
automated creativity and so in
particular it was the ideas of human
computation and things that we now call
crowdsourcing and ideas like that of
having computers as part of the compiler
humans as part of the computing agents
in addition to humans the second was on
type theory and program logic and the
third presentation was a general area
I'd say I sort of bundled it all up
Auctions game theory and algorithms
meaning bringing in some of these
principles into computer science the
fall 2007 was about privacy and in
particular the sort of technical aspects
of privacy for example differential
privacy and other metrics like that as
well as the human side so what how do
humans understand their privacy settings
different applications what how do you
capture their desires and the risks of
privacy and then the more recent mind
swap was about the relation between
computer science and economics how we
can bring the principles of economic
theory into computer science and how
computer science and algorithmic and
computational thinking really can
influence of economics as well and then
overall if I look back at the projects
I'd say that those sort of different
themes come out as the the different
types of activities that have been done
here over the years so this idea of
economic principles and concepts come up
with new ways of solving CS problems and
vice versa privacy I described as
expanding horizons so this idea of
computers and the way we think about
things can be used not just to solve our
own problems but even outside well
outside the boundaries of traditional
computer science and then another major
component of the work has been on CS
education so how can we introduce
students earlier on in a more systematic
way to some of these principles of
computer science rather than it being
something they sort of accrue over a
lifetime of experience and in fact today
we'll have presentations that cover many
of these subjects and so I'm not going
to try and go into any technical details
because you'll hear it from the other
presenters and so just to list some of
the projects that were done over these
years in this general area of cs and
economics there has been work on setting
up and we'll hear about that exchange
systems of ways of improving the sort of
using economic principles to control the
allocation of resources in a computer
system how to
think about games as a way of designing
a protocol and the sort of algorithmic
aspects of the marketplace in the area
of privacy as I mentioned it sort of
goes from the spectrum of sort of the
technical aspects of privacy metrics for
privacy as well as how this is sort of
the human aspects of it and then
expanding boundaries who's been well
some of those projects are already
listed you could argue kidney exchange
is definitely expanding the boundaries
of computer science but also new ways of
doing drug design new ways of having a
computer system set up to be a company
'used live musicians go on as well hear
it later today has done quite a bit of
work that sort of spans between
education and this externally focused
how do you get artists using computer
technology to be able to express new
different ways of artistry and and then
on the educational side this whole area
of computational thinking is had a
pretty major influence on how we teach
our undergraduates and so in particular
there was a major curriculum revision
that we started in 2010 which had a
couple of different all at the sort of
first year two years of our computer
science program not just for our own
majors by the way but even more so
almost for our non majors so one was
that because of the time we are teaching
our especially the non majors we're just
getting a single course in Java
programming that really did not include
much thinking let's put it that way
computational or otherwise it was this
is this is how you write Java programs
and and so we really want to say now
really even if if somebody only takes
one course from us we want them to at
least have some glimpse of the
underlying principle
of our domain and not just sort of this
superficial understanding of some of its
tools but also and as guy will talk
about later in these sessions to bring
in the idea of parallel thinking so
prepare students for a future in which
most of their computer programs will run
on multiple cores or multiple processors
and they need to be even in their design
of algorithms have to be thinking about
it what works in a parallel setting
versus a sequential one we also in the
process certain migrated Java out of the
introductory programming sequence with
an understanding that Java by the way is
if I have no not a negative statement
about Java at all but it's just not a
very good language for introductory
programming courses and so it really
should be moved into a different part of
the curriculum so just to sketch it out
a little more and these all look like
numbers but what course numbers but let
me just outline to you and these are the
courses that would be taken by our
majors as well as most of those many of
the students and say ECE and so it
starts at the beginning level we've
always had a discrete math requirement
and for students who come in with no
programming experience whatsoever which
is right now about one-third of our
majors interestingly enough I'll they
take a course it is indeed a
introductory programming course it's in
pythons data Java but it is pretty much
basic programming oh there's a separate
course that I don't list here by the way
which is for non-majors that really is a
sort of more kind of holistic view of
computation includes programming but it
also is trying to bring in the bigger
picture as well but we figure with
majors and with students will take
multiple courses we can start them off
with programming and then we introduce
more of the computational thinking as we
go so then above that these two courses
are sort of our true introductory
programming courses and one is about
imperative computation
programming and Frank pennings going to
talk about that later today and then the
other is in functional programming which
is something we've always taught but we
we've packaged it in a slightly
different way and designed it to be more
a 100 level course and then there was
two courses feed into our course the guy
Pollock we'll talk about today which is
data structures and algorithms but
including this sort of parallel thinking
about algorithms and not just sequential
and so in particular we had to structure
it this way because functional
programming is actually a very important
set of concepts if you really want to
think about parallel execution and
that's why we arrange things this way so
I think the interesting thing back when
people were going through the assertive
a self evaluation of computer science it
was sort of a prevailing view that you
know if we we have to kind of dressup
this thing and make computer science
more jazzy and put in multimedia and you
know make game programming and stuff in
our introductory courses in order to
attract students into our field because
otherwise you're just going to get
turned off and also you know students
nowadays they all want to program phones
and do apps and stuff like that so we
should sort of be bringing in all this
technology that would make them feel
really edgy about you know I can program
your phone for you we actually do have
in program phones but you know this is
sort of they want to know the latest
buzz what's that thing out there our
view is in some ways if you look at this
almost retrograde say no actually what
we want to do is make our introductory
sequence more rigorous ie harder and
more mathematical and because really if
you think about where the world is going
and software is going if anything we've
got to do a better job rather than
making it cooler so I you know
programming creating out commercials
software nowadays is harder than it used
to be because of issues especially
dealing with security and if you've got
a bug in your program some bad guys
going to figure that out and exploit it
as an attack method so the whole area of
programming if anything requires more
discipline and more rigor now than it
did in a former era and also a feeling
like look at we're preparing people for
a wife a career and so it isn't really
what is the latest buzz what's the
latest sort of methodology but let's get
some principles in there that even after
they get their jobs they'll be able to
then carry through in their careers so
this is out gone amazingly well I won't
say it's been absolutely smooth sailing
but this in the sense of stepping up the
rigor in our program and this is
affected not just our own majors as I
mentioned but we have a lot of other
students on campus taking computer
science courses and I think actually
I'll credit our corporate partners for
having helped make this possible and the
reason I say this is that when they go
off to interview at Microsoft and at
other companies if they get a seasoned
credibly hard and arcane problems in
algorithms logic reasoning about
programs and all this stuff and they
come back and they go wow that stuff I
learned in my algorithms course got me a
job and so they're pretty happy about
that and they tell their younger friends
and their younger friends say sign me up
so it actually has been a let me call it
a virtuous cycle at least among us nerds
to say that people have really
understood that there is a you know
you've set a high enough bar and sort of
impose this thinking about among our
students that say wow this is pretty
serious business and we have to really
prove ourselves worthy to get the kind
of jobs we want to get this
is by the way a cover of a book about
how to get a job at Microsoft there's
similar books about getting jobs at
google getting jobs here there and
everywhere that you can go and if you
look at them they're just full of
problems they're actually pretty fun to
look at if you're well if you're nerd so
that's sort of the the background and
just to sort of cap this off this is why
the admission sort now so you remember
that first slide I showed ended in 2005
when we hit our low point and since then
we've been climbing out and in fact for
each of the past three years we've
broken all historic records and we're on
chart this year to break it again and
probably works and to spinning around
5600 applications so computer science
flipped from being the job people didn't
want the job everybody wants and this
idea of spending all your time hacking
code has become cool again and that's
great but i think this core of bringing
in these principles and present him to
our students and also using them to
guide us more systematically has been a
very positive development so with that
I'll finish</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
