morning's session it's great to see you
all here early in the day after such a
great evening last night it's a pleasure
to welcome you to the the session on
Microsoft academic before we get going I
just want to say a word or two about the
remainder of the schedule in the day
we've got several breakout sessions or
parallel talks on different aspects of
AI so once this is over we'll have one
focus on machine learning and algorithms
in in AI another one that's focusing on
the actual hardware implementations or
intelligent devices and then one on the
extremely timely and interesting area of
quantum computing so all that will be
coming when we're done here this morning
it's a pleasure to introduce our speaker
Alex Wade alex is a director of
scholarly communications at Microsoft
Research he's had a very long history at
Microsoft with a particular focus on
search he's implemented the search
algorithms in Windows as well as in
Microsoft's intranet search now he's
focusing mostly on cognitive computing
and Microsoft academic and the academic
work will be the focus of today's talk I
saw Alex
thank you everybody for getting up this
morning after after last night I was
considering missing this session this
morning but it's probably good that I
came here and also I think many of you
came by the booth yesterday during the
demo showcase so I'm going to go into a
little bit more depth this morning about
what we're doing with Microsoft academic
and I'll paint a little bit fuller
picture of the relationship between
Microsoft academic and some of the
Microsoft cognitive services that were
also developing in tandem here so I'll
talk a little bit about the relationship
between these two things and because we
only have a half day of the summit left
today we've timed it so that by the end
of lunch all of the clouds should have
cleared out and everybody can head out
to the beach today so as part of the
planning for the session here on
Wednesday when we kicked off
Riko talked about Microsoft's
interconnected ambitions here about
reinventing productivity about building
the intelligent cloud and about creating
more personalized computing and and
really our our new mission of enabling
everyone in every organization on the
planet to do and to achieve more what
we're doing within our group in
Microsoft Research is taking a very
small slice of that pie everyone on the
planet is a lot of people so we modified
this a little bit for our academic
services to talk really about every
academic and every academic institution
focusing in right on those and
specifically today I want to talk about
a couple of things that we're doing in
this space around reinventing
productivity I'm going to talk a little
bit about Microsoft academic which is
really the sort of first volley in in
how we see taking some of the efforts
that we're doing around machine learning
and data mining and knowledge
acquisition from content on the web in
this case around scholarly publications
and scholars and bringing that together
into something that's much more than
just a search engine but something that
we feel will will actually help in the
productivity of you guys from an
academic person
this site itself is actually built on a
number of layers that we are also
releasing simultaneously under the
Microsoft cognitive services banner and
so I'll talk about the relationship
between these and how they actually help
us build up these services and then how
you can use them as well in addition to
the to the to the web portal and moving
forward what we'll be working on now and
coming over the next couple of years is
looking at how we create this more
personalized to computing experience
with this data so Microsoft and other
companies are coming out now with
personal digital assistants things that
you can talk to interact with act on
your behalf
notify you about things alert you that
you may want to leave for the airport
earlier if the traffic is bad so it
knows about your flight and knows about
the environment and imagine what you
could do if you applied that same
thought approach to all of the processes
that you have as researchers and as
academics what would happen if we could
sort of focus in there and have a
personal assistant that's that's really
taking care of the things that you need
in your academic life so Microsoft
academic as I said is this a new web
experience we'll talk about that it is
the sort of logical progression of a
project that we were running originally
started out of our Beijing lab Microsoft
Research Asia almost a decade ago and a
service came out of that originally
called Libra and then was called
Microsoft academic search and as a
research project that actually led to a
number of other technologies such as how
the Bing team today is is building up
their knowledge graph but the the
research project itself ended a few
years ago and we've taken those same
concepts we've taken the ideas there and
we've rebuilt this entire approach now
in partnership with the Bing team so
they're taking care of all the web
crawling aspects of this and we're doing
the interesting work that is really
domain-specific around the academic
content and simultaneous with that a
number of these services that we use
ourselves to generate this this graph
are also being made available
so I want to touch a little bit on some
of the elements of the of the service
that I think are what we're targeting as
ways that we can differentiate what
we're doing here from some of the other
services that that exist and the first
one is really if you think about most
academic search engines today they're
still very much based on a traditional
information retrieval aspect they take
every single document or every academic
paper or every webpage and they really
treat them as a bag of words you take
the words you index the words you may be
doing some sophisticated morphology on
the words but ultimately you're treating
the document as a bag of words and
you're treating the keywords are sorry
you're treating the query terms as a bag
of words that you're matching up and you
coming back with a set of candidate
documents and ranking those and putting
them in front of the user and question
and answering in this world if you're
talking to a digital assistant um
doesn't really work because all you're
trying to do is match keywords to the
documents so we end up having to build
sort of independent parallel question
and answering systems around it the
approach that we're taking here is
fundamentally as Rico put stated on
Wednesday is teaching our bots not just
to take a document and find all the
words in the document but to read the
document and to understand the document
and map the human language that's in the
document to the concepts and building up
a knowledge graph around these concepts
the people and places and things that
are being talked about in the in the
content build up that knowledge graph
and then simultaneously or in parallel
when a user comes to the system whether
or not they're talking into their device
or typing into a search box treating
this as a opportunity for our our
processes to understand the intent of
the user what is it that they're trying
to do here what are they trying to
achieve I'm not just looking at the
words in the search box but that's a
clue as to what the user is looking for
and one of the systems that we've
developed and there's examples of this
running an in Bing today and in Cortana
is taking the taking the added step of
not just having this be transactional
not saying you type something into a
search box and we'll give you back a
bunch of candidate doc
and then you have to figure out which
ones are relevant for you but actually
using constructs of human dialogue to
ask clarifying questions to provide
aggressive suggestions from the search
engine and we can do a lot of these
things in parallel in the Bing search
engine today and we're bringing that
into the academic space so the second
aspect of this is is really the the
reach as I mentioned we've rebuilt this
now on top of the Bing crawler so this
actually enables us very quickly and
very efficiently to find new content on
the web we're growing this knowledge
graph what we call the Microsoft
academic graph let me go back one
there's Microsoft academic graph on a
weekly basis I think last week we added
about another 300 thousand documents
into the graph and rather than just
reading this as a set of publications we
have well over a hundred million
publications at the moment but instead
of just treating this as a set of
publications what our bots are
fundamentally doing is reading each one
of those papers and pulling out the
concepts and saying this is this is not
just a string that represents an author
but this is an author entity and that
author comes from an institution and
this publication was in this particular
journal or at this particular conference
and again mapping these things into this
into these concepts so this is a growing
knowledge base a growing knowledge graph
of academic content that is not only
powering these experiences but we're
making available to you guys those
researchers if you want to take the
whole graph and and pull that down and
do do your own research on it we also
realize the reason that we're making
this graph available to people is that
this is not just an exercise for us as
Microsoft Research to do further
analysis on how for example we do
ranking over entities in knowledge
graphs or how we do data mining and
entity extraction and entity linking but
we want to do this in partnership with
the community we want you guys to help
out in this same space and over the past
couple of over the past year
specifically
we've done a number of challenges that
have sort of shared some of the the
challenges that we have that are
represented as ways that we can invite
everybody in and run it as a competition
and see who can do the best in this
particular space so one example of that
was the wisdom cup challenge that we ran
from about August of last year until
through December effectively and the
challenge itself was given a set of
papers and we gave our participants
access to 100 million plus papers in
this graph given a set of papers give us
a static ranking of those papers which
papers were more important and you can
look at things like the citation counts
in the papers but that graph also
included papers that had never been
cited before brand-new papers tens of
thousands million papers that came out
in 2015 that were not old enough to
receive any citation so you have to be
able to rank those as well and during
phase one of the competition we used
traditional information retrieval
evaluation techniques we took a set of
expert evaluations and each submission
from the participant teams was then
graded against that at the end of phase
one we took the top eight teams who are
in the picture here including one team
here from Brazil
we had three team four teams from China
and Taiwan we had two teams from Europe
one from North America and one team from
from here in Brazil in the final eight
and we took all of their ranked
approaches and we actually flighted them
in our Bing academic service over the
course of about six weeks and we did an
online evaluation to see how well their
rankings actually stood up to real-world
interactions and to see how end-users
interacted with those those search
results so a very interesting sort of
transition from a traditional
information retrieval evaluation
technique to an online evaluation
technique and this is important for us
as Microsoft because this is the way
that we evaluate any new feature that
rolls into our online
tensions into into being and other
services is that we will flight these
take a small percentage of the traffic
do a/b testing on what we have today
versus new feature and we measure
whether or not that has any noticeable
effect on on user satisfaction on click
through on success rates etc and so that
that's what we did with these eight
teams in terms of opening up Bing for
doing these online evaluations I can go
back here we actually taken that concept
and that will be run this year as part
of the track conference we're doing an
open search track in track to actually
scale this new approach up and hopefully
those be something that we repeat year
over year for the wisdom Cup the those
top eight teams that I mentioned if
anybody's interested in reading about
their approaches these papers are up on
Doc's calm a little plug for another
service for Microsoft Office right now
they've got this service called Doc's
calm that allows you to publish your
Word documents in your PowerPoint
presentations and PDFs on to the web so
go and do a search for West wisdom cups
app challenge and you'll see the the
publication's hear the wisdom cup
challenge ended in February the
conferences in San Francisco right now
we're doing a second challenge this year
the first one we did with actually no
cash prize it was just for a fame and
glory of coming up with the best ranking
algorithm but for the kdd cup challenge
that's going on right now and we
actually put a ten thousand dollar cash
prize on first place I think there's a
second and third place a cash awards
that go along with this as well and
whereas the wisdom cup challenge was
about ranking papers the KVD cup
challenge is about ranking institutions
so given a topic machine learning
information retrieval neural networks
gives us a ranked list of the top
institutions in that area and that
challenge is going on right now we're
running it in multiple phases
I think the phase number two just ended
the leaderboard is is up right now we
have over 500 teams participating it's
not too late to participate so there's
one more
submission deadline that's coming up
next week so go back and tell your
students to participate and then we'll
be taking again the top top teams in a
holding workshop around this at the kdd
conference in august the other aspect of
what we're doing right now with
Microsoft academic is trying to be as as
open as we can not only with the data
and with the api's but also the the
algorithms and approaches that we're
taking and constructing this graph and
so I'll go into more detail about this
stack over here
but the short cut version of it is that
the graph itself as I mentioned before
is as available for you to download and
do your own research on we're doing
we've released this roughly quarterly
over the past year so the last release
of this was back in February and if
there's need we can we can do another
release but we've also put an API over
this constantly refresh set of data so
you can query into this and get the as
fresh Gaydos we're putting on to the
website itself so the way that the
cognitive services and the website
relate to each other is basically this
we have this Microsoft academic graph
that I'm talking about here as serve our
data the way that we build that is by
crawling content that's on the web this
content could be on publisher websites
it could be in institutional
repositories it could be on your link
from your own faculty web pages but we
basically piggyback on top of the of the
Bing crawlers look for the academic
content we have classifiers that will
recognize the content and we run that
content through a number of processes
such as an entity linking service that
pulls the things out of the document
says this is the author this is the
affiliation it understands the context
of the the document itself and will link
the concepts into these topical
hierarchical terms and that helps us
produce this graph from an abstract
perspective we have this graph
yesterday at one of the parallel
sessions I talked about this knowledge
exploration service so I'm not going to
go into any detail about this here but
the knowledge exploration service is
something that that you can use with
your own data to generate your own web
service effectively over the graph any
any arbitrary data what we do here is we
take our graph and we run it through the
knowledge exploration service and what
that produces for us is this academic
knowledge API so this is a queryable
rest endpoint that provides access to
all of the data that's in this Microsoft
academic graph and these items here in
teal are three of the examples of the
Microsoft cognitive services so you can
sort of interact with this at any level
you can run your own data through the
entity linking service you can run your
own data through the knowledge
exploration service or you can play with
our data that's been run through that
pipeline and then we put the website on
top of it so everything that we're doing
on top of the website is exposed via
these api's you can build your own user
experiences on top of the same data that
we're using okay so let me go into a
little bit deeper dive then on Microsoft
academic we want this to be much more
than just a search engine this isn't
loose States differently all of the use
cases that we see when we talk to
students and researchers and faculty is
yes I want to be able to go in and
search for a paper but I also need to be
able to stay up to date in my field and
that's not always best served by by
being presented just for the search box
and trying to type in keywords and get
information back so a few of the things
that we are starting to expose now and
this will be growing over time are ways
that we can bring fresh information to
you expose the information in the graph
and in sort of a zero query format and
then sort of do some playful things we
have some leaderboards in there we
expose things that you may want to put
onto your calendar etc and so let me
walk through a little bit of the site
experience to show you what that looks
like so when I talk about a zero query
experience when you come to the site
without having to put
cursor in the search box or take any
action you're presented with information
and you can see over here on the left
side we have the domains of coverage in
the middle we have a feed of information
here this is focused right now on
computer science and so what we're
showing here is is a combination of
research related news stories as well as
recent papers so I'm a former academic
librarian and many years ago well before
my days at Microsoft people actually
used to come into the library as a way
of staying up to date on the research
and we'd have this sort of most recent
editions of all of the journals and
somebody would come in and browse
through the table of contents and say
yeah that's the paper that I want to
read well before a lot of the online
databases that are available today and
in some respects we're trying to
recreate that you know you come in here
you can sort of browse through this you
can get an idea of what's going on in
your field you find something say hey
that's interesting I didn't know that
was going on we have the leaderboards
and we have the dates over here but let
me sort of focus in here this is generic
on computer science maybe I want to
drill down into my particular sub domain
so I can come in here and I can pick
something like artificial intelligence
and now we'll Reese cope that feed of
information in the middle column here to
be just the papers and news stories that
we've run through this entity leaking
service that we know to be about
artificial intelligence when I talk
about us mapping the concepts many of
these new stories might not even contain
the word artificial intelligence or the
the word AI but from the context from
reading the stories from reading the
papers are our BOTS are making that
mapping between the concepts and the
items and the leaderboard over here is
scoped as well so now I've got the top
10 authors and artificial intelligence I
can change that I can say maybe I'm
interested in the conference's and we
give you the top ten conferences when I
talk about ranking and the things that
we're doing on paper ranking and the
things that we're doing on institutional
ranking with the wisdom Cup challenged
in the kdd challenge this is one
instance of where some of these rankings
come out it comes out in our search
results it comes out in our leaderboards
it comes out when when we drill into
some of the
topic pages in how we're presenting the
rank order of these items and the
calendar events down here as well so if
I'm interested in artificial
intelligence I might want to know that
the submission deadline for this
particular conference is coming up in
the near future for each of the objects
in our graph for each of the entity
types then you can also browse in to
navigate to a details page about them so
this is the details page for a
particular paper and this illustrates
how we have information about the paper
itself when it was published what
conference it was in who the authors are
what affiliation they have here you can
see the the linked topical fields of
study so this particular paper is about
heterogeneous networks and cluster
analysis and machine learning and
computer science
the abstract the other process of entity
linking as we read the full text of
papers that we find on the web is
actually reading down into the
references section parsing those
references understanding what papers
they're pointing to and then making
those connections in our graph so from
this paper to this paper that it's
citing and if I could scroll down the
page here you'd also see the list of
papers that are citing this paper so you
can navigate forward and backward in
time from this paper both the ones that
it is citing the ones that are citing it
and then over here we have the multiple
instances of this paper that we found on
the web so in this case we found five
copies and we need to bring these
together in a single unified version and
the interesting thing about this is that
this graph grows incremental e over time
we made tomorrow go out and find another
copy of this paper maybe the first one
we weren't able to read all of the
references for some reason and the
second one we could or maybe the first
time we found out a pair of paper was
only because it was through the
reference and we didn't actually know
where it existed on the web so not only
re adding more papers to this graph
every week but we're actually adding
more details to each paper as we
discover more evidence about it
similarly you can focus your gaze on a
different type of entity and they get in
the graph you can focus your gaze on an
author entity and then you can aggregate
together
the information that we know about that
particular author so in this case I'm
looking at Eric Orbitz we've gathered
information that we have discovered
about him that's in Wikipedia in some
cases were actually pulling in
information from people's public
LinkedIn profiles and then linking that
into this author entity record in in the
graph
oops let's go back got ahead of myself
so here here's another instance of us
using this ranking so we're showing here
what we believe to be by our ranking
metric Eric's top publications and then
we get some aggregations of information
here what what are the top journals that
he's published in what are his top
conferences who are his top co-authors
etc same thing can be done at the
institutional level so this is Carnegie
Mellon we aggregate together all the
papers that we know about from Carnegie
Mellon or from Carnegie Mellon authors
we have 45,000 of them here in the graph
and again statistically or from a
histogram perspective who are the top
authors from CMU what are the top
conferences that they published in what
are the top journals we don't expose
this right now on the website but you
can also think about this data
temporarily if you did some temporal
analysis of the data here you might
discover some interesting analytics
about if your if your Carnegie Mellon if
you're the Dean of the CS department at
Carnegie Mellon it would be interesting
to see what trends emerge over time
which of my authors are publishing more
which ones are publishing less what
venues are we publishing in more or less
how does the the topical structure of
our papers change over time what does
that tell us about our areas of
specialization so all that data can be
gathered not right now out of the
website but certainly out of the api's
that were exposing a conference so this
is the world wide web conference gives
you information about that you can see
other instances past and future
instances of the conference and again
some of the deadlines around it and the
same thing about a journal so any one of
the entities in the graph gets this sort
of focused view here and then finally
the individual topics I talked about
this topical hierarchy this is the topic
artificial intelligence
and this is bringing together now all of
these papers about artificial
intelligence and who the top authors and
journals and conferences are they're
everything that I just showed you sort
of falls into this category of
exploration everything that I showed you
is all navigable from the site without a
very interacting with the search box at
all but of course we also do have a
search box and we use some of the
techniques that we've developed for and
with the the Bing search engine exposed
on this site to improve on that notion
of moving away from strict keyword
search not viewing the search box as you
type in a word and we'll match those
words to those documents but actually a
more interactive opportunity for us to
try and understand the user intent give
them opportunities to help us
disambiguate that intent and really sort
of focus in semantically on what they're
searching for
so we support a certain form of natural
language queries here my query is I want
papers by Kwan Sanh Wang in dub-dub-dub
whatever in dub-dub-dub means and I'll
show you what that that looks like in
the in the query box model in a second
but you can see here that we've we have
from this query identified there's a
person that you're talking about Quan
San Wang there is a conference that
you're that we're talking about
dub-dub-dub conference and you get back
to the set of papers here and again
these sort of filter views over on the
left you can change the rank order of
this if I just want to see the most
recent documents I can do that and this
little paper right here was the paper
that we presented at dub dub dub last
year in Florence that explains this
entire pipeline of how we construct this
knowledge graph so if anybody wants to
go in it's called an overview of
Microsoft academic services and the
search box itself when I talk about
recognizing the user intent and
providing opportunities for
disambiguation you can see how we're
we're also annotating the query so if I
type the query in dub dub dub after 2010
about our EC the icons here are saying
well dub dub dub is actually an
ambiguous concept you could be talking
about the
dub dub dub you could be talking about
the concept world-wide-web
it's a concept in our topical hierarchy
and it's also the name of a journal so
you're talking about the conference or
the topic or the journal and so we give
opportunities for the users to specify
we're also using the ranking here to say
it's probably most likely that you're
looking for this one based on other
aspects of the query or based on the
static rank of that concept in the graph
and secondarily we're using this kes
knowledge exploration service to then
provide suggestions for autocomplete
here so if I say in dub-dub-dub after
2010 the recommendations for for further
refinement of the query are actually
going over that graph and the
suggestions are only going to be offered
here for the most likely topics that
papers in that conference after 2010 I'm
had in them so we're actually using the
knowledge in the graph to drive these
suggestions okay finally is this notion
of connecting and collaborating and
making a much more highly personalized
experience this is an area that we're
actively working on right now so I'm
just putting this here as a teaser watch
this space very soon we'll have a lot
more to share in this but but
specifically moving this from what we
have today which is an entirely non
logged in experience everybody gets the
same experience you come in you search
you browse what we'll be adding into
this is a personalized experience that
allows you to create an account to
identify yourself in the graph and that
feed of information is now not just
about artificial intelligence but about
things that are going to be much more
relevant to you okay that's the user
experience that we're creating if I talk
now about Microsoft cognitive services
there's been a lot of sessions we had
several demos yesterday during the demo
showcase about various of the computer
vision the language speech other aspects
of Microsoft cognitive services but I'm
gonna drill down in here specifically to
a number of areas now Microsoft has been
working in the
space for a long time if any of you
remember Bob Microsoft Bob even even
some of the interactions that were built
in what Jeff mentioned was window search
in the early days of window search back
when windows search was just a grep
search engine we were starting to build
in some of these natural language
interactions where you could ask
questions and it would it would try to
process these in sort of an avatar
interaction mode but over the years
we've made a lot of investments here in
a lot of the underlying technologies and
for the most part these things have been
targeted at a shipping these directly to
the product teams who then make the
decisions on when and how these get
implemented into the Microsoft products
and there's a number of areas that we're
doing this but specifically in the
knowledge area the ones that are in that
stack that I talked about are the that
we will talk about a little bit more
today or the academic knowledge API and
the entity linking service it's
important I think to understand that
these aren't just simply simply the art
this isn't just a matter of we and
Microsoft Research are building
technologies and we are getting them out
there I mean we are doing that but these
fundamentally come from things that we
have been and continue to ship directly
to the to the product teams so almost
all if not all of the Microsoft
cognitive services are actually being
used in production at scale across
Microsoft products today and so
specifically in the knowledge category a
lot of what we're doing in generating
the the academic knowledge API and a lot
of what we're doing with the knowledge
exploration service are being used in
Bing and in Cortana today so for example
and this is a little bit of a repeat of
what I talked about with the knowledge
exploration service yesterday morning
but if you go to being today this is
actually a screenshot that I took
yesterday of what the Bing experience
looks like here in Portugal so in
Portugal it said Portuguese out there
here in Brazil and and I and I sort of
apologize because
one of the things when we talk at an
international conference about some of
these features and being one of the
things to realize is that not all of the
features in being roll out to all of the
countries globally at the same time so
I'm going to use this as an example of
what search looked like before and after
the knowledge exploration service was
applied to this so unfortunately in
Brazil right now you're still in the
before state so if I go into the the
Bing search engine here in Brazil and I
type in latent semantic analysis
you get a very back up here first of all
it's not giving me a good suggestion
here it's not Auto completing for me
it's not understanding my intent it's
just seeing that I'm typing latent s and
maybe some people have typed latent
semantic before but it's not
understanding the context it's not
understanding my intent and my search
results are very traditional ten blue
links I've got some web pages that have
matched that string and now it's up to
me the user to figure out whether or not
any one of these is relevant once we
take that knowledge exploration service
once we build up these knowledge graphs
and we in inject that into the search
box experience this is the experience of
the after so as I'm typing latent
semantic it's saying hey I've got a very
high confidence that what you're looking
for is latent semantic analysis I can
actually give you a definition of that
right here in the search box I can give
you the opportunity to engage with that
maybe you're looking for something that
started with that same string but if
you've clicked on that then the search
results are much more robust they're
much more helpful they're much more
actionable now first of all we recognize
that you're looking for latent semantic
analysis we recognize what academic
papers are and that they have more
substance to them than just showing them
as 10 blue links and we can start
surfacing things like hot links to the
journal hot links to the author
affiliations you can pivot on the author
names and over here in the entity pane
we show things like the definition some
related conferences some related people
even the people also searched for links
are not just other strings that other
users of search for but they're actually
the concepts out of the knowledge graph
that map to the
sepsis or so this experience I think is
and and as we flight these and testes in
front of real-world users much more
fulfilling much more helpful at that
sort of task completion when people are
doing this sort of query and this also
is helpful in in disambiguation here so
here if I type in Susan doom a I'm
getting the the traditional approach
here but where the knowledge exploration
service kicks in is when we have enough
evidence that what you're looking for is
actually publications by a person whose
name is sue doom a and we can map that
intent on to our graph then we can make
much more robust suggestions here about
maybe you would like to refine your
query by her co-authors etc and that's
the the pivot that I talked about during
the knowledge exploration service
yesterday morning about going from
simply queries that other people have
typed into knowledge driven queries
query completions I also mentioned that
the information that were producing the
data that we're producing is also
feeding into our Cortana service so
Cortana started as our digital assistant
on the Windows Phone I'm holding this
out there like it's a Windows Phone it's
not Cortana is now available on Android
and I'm on iOS it's also baked into the
Windows 10 operating system so where the
search button is in Windows 10 you have
this Cortana interface here and Cortana
has this notion of a notebook this
little notebook icon here and this is
where Cortana stores all of the
information that she's gathering about
you of the things that you have
indicated to Cortana that you're
interested in what types of food you
like what kinds of music you like what
sort of news you want to get in your
news feed what stock information you
want to follow Cortana gathers all of
this information into the notebook you
can go and review it and edit it and
change it at any time but we've added in
here this category called academic so
this is this is available today and if
you go into the academic category you
can
trol what you want to get notifications
on do you want to get conference updates
do you want to know about new papers do
you just want to know about news and
what Cortana will do is two things
Cortana will suggest to you topics that
you may want to have her follow on your
behalf and this is based on your online
behaviors if you've been searching for
these things maybe maybe you're
interested in them maybe you'd like to
have them followed and then the the blue
ones up here are the ones that I've
confirmed I've said yep I am interested
in machine learning and artificial
intelligence
so please monitor that on my behalf and
what that looks like then is in my feed
of Cortana here I'm now getting
information on new papers on news items
and on events coming into my feed so
just a nice little thing while I'm
waiting for the bus I can sort of go
through and get updates on a newly
published items so those are two ways
both in being in Cortana that were
taking the same data and taking the same
approaches and shipping them in our
products at the same time we've been
given the mandate within Microsoft
Research not just to take the
traditional approach of taking our
research and handing it off to the
product team having them iterate on it
make decisions about when and how to
ship that information and and our soul
path to end users being through the
product groups but we're encouraged to
take these same things that we're
shipping to the product coops and making
them directly available to developers to
researchers in the form of these
Microsoft cognitive services api's and
then everybody's happy so getting back
to the stack for a second let me show
you just to sort of two quick examples
of of how we're using the the cognitive
services in this pipeline the first one
is the entity linking service so this is
actually something that you can interact
with on the website right now if you go
to the Microsoft cognitive services
website they've got a little interactive
text box where you can type in your own
paste in your own text and it will show
you how it does the entity linking of
this text so if I take this block of
text and I run it into this service it
will come back and we'll identify the
entity
in this text that it recognizes and
we'll use the context of the paragraph
to do the disambiguation so for example
we have this word web here
what is that web referring to well from
the context of it it's actually
referring to the James Webb Space
Telescope
that's not referring to the person James
Webb or anything else that's Webb it
takes that full con content context into
consideration when it does that entity
linking and we provide them the the JSON
results of that so this API allows you
to send an arbitrary text and get back a
JSON response object
annotated with those entities maps to
map to entities that are extracted out
of Wikipedia in fact so we use this
approach not just with Wikipedia
articles but with our own graph as we
construct iteratively the the academic
graph as I mentioned with the knowledge
exploration service this is also
something that you can use with your own
data you can bring your own data your
own schema your own domain specific
grammar into the knowledge exploration
service and build will produce for you
an API with which you can build your own
applications but in fact we've done this
with our data with our schema and with
our academic grammar we've run that
Microsoft academic graph through the
knowledge exploration service and we've
produced also a REST API and that REST
API is the academic knowledge API so you
can see how these things build up with
our data through our own services and
you can choose to interact with them at
any layer so mapping the let me back up
here talk briefly about this this
academic knowledge API has three method
calls in it the interpret method call
takes natural language queries
unstructured text text that the user
might type into the search box and we'll
give you back candidate interpretations
for that query it will say I think what
this person is looking for is papers by
the person Quan son Wang at the
conference dub-dub-dub and will annotate
that query for you and
give you a log prob likelihood or
confidence score of each of the
interpretations of that particular query
and you can you can bake that into your
application in any way you want we do
this as part of the drop down in our
search box having selected one of those
the users say yep this is this is what
I'm looking for
the second method here evaluate will
give you back the set of search results
the set of entities in the example that
I just gave will give back a set of
papers but your application could be
movies or houses or anything else and
then the third one the calc histogram
will then do a aggregation of the
relationships between that entity and
other entities within the graph and this
is what we use for both the faceting UI
and for the aggregations on the profile
pages so so mapping those three methods
onto the website we use the interpret
API to drive that experience we use the
evaluate API to drive the search results
after I've selected one things in the
search box and we use the calc histogram
to drive the the filter experience here
and any time we have a user interaction
on the site if they type another
character into the search box or if they
select something from the the faceted
list on the Left where reacts acuity of
those queries simultaneously if you do
this with your own data or if you if you
use our data in the academic knowledge
API will generate for you this this page
and this is just sort of peeling back
one layer of the user experience here so
you can you can actually see what the
the individual rest call is so in this
case I'm passing in the string papers by
Eric hor I've told it that I want auto
completion to be on so I'm in an
experience where I I'm actively you
think this is stemming it's turned on
I'm executing this on each keystroke and
I want to get back yeah ignore the
results are so that this is the ranked
list of candidate answers or candidate
interpretations for
query papers by Eric poor and if you
looked at the the JSON response object
it would say this is a person and this
is a title and this is a this is another
title so it's providing that annotation
the first one that's selected here is
also being executed down here so the
second method evaluate is saying give me
all the attributes back for the
structured query autumn equinox
so we've translated this query this disk
we're here papers by Eric or - a search
for the author Eric Horvitz and
similarly the calculate histogram method
over here is doing the same thing what
it's giving me back not just a list of
entities but a list of values okay
so that's how the whole stack fits
together we would love to have you use
the website but we'd also love to have
you use the individual services there's
a number of ways you can right now not
right now because you can't get Wi-Fi in
this room but you can when you get back
to your rooms you can interact with any
one of these services the NT linking
service and knowledge exploration
service the academic knowledge API and
the website itself are all available for
you guys to use if you also want to take
advantage of Azure resources in your
research if if you want to take the
Microsoft academic graph and instead of
downloading the whole thing you actually
want to put it in your own as your VM
and do your own analysis over the graph
or if you want to do other applications
that are making calls on the API there
are programs like the the DreamSpark
program that give you access to to a
shore resources and a program that we're
running out of the the outreach team
within Microsoft Research called voucher
for research and this has been talked
about a couple times over the past
couple days but it's a very easy way for
you to put in a request for a tional
resources to use in your research so I
hope with that information you do two
things you check out our website give us
feedback we have got a lot of great
suggestions from people at the at the
demo showcase yesterday about features
that they'd like to see if you have
ideas for features there's a little
feedback button on the site right here
click that button vote on features that
other people are suggesting suggest your
own features we use this actively in
helping us prioritize the new features
that we're going to be adding into this
and secondarily use the academic API and
the other cognitive services in your
research and again if you have ideas for
other things that you'd like to see us
expose through these api's let us know
the intouch thank you okay we have time
for some questions yes so I was
wondering like so vapors is something
clear that you have a time and
publication that's are you yes so there
are some entities that are very clear
that they have time associated like a
publication yeah but like certain
connections perhaps should have a time
or time period for example an author an
entity an author like four thirds of
years it's a professor on the university
and then moved so not University and
company is that also already
incorporated in in the graph structure
for it so when you look at an
institution can you give a period of
time and see the people there were
actually attached to that place at that
period of time it's it's a good question
so we don't actually so it can be done
we do two things so we we have
information about the author entity in
the graph and so with the author entity
we will typically store without author
entity both like current affiliation or
affiliations as well as previous ones
what we don't what we don't model
directly right now is you were at this
institution for this time range it and
it could be done you just have to go
back through so we preserve the the
native information that we crawl out of
the document so we will store and you'll
see this in the Microsoft academic graph
you will you will see for any individual
paper author one was that affiliation a
at that time period and affiliation a
might be different than what
you see on that Eric Horvitz profile
page so that that profile page is
supposed to be much more about the
author's current affiliations
we do have can't remember if we're
exposing this now but we do have a place
where we can't expose past affiliations
we just don't have the sort of time
bound and the the interesting thing
about that especially with with research
publications is that that's a very fuzzy
indicator of when you actually left an
institution because you could still be
publishing papers of research that you
did at that institution two years after
you've left it so yeah so the data is
there it's not it's just not as nicely
represented as I think you you're asking
for okay thank you there's a question
over here
but thank you very much for a
presentation and within the roadmap of
Microsoft is there let's say a time
frame where all these servers is like
being search experience and Cortana for
example will be available for Brazil
because I think this is very adopting
these tools very early it's it's
fundamental so we don't get used to
another another tool or another website
or other search engine so what I saw
that the experience is very different
that what we have now in Brazil
have you considered moving to the United
States no I I wish I could provide that
it's it's complicated in that Microsoft
offering services globally it's often up
to each one of the individual markets to
decide what the prioritization is for
individual features and there's there's
local information there's local language
support a lot of the information that we
have in the knowledge graph may only be
in English or you know a subset of that
in in Portuguese for the Brazilian
market right now one of our one of our
most
furthest along markets in integrating
this information into Bing is actually
in China and it's due to a number of
factors but one of the factors is that
part of our extended development team
works with being out of our Beijing
office and so the experience that you
get with academic content in being
within China is more robust than the
United States and as I demonstrate the
United States is more robust on what we
demonstrate in Brazil for me as being
interested in the academic segments
those academic features you know the the
best I can do is knock on the doors of
each one of the individual markets you
know here for the Brazilian market
saying we'd love to have you guys
implement these features here but it's
it's sort of out of my hands it's sort
of market dependent I wish I had that
roadmap it's actually something I'd like
to be able to supply just not have it if
I have if I become a kind of regular
user of academics
probably I would like to have the change
in in the information that is provided
to me is there any plans for tracking
the use I do on the academic service and
for example if I click it such-and-such
paper it's not going to present these
papers again to me but you present new
papers that I am interested in I
possibly be interested in in reading to
have plans on this direction we have
definite plans for a more personalized
experience here so once we get to the
stage where you'll be able to login then
yes absolutely
understanding what you've published and
we can infer even what you've read from
the papers that you've cited I hope the
papers that you've cited you've read but
you know we can sort of feed it feed
that into into this and and use that
information but as I said give us that
feedback you know more times that we
hear those specific requests and have
other people come in and upvote those
particular comments moves it up on our
stack rank for for implementation thank
you
whatever here hello this is Yamato from
national political Institute Mexico so
I'd like to ask you a you said something
about semantic search so if you have
considered for example and there are
some terms related terms such as
supported vector machine and support
support vector network which are related
so if I look for one and I want to see
also what in other terms how is called
is considered in the current version in
effect Microsoft academic it has been
something that we've talked about both
implicitly and explicitly so you can
actually use the structure of our of our
topic map to do automatic query
expansion if you want to we tend to use
it more for query refinement and driving
the queries down but we do have the
notion of synonymous one of those topics
so you might be typing SVM and we can
map that onto on to the concept so this
gets back more to the to the idea of
understanding the intent but in terms of
exposing the the hierarchy in a way that
users could use that to either refine or
expand their search is again something
that we talked about but don't have any
any immediate plans to implement that
again
features there's a suggestion or better
yet the the data that I talked about the
Microsoft academic graph data probably
the best way to explore that set of
related terms is to download the field
of study hierarchy file and so we that
actually gives you access to all of that
hierarchical structure and we'd love to
have people do research or implement
prototypes that show how that data could
be exposed so this is this is part of
how we're trying to open up the the
opportunities here to the broader
community rather than just making
feature suggestions of us implement
these things and share them with us and
let's find a way that we can work on
this
I don't need that be interesting alright
thank you thanks are there further
questions if not let's thank Alex again
