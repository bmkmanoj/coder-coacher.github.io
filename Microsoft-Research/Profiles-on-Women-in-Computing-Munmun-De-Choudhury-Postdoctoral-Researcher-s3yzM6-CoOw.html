postdoctoral researcher at Microsoft
Research in redmond my research
interests are n computational social
science what got me interested in
computer science was the fact that we
can build technologies and techniques to
streamline our lives and make it better
in ways that was not possible before the
reason I took up a career in computer
science and particularly what I do is
because beyond computers and the
technologies I was always interested in
people and I wanted to work in an area
where I can merge the two things I was
always very keen about computers on
computing technology but I always felt
the more softer part of me which is my
interest in understanding people what
did you their behavior and other other
forms of software sciences so I was
always passionate about bringing the two
things together it was a little bit of a
challenge in the beginning because not
many people actually do things like that
things are pretty much black and white
you'll see a lot of people doing
computer science where they'll be doing
just computers or you'll see social
scientists just studying people I work
in the area of computational social
science which sits at the Nexus of
computer science and social science
particularly i'm interested in
developing computational methods and
techniques using big data on the web in
order to make sense of our behavior i'm
particularly interested in how we
express emotion and how it can make an
impact on health economics politics and
so forth Microsoft Research is a very
big research organization in the world
that intense and envisions to push the
frontiers of computing and computer
science in developing techniques and
technologies
that are five years ahead of time ten
years ahead of time 15 and so forth the
reason I got interested in working at
Microsoft Research compared to a
different academic institution was
because I wanted to work in an
environment where I get to work and
collaborate with a variety of people
from a variety of different backgrounds
who are experts in their own fields and
in their own skills I was also
interested in developing techniques and
technologies which could eventually be
used by people which could be in the
order of thousands and millions all over
the world Microsoft gave me tremendous
opportunity as a junior researcher for
my professional growth it gave me the
Liberty to work on a variety of
different problems that interested me
that I was passionate about and perceive
them with my own or ownership my
educational background and my childhood
experiences had a lot to do with me
pursuing a career in research when I was
a little kid I used to have these lots
and lots of story books on the lives of
scientists and I was always fascinated
by how they were so crazy but they were
also very awesome and coming up with
these ideas and tools and techniques
which no one had thought of before they
were actually the first ones to do that
that fascinated me and I thought that I
want to be one of them so I eventually
went to grad school and pursue a
doctorate degree in computer science and
I knew that this was it I need to pursue
and stick to this be passionate about it
build on my basics improve my
understanding of things and thereby
develop ideas which would be for the
first time ever I had great mentors in
my life all throughout but most
important mentors in my life are
probably my parents who always
encouraged me pursue things that I was
passionate about I was never really
under in any kind of pressure to do
things what a girl should do or as a
woman I should be doing I had the
Liberty to go and pursue science and man
and we totally nuts about them so I
believe that they were the most
important mentor
in my life and helping me become what I
am today beyond that I had great
collaborators great mentors advisors all
throughout my professional life who
treated me the same way give me the
similar kinds of opportunities to pursue
what I was passionate about and keep me
going I would like to recall one
experience and my past which I found
particularly challenging in breaking
into an environment which was
male-dominated I was once working in an
environment in a really really high high
quality research group but where
everyone was a guy so initially it was a
little bit of a challenge for me because
sometimes I wouldn't be able to
participate in the kinds of conversation
outside of work that they are having
sometimes not getting the kinds of
supports conversations that they're
having are the kinds of humor healthy
humor but very male focus humor that
they're having so at times it was a
little bit upsetting for me to be in
that kind of environment because I felt
like I actually can't be friends with
them but then over time I realized that
they are all actually nice guys and they
are actually not doing that because they
wanted me to feel alone or anything like
that so eventually it got better and I
stuck to the fact that I love my work
and I will continue to do my work
irrespective of who is around me and
that really helped me overcome that
challenge and eventually I felt very
much a part of that group like any any
other guided in that group my advice to
the future one v's of computer science
field would be to stick to what they are
passionate about really pursue what to
believe in not get sidetracked by what
others are saying or others are thinking
but to truly believe in what they think
would actually change the world and
pursue that with all your efforts and
confidence and to think big and out of
the box and not like everyone else in
making things happen and building tools
technologies in making our lives better
in the future my job at Microsoft
Research is extremely inspirational
every morning that I wake up I'm always
passionate about the kinds of new things
I'm going to do and build the awesome
people that I'm going to be working with
meeting with and collaborating with and
opportunity that one day with the
research that I'm doing it can go off to
the hands of millions of people across
the world and truly make a positive
impact in their lives that keeps me
inspired and going every day each year
microsoft research helps hundreds of
influential speakers from around the
world including leading scientists
renowned experts in technology book
authors and leading academics and makes
