research is that we don't know where
we're going we don't know what problems
we're going to solve we're trying to
solve one problem and we have a huge
impact on another problem and those are
the moments that make research really
incredible Microsoft Research New
England is a lab that focuses at the
boundary of conventional computer
science and other disciplines in
particular the social sciences like
social media and economics and also the
biological sciences like computational
biology one of the best things about
being located in Cambridge is that were
at the heart and center of a wide
variety of different academic
institutions and research centers and we
have a great opportunity to collaborate
with researchers across wide variety of
different institutions I believe that
real advances come at the boundaries of
disciplines when you take the insight to
one discipline and combine them with the
insights of another discipline it's kind
of like an an explosion engineers are
critically important to computer science
but actually so our social scientists
economists sociologists anthropologists
you want these fields to come together
to solve hard problems I study a kind of
intersection of three different areas I
study computer vision machine learning
and computer graphics we want to make
computers understand how to interpret
images the way people do and that's
really what drives me I study how young
people use social media in everyday life
and so I look at what it is the
teenagers do when they jump on to
facebook or myspace twitter tumblr these
types of things I focus on a part of
economics called market design two areas
that we're really excited about here are
the study of health economics and the
impact of the internet on the news media
one of the things I'm most excited about
it Microsoft is that I can invent new
theory I can bring that theory to the
data from the real world search engine
then informed by that data I can create
new inventions experiment with them get
the data that shows they work and that
feeds back into improving the theory you
can complete the loop and it's a really
great opportunity there are very few
places left where you can do long term
big research projects and Microsoft is a
shining star in that regard it provides
us the freedom and the infrastructure to
really try for a home run and that's
what we're hoping for and that's what
we're working hard toward Microsoft
really wants to help to create the
future and to do things that solve
problems that people have and that they
don't even know that they have and the
new disciplines that we're helping a
found at the boundaries of economics and
social media and computational biology
are going to give Microsoft the deep
expertise we need to help people solve
those problems
