Microsoft Research which stands for
future social experiences labs and one
area of things that we're looking at in
social software is how to reuse data
that we see from social networks like
Twitter and Facebook as well as social
news that we see on bing so one of the
projects that we're looking at is how
any person can really get a personalized
news stream by reusing some of the
breaking news that we're seeing out
there on the social web another project
that we're looking at let's end users
actually author their own personal
stories around breaking news or news
from their friends and this project is
called montage and you can either author
a story for your friends or if you're a
group or a company you can actually
author a whole page of news about your
company and it automatically updates and
pushes you interesting things that you
might not discover on your own hi I'm
David risky know from fuse labs and I
work on montage and today I'm going to
show you what montage is so montage is a
really cool experiment from fuse labs
that allows anybody on the Internet to
create a page in seconds on a story or
topic that they're really passionate
about so I'm going to get started here
so today I'm going to use the barring
uprising as an example of a trending
topic and so here's my montage and I can
even change layouts as an example this
one has tweets and then I can choose to
publish my montage or keep it private
and if I publish it will show up in this
gallery over here and we've had about
5,000 of these created in the last 35
days or so so it's quite exciting so
this is an example of the seattle
traffic site that was created an undead
just like this the snowstorm and so
people can go to the site to take a look
at what the current traffic conditions
are and of course all of this is
crowdsource so another example of a type
of montage that we've been thinking
about is for a company to have a
real-time view into how the global
community feels about them so this is an
example of a crowdsourced page on
Microsoft which is really interesting
because it has real-time news as the
global community perceives Microsoft
it's this page over here that allows
anybody in the community to upload new
search term
RSS feeds authoritative people on
Microsoft big bloggers that right about
microsoft meeting that's really powerful
for a company to have the luxury of the
inside of the whole social media space
and so we're really excited about all
the various offshoots a montage that we
have and we think that it's it's
incredible that someone can create a
page in seconds on a topic that they are
passionate about we think that's
game-changing hi I'm Jim Llewellyn from
Microsoft Research fuse labs today I
want to talk to you about an exciting
new application we're working on called
Project emporia project emporia is a
personalized news reader for windows
phone and html5 devices in project
emporia instead of personalizing your
content by going through and filling out
a bunch of forms and answering a bunch
of questions you instead just start
reading stories and as you read them you
vote on them and we use those votes to
give you better content going forward so
i like to use do most of my reading on
my Windows Phone device so I'm going to
go ahead and start the application there
so when the application is starting what
it's doing is going out and deciding
whether it knows me or not if it doesn't
know me it shows me popular stories from
other users of the application and if it
does no mean it gives me the
personalized content so in this case you
can see it shows me a number of top
stories I can scroll through those
stories and look at them in that view or
I can dive in and click on an individual
story and then it brings it up here on
the screen for me I can then navigate in
between the stories and see the
different pieces of content available to
me from there I can choose maybe to vote
so if I say plus I like this that means
I want to see more stories like this
story or minus says I don't want to see
any more stories like this project
emporia will use that information to
make more intelligent decisions about
what to give me in the future so while i
use my windows phone a lot I don't use
it all the time and occasionally I go to
the PC so we've also built project
emporia for html5 devices in this case
you can see all my top stories here on
the top of the screen I can also go and
click into an individual section and say
look at the lifestyle stories and read
the different articles here on the page
so that's project emporia we've had a
lot of fun building it and learning to
use Windows Phone and we're looking
forward to the feedback from our users
if you'd like to try it go to ww prg
emporio calm or download the app from
the windows phone marketplace under
project emporia so we're really excited
about this whole set of projects around
re using data from social networks and
how we can apply that data and make it
useful for people in all different
aspects of life from work to personal
news to learning and just having fun
thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
