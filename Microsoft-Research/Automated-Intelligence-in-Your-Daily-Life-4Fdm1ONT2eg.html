to give computers the capabilities to
see here learn analyze respond in ways
that are more more intelligent machine
learning is a core aspect of artificial
intelligence research focus on taking
large amounts of data and building
predictive models or classifiers that
can interpret the world the way a smart
person might be able to interpret the
world even better sometimes when people
interact with others we know they're
smart they learned from past
interactions well as machines are
becoming a little smarter we're using
machine learning to help them improve
the interaction with humans right now
we're observing that more and more data
becomes available online and one great
challenge is how can we process these
huge amounts of data and so we're
looking at what we call the scalability
problem how can we make use of all this
very valuable data in order to create
experiences for the user that are useful
for them at being team we have taken
full advantage of so many years of
greedy research from MSR and we can
really leverage the power of machine
learning to figure out at a personal
level what the user is really looking
for and what kind of the result can we
actually provide to the user we want to
create flexible adaptive software that
can help people in a variety of
different situations we invest in this
area because it is challenging it is a
great unknown it also has the
opportunity of having the results of
these explorations translate into much
better experiences for our customers I
think I machine learning is becoming so
ubiquitous and the so importance and I
really feel like you know we're just
that it's very beginning with
we searched you know what we can really
do for the users the biggest changes
will see in the world will come from
computer science over the next several
decades to come from machine learning
and intelligence in particular i believe
and I've always felt like we're betting
that future at Microsoft is searchable
this work is important because it's the
future is the future of humanity is the
future of humanity dealing with
computers it's that simple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
