which is a platform for hosting slack
and messenger BOTS we're focused on
developers and giving developers the
freedom to build bots as they want so we
launched BOTS as containers we autoscale
those containers we handle like key and
token management and continuous
integration continuous delivery similar
to like a Heroku type experience or even
like the lambda timeline you do a get
push we build and rapidly auto deploy
your bought within seconds so what am I
talked about today actually so this is
me again beep boop so slack and
messenger bots some of these slides may
look different cuz I just realized I
don't have the fonts on Ben's computer
so we'll see how that turns out and
again we launched BOTS as containers so
as developers you can bring whatever
framework whatever language you want and
we'll build and deploy your code and so
but I want to talk about beep boop want
to talk about something a little bit
different and that we're always
challenged with this idea that BOTS need
to be intelligent and the expectations
that were held to as these BOTS need to
be really intelligent and our users get
really frustrated when they're not
intelligent and i think you know i love
this quote from yong lacuna who made
this comment after the Alpha go
occurrence where he basically said if
intelligence was a cake and if
unsupervised learning was the cake and
supervised learning was the icing on the
cake and reinforced learning was the
cherry we can make we can't make the
cake like we can we can make the icing
and the cherry but we can't even make
the cake like in reality and so the
expectations that people have and even
we're putting on ourselves and what
everybody else is saying that should
happen with bots like we can't even make
the cake and so this is really like your
AI chop Bob that's supposed to be this
spaceship this amazing spaceship and
everybody when they have a chat bot they
put AI before it they're like my my AI
chat bot is really like this cart with
bicycle wheels that looks like it's been
sitting in a yard for 42 years maybe
it's it's close to that and so maybe
we're just doing it wrong like we're
thinking about these things in the
way and so I'd like to encourage us to
kind of start to think differently about
these things and so Arthur Kessler in
the ghost in the machine coined this
term called a hole on which was concept
of something that was simultaneously
apart and a hole that was autonomous and
self-reliant and had a degree of
Independence but could participate sort
of in a network of things but handle
contingencies without higher authority
etc and so with that in mind if you take
you know this is common use case of
here's this body doesn't even give you
the weather he just gives you the
temperature all right and what's here
you have a user that asks in natural
language for the temperature in the
bottom respond to the temperature and
what is oops my fonts are gone so you
can't see my bolt highlighting but
what's significant here is you know we
do basic intent matching and the
extraction to say you're looking for the
temperature at this particular time at
this particular place and the bot
responds with some pleasantries but
basically with the temperature and so if
you take a step back and say well what
if it wasn't a human asking that in
natural language achat perspective what
if what if it's just another body and we
kind of flipped the script right so we
say that our BOTS need to understand
natural language but we respond in
language as well and so what if the bot
asks the question of what the
temperature is and maybe in a more
structured way that's actually easier to
understand uncen you could conceivably
see that you could have some BOTS and
this one's named um that asks for what
the temperature is and the bot responds
and he does you know Nou on the response
and parses out the temperature super
simple use case though and let's say we
want to do something a little bit more
involved or interesting which is just
like I want to ask the bot just hey do
something because I think we focus so
much on the conversation we build bots
that we miss the fact that you know BOTS
can be these great things that are like
sight unseen I think like the best
conversation you could have is the one
that you don't have to have and we focus
so much on the conversation I want BOTS
to do things for me that I don't have to
talk to unless it's really important or
high-value so what if I ask the bot to
say hey tell me when I should just dress
for the weather like watch out for me be
mine
and do that for me you got it Candace
then some time later the bot says yo
Candace don't forget your umbrella today
we can say well how did how did how did
um know this and how could we actually
build this and just so here's a thought
experiment so what if we have this back
channel and we have these multiple bots
in the back channel and one is called
Cal and colleges chimes in every time
Candice has an appointment upcoming for
the day and like oh look Candice has a
meeting is meeting your brother for
lunch in the mission today and Tempe
sees that and sees the location is like
oh wait the temperature in San Francisco
around lunch time is going to be 64
degrees and we have yet another bot
that's that's in this back channel that
sees that and goes up there's an
eighty-five percent chance of rain today
in San Francisco something's happening
in San Francisco they're just reacting
to what's happening in this channel and
responding and um goes oh wait San
Francisco chance of rain I better tell
Candace that she's going to need her
umbrella and then she messages Candice
to say yo Candice bring your umbrella
today thank you you're the best right
and that happened by this sort of riddle
composition of things happening in this
back channel and you can see you know
other things could to sort of happen as
well but it's I like to refer like think
about this is kind of this ticker tape
right and it's if you remember the old
ticker tape stock quotes getting printed
and if a channel is like a ticker-tape
you could have both BOTS observing and
humans observing or writing and
observing to the ticker tape so anybody
could write to this tape and it's just
this history that's happened right so
bots in people and so this the example I
gave was just bots in a channel but you
could think about what you mean can jump
into that channel as well and it's
actually the way that we're building the
inner workings of beep boop we're
building we're out but we don't have any
administrative UI we're building all of
administrative functions as little BOTS
that go and do things we can integrate
is or we can sort of integrate and talk
to those BOTS especially we don't have
functions that humans do at the moment
we talked to bots and trigger things and
then we figure out what language works
and how it works and we were starting to
add bots to do things that we're doing
like generating invoicing at the end of
the month and so
you know this is maybe what that looks
like is I can just just see Zalman talks
to it one very specific things does sort
of Helana core like monadic of like does
one thing and do it one thing well
button behind of this is sort of chaos
that's happening and reacting and then
so if you could let yourself assume that
that's possible you know then even you
know greater and greater more complex
things it can be created out of
composition of this style of development
and you know I go back to Marvin Minsky
who wrote in the Society of mine and
talks about intelligence that we're
trying to create this it's it's not this
one thing it's not like the intelligent
AI Siri chat bot that can do everything
answer every question for me under every
scenario it's not any one trick but it
really stems from this vast diversity
and not like one single perfect
principle and so back to me Oh Kessler
with his idea of this whole on that if
we think of these spots potentially the
cheerless channels on talk to each other
that we have been forming these like
synaptic networks or these these whole
our keys of bots that communicate with
each other which is like what the like
are you kidding me right like this is
either like terrifying or absolutely
ridiculous it's very it's potentially
very brittle it brings all sorts of
questions about privacy and like where
they have first-party data third-party
data etc right now we're expending
experimenting with this and it's
actually been a lot of fun it's been
interesting very much in a first-party
way in our own trusted channel and in
addition you have to be aware of things
like the left pad bot if any is familiar
with happened a few months ago in the
node community there but anyway we're
sort of on this journey we're building
beep boop as a way for people and
developers to be able to build and share
BOTS and we think it's really
interesting and what to do so join us on
the journey we've got kind of a long way
to go so thanks everybody
