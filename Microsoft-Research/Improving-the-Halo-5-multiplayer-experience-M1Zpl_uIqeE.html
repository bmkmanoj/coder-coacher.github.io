system it's pretty much the world's
fastest so it's two to four orders of
magnitude faster than the competition in
terms of processing temporal data and
one of the teams that we've worked with
really closely is the halo team they've
been using trill for about a year now to
process their customer data their game
telemetry data and just over the
holidays this year they released the
halo 5 beta and they used the other demo
that we're showing here today which is
tempe to basically explore the data and
learn about what customers were doing as
they were playing the beta game so what
they were interested in was looking at
the the frequency of how often the game
players were winning these really rare
metals the thing they found really
interesting was this combat Evolved
metal now what this metal involves to
win this a player has to throw a grenade
and explode a weapon to themselves and
catch it and use it but what they were
seeing by analyzing the customer data in
tempe is they were seeing this was
happening really frequently like every
few minutes somebody was getting this
metal and that didn't make any sense to
them right so then what they could do
was dig in to the customer data and
actually watch what happened they
basically replayed this game move and
they saw here's the player and the
player throws this grenade you'll see it
gets round and there's the explosion and
they just walk over and pick up the
weapon off the floor so that really
wasn't what they intended with this
metal by basically using trill and Tempe
they were able to discover this bug in
the logic of the awarding of metals this
really allows the team to be in constant
and really fast contact with what's
going on with the customer so as
customers are doing things like playing
the game may be experiencing glitches
they can find out about it really fast
find the root cause really fast and then
fix it
game over victory
