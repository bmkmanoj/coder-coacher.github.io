you
well it's a great pleasure to welcome at
Nicola from beautiful sienna and he's
going to speak to us about lottery
auctions and he's going to be spending a
sabbatical here for next few months in
Cambridge so Nicola welcome and over to
you okay thank you very much Peter
really pleased to be here and I hope
this will generate some interest on your
part so I actually belong to a
department of economic sincere economics
and statistics and the talk yeah so the
talk is going to be about lottery
auctions something which perhaps is not
very common as a as a as a denomination
in the lower chat but oh I hope I'll be
able to to to show you that it's
actually more commonly thing let me just
give you a little bit of a motivation on
why I became interested in lottery
auctions this is part of my academic
interest in auctions only one hand and
on the other hand is also part of my
experience I've been as an adviser I've
been advising the Italian procurement
agency this which is centralizing which
is located in Rome for about five years
from 2003 2008 that was a very
interesting experience it was a almost
newborn agency the idea was to
centralize procurement of goods and
services of course not works in large
contracts in Rome for the whole public
sector in order to exploit economies of
scale and save money and so cut some of
the button public debt in Italy which is
one of the highest email domain may hurt
in any any in Europe and I think the
whole in the whole world so there was
the kind of operation I was asked to
collaborate with it as more research
unit which was feedback in upon thee
the rest of the agency on how to design
these big options right and and so the
curiosity about lotteries came when we
started to think about how to organize
these auctions and let me just tell you
that if you use price only auctions
namely options based only on price where
you award a contract based on Leon the
on price the typical procurement option
would be lowest price i mean the lowest
price gets the contract to provide a
certain certain supply of goods or
services and the contractor will receive
from the contracting authority exactly
their price which he or she submitted so
that's the lowest price so obvious that
we wouldn't need even to talk about it
but in fact we know as economist and its
computer story that there are other
formatting virtually infinite formats
that you could use perhaps with better
virtues like the second lowest price
second lowest in the procurement because
you do you go reverse of course but the
problem is until me and other two or
three economists in the research unit
started to talk with the legal guys the
legal people saying why don't we think
about other formats and you say oh no no
no f's too dangerous we got to be suited
all the time because the european
directive on public procurement which
regulates the whole activity throughout
the country's speaks about awarding the
contract to the best offer it doesn't
say what price should be paid it says a
woody the counter to the best price to
the best offer in case of price only and
so if we start you know mixing up around
with different rules rather than the
lowest price it could be dangerous it
could be it could be dangerous in the
same
that we could enter into legal disputes
with which we don't want but then I
insisted myself I said why why why don't
we consider other kind of you know other
kind of formats for instance the bakery
but even other I mean even even the only
weakly so to speak the week is quite
well known in some sense and the weekly
let me just anticipate the second lowest
price would be very very important in
procurement if we could use it properly
because your type in their context would
be the biggest cost the firm's cost and
is it if as a as a procurement agent as
a contracting authority you would have
information on the firm's on the cost of
the firm's that would be very precious
and important information because you
will know what what is a reasonable
margin for that for them to to enjoy
profit margin I mean and so on and so
forth at would be extremely important
because you don't want to kill your
suppliers of course but on the other
hand you don't want them to enjoy too
big a profit margin so the difficult
part in procurement is to find the right
the reserve price I mean the right
profit margin to for them to enjoy so I
started to think about other models
that's what is then you said again don't
you need sorry if if the information is
going to be kind of used in some sort of
repeated you're awake you're doing this
then
Luke I did not clear that Vickery
actually does have all those nice yeah
yeah but they don't use big really what
yeah they don't use weekly actually
would be important information weekly
auction i agree with you as is very rare
in fact and there is a literature why is
it rare and one of the reasons why this
rare it's it's virtual mainly you're
naturally tend to say the truth they are
mainly to review to bid your costs which
is saying the truth so it's kind of I
would myself have kind of mixed feelings
about using bakery options but perhaps
on a single shot you're right in a
repeated context it would be different
because they would learn that they
naturally reveal the truth and perhaps
at some point they wouldn't reveal the
truth but anyway so we were just think
about you know different formats etc so
I start to think I started to think
about lotteries because lotteries in
other contexts are actually quite
popular a particular fundraising and
national lottery is like you know when
you buy tickets and trying to win a big
prize that's a governmental it's not the
government's don't use that this kind of
mechanism that's governmental and so I
started to you know to to reflect upon
the fact that being used that they must
enjoy some nice properties which I
didn't see very much is flawed in the
literature until I came across these
three papers and there are two or three
more not very many more a listing the
economics literature to Blizzard shown
the properties of lotteries John Morgan
who is actually gain theorists at
Berkeley business school gori is a Dutch
very very famous now back in Europe he
was a contact at that time and boss is a
young as a young assistant professor
don't remember where i think in
in maybe Germany but they are the few
ones who studied lotteries for
fundraising fundraising their word
actually support they can you know the
provisional Republic good but nobody
actually did as far as I know lotteries
in sale auctions or advertising options
so let me just go ahead so what I want
to do today is just a short presentation
I have two incomplete papers going on
parallel so what I'm going what I'm
going to do is to try to give you an
idea what I'm doing now on these 32
papers by talk about three simple models
where I'm trying to address three kind
of fundamental questions in auction
theory in general that I will want to
transfer into this lottery auction arena
so to speak so the first question I want
to want to address its revelation now we
were talking about Vickrey auction
before so the question I want to address
is there any kind of second price
lottery mechanism that would reveal
values as as much as the victory option
does in a natural way so that's the kind
of question I want to start with the
second question could be even more
important to some extent using lotteries
would you as an auctioneer obtain better
results and higher revenues in other
words then using some more standard
options such as Vicki or first prize and
third question it's kind of provoking
question due largely options always
exist and I'll show you what what I mean
in
something non-standard Google you're
telling me lose revenue equivalence
doesn't just apply to your your second
point sue together what what what what
is special about your setting that
revenue of the looms just doesn't make
the answer no to your second question
well you'll see it okay okay so
revelation and you see already that the
title this part is mirror revelation
because the kind of relation that I'm
going to discuss we doing the simple
model that I imagine sequence simple
second prize lottery model that I
imagine and you can imagine virtually
infinite ways of second prize type of
lottery models that the model that I
imagine would give rise to a strange
kind of Revelation but there will be
revelation and you would have a trade
off with respect the kind of Revelation
you have in a standard victory option so
that's I mean this valid points
summarize the motivation behind is there
any second prize for more lottery
auction that would give rise to some
kind of Revelations kind of general
question of so precise as in victory so
in other words the main question is is
second prize whatever then may the
mechanism the second x mechanism you're
actually considering revealing values in
some of different kind of fields or
models so his revelation intrinsic to
second prize mechanism and in particular
I want to investigate this in lottery
type of models but if you if you if you
go a step further and you go here and
you will immediately have
a negative example because second prize
all pay options with complete
information so the simplest situation
you can imagine which is called war of
attrition provides you immediately with
it with a negative example namely
bathing your own value it's not even a
nash equilibrium that modern leave it
alone and weakly dominating strategy as
envy cream so I was tenacious and
address the quest in any way and to see
whether in lotteries you can have so
what I'm going to present is a very
simple model which was motivated by
parallel work which I'm doing together
with a former student of mine and now in
the University of Bologna jugal Zanella
we actually modeled the siena horse race
which is called the Palio I'm not sure
whether some of you have heard about
this medieval race which is going on for
about 400 years now almost continuously
we have a huge database daily in the
municipal archives that's that's very
reliable you can't cheat on that because
otherwise it would be it will be
practiced by your your your opponent's
in in Siena anyway so we modeled that as
a as a as a contest in particular as a
ton of contest that t'loak is a is a is
a buzzword here colic is an economist
who proposed a certain form of
probability to model contest type of
situations and I'm actually going to use
his proposal to model the probability
with which you would win in this lottery
option that I'm going to to to to
discuss and I'm going to consider a very
simple setup with two bidders just to
just to get in size private money
complete information not incomplete
incomplete is kind of nasty even with
two players and let me just anticipate
aight the results before i go into the
model with to within this very simple
setup the main difference it's in so
fired revelation between life simple
second prize lottery option model and
the weekly standard model is that you
can still have revelation in some sense
in my model with lottery auction however
that's that's why I called the mirror
revelation in the meaningful equilibrium
of my model you wouldn't reveal your own
value you would reveal my value and I
would reveal your value so there will be
a mirror in this sense I would reveal
yours you would reveal mind in the
meaningful and specify in a second what
meaningful is so that's why I called the
mirror that's a strange I wouldn't I
didn't know what to expect when I
started to wear play around with this
model but that came out and I'm you know
I'm confident on yet on the other hand
so you have mirror no direct in weekly
you you beat your value I beat my value
video value here I bid you value you
beat my value so it's indirect its
mirror so if you want to use this model
to to have the players reveal their
values in the model in the game then you
would have to assume that they know each
other values of course that's a strong
assumption sometimes you don't even know
your volume it could be a strong
assumption but but in certain occasions
it could be acceptable because if we
know each other very well I would know
how much you're willing to pay you would
know how much I'm willing to pay because
we know each other since a long time so
if you if you are happy to accept the
idea that they know each other values in
this model that I'm that I'm discussing
okay there would be a
precise revelation in a sense that I'm
going to tell you then in a week okay in
a sense they are going to tell you in a
few second however in this second prize
lottery model directly relations not
even a Nash equilibrium leave it alone
to be a weekly donating strategy so you
completely lose direct revelation in
that in this lottery model an efficiency
would not be guaranteed as well as you
unlike the weekly model well you know in
the weakly dominated strategy you would
you would assign the object to to the to
the efficiently to the to the player
with the highest value so just to
summarize the trade-off insofar as
revelation the question they are
dressing with this very simple story
revelation of values the trade-off
between my model second prize lottery
and that's just one possibility of
imagining second prize losses we can
discuss about that and the standard
weekly would be you would gain some
procedural regulations in equilibrium
and i'll tell you what i mean by that
but you will lose week dominance and
directly relation which you would enjoy
in the Vickery okay so that's the kind
of trade-off okay so what is the model
that I've been anticipating well it's a
very simple its simplest setup you can
imagine she'll beat complete information
to players warning the visible object on
sale right these are the values of the
two players having equality would
trivialize everything so this is the
older this is an upper bound which is
common knowledge and plays a kind of
crucial role here so if there was
infinity here infiniti the whole story
the ontario will work so in
vacations who can imagine perhaps that
the auctioneer would impose the bead to
be below a certain very high it doesn't
really matter how high you have to
impose you must be an afternoon so what
is the mechanism the mechanism is simple
is like standard for standard still beat
I submit my bead in a sealed envelope
you submit your bead in a sealed
envelope the auctioneer would open the
envelopes publicly and would open the
envelopes i will look at prices however
you will not assign the object at that
point that's why the lottery element
comes it would not have signed the
object at that point he would draw the
winner randomly with this probability
okay be one is the price which I
submitted be tues device that you
submitted okay so that's the probability
that's the tarlac probability in other
words you're going to be drawn as winner
you've got to be drawn as winner with
the probability which is proportional to
what you beat and negatively related to
what the opponent bit okay so that's a
pretty pretty widespread used type of
probability formula so that's player one
will win the option with this
probability player two will win the
option with a probability if they'd both
be zero conventionally you set up a half
probability of being drawn as women
please confusing something here so from
what I understand why wouldn't each
player bit as high as possible we have a
higher probability of winning you lose
you'll see what is the best require okay
okay so okay so that's a half so
just reminding here where these forms
come from it terms listed suffice
economics is concerned I'm showing must
must have been using computer somewhere
I don't know where but by Gordon t'loak
is a public finance type of guy who
actually became famous only reason I
mean he was famous at this time he
became very famous now that political
economy and namely economics related to
to to politics is became kind of popular
area of studying economics because at
his time I mean in the 80s he was
proposing this kind of probability to
model situations where you are lobbying
a politician for instance or you are
seeking to gain some rent so this in
that contest would be your investment to
lobby the politician this would be my
investment and I would win the lobbying
race with this probability maybe I will
give a gift you will give another gift
he can only make one favor and I and we
will win probabilistically this race
which you know with the probability
which is proportional to the gift we
gave so that's the idea and you can use
that for investment race among firms etc
section so that's kind of popular also
that's the third model I hope to have
time to discuss also this especial would
be typical in a national lottery for you
to win the probability with which you
win is number the ticket see what which
you can interpret as the numerator of
this story divided by the total number
of tickets right okay so on oh sorry
this used to be here I don't know why he
shifted over there but anyway so you
whew if you don't have some costs namely
you don't have an old pay but you're
rather standard a type of action the
free steak player won the prophet of
player 1 can take two values his value
minus as the second price story so the
if he wins because it's drawn and he's
drawn with this probability right if he
wins he doesn't pay his own price but it
pays the second drawn price now since we
are dealing with a two players model the
second drawn draft price would obviously
be the only opponents price so you only
have one opponent there's nothing to be
drawn in to see what the price you have
to pay is so you would pay v1 you would
enjoy v1 minus b2 in case you win and
you win with this probability otherwise
you you don't pay anything that is not
an all pay okay there's no sound costs
with this probably so you're expected
profit would be this very simple
expression now hope I can answer your
question about why don't you eat so this
would be the best reclined is very
simple very simple I haven't drawn a
figure but it's simple to draw the best
reply or play one against player to BB&amp;amp;B
to would be any positive number if your
opponent doesn't beat suppose you think
your opponent doesn't buy tickets
whatever the interpretation then you buy
at least one ticket and you can buy many
more so we'll see we'll see the
intuition if your if your opponent beats
strictly between zero and your value
strictly between 0 and y over then you
beat the maximum that's what that's your
answer you want to win in that case
that's why he you beat the maximum if
you be if your opponent did you beat
your value
if your opponent be giovanni then you
beat any number and we'll see why if
your opponent bit above your value then
you don't beat it's just kind of
different from standard auctions perhaps
non equilibrium but as opposed here are
the equilibrium pletely rationality no
because everything is maximizing here so
best reply is in the standard sense if I
expect you to do something I will
maximize my profit really that's not
possible as it as the yesterday we're
not talking out of equilibria absolutely
anything is boss what do you mean so
what what would you what would you say
is possible out of equilibrium for
example just right it's not an
equilibrium for both people to bid
truthfully in most options however if
everyone bids truthful you're not going
to violate individual rationality but it
looks like here you can't violate
individual ration it could be dangerous
here to be truthfully and you'll see why
in when I want to interpret the
intuition behind the equilibria and in
this equilibria I find the mirror
revelation story that I'm going to tell
you about so the equilibria of this game
is made of three triples right the top
and the third actually symmetrical
discuss only one of them but the
interesting one for us is this you see I
beat yours you bid mine that's the
mirror that's the mirror revelation I
beat your value you beat my value and
that's the mirror revelation and what is
the difference between this and the
other two which would justify my saying
that he or revelation is more precise
what is the difference this is the only
equilibrium where they be positive
prices so if you as an auctioneer would
wear
would observe okay this is a mother
there's no reserve price opposing in
practice this would be very low rather
than zero he would participate with a
very low price if you if you if you
observe that somebody is actually
beating the reserve price which is very
low then you would realize that they're
not revealing any any any any value it's
only if they be the positive price not
necessarily close to the result price
that you immediately events that they
are revealing each other values in in
the model in formal terms this is the
only equilibrium where they be positive
price so whenever you see positive
prices revelation is unambiguous if you
think about it this is not in victory
I'm going to because in weekly it is
true that in weekly bidding truthfully
is a weakly dominating strategy which
means you would never regret exposed to
have bid your value that's what it means
weekly donate is that you have no regret
as opposed to have video but you could
have done any better by doing that but
it's also true that Weekly has got
infinite other equilibria Nash
equilibria where people and we were
saying before may not be their own
because it's too easy to beat your own
then you want to crowd out your your
your opponent you don't be 0 so
observing positive prices in a weekly
option it doesn't necessarily mean that
you are extracting their values unless
you assume that every time they play the
weakly dominating strategy which
normally we do in the literature in the
literature when you analyze the expected
value of whatever of the weekly ocean
you assume that they play the weekly the
weekly the way Australia they be
truthful but in real life they may not
so you may get garbled so to speak Oh
crowded out by the fact that they may
play another equilibrium in
victory which is kind of unnatural but
still existing so why is what is the
intuition behind these two equilibria
that's a featuring the feature this kind
of model of this kind of luxury model
look at this equilibrium okay you don't
beat I bid above your value okay why is
this an equilibrium well suppose you are
playing too and you expect me to read
above your value okay so what do you
want to do you don't want to win because
what does it mean not weigh it what does
it mean to win to win means that you're
randomly drawn as window and then you
would have to pay a price which is above
your volume which is b1 so certainly you
don't want to win ok and now in this
model unlike standard models for you to
be sure not to win is not enough to beat
below your opponent because you can
still be drawn as winner even if you're
below you have lower probability to be
drawn but you can still be drawn with
positively you have to be 0 to be sure
not to win you don't have to beat
basically that's the difference with
respect to standard options it's not
enough to be below you have to not to
participate in some sense or almost not
to participate you have to reduce as
much as possible your probability of
being drawn as winner because if you win
you have to pay this price which is
about your value and you make negative
profits well that's why so if you expect
this you would be this and vice versa if
you expect player to not to not to beat
then you certainly want to win and you
beat above this value to discourage him
to outbid you so to speak
and the same is here symmetrically but
the interesting part for us is this
revelation why is this in equilibrium
well if I expect you to beat my value if
I expect you to be my Valley fray to
expect the player one expects to to beat
v1 right he will get zero profit think
about it will get zero profit whether he
wins or loses because if he wins and
he's drawn as winner he would have to
pay v1 and so his profit would be v1
minus v1 equal to zero if he's not drawn
as winner it would have zero profit
anyway so whatever he beats he would had
zero profit so any bead is best reply
included leading the opponent value and
vice versa so that's the equip and it's
the only equilibrium with positive
prices so it would be a precise
revelation in this sense of the values
we call this mirror revelation I just
want to make few other sort of comments
on this this equilibria are also
equilibria in the standard Vickrey
auction so they don't come out of the
head like a rabbit they're dead already
but you can you can say that they are in
something selected among the equilibria
in the big reaction through the lottery
so the lottery you can think of the
lottery as a selection mechanism in some
sense out of the satellite we live in a
big reaction is selects those whether
you like it or not selects those in
using what I call here a behavioral
discontinuity which is what I was
hinting at before maybe if you want to
lose here is not enough to beat below
you have to be zero if you
want to lose for sure ok that's a
discontinuity in some sense that's what
I ok so the revealing outcome isn't
didn't said attack delivery a vector of
Vickery you know the direct revelation
is not even in equilibrium here the
mirror revelation of the new revelation
is is in the Vickrey auction is one of
the equilibria it's a as a randomized
there are just a pure strategy you can
think of positive probability of both
people winning run if you beat if you
beat this in the ring tone if you beat
this in the victory he would win and
would pay this so this is certainly less
reply so this is best if I against that
individually because if you if you beat
this you pay this and you get zero
profit so that's fine you couldn't do
any better than zero wait sorry let's
let's rephrase it suppose your player
two ok and you imagine player one
bidding your value ok so what is your
best reply if you beat above you win and
you pay v2 so your profit would be zero
if you beat below you lose and you pray
that you get zero so any beat would be
in the victory a best reply included the
opponent's value so this is this is
easier that will be having any promises
that the outcome results from the bed
yeah now the result goes through with
modular forms of probability for the
lottery with which the the winner is
actually drawn as long as it's
positively related to his own beat and
negatively related to
opponent speed so it is not conditional
upon the particular form of the talak
probability is just any other
probability with which those properties
are maintained would do now let me just
make a short observation why should the
option here care about complicating his
own life this much why shouldn't he use
victory okay let's compare the revenue
of the auctioneer in the too revealing
equilibria so the direct revelation
equilibrium in victory verses the mirror
revelation in in in my model in the
middle revelation equilibrium the option
here will get this much expected profit
in the direct revelation equilibrium in
the victory he would get the second
highest value of course because you bid
your own value and so the second highest
value would be the revenue of the
auctioneer and this is larger than that
these is larger than that so if you if
you confine yourself to comparing the
mirror revelation in this second price
loss work with a standard revenue in
with the revenue started Vickrey auction
the lottery would dominate would
dominate in this still revealing
equilibrium would dominate the victory
why is it so because you have a positive
probability of guessing v1 which you
wouldn't have in the victory so that's
why on average you get more now I had a
conjecture here I have a nasty thing so
the question that I address here would
it be possible to have positive prices
which are not in pure strategies by
rather in randomized strategy mixed
strategy mixed strategy Nash equilibria
they would not reveal the answer is
conjectural for now because I've done
simulation yeah I need to have a closed
form of this it's more complicated than
I thought but I mean no simulation that
Iran gave me a yes so there's no way to
get confused so what happens with n
players let me just go through briefly
so suppose you have n players now now
you see the second price mechanism more
explicitly because you don't have just a
single opponent but a bunch of opponents
right so player I now with at a profit
function which is structured in this way
if it wins and he wins with this
probability composed probability he
would get this so in other words he
would get VI minus B K where K is one of
these upon would be the one of his
opponents if he's drawn as winner and he
would be drawn as winner with this
probability and on top of it and then
you exclude the winner from the second
drawer to determine the price the price
he would be paying would be BK with this
probability which is BK over the total
of the baits minus the winner bit so
it's a compound probability ok so the
mechanism let me just to make to make it
precise to be clear the make this the
second price mechanism that I am
imagining here is not the second highest
price among the opponents it's the
second wrong that determines what price
you're going to to pay so the first draw
will determine the
then you exclude the big of the winner
redraw again that will determine the the
price so you can get any price with any
K price except the one for the winner
with this probability so the expected
profit will get a similar expression
here before you had V V 1 minus b2 now
you have VI minus the expected beads of
your point so this expression here EB
minus is the expected beads of your
opponent's the best reply has got the
similar structure accepted rather than
be to you have your spected bead of your
opponents and we have this very simple
proposition you have mirror revelation
equilibria here where the revelation is
made by the expected beads of your
opponents and you can prove it exists
the problem with end players is that you
may have some mirror revelation
equilibrium where some zeros now can
appear so they could be ambiguity in
Revelation but there is another
conjecture that says in the completely
familiar with n players and equilibrium
profile of beads is a mirror regulation
equilibrium if and only if it doesn't
contain the maximum okay so if you
observe a bunch of beads as an
auctioneer and no V Bar is there that is
a mirror regulation equilibrium so the
average bead of player eyes opponent
will tell you the value of player eyes
opponent it's a complicated story but
that's what it is okay let me so how
much time about the ten minutes I have
to rush second point I want to address
can I can I get higher revenue in
lottery options answer yes in an even
simpler story so consider again the same
model that I just
explore and in a more standard way
namely your drone is winner with this
probability okay however you don't pay
the second wrong price but you pay your
own price so if I'm drawn is winner and
I bid 10 I'm gonna pay 10 that's a much
more common model used in the literature
okay you can look at this very nice
survey on contests and lottery bike I
car ride is also a public economists who
did a lot of work in the field using the
tarlac probability to model political
contests then you can only count so
rather than having be to hear you have
been one now this model is quite well
known in the literature when the two
players at the same value but here I
want to play around with different
values v1 and v2 so if if the one would
be equal to v2 the whole model would be
kind of simple but surprisingly enough
if you if the two values differ as I
want them to be the model gets slightly
more nasty okay so these are the two
best require functions and there is a
unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium
okay which will have to satisfy this
equation you you put you put together
two best replies you solve the system
you try to solve the system would be
easy to solve the system with equal vs
it slightly more complicated if the v's
are not the same like in this case but
what you can say is that in equilibrium
the one with the higher value would be
higher than the one with the lower value
in this interval be one-third be to
third if the two V's would be the same
there would be a unique Nash equilibrium
as
is most common in the literature exactly
equal to V divided by 3 but here is in
between that so it follows I'm not going
to have time to going to you say that if
v1 is large enough and I have a bound
here which is perhaps even to high as a
band I think we can reduce this bound if
v1 is large enough then the expected
revenue of the lottery option which
would be this in equilibrium the
expected revenue of the lottery auction
would be higher than the revenue in the
Vickrey auction okay so let me let me
just summarize what I'm doing here I
take a very common model lottery auction
model where the winner is drawn at
random and he pays his own price there
is a unique Nash equilibrium in pure
strategies and if v1 is large enough
namely if the two values are far enough
from each other basically if the two
values are far enough from each other
there is a bigger symmetry basically
then the revving the expected revenue
for the option area in a lottery would
be higher than what he would get if
instead of a lottery it would sell the
object through a Vickrey auction okay so
there is room for revenue improvement a
list at this basic complete information
level okay so that's the second point I
wanted to address and now the last point
are just carrying over quickly because
there's another seminar in five minutes
but this is kind of intriguing we often
say why do we buy a ticket for a lottery
right and there's no point in buying a
ticket and yet lots of people buy
tickets
and lots of money is actually transacted
through lotteries so I'm addressing this
question why national title lotteries
exist what do I mean by national title
lotteries I mean to consider lotteries
which unlike standard lotteries were you
as a bigger you enter the lottery having
in mind your value in it okay you know
how much you're willing to pay at most
so you know in some sense your prize in
that lottery in a national lottery often
not always often the price you're going
to get is actually proportional to the
total amount of money raised by the
agency that organizes the lottery right
so it's proportional to the total
investment made by the pivots so in the
national lottery prizes namely your
value is endogenously determined namely
determined by the beats so you don't
enter the auction knowing how much is
going to be the price the price would
often depends a month often depend upon
how much money has been raised by the
organizer so just think about this
simple model right so suppose you you
buy tickets your player I you x TI
tickets each ticket costs p pounds so
you're going to invest this much amount
of money which i call L for lot okay so
suppose the organizer uses them the
money raised to give prices and it would
keep prices to prices in this simple
moment would give a share of the money
raised which is alpha 1 to the first
prize and a share of the money raised
which is alpha 2 to the second price and
of course I for one would be higher than
alpha 2 because this is first this is
second price but you would have to get
some profits so the sum of the
shares cannot be one it would retain
some money as an organizer and so this
is the total amount of solid this is
t 1 sorry this is t 1 rather than l1 so
anyway so this would be a speaker is
coming this would be the prophet for you
as player 1 suppose there are only two
prophets you would get both prices with
this probability you will get the
highest price with this probability you
will get the second highest price with
this probability you wouldn't get any
fries with this probability and these
are the relative profits right you're
expected value would be this at the end
of the day would be divs so you have to
choose your investment l1 you have to
maximize this function and to maximize
this function is L 1 equals 0 so in
other words that is part of the answer
to the original question why do national
lotteries exist is crazy to play to buy
tickets and national lottery this tells
you yes it would be crazy if your risk
neutral and if the lottery would be
organized in such a way that the prices
would be set out of the total investment
and the organizer will retain some money
for himself in that case lotteries
should not exist so that's the only
equilibrium but they do exist so why do
they exist what is the mechanism then
may incentive 8 now for instance you may
have an explanation Allah Morgan namely
a provisional public good with the
revenues the public who enters your
utility function so your utility
function is raised if some money is not
distributed as prices because it
re-enters in your welfare through the
public good I'm just going to skip this
but another thing would be to imagine
what happens in reality you have a
jackpot so imagine the dynamics you have
a jackpot namely to
a the price would be depending upon how
much people invested today but also as
more amount of money coming from
yesterday's lottery which B is going to
be reinvested into the prices today and
that would generate lotteries so let's
conclusions there's a lot of work to be
done it's an interesting field I think
it's it's not well understood yet we
understand contests which are very much
in a relative very very close Constance
countless theory is very very close and
it's well developed but I think that is
not enough to understand what happens if
you want to sell stuff or buy stuff
using lotteries there's a lot of work to
be done and it's kind of interesting and
promising I will stop it here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
