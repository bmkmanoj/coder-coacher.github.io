big dream is to start a female
revolution and change the face of
computer science forever
hi my name is Cassandra Mauro my big
dream is to be a naval officer but more
specifically I pledge allegiance to the
flag of the United States of America
what you want into America it's for
people who are really dedicated to their
country to their academics I don't know
I just fell in love with it we often
think to ourselves oh I have to be
better than every male they put me up
against I could go all the way back to
kindergarten where they told me that I
couldn't play Legos because I was a girl
there's no greater pleasure in life than
doing something people tell you you
can't do our project was an application
that targets dyslexic children and their
parents and that's what we are basically
trying to do is to use the massive and
impressive advancement of technology to
solve mobility we are now
we're coming
I think my biggest dream I really want
to get into neuroscience I think is
becomes a reference engineer my victory
is I want to be someone's inspiration my
big dream is to get into a college and I
want to hear what cure big dreamers
educate a girl change the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
