lectures freely available
you
so today I am pleased to have a lead
here to give us a presentation he's has
this technique which I'm interested to
learn more about and he has a long
history whereas most people in speech
are either engineers or computer
scientists we're going to be addressed
today by a mathematician who has who has
been at the Paris University and it's uh
spent some time in Montreal spend some
time at MIT as a postdoc and is
currently in inria and it's all you
Thank You Yasha so thanks again for
welcoming me here and giving me this
opportunity to share this fundamental
research with you practical guys and
then as I said the osh I yesterday not
just today but when we have the wild
that ie I need some honest feedback
about what you think about to which I'm
going to talk about because of course
the purpose is to go further in more
interesting stuff so what I'm going to
present today is is the part of the PhD
work of wide huh Naga who is going to
defend in few weeks and with the
contribution of our pond with a topper
researcher in our group and you say yeah
my colleague with Huey co-founded the US
that team so just a team in book okay
there are that's the first
however I've been assimilated yeah so
gay which had said is written there in
line so and rocio stat team of Bordeaux
is working on nonlinear analysis of
complex system and signals using
principles and metals coming from
statistical physics and we have typical
application application right on your
physics and astrophysics imaging and
also some an Isis of art with data and
what I'm going to talk to you today
about is actually these new methods that
have been developed in this field of
remote sensing application I found at
some point that it is worth to give them
a try for speech signal so i will the
outline of my talk will be the following
i'm going to motivate why are we doing
this work and typically it's because of
not only non yachty a speck of speech
and that we want to look at speech as
the realization of complex system then i
would reduce the formalism that you work
we work it we work with which is the
called me mechanical mystic multiscale
formalism or MMF to summarize and
describe the basic principles behind
this formalism and see how we can apply
it to speech signals and then I will
show what we have achieved so far in
terms of applications so it will be on
fanatic segmentation GCI detections on
sparse prediction and multiples
excitation and then I've done some
conclusions and I hope that the
perspective will get lots of exchange so
I don't need to underline that you all
know that we classical speech processing
techniques they live in linear world
doing a bunch of assumption inherently
physically or two of them that
uncoupling between the vocal and
attractants speech source the laminar
Ichi of the air fro through the vocal
tract and and the pair the periodicity
of vibration of vocal folds but there is
it is established theoretically and
experimentally near effects in the
speech production mechanism so the and
typically the duties some tribute to
source signal during the production of
void fricatives so this with this the
laminar flow assumption fails and that
there is non linear feedback during
voicing and thus the glottal pulses are
not exactly very adik and they are
screwed in shape for plosives the
excitation is time spread and have a
turbulent component and the disc
coupling between the glottal airflow and
the vocal tract system when the glottis
open so the source and the filter does
not depend does not function
independently and these these nonlinear
phenomena giratina are emphasized in the
case of voice disorder where you have
strong complex nonlinear a periodicity
and turbulent non-gaussian randomness so
so if saying this we would like to look
at at speech from a non-linear signal
processing perspective and and mainly
the people that have been interested in
nonlinear speech processing the they
were looking at speech from in the
framework of nonlinear dynamical systems
and and typically the dynamical system
that share characteristic with
turbulence are called chaotic and there
have been bunch of tools developed in
the air in this area which is called
attic signal processing so give you a
brief recall about this so in chaotic
signal processing the speech signal is
assumed or the speech the production
vehicle mechanism is suitably dynamical
system which is government governed by
the equation there that where y is
multi-dimensional but which dynamic
dimensional system but which is unknown
and that the measurement we do that we
capture about speech are just one D
projection of this unknown highly
dimensional system and then in 91 there
was this existence theorem or the
embedding theorem which says that if you
take your speech signal and you take
time delays of the signal and you
consider this D dimensional space now
that this eck the multi-dimensional x
signal X shares common properties with
the unknown dynamics of y of n and these
common features are typically
correlation dimension fractal dimensions
s is the speech signal I saw I didn't
lose it yeah as is the the 1d speech
signal
so we're okay so s
so like we can think of why as the
articulator and s as the time series and
then this x somehow is related to the
originals yeah there are some common
features and probably the best known of
them is the Yeppoon Yeppoon of exponent
which is the characteristic of dynamical
system that remain intact under the
embed embedding procedure and and this
exponent characterize the degree of
chaos of the system so so if you compute
your lap yup enough exponent and find
that it is greater than zero then you
can say that your system is chaotic and
you're correct characterize its duty of
chaos city by the value of this positive
exponent when it is negative which means
that the system is not chaotic okay how
good is something in which you may
yes so I was going to to say this here
in the drawbacks is that actually this
theorem doesn't tell you has how to
choose it's an existence theorem it
doesn't tell you how to choose the time
delay Chi and the dimension D okay and
and these are very important quantities
to to to have good estimates of these
exponents so and and and moreover it
assumes the Shannara t assume that you
have subsection I'd it is only in this
case that this exponent have a real
meaning and and as I said so since the
the immediate area ms an existence
theorem it is really very difficult to
estimate this exponent and there is a
bunch of methods to do so and and there
are there is no consensus on what is the
best way to estimate this exponent and
you find contradictory results and
conclusions about and and even though
even though if you assume that you can
estimate them this quantity is just a
global quantity that gives global
description about the system and I think
that it's because of this difficulty in
measuring disk in estimating these
global measurements and in the weakness
of the information that it gathers that
these methods didn't have to the base of
my urges an impact in nonlinear speech
processing the size of a suspenseful
yeah it tells you it's it measures yeah
and the divergence rage of near bar
orbit so it assists bit the complexity
of the system without really saying more
so the question that that you've been
asking is that when not much me but
a physicist is that is all this
necessary to have these complicated
things to deal with and can we do more
simple and still have more comprehension
about our dynamical systems so necessary
the life of exponents principal measure
doesn't really tell anything yeah yeah
really you say and it's difficult to
achieve it yeah and it's not it doesn't
tell you that much but a lot of work in
nonlinear specialization has been
dealing with this kind of stuff so it
turns out actually that this kind of
methods belong to what the physics
called the first phase of complex system
theory so we're only global measurement
can be assessed so this starts with the
kolmogorov model of turbulence the
noises of structure functions the
canonical representation of fracture
multifractal processes be trendin the
fluctuation arises so these methods they
recognize the existence of interaction
multiscale motions but there is no
access to them in simpler way recognized
complexity of the system but they don't
tell you that much about the complexity
of the system since the 90s there is a
new trend in in the community of complex
system theory why it says okay this we
are going now to look to try to localize
geometric complexity that means that
where the complexity emerged and how it
organized itself and there is a school
which adopt the notion of predictability
as a way to characterize complexity and
this is where the USA was just a team
stands
sorry Oh what's going on
what happens waits moving music is this
lecture you guys videos okay so in this
in this school that adopt predictability
as well characterized complexity the
basic principle is to say that in for
certain class of complex signals and
systems there is some thermodynamic
observer of observer observables that
have a power low behavior and even more
is that what Antonio torial and you say
Nia are have developed is that this
power low behavior can exist at any
point of the signal domain so typically
in in mathematical wording is that given
your signal s of X there exists at least
one Wilkie scale functional TR that when
you analyze it around the point X you
find a power law behavior in theorem of
scales Saudi here just the dimension of
the signal s so for speeches will be
just one and the important quantity here
is this a show of x is called the
singularity exponents and the apologies
is that for this class of systems that
exist some geometrical super structure
that dominates completely the dynamic of
the system and that these we can access
to this geometrical structure by
analyzing the level sets or some levels
edge and they are characterized by the
points where
are the singularity exponent is the same
it is is the same so in other words you
check your signal you evaluate this
military sched functional you try to
find these H these HS at each point and
then you form the set of the points that
have the same exponents the level sets
and some of them are actually the most
important quantities that carry
information so in this way this
singularity exponent unlock the relation
between geometry and statistics because
basically what they say is that we are
going to access to this structure 22
geometrically and this structure contain
most of the static statistical
information so it's kind of way to bring
together statistical signal processing
and dynamical nonlinear dynamic and
signal processing which is the counter
they deterministic counterpart of
statistical signal parties so what I
understand it yeah
there's a signal s of X or a time and
you're saying at some particular point
in time that signal has a property that
can be expressed by this power law yeah
and I should care about that property
because that property is measuring how
predictable to signal is theirs and yes
that why it's yeah yeah it's what it's
because I mean they're there what is
nice about the work of Antonio to yell
and these fellow colleagues is that they
provide the way of precise estimation of
this age at each part of the single
domain and it gives also an
interpretation of this a this exponent
as way to to quantify local
predictability now why should I just be
like simple minded and say well I'll do
it LPC and I'll see what the error is
right around here and that's the
predictability or some other model that
predicts a time series and just apply
the model of see what the predictability
is its you can you can do this for
example okay you can take or maybe you
can take choosing make it yeah why not
just do that I want predictability my
dad's measure
no but forest so it's your what you are
saying that you are defining your notion
of predictability so typically what
you're saying I'm going to look at the
residual and where they I have the
highest peaks they are the less
predictable points okay but here first
you are assuming a notion of
productivity that can make sense or
cannot make sense the second thing is
that you can do for example if you take
if you take just the highest peaks and
do them as as the source signal for your
for your filter it's not going to work
that much because you have a polarities
in this sir in this in these pics so you
can do I mean it's all about what what
do you mean about predictability ok so
maybe get your estimate of h by doing
something like LPC
even though that might be a bad or crude
approximation but if you do I don't
don't forget also that there is this
notion of scale so so if you do LPC you
are just a defiance the resolution of
the signal and you are going to have a
definition of predictability at at a
defiant resolution here it tells you
actually I mean I not want to go into
all the apotheosis system it it tells
you how the energy concentrate in the
point X while it transfer across scales
so all this is based on from the notion
of turbulence and energy cascades in
turbulence so H is the underlying
dynamics or system that you understand
that you can characterize in the second
term there is all stuff that you can
terrorize all noise the second surface
this stuff is negligible I mean they say
that for s'mores case this term here you
can neglect it this is just a sec so
yeah I'm coming I'm coming to this later
because this is the first component is
definition of the singularity exponents
so for each X you you can extend that
you can expand your original function
into this form right for each X yeah and
but for each X you have given a far
different age thank you yeah you have
different alpha different age but alpha
actually it can cancel and and what
governs the dynamics are this age here
because there is a way to show how I
mean this alpha is also not that that's
important you can make it make it
canceled so you can see
hmm even if alpha is different for each
different point still there yeah it's I
mean in the estimation you can offer I
mean alpha is there but in the esteem
you can get rid of it if in the
estimation of h and and what and the
important quantity according to the
story is this a power-law scaling and
not not this constant this
multiplicative factor applies if R is
going to close yeah 444 small skates
what mini pies are just just the
distance I'll Justice Scalia distance
it's the scale at which the resolution
at which you are looking at the signal
because if there's multiple scales and
each scale you've got your own age then
you've taken Minos you don't have a
heart so never know it doesn't depend on
the scale H does not depend on the scale
magical
ok H is a function yeah
so typically from s we are going to have
access to this H of X and see what we
can do with it for the moment so and the
choice now of of the this multi case mu
tisk a functional is important because
if you choose it for example just as
linear increments you run into the wind
known holder exponents that are mainly
used in fact I'll multifractal theory
I the distance in verse 11 definition
but we will not adopt this because
actually these are just these quantities
are there is only directional and they
are in stable and they don't resist to
noise and they don't give you really a
an internship interpretation about
predictability just about geometric
irregularity of the signal so these
quantities are very known in in the
clinical framework of material fractal
theory and and but they are impractical
and they are very difficult to estimate
but what Antonio Uriel and his colleague
has proposed is to define these measure
as the multiscale functional which is
called the gradient modulus measure and
which is the defined from typical
characterization of intermittence in
turbulence and it measures actually the
local dissipation of energy of kinetic
energy so you measure you measure you
sum up or you take some of them all the
variations of your signals of your
signal in a ball around X and then you
with this measure you try to estimate
the edge with what is the gradient being
taken with respective it's a gradient of
your one dimensional signal here I'm I
mean whatever dimension here earlier I'm
reading your signal with respect to what
it's due to your tour your dimensions so
here it sits just go so if it in one
dimension the previous exponent you're
talking about would be one approximation
for the gradient yeah or it's it it's
difficult not that you it's exceed yeah
this one here that seems like an
approximation for the modulus of the
gradient as R goes to zero when you can
see it as an approximation but here you
sum up all the variations in in the ball
so you and but if you want you can
consider it but actually just this this
measure here makes a lot of difference
because they show that it describes
better the variations are on second that
look in just a directional increments I
got it that's an integral over surface
yeah and I'll over the volume is that is
that right yeah
so so so by taking this Mickey which is
K functional what what these people say
that they cake they can characterize the
degree of local perative predictability
at each point how do you do this that
they say if we are correct in saying
that there exists this geometrical
structure that govern the dynamics then
from these geometrical structure we can
have access to all the information about
the signal so this is the origin claim
and what what they have done is that
they show that for particular signal
this is true so they take the law we
predict the dough because if you're
looking at the gradient that's how fast
things are changing and if things are
changing a lot all over the place and
you do that integral lead and that was a
big number and I would seem to mean that
it's not predictable because if you go
over here in this direction over here
you're going in this direction yes yes
but but this is what it is so to
estimate you for example in easy ways to
look at the log log or ratio and the
things reverse I don't know if you go
back a slide yeah
it
this tea
that's not the opponent on how they're
just not the Expos it's not their ht1
this value is larger HD we also be
larger and give us it's just a lot a lot
no no it's the opposites large the
exponent is smart it's if even if you
ice
because I this lesson lesson one okay
yeah it's very small the lies get so so
the so the claim is that if we look at a
particular geometrical structure we have
access to most of the information and
here is to answer your question duration
with statistics is we are going to show
that this is indeed true for some class
of signals so you take these exponents
you assume that you can compute them of
course them and you look at the so
called the most angular manifold and the
exception is that the most angle so the
most angular my food is the subset of
point heavy the smallest angular
exponent so you compute your ages and
you take the smallest ones and you form
the subset of points that corresponds to
this smallest exponent this is called
the MSM the most angular manifold and as
I said they claim that this MSM
corresponds to the point where
information consult a constant data
transfer transfer across scale and that
it governs the dynamic of the system so
when they say if we are right then we
should be able to construct and actually
they developed a method for system ER
constables constable reconstruct ability
which is here so for natural images
which says that you can recover fully
your your signal by looking just at the
gradient of the signal restricted so
december means that it is a restriction
over the MSM and you defuse it to an
appropriate kernel and disk in case of
natural images this Colonel is universal
and has this form which complies with
the
the scaling property the scaling
property of the power spectrum of
natural images and there is a lot of
applications and strong results in email
in image processing using this format is
that so I recall you have now two
component this this measure the
singularity exponent the singularity
exponent that we obtain from them the
MSM the most angular manifold that
allows us to reconstruct fully the
signal from only the knowledge of
properties of the signal or on the MSM
construction I always think will you
still help others right yeah there is in
fact the real way there is still errors
but you can never have perfect
reconstruction but they have what they
they show that they have very good
reconstructions so you're saying that to
the extent the model is correct you have
perfect reconstruction yeah then because
the model isn't perfect you don't have
particular construction is that the is
that where the imperfection comes from
it's got to be more conservative subset
that's gonna have to do it the size of
the subset yeah because it's in actually
they have shown that this is 24 in in
the continuous case you have perfect
color construction for real word signals
as you said it depends on the how many
information you gather here and and the
old goal is depends on what kind of
signals the cardinality of this set here
can be low or big and this gives you
plus or minus about your construction
yeah because actually would you say that
this MSM is dance in the country is
dance in the signal domain and you can
recover everything from it but this is
the continuous case so if we summarize
now what you have is that there is this
well I will say easy to compute quantity
which is this angular TX point even
though it's not that easy for in the
case of images I mean the way they
compute it is little bit involved
because it's it it uses a notion of
local construction to estimate the ages
so they evaluate local construction
around the point to give a value to H so
if you have good reconstruction it means
the H is big and so you know that the
point is predictable otherwise
when you have better kinda local
construction the H is very low and and
this is how you can pretend that this
moose angular manifold corresponds
actual each with them to unpredictable
manifold so now this has been done in
image processing but if we look at this
reconstruction formula it looks a little
bit appealing to which what we know
about speech is that imagine one second
that we can do the same thing for speech
signals this will tell us that oh by
looking at this age we can probably have
a radiant easy access to the sixth
source signal and if we can find the
good colonel then we are going to
reconstruct so it will be an alternative
nonlinear alternative to our classical
source filter model source of the filter
and I are couple yeah this is a lack of
all here yet yeah they are not or they
are this is I don't know expressions
yeah but but when you look at this event
here you are obtaining the source here
after nonlinear operation of the full
signal so probably what you obtain I
don't know because this you will it's
not you really de couplet so but anyway
we can still if we can use the this this
formalism this way and and do the
assumption that they are the couplet why
not I mean we
so so let's now see what is going on in
the case of speech signals so I took
exactly the same components but I
replace now x by chi and let's use the
same analogy as in two decays and take
the same multiscale functional and we
want to analyze this this this new
formalism to analyze speech but keeping
in mind that we want to do and this is
very important because as I said before
this nonlinear technique that's been
developed so far they are very
complicated and people did get scared
from them and there is not that matter /
and probably that this is why they don't
have that much impact in speech
processing besides the fact that for
example as I said before we don't have
we don't have access to a lot of
information so so I I want to try this
formalism on speech signal by but with
the philosophy to do simple things that
everybody understands and also to do to
develop efficient algorithms to do
things that people can easily implement
and the problem is that we don't have
this nice or construction formula as in
the two decades okay we cannot hope to
have this Universal kernel that you
construct for speech sick so
so but still just let try to do
something with these ages so since we
don't have the reconstruction formula so
we cannot use exactly the same the same
way they they estimate the ages but we
rely on a theoretical result that have
been developed by or your point which
say that if you assume that there is
energy cascade we hang behind your
process and then some other technical
stuff that the Cascade variable is
infinitely disabled individual then you
can estimate your exponent just by
summing up the so called transitioning
exponents which in our case we compute
just as the logarithm of the multi-front
the ratio between the logarithmic scale
functional and the logarithm of the
scale and you normalize I have lost her
can you translate this into speech I
mean what is H correspond to a speech
my speeches to information is in there
so so this is the point actually is that
we are using in in the indicator of
Trudy we can say fairly that this
expands correspond to local to quantify
predictability around the point okay
here we want to say to something the
same thing but at least personally I
feel that they don't have the right to
say this because we don't have their
construction formula that allows you to
to give this interpretation of local
predictability but I'm just going to
call them singularity exponents try to
find a way how to st image and I shrink
it this way I chopped off some some of
the rose on the bottom is all the
smaller what if I shrink it down all the
way to one drug I have a 1d why white is
all of a sudden break that case what
what what would break I mean if it's the
Citadel it that the difficulty comes
from the interesting part b rh not cause
of damage analogy if it's on the
dimensionality then won't be simpler
than 20 right yes she was in there
cluster signals they can be satisfying
those in one dimension you see why the
reconstructive respect actually they
have done it too bad well to a certain
extent in design in for stock market
series so we're there it's the dynamics
are not the same as in speech of course
and but may I think that for for speech
signal we have just to take I'm very
confident that we can that which can
achieve their construction formula but
just we have to take
yeah some trans no or different train
support it more difficult well could you
have to be single I mean I live across
to the image there your hands right
especial games an image so why is that
no but it's not an image coming from
turbulence okay no seriously why yeah it
is firm doesn't work for I mean you
cannot say that you can apply for any
image and you will have this information
about the physical process behind now
it's not too much not magical picture
exhaust coming out the tailpipe on a
cold day off what is the billowing smoke
he's asking which I that what you're
talking about when you're talking about
an image of turbulence yeah yeah it's
smoked black move if you look a
cigarette and there and so the theory
tells you that there's some points in
this image that you can take and then
reconstruct yeah but it's vector grams
it doesn't statistically not physically
reconstruct right the spectrogram
doesn't have doesn't look like that
right and so that's why you're saying
that speeches is you can't directly
apply this to ya of course enjoy mystic
I'm not Jesse wait until I find it hard
to believe that the turbulent image
would be more compressible then is that
delay the non turbulent and turning the
the image into a few of these points
that's a lot like compression this is
super system is a stochastic
reconstruction so he seemed to have
something that resembles melted won't be
fix for pixel accurate today right yeah
it's it's not it's not going to be pixel
for pixel it for sure but I think it's
more than that I think he actually means
it reconstructs it not it reconstructs
something with the same statistical
properties but it actually reconstruct
something that's like a mean square
error closest approximation I don't
think so it's a less or you can buy the
work week instruction word for it for
images for images is that you take the
image you compute your exponents you
find the lowest ones and you apply the
corner here and you have a good
reconstruction of your image is good
yeah so good it's I mean if you had a
bunch of images of turbulence would you
be able to fight and you had the
reconstruction would you be able to find
the source image what it looks similar
yes sitting if you have so let's say I
have 10 pictures of turbulence mm-hmm
take one and I try and reconstruct it
yeah and I see this reconstruction can I
as a human pick out which of the 10 I
used as a source of that reconstruction
I mean the images look the same well at
least this is what they claim that they
are really looking at the same is that
you can recover for turbulent images you
can recover all the all the solder order
the important France yeah unfortunately
I don't tell I would if I knew I would
have showed you examples of ocean
dynamics
pixel by pixel mean square error yeah
well actually for example in yeah if you
are thinking about compression or I mean
this physicist yeah and a keep it and we
did this and then we reconstructed it
would we say oh that's Lena oh yes yeah
yeah actually this is you but but you
know they consider later as a natural
image you see it's the actual image so
what is this what else is battery on
birthday that's my question what right
you seem a natural religion is not true
there's because not turbulence it's so
if I see which I mean you want you want
that take the spectrogram and row
constructed this is what you mean yeah I
don't know if you do this and it can
reconstruct Lena why can't we do this
and reconstruct the spectrogram first
well and then do an imagine if we cannot
construct the spectrograms and then what
I mean how are you going you are going
to pick some points some miss em on the
frequency domain and the game is
isomorphic waveform excuse me from
especially giving such a way one
yes let's isomorphic he has the same
information so i can have at em Varrick
so the point is if we can eat we can
strike Alina we can reconstruct the
spectrogram reconstruct the spectrogram
can reconstruct waveform and therefore
it works for the 1d signal will probably
you all right when you're giving a great
day I will actually I have to at some
point but I told that what would be dms
and when you look at the spectrogram
what would be intuitively the these MSM
to what what it will correspond to or
yeah that fish important images but
there's enough overlap Oh what's a 2d
image so yeah there's a lot of its
respective names constraint not every
images of Alice patch again
because it's a 1d signal so it's a
constrained image
yeah but what you probably i will do it
this and send you the reconstruction see
what it is so where were so when you're
in summary we 4444 the 1d case we just
adopted this way to estimate the
exponents which is very easy very simple
a question so I understand how this
computation sell these individual H sub
R sub I are calculated by Vlad ratio of
this T operator yeah which is your
modulus gradient yeah so it's like how
quickly is it changing at the scale RI
yeah and the denominator is the scale /
what yeah is it something frequency so
that's a constant yeah and then RI is
measured in time is that so we just it's
your hair just miss kind of nature when
you're looking at so see it's very
simple to computer trying to figure out
what's happening across frequency how
quickly is a signal changing yeah
crossref ice skate like refers can yet
so I said now we have this way to
compute edge and look let's look how
they look like so this is speech signal
from teammate and the vertical red lines
are just the manual transcription of
four names and image and if you look at
the time conditioned distribution of the
ages so here you have time so take 32
millisecond window and you look at the
histogram of the ages in each window and
you can see well here is not very clear
but it's if you look closer you'll see
that actually these the distribution of
the h's is changing from phone to phone
but of course is not very clear from
here so we said okay so since the dead
of students is changing let's just look
at the simple simplest the step
descriptive statistic so we look at the
local mean and since we want to keep
resolution the finest possible we just
look as at the running mean of the ages
so we look at this function ACC as
accumulation and you can see that we
have this nice behavior that it's almost
piecewise linear functional with a
breaking point at the boundaries of
phonemes and even you can see for
shorter ones see here it describes the
slope was of this piecewise like linear
functional it changing for adjacent
funny so say okay let's do simple thing
and fit a piecewise linear functional to
this curve and identify the breaking
points
you if you use very sympathetic you
still have this canal yeah well we've
looked and can you tell me of a simple
technique that you will do this Just
Energy yeah if you click at the the
energy you are not going to have this
kind of piecewise linear functional with
with such a resolution 00 t is your
money orders ya know but not if it
doesn't mean here where you start
because so the slope interpreted as a
local mean yeah without the h
right but that's usually a flawed in the
ad because usually a low-pass becoming a
high-pass filter at the plant so the
local mean should be zero it doesn't
pass TC however little confuses what
this is getting at because it's
essentially the first essentially the
lowest being deceived in respect Your
Ground Hog it's not this over time it's
cumulative so it's the interval to
integrate yeah so it's a slow death it's
a low-pass filter perfect ok so I'm
kissed if you see how you look at the
zoo whatever you say you're and you're
integrating over time which is
equivalent to in the frequency domain x
1 over l yeah but here we are not taking
the speech signal it's not the speech
where is that all at your age yeah I
have no idea that sorry
yeah hey yeah it's so let's go go back a
slide thing I'm sorry do you know pretty
smoothing out the ripple go back the
slider is so you said that H will be low
when you have maximum you can I below
predict the goalie but around 0.3 looks
like a fricative which should be at
least particularly no the opposite when
it's high it's well I i don't mean wait
for a while but i think this is this
looks like a fricative we should be most
unpredictable I mean this is definitely
about well you know he has it labeled in
the previous slide with that it oh yeah
what's the things is your point 3 go
back go back go forward no I'll be right
over yeah so pointy yes that's a
fricative that's maximum randomness yeah
so look at the lowest H it soon yeah
this is what's ate but I predict a man
can you just go back that's my one
before it no no he's your boys a smaller
today she's unpredictable towards the
negative infinity is unpredictable yeah
3 but it but if you go if you go back
one the one before it's about and that's
all so far yeah there's not much
difference between this foul which is
very predictable and distributive which
is completely noise we're comparing
random the other things that we go well
there seems to be some effective scale
right because the most predictive
openness silence solid see really
predict yeah that part works but yes let
me remind you it is that a year I I I
don't allow myself to talk about by the
ability at this point for these
exponents I talk about ready for images
but but still here you can you can see
that it consists a little bit which way
what we are expecting I don't know if
you agree
I'll go with this or the previous the
next to take the mean
wait is this the mean or is each point
in this time I know the mean vertically
in the hizzy consumer age so 180
degrading over tau agent right all the
the previous I thought your your Jake
that was a sum of other little agents
well a check in the previous one is a
histogram above young h.s I went up in
it some in a time time yeah yes this is
just a histogram so the mother in there
we go to go back 11 yes I got H for any
given time is a summer yeah this is just
a way you how to compute you can just ok
so these HS are other transition CR
you're just to prolong know everything
so that's just a for forget this one I'm
just saying how we compute in this case
just you're so that it is easy actually
so one of the things you're asking is
how would somebody in speech recognition
look at a graph like this it seems like
the only really useful things like a
spectral measure where you're trying to
determine whether the sounds around it
are similar or different then my places
where you have a linear progression of
this integrator you expect the expected
value of the H in that region is the
same so it seems like you can some of
you out if the sound isn't changing then
the H isn't changing but there's some
correlation there between the two but is
there also like is there any
repeatability
the Tiwi a 52.5 they're both float down
the show well go bears go back to commit
i think is the record slide is slope the
informative thing because because it's
not not absolute number but sometimes
previous thing is based on the fact this
next slides based in fact this is
constant this is kinds of this is
constant hello expand on there this is
constant so the error value when you dab
it over time that gives you a particular
slope yeah use interplay between the two
constant you know these mines contact
few things right right i think so what
happened is your point for the next
round because it's loading a lot so
that's
what's changing I guess yeah it seems a
lot that means place inside yeah this
every significance where h is zero so
it's a post in the previous start we've
we've got positive values a vector
negative series yeah it's late more
what's the significance of the position
zero so so Corran theory see the
negative ones are are the most important
ones it's where we have low
predictability and and the positive ones
is the opposite so and here we are
looking at it at all of them you are not
we are not at the MSM yet yeah it seems
like context-dependent predictability
cuz like the to a felt a totally
different apps I'm sorry it's that's
good integrator yeah this is me right if
you look at some point lead I want to
draw everybody's attention to the clock
yes so yeah yeah so and here so by this
simple operation that you're saying and
do so we compared to the state of the
art taking phonetic segmentation well
don't look at the SEC the third row this
is just incremental improvement about
this integrator is a CC functional and
and they are and we so we compared to
what we found is the best so this paper
of those are non rabiner which we
compared on the full team each database
so at least we can have fair comparison
and we have better results but which is
more important we've been discussing
this before is that probably we should
just more if this stuff makes sense
sophomore the segmentation by this
method than the line on the manual
transcripts of of timett so and so
probably we should look at a typical
example where normal
even manual transcription can not find
the regime the transitions and see if
this method can find them but
unfortunately we didn't do this because
we wanted to go to look at other aspects
so if you look at the MSM this major
component of of of the formalism so here
a voiced speech and here the H is now
just the signal h of G and you saw that
from this picture here you say that and
the end the red vertical line they
correspond to GCI locations extract from
EG g signals so they are here also and
see that allow the lowest exponents are
around this g cialis so this is directly
by looking at the edge here a better
example where we zoom if we take now
this the the MSM by five percent of of
the lowest exponents you have this
behavior so here get another voice
signal and you see that the MSM is
located around this yet the lowest
exponents are all around you said even
another nice behavior that the lowest
exponent in these regions corresponds to
the exact location of the G of the GCI
according to the ECG signal so it seems
like this MSM corresponds to has
physical meaning in speech which
apparently here is GC else so we said
okay let's compare to watch is going on
in this field of GCI detection so this
basically this level change functional
just you compare the mean of h's around
the point just to allow you to have only
one MSM point per glottal cycle so it
gives
this red curve and then we take the zero
crosses of this thread this green curve
sorry and we take the lowest MSM with
the lowest exponent points which is the
closest to the peak so just this is to
guarantee that we have we are taking msn
point the lowest one and but the ones
that are in one volatile psycle so and
he already put the performances so there
have been teases defended the just last
year by Tomas drogue man and and here
are the results in crispy so you have
two measures I think mark knows this
stuff better than I do reality measures
and accuracy measures sorry reality
measures are almost the same but
accuracy is always better and according
to Thomas drug man see dreams and the
confirm or infirmity say is is the best
algorithm and the most robust so far
current we see so and particularly when
you look at shorter tolerance windows we
have better results so we we see again
this when when we want to look at a high
resolution we have always this benefit
because the metal is sampling based and
remind you that this is just by simple
transformations of the edge so here are
the results on noise because in clean
speech most of metal do well so here you
have accuracy oh sorry then the hit rate
and and here the last figure you have
the accuracy
this is in the case of Barbra noise and
you see that particular for low SNR we
are yeah switch good speech seemed
better they she she ever done oh you
have you just gradually you have you
ever sleep signal at a parallel each
yeah yeah and what is interesting is it
in case of car noise that the result
seems to be very good so you means that
there is some are Westerners and this
has been actually showed the image
processing and also theoretically that
lowest H's are robust to noise so well I
have to each week so this is so we took
this MSM and proposed it as a way to
provide sparse linear prediction so the
idea is so the l0 gnome is the the the
Impractical ideal solution another a an
approximation to this solution is the
Edwin R match it involves convex
programming so we propose just 22 down
wait the the mean square error
minimization on the GC is and actually
wednesday morning there was a
presentation by Pabu alco who is doing
exactly the same thing fortunately well
submit the paper to three months ago so
we did the same principle is using his
way to compute GCI so we down weight and
showed that we have better sparsity
after we made a statistical test that by
doing this mess but this is I wouldn't
say that here we are just playing about
with our MSM stuff to to obtain
interesting results so
so then he was talking about four months
and so we have made the test that we on
a synthetic vowel you have a exact test
image of the original transfer function
while the l2 norm is shift key informant
little bit and also so we have used this
MSM to you know that milky milky classic
MLG place excitation codon do operates
in two stage we're in first stage you
have to search to Duke if you if you
want couples is you have to do caches of
our order n two extra to extract is
lukensia education one after the other
and then you optimize all the pulses the
other object you jointly at the end and
and this takes a lot of time this first
day so we are placed this first stage
directly by putting the MSM as the
pulses we say that the MSM gives us the
location of the pulses and then we keep
the second stage of MPE the same and
here in example what what we find so
this is the original signal this is the
pulse pulse is given by by the MSM so
the amplitude is computed using the
second stage of MPE and this is the
reconstruction signal and here we
compare so to the performances so the
best one is is MPE the optimized MP
because there is the first version in 82
which is which is relatively bad in SNL
performances ours is here and this one
is one that was published last year
using components compared using last
year without using compressed sensing
methods
so we see that for lo lo que lo case we
have better results than these two here
but MP is better but MP does
intrinsically minimize SNR so it's not
surprising that she is doing good job in
SNL but if you look at perceptual
measures we have almost the same quality
but we win a lot in computational
complexity so I want to make your just
one similar conclusion actually I don't
my interest is not in the performance or
what whatever percentages regain is that
it is I showed you a very simple
nonlinear operation and a signal that
allows to have easy access to some
interesting local dynamics of the speech
signals so so that we can have access to
GC is 24 transitions that does this mean
that this formalism is potentially good
for an earlier speech processing I hope
that the answer will come from you so
this is the perspective for the short
time incremental research actually
Thomas document wants to use this for
synthesis in his system he hasn't it
this system I heard that geo eyes were
very complicated to to estimate so
probably we can take a look at them but
you have them they it in your the
multiplayer pulse excitation and second
pulse loop dream I feel like it points a
bit the GOI that really is yeah you
should selectively solve it what does it
mean msn for unvoiced speech normally it
should have better meaning there because
the assumption is that there is
turbulence there is there just some
random locations of Android speech or
does it have physical meaning as we have
found for voice speech are we looking at
the right intensive variable
I mean I have showed you this mod
gradient modulus measure as our
intensive variable is it the right way
we are have just copied from image
processing is for speech is the right
variable to look at can we have better
estimates Sangha expert probably the
idea is by or construction the spectrum
I was living and i want to say word that
so this is not in this talk but or your
point is physicist and mathematician guy
who in our group is working on a way to
infer directly in the Cascade energy and
this is true the notion of optimal
wavelets who is has already some result
but we are waiting for the final results
where we can infer completely the
cascade of of the energy using a notion
of optimal waveless so if we have this
of course we will have another way that
I represented you today to look at the
systems but what would be very
interesting is to have our construction
formula that is similar to do to decays
and here it's open should we can see
their sound dependent kernels any I and
of because this would lead us then to
what is interesting for you has to have
some new ways for feature extraction and
and so on and also here you see that we
are since we are little structural and
we don't have a lot of manpower it is
very important to me to know what are
the good problems to look at or what are
the good applications to look at instead
of just be tried but by by the lack of
manpower so I hope that you will tell me
where this stuff it if it makes sense if
it's not you can tell you to me and
don't be nice to me and and what is that
what are the best problems to look at
and I think I'm all right John Choi
thank you
further questions for the audience's a
lot during the presentation yeah I know
a lot of us have to be somewhere oh you
have the meeting at three yeah but yeah
one thing Harley that doesn't know being
you know mathematician is whether this
work is interesting for speech or what
kind of he's looking for feedback at
what kind of directions to take that
right yeah yeah try to figure from your
party good guys who know better than
made the area and pathetic we're very
good at adams bday two dimes and
slightly larger scale what's that like
fun level or the fray level rather than
at the sample scared
the transition to 20 words
I could imagine the dynamics of a
conversational speech so we're more
nursing so speech articulator zingaro
the of the air in the retina vocal tract
bread so it's it's higher labor into a
transition that our with your interest
yeah the dance that's generating speech
rather than the manifestation of that
why I think in terms of segmental
decoding and having some hints as to the
segment activities could be very useful
if those sorts of boundaries that you
identify their hold up you know in a
little bit of noise and in
conversational speech and if it's
generally true that this gives
boundaries with reasonable accuracy i
think that's that's interesting okay so
we'll probably have to go the class will
be in the holes please I know no it's a
local cop you know it's a local coffee
change it thank you very much it is very
interactive probably won't be here with
me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
