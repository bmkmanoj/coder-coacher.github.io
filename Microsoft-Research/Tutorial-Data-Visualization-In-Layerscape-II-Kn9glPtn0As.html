okay I'd like to continue the second
part is going to be a little bit more
far afield from worldwide telescope and
layer escape I want to talk about
another one of our technologies briefly
called distribution modeler and that's
going to i'm introducing it for a couple
of reasons one of them is that it will
produce a data set that i'll then view
in worldwide telescope but it's kind of
a long ways to go to go from
distribution modeler to a visualization
but in so doing I hope to make the point
that again you don't need to have
geospatial data you don't need to have
latitudes and longitudes in order to use
the layer scape visualization engine to
look at and try and make sense of what's
going on with your data and then the
second point that I want to do is the
real second reason I'm bringing up
distribution modeler is because i think
it connects back to what i started
talking about at the beginning about the
progression from thinking about science
thinking about environmental science to
data to information to models and then
to predictions and then to services and
again that's sort of in preparation for
the second speaker who will be here this
afternoon after lunch before i continued
somebody asked me during the break about
doing analysis and distribution modeler
is really going to be a technology about
analysis but is world wide telescope
something that you can think about using
for analysis and i want to emphatically
state that the answer is no if you want
to add numbers together if you want to
take a fourier transform of a spectrum
if you want to do the kind of thinking
about data that you can do even for
example in the Excel spreadsheet world
wide telescope is not the technology
that's not the place to do that kind of
stuff worldwide telescope
know about carbon it doesn't know about
climate or oxygen or tides or water or
anything like that it doesn't even know
about planets what it knows about is
pixels and well its got some built-in
interface to allow you to explore these
these important environments but the way
to think about worldwide telescope is
really as connected to a second
application so this is a connection
picture of how things work if you think
about worldwide telescope is just ready
and waiting to draw pixels of your pixel
representation of your data then you
need a second application that has the
intelligence that does understand
dissolved oxygen or carbon dioxide or
something like that and then that will
talk to worldwide telescope and you can
either talk to worldwide telescope by
means of creating files and then
importing them or you can talk to
worldwide telescope through something
called an API which is short for
applications programming interface and
that what that means it is if you happen
to be a computer programmer and you have
just a sort of beginning level skill you
learn how to make print statements print
statements are typically write text like
hello world to a screen somewhere but
you can also print onto these things
called ports and I I don't work with
this very much so I'm just kind of
giving you a layman's picture of it but
if you can generate a print statement
that happens to be very long and has a
bunch of data in it then you can print
that to worldwide telescope and it sits
there and listens on its API channel and
it listens for that print statement when
you win it here's the print statement it
takes in all the stuff that you said and
it tries to render that as data so at
the very last thing I'll do today is I
will show a developer's view of how to
generate these print statements and what
that ends up looking like if you're not
a programmer then eh maybe it's kind of
culturally interesting and you can just
sort of doze off or whatever or be you
could say well you know that doesn't
actually look too difficult maybe this
is something I could explore and that's
that certainly would be a great outcome
for us we would love it for more people
to sort of get engaged in programming
and writing computer programs because it
so enjoyable it's kind of rewarding it's
fun to do and it gives you a certain
measure of control over the technology
that it enables you to sort of pursue
the things that you can imagine doing so
world wide telescope is not an
analytical tool it's a pixel drawing
tool and you want to have your
intelligence sitting in another
application and I've already given an
example of a data application that has
that sort of intelligence in that
example we use was the Excel spreadsheet
so the Excel spreadsheet by itself
doesn't really know how to talk to
worldwide telescope but that's okay
because you can install the world wide
telescope add-in for Excel and that does
know how to talk to worldwide telescope
that's a bunch of programming code that
talks to the worldwide telescope
interface but there's a quick way of
doing things also and that's called cut
and paste and I showed that earlier when
I cut data from real wide telescope and
I pasted it here into into excel so I'd
like to go in the other direction now
and cut and paste from here into
worldwide telescope so i have this is
the wrong data file let me go to the
right data file i don't have the right
data file okay I better regenerate the
data file so let's go back to worldwide
telescope I'll do my climate demo this
time I'm going to keep going past where
I want to be I'm going to do that fetch
climate demo so that'll sort of
reemphasize that fetch climate is just
sitting there waiting for somebody to
come along and ask it for data so here i
am in excel i go to a worldwide
telescope ribbon and go to the services
and there's the fetch climate demo if
everything goes according to plan this
is now going to talk to worldwide
telescope and get a latitude and
longitude at the east side of the
Himalayas it's going to go to the
computer in Cambridge and it's going to
get a block of data precipitation and
surface temperature it's going to bring
that back into a table in Excel and it's
going to try and draw that data in
worldwide telescope so telescope to
Cambridge and fetch climate and then
back to telescope again all from this
little application dramatic pause
think we're about halfway there
certainly
yeah let's get the microphone well let
me start again one of the problems of
not having the analytical engine coupled
to the database engine is that sometimes
I need a whole bunch of setup data in
order to calculate one value and use
only that value for instance if I from
doing a low pass band filter I have the
raw data and I need to get a window of
data that we will revert to only one
point imagine a sine curve if I get that
from a sensor the sine curve will be a
very regular so I would like to pass a
little low pass band filter and it would
make a nice regular wave in order to do
that that I have to get a moving window
over the the signal calculate the value
of each new point and use this point
instead so if I can couple the engine to
the database I I can do it in a more
efficient way mm-hmm how would I use
that with worldwide telescope so you're
talking about doing a low-pass filter on
a signal yeah and as you as you do that
your signal is evolving well it means oh
boy maybe just a large signal so I would
make a low-pass been in a small part at
each time I'll move the signal whether
it would be a temporal right feedback so
if you're talking about having a large
data set and you're sort of operating
locally on a piece of it at a time right
then you're right if you had that inside
your visualization engine you can sort
of see that changing as you go right but
what you can also do is you can have as
developer you can boy this really needs
to reboot open worldwide Tilikum try
again sorry I'm trying to do two things
at once it's not working so you can talk
to worldwide telescope by means of that
API that I was describing
you can simply send over pieces of data
as you go but what what I was describing
was something that's a little bit more a
little different which is that it's
difficult to put that analytical
low-pass filter machinery inside the
worldwide telescope application itself
and the reason for that is because we
would have to sort of choose a
particular type of analysis let's say it
was a low-pass filter and then we would
have to sort of figure out how to
implement that and then we would
somebody would come along and say well I
don't want that low pass filter i want
the different one and then really what
you want to do is use our or you want to
use MATLAB or something like that so if
you decouple them then you're sort of
keeping them you're trying to minimize
the simplicity of each application so it
does that make sense yes okay I'm gonna
try this one more time and if we're dead
in the water we're dead in the water and
we'll just have to reboot
Oh as if I went to the wrong place dunk
on it
it's going to be very boring data
all right I'll see how that goes
okay so far so good
okay so that worked and now just to show
what I'm doing so that's no I'm again
I've gone over to the Himalayas here
I've gone to worldwide telescope
services fetch climate demo and will let
it run again by default world wide
telescope comes up at zero latitude zero
longitude which is out in the middle of
the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of
Africa and so that data is less
interesting and I want it to have
slightly more interesting data so we'll
take a moment to rerun the fetch climate
call I think we're doing that now
I could threaten to go on to something
else and maybe would respond to that
okay let's go on to something else and
we'll see if we can come back to this
you look a cooking show so I've
mentioned several times distribution
modeler and I'm going to tempt fate and
try and do a demonstration here yes
that's good so just for fun here not
much still hasn't come through
ok
oh it worked okay hallelujah so I've run
the fetch climate demo and I've
generated this data just for technical
reasons it's not as beautiful as I'd
like but it nevertheless does illustrate
that there's more rain on the south side
of the Himalayas and less as you go over
into the Himalayas and where it gets
also colder so the colors are colder I'm
going to go back to excel and just
demonstrate one more time messing around
with Excel and getting a data set back
into worldwide telescope so somatically
what we're doing right now is how do I
get data into worldwide telescope and I
have this fetch climate block of data
here which has two columns min LA and
min and Max LA which are latitudes for a
particular block in that block of cells
I was just showing so I'm going to
create a column called lat and I'm going
to have its value be equal to paren a2 +
b2 divided by 2
and I'm going to create a column called
long for longitude and I give that a
value equal to c2 plus d 2/2 okay so
cool Excel trick is to be able to take
the beginning of a column of data that's
not filled out and say okay do the same
thing all the way down you grab onto
this little thing here and you double
click on it and it fills it out so I've
just averaged these two latitude values
and these two longitude values to make
this table over here and then there's
altitudes which are of course related to
the annual precipitation and color which
is built out of the temperature so I
have four columns of data here and I'd
like to just paste that into worldwide
telescope so I'm going to select all
four columns whoops let's try that again
like that I'm simply going to say copy
so my point here with my goal here was
to copy and paste from here in the world
wide telescope from excellent worldwide
telescope so I'm going to paste except
this time the data doesn't just fly in
instead it brings up this wizard here
and it says okay you're trying to paste
in some data that's great let's call
that a new layer and we'll give it a
name so we'll call it h IM for himalayas
and then we'll work our way through this
little wizard now I had a column called
Latin another one called lon and
worldwide telescope is guessing that
those are latitude and longitude and I
have no problems with that the same
thing with altitude and it happens to be
in meters so I can customize my data
paste process here but as it happens
those are fine and then I have a scale
factor here and I'm going to drop that
down to make it a little bit lower so
that it's not too bright and my markers
are going to be gaussians my color is my
color column so everything's looking
good and I'm going to finish so there I
pasted a new layer it's called him but
I've also got to fetch climate layers
here and i'ma turn them both off so my
hem data is down in here somewhere it's
a bunch of little dots but I can't
really see them so what I'd like to do
is I'd like to make that more visible
and sort of show them as columns and so
I'm going to go back to my hem layer
here and i'm going to right click on
that and i noticed that right clicking
is sort of my standard operating
procedure in worldwide telescope right
clicking gives me these menus where i
can do all kinds of stuff so if i right
click on that layer and i get down to
properties that's going to bring up that
wizard again as a bunch of tabs now i
can go in and i can modify how my data
is viewed and in particular in the
markers column here we chose Gaussian
which of these little fuzzy dots and
instead I'd like to make my data be
column data because I think that'll look
better
okay so i'm done in my data you didn't
see it but it sort of grew in like this
and there's my data so my data has been
rendered as a bunch of little squares
are all next to each other and it's sort
of semi transparent so that I can see
through it and I can see the train
underneath that's my himalaya if I right
click on it let us i right click and I
change the opacity I can sort of fade it
out and dissolve it away too and that
can be useful in seeing the underlying
surface features I can also fly through
my data okay all right so that's fine
but there has to be a purpose for
building the excel add-in for worldwide
telescope and so what I'd like to do now
is do exactly what I just did but i'll
do that using the Excel add-in so again
we have this ribbon here we have all
this data and I'm just going to send
over these four columns so I've selected
those four columns hang on a second okay
and I have a button up here called
visualized selection so let me just do
this first
hmm
we still got okay we're back in business
thankfully
okay one more time with feeling
ok
so again i'm going to pro go through my
process of visualizing my data I say
visualize selection it brings up that
wizard except this time the wizard is in
Excel and for reasons of taking care I'm
going to drop the scale factor down
and again I have this is not as easy as
it looks okay I have four columns that
I've selected altitude color lat and
long and it takes those four columns and
it makes guesses as to what the column
name should be assigned to in worldwide
telescope so here is an assignment of
altitude to altitude I could change the
altitude to be distance or any of these
other attributes but altitude happens to
be correct so I'm happy with my
assignment here and now I'm going to say
let me widen this out a little bit I'm
going to save you and worldwide
telescope so let's go to worldwide
telescope and sort of turn off our
visualization so him him is off and
fetch climate two is gone and back here
we can click on view ok so the steps
were as follows I generated some data I
selected that data and clicked on this
visualized selection button up here and
then it sort of did the wizard work here
and now finally there's a view and
worldwide telescope button down here to
send the data to worldwide telescope
and did it show up see it
or did it call it
yeah called it fetch climate to is a
residual name okay
so there's our data here and again I can
go to properties I can go to markers I
can change it from Gaussian to be
columns again and the data grows up into
place oops and we're all done okay so
that was that was rather belabored I
apologize for the for the slow pace here
but again I'm just trying to sort of
demonstrate that it's fairly
straightforward to use this technology
to get a column their data column data
into a worldwide telescope and the same
thing applies to irregularly spaced data
there's no there's no rule that says
this data has to be nice and gritted
like this it can be all over the place
so with that I'd like to turn to fetch
climate I'm sorry not to fetch climate
to distribution modeler and do a quick
demonstration of how that works whoops
so distribution modeler is a website
you'll notice this is a browser and it
works on data sets that contain
observations about something that's
going on out in the world and so the
first thing we'll do is we'll import a
data set so now I'm totally away from
worldwide telescope this has nothing to
do with layer scape right now this is
entirely about a system for
conceptualising a model and then
carrying out your ideas against some
data that you happen to have so earlier
I mentioned that I had some data I will
import that data now and what we're
going to do is we're going to build
something that resembles a workflow so
this would be sort of I workflow system
if you like and workflow simply means I
helped a whole bunch of tasks that I
want to do in some sequence so I want to
set up the machinery to do that and then
we'll sort of say go and it will the
data will flow through the machinery but
the nice thing about distribution
modeler is the machinery that's put in
place happens to be very sophisticated
stuff thats related to ecological
analysis and statistical analysis so
again i'm working from a browser and I
have this interface here i'm going to
select my data file i'm just sitting on
my SkyDrive and it's called Gauss data
so now I've created an action here
is read in a data file and once it's
configured I can run it and so it runs
and sure enough it creates a data file
so let's take a look at the data file
the data file appears to be a series of
columns which I cannot for the life of
me see hang on it's like i'm going to
try duplicating my screen so i can have
a chance of seeing what i'm doing and
working more efficiently that going to
work
oh no it doesn't work because for some
reason it's blanked out my other screen
huh okay let's give up on that idea
okay difficult to see but up here you
can see that there's a column called
beer and a column called pirates and
over here somewhere there's another
column called joy so we have our data
and what I'd like to do then is proceed
through this interface to create a model
of the relationship between beer pirates
and joy and then we'll see if the system
can actually solve for the parameters /
what I showed at the beginning of my
talk so first thing I want to know is
what is my workflow look like so far
well I happen to be on the data page but
it's got provenance hmm I don't know if
this is going to be recalcitrant and
maybe I'm just going to have to give up
on it okay
it's a charge drew for pre testing this
okay one more time i'm going to import a
file i'm going to browse that file i'm
going to go to my SkyDrive i'm going to
go to distribution modeler let me get
ghost data data you've got to run the
module i'm going to get the data file it
looks beautiful and then i'm going to
say what is my workflow look like so far
aha fantastic we have a round thing
which is an action and a square thing
which is an object so we have imported
the file and there's the file I can go
back to the file and look at it and then
I want to say what else do I want to do
well my whole spiel here has been
talking about building a model so let's
build a model I want to estimate the
parameters so I have the model in my
head that it's like a bell curve the joy
is a function of beer and I have a bell
curve joy as a function of pirates so
now I want to go and actually explore
that by creating a couple of bell curves
so I'm going to run this module here so
you'll notice that this provenance
connects my data to the data loader and
the use in New is everything that I
could do from here so one of the things
I could do from here is I can make a
chart so I'm going to before I go and
explore my model i'm going to make a
chart of my two types of source data my
environmental data which is beer and
pirates and my observed data which is
joy so i'm going to make a let's already
selected my my Gauss data as my source
i'm going to make appt in description or
a pin plot so my need to get beer on the
x-axis pirates on the y axis and the
color is going to be joy
okay interesting let's hide the legend
okay so sure enough we have a sort of a
sweet spot for a beer and a sweet spot
for pirates and the joy is that the
maximum there so everything looks good
so now I of course created a chart from
my data so let's go back let's go on to
look at the chart you know a second okay
so there's my entire workflow so far
this is a constrained because the the
screen is so narrow here so I'm gonna
have to sort of wiggle it back and forth
like that but you can see that we loaded
the file and then we put that into a
chart maker and there's our chart and
there's our chart comes up it shows us
our stuff again will click provenance to
go back to the workflow and now we'll go
back to our data and we'll go and do the
model estimation business so this module
called estimate parameters has both
environmental data which is beer and
pirates and it also has distribution
data which is joy and finally it needs a
model so this is where we're going to go
about describing those bell curves so I
clicked on the model generator and now
we're in a new module that creates a
model okay now this is ecologists who
built this so they like to think in
terms of species so I'll imagine that
what I was observing was a species which
is called joy shows yet you have joy so
that's good i'm going to add that
species it's the only species we're
going to model right now i could model
frogs and ostriches and emus and stuff
like that but i'm just going to model
joy because that's the only data that i
have joy is measured as a real number
and it's described in my model in terms
of two niches one of them is beer and
the other ones pirates so I'm going to
chart and start typing beer here and
notices that I have a beer column so
it's looking at my source data and
suggesting what I could be possibly
talking about so I now added beer this
is my beer model and then I'm going to
say well my beer model isn't a
non-response it's a bell curve or
normal distribution or Gaussian response
so here's a little Gaussian curve so I'm
actually putting my model together as
I'm speaking here and then I say well
there's another thing in my model which
is that joy is also dependent upon
pirates and so I say add that so here's
the page that deals with my pirates my
pirates need a model ok so my privates
is also going to be a Gaussian response
or a bell curve so now I have a beer
bell curve and a pirate's bell curve so
everything is looking great this is my
model it describes joy in relationship
to beer and pirates and then I want to
say great let's go back to my workflow
so my model that I just built here is
feeding into my parameter estimator
which also has beer and pirates and joy
and it has a run button so now i can hit
run and that's going to go off and
calculate an end result that end result
i went sort of went away too quickly ok
so let's do this metadata prominence
sorry everything is squished together
this whole thing crashes I'm going to be
very disappointed yeah crashed ok well
that's a data point for those guys
let's try and do this
all right not to worry
that's worry too much
you
ok
so I'm getting some carpal tunnel from
this thing the
the workflow window here I can zoom out
on it again we're limited by two things
there's a bandwidth issue on the
internet connection and then there's a
screen with issue here so I apologized
these are sort of things that you can't
anticipate but well we've got here
finally I'm going to skip ahead a little
bit so i reloaded this entire workflow
from a pre-existing zip archive so what
we had done so sort of to begin with
those we'd created a imported data file
and then created a model and put that
into a parameter estimator and got a
result so the rest of this stuff here is
kind of working with that result to do a
prediction and the prediction is the
kind of thing that I was talking about
in the beginning where you want to
predict the results of a model that you
have a high confidence in and so we do
that get to this provenance and then we
make a chart out of the results let's
see we want to go to the province again
there's that chart
no it's not it
that's the chart
okay let me see if I can narrate this
through what happened to try and make
sense out of this because I realized
this is a kind of a rocky presentation
so at the very beginning we had a data
file that describe the distribution of
pirates and beer and then joy as a
consequence of that which I said was
sort of peaked along the beer axis and
peaked along the pirate axis and what we
did was we brought that into this system
this distribution modeler and we created
a model for that where the distribution
works is and then the distribution
modeler solved for the parameters the
best fit that model and then of course
we can use that to make a prediction
about given a certain amount of beer and
a certain amount of pirates what's the
end result look like and so this is so
supposed to be a recreation of our
source data and this is the simplest
initial approach to using distribution
modeler and so then i can describe to
you a more complicated or more
sophisticated use of distribution
modeler and then that'll that'll sort of
end this part of what i'm talking about
so i'm going to go back to my provenance
chart here and say there's a multi-view
at the very end and the multi-vue is
both my source data here and then my
prediction data and you know lo and
behold they match each other very nicely
and so that's great okay so let me
describe to you the more important
purpose of this system as a predictive
system okay so let's suppose that you
have addition drew will probably do this
suppose you have a distribution of a
bunch of observations of wheat growing
across the world okay so you go outside
the door here and you try and grow wheat
and it doesn't do very well because it's
too warm and it's too raining you go to
somewhere in Kansas in the United States
and you try and grow some weed and it
does great because of the contra
combination of how much rainfall there
is and what the annual temperatures are
like wheat grows really well you go up
to Fairbanks Alaska and you try and grow
wheat unless you're inside of a
greenhouse the wheats not going to do
very well so you go around the world and
you make these observations latitude
longitude and how much wheat is growing
and that's all you know latitude
longitude and how much hot and how well
the wheat would grow there okay don't
know anything else but you have this
idea that how well wheat grows is
related to the
in the temperature so you go into
distribution modeler here and you say
okay here's my latitude here's my
longitude and here's how much wheat
grows tell me something and distribution
mother says I have no idea what you're
talking about I don't have anything to
go on here all you have is observations
you don't have any background
environmental date and you say oh of
course I forgot my environmental data
what I need is climate data I need
climate data that matches the latitudes
and longitudes where my observations are
then you think oh yeah that's right i
can just go use fetch climate so one of
the buttons here see if i go back to
home one of the buttons here happens to
be fetched climate so i click on this
and it creates a little fetch climate
module and I say hey fetch climate
module go to these latitudes and
longitudes that are in my wheat data and
find out what the climate is like
they're so that goes to fetch climate
and it pulls that data back and now we
have data for annual precipitation and
surface temperature and then we have a
sort of new data set that's got not only
the observation of the week but also the
environmental data about what the
temperature is and what the precip is
from there we can go through this same
process where we build a little model
that says that I think that there's a
peak temperature and a peak
precipitation for growing wheat and just
like our beer pirates joy you can have
distribution modeler solve for that and
come up with an ideal environmental
conditions for growing wheat and you can
instead of plotting that on an XY chart
you can actually bring up a map of the
world and we'll show you that on here so
that since the map of the world is
distributed in this funny way with
continents and oceans and temperature
and mountains and stuff like that you
just see where the wheat grows well it
goes really well for example in like
Northern Europe okay so you say oh there
we go we fit a model to our data in
terms of the background climate
information now let's go ahead and do
some predicting okay so when you can go
back to fetch climate and say what's
it's supposed to be like on the earth 20
years from now and fetch climate says
well I happen to have a model run
from a climate model that goes 20 years
into the future so here's what it's
going to be like in 20 years and then
you can say through this distribution
modeler workflow okay great in 20 years
where is a good place to grow wheat so
what you're doing is you're taking a
climate model and you're using that in a
predictive way based on your solution
for the optimal conditions for growing
wheat so if you think about that and
think about us as a sort of a global
community there's a lot a lot a lot of
questions and a lot a lot a lot of
economic inertia behind questions like
this so you could actually start making
decisions about how you're going to
manage your resources based on this
future trend this might not be a good
time to plan on it getting colder for
example where you live and switch to a
colder weather crop you might want to
switch to a warmer weather crop if the
global temperature is going to keep on
increasing so that was a sort of a big
heavy conclusion of a kind of a rusty
bumpy demonstration here but hopefully
that sort of gives you a flavor of the
kind of stuff that we're working on
behind worldwide telescope as a as a
sort of a visualization engine we're
also getting into things like analytics
and into other aspects of technology and
service of problem solving okay so with
that I had I did have a worldwide
telescope kind of demo of some of the
stuff and see if i can find my cursor
and we'll see if that we can get that to
go so i'll put veg climate away okay so
i'm back to worldwide telescope and i
would like to add a reference frame i'll
just call it DM for distribution modeler
and that reference frame is simply a
little XYZ coordinate system that's
sitting down here at zero degrees
latitude zero degrees longitude and I'll
bring it over the top of that XL once
more and these are some parameters so
each line here can represent sorry let
me look at a more usable version of this
each line here can represent a moment in
time
so as I've been doing in this morning's
presentations I'm going to select select
a block of data here and this block of
data I must battle with my scroll bar
again I think I got it okay this block
of data has a bunch of data headers that
don't particularly mean anything Elwood
m0 beta ji p hg depth g moss and then
color and date those sort of makes sense
but what I'm saying here is that I have
a series of parameters that I'm
interested in exploring and I'll explain
what those parameters are in a second
but just because I'm impatient i'm going
to copy and paste this data into
worldwide telescope and we'll hope that
that works out okay so i have my little
reference frame here called DM i'm going
to paste my data it's going to be X Y Z
data so imma say it's a rectangular
coordinate system and now i have three
axes to choose from so my x axis I'll
make beta whatever that is my y-axis
I'll make gph whatever that is my z axis
I'll make G moss next ok scale factor
i'm going to make that very small
next Gaussian dots is okay color is
color next time is date next okay I
think we're done so if this worked and
we have a data set to explore and sure
enough down here is the data set it's a
little bit faint so I'm going to back
away
right click open up the properties scale
factor and make it a little bit brighter
let's see that's good okay so what have
we done
I'm going to describe what distribution
model or does in a statistical way it
says I have a model that relates
environmental data to observational data
and that model has some parameters so
for example where is my bell curve
centered how high as my bell curve and
so forth and however many parameters
there are in the model that's going to
the sort of generate a n-dimensional
space and then I want to find the place
in that n dimensional space that's the
best fit ok so what you do is you go off
into that n dimensional space and you
calculate if the parameters were right
here then how good with my fit be and
you say oh they're sort of ok now I'm
going to take a random jump over to the
side and I'm going to do it again and if
I did better than I'm going to keep
going this way and keep going this way
until I start doing worse so it's like a
big game of hot and cold and you wander
around in this space until you reach a
point where you can't do any better you
say I found the spot in my parameter
space where things are absolutely the
best for my model and this is the best
fit right here but you're not happy
because you're not sure about how
certain you are right now so you say ok
so I'm going to stay here for a while
but I'm just going to move a little bit
and I'm going to measure how much my
fitness and my goodness of my model
changes is I sort of vibrate around just
in this local area and everyone smile
all step away again make sure ok no
everything's supposed to be right back
here and then I'll vibrate around for a
while so you do that for a while and at
the end of that whole process you say ok
this right here is the best place for
solving my n dimensional parameter model
but it's got a certain amount there's
some uncertainty so I also know that you
know within these sort of two feet is
really where the solution has to be and
the solutions not on the other side of
the room over there I'm really very
confident about that so this is called
Bayesian analysis or Bayesian inference
or bayesian statistics and we have a
picture of it in worldwide telescope
here and what it means is that as we
went through our data set each one of
those rows was another attempt at
finding the right parameters to fit and
this is a picture of wandering around in
that space so we started off doing the
purple stuff let's get rid of all the
stuff around the edges so we started
wandering off in the purple stuff here
and eventually
we sort of found the right place in the
space which is down here in the yellow
and the red and the white so and I can
prove that that's sort of our
destination point besides waving my arms
I can prove that by going back to our
pasted layer here and making it a
time-series layer because I stuck time
one time on each of those rows and the
very first row had the first time the
very last row had the last time and so
if I make this a time series by checking
this box here and hopefully oh you know
what it's going to be hard to see
because of all the light issues so I'm
going to I'm going to take a chance here
and make this much brighter I say take a
chance because there's a little
idiosyncrasy that if you make things too
bright you can crash your display driver
and then you have to reboot your machine
and so forth so let's see how that looks
ok so that's maybe a little bit too
bright let's try that ok so I'm going to
angle myself a little bit so I'm going
to go back to the beginning of time the
beginning of my time sequence here I
can't see my data anymore ok there's my
data so at the beginning i'm wandering
around in parameter space here all over
the place that's the purple stuff and
then it starts to settle down it settles
down and finally it's augers into this
yellow part and then the sort of OOP
walks away and it walks back and it
walks away and it box back and walks
away and walks back and it's getting
more and more confidence and finally it
gets super duper confident and it kind
of zooms down into this this particular
I'm zooming down right now I'm not
actually moving the time slider and it
ends up right here so hooray we've come
to the end of our distribution model or
process so that took like you know
10,000 steps and it shows the walk that
we're taking through our parameter space
ok so that's that's the end of that part
of what I wanted to talk about there's
two more things that I wanted to do
today and then we'll be all done here
the first one is I wanted to actually
publish some data to show what that
looks like so I'll tell you what let's
back up to the beginning of what we were
doing have to find my data again I'm
going to make this even brighter
ok
and i'm going to create a tour so back
at the beginning when we started up
worldwide telescope we were hitting play
and right-clicking and saying presume
using them from here so now let's
actually make a tour so i'm going to
create a tour it's going to be called
let's ham that's all i need to say and
now we have a tour editor up here and
this is my way of telling a story about
this data good i have 34 minutes left so
first I'm going to back away on the
earth and say okay this is going to be
my initial shot of my tour so I'm going
to add a new slide and it does a little
thumbnail capture here and that slide is
on its left ear which is the beginning
point of the slide and then I want that
slide to zoom down to my data so I'm
going to go down here until I can see
that purple initial purple dot I'm going
to right-click and say set end camera
position so now i have a 10 second slide
that starts from where we started and
ends up here i'm just going to save that
so save it as the let'em tour save and
here we are okay not very interesting
because we need to do some time playing
forward in time so let's add a new slide
which will pick up where the old one
left off and let's play forward in time
a little bit so de la la la la la and at
the end of the slide I'm going to move
my perspective to be down here and
looking at that okay that's where I want
to slide the end so I'll say set n slide
position again set end camera position
Oh make a new slide and it'll pick up
where we left off and it'll go do a
little all the way to the end will say
set end camera position and then i'm
going to create another slide that just
sits there quietly and does nothing so
now we have a four slide tour i'll click
on save and let's see what the tour is
going to look like it's going to take
40 seconds to play so for the first 10
seconds because every slide is ten
seconds by default for the first ten
seconds we zoom down to our data which
is that purple stuff and then it goes d
to lead elite for 10 seconds and then it
does d to leave for 10 more seconds and
then for 10 more seconds and then it's
done
okay so that's not going to win an
Academy Award or anything but at least
it serves the purpose of being a tour
that we created and then of course we
can add on to this and i'll just do one
more thing before we move on to
publishing it so i'm going to go back to
the first slide here and i'm going to
insert some text and this happens to be
markov chain monte carlo so i'll call it
mcmc solution deedledee and save
so that's going to be part of the slide
now but just to make sure i'm going to
say set start camera position and i'm
going to make this an animated piece of
text so i'm going to move it down here
and say set end camera position and then
i'll save it and i'll play just to make
sure it does what I think it's supposed
to do I did the opposite of what I asked
it to do but this is weird huh I guess I
added a new slide and it went backwards
anyway it's probably some kind of
strange behavior but it's doing
approximately what I wanted it to do and
I can go back and mess around with it
some more but more to the point I've got
my end result done which is this file
documents okay so there's that file that
we just generated it's three hundred
kilobytes which is mostly data plus the
cinematography and I want to publish
that to the lair escape website which is
like I say acts as a sort of a sharing
and collaboration website it's sort of
like YouTube because you're publishing
movies but the movies are worldwide
telescope movies so I'm going to go over
here and maybe it's down here either it
is okay go back to the lair escape
website I have a windows live ID so that
allows me to publish it log me in
automatically and I'm going to click on
the publish button so this takes me to a
publication page and all I need to do is
browse to my document let em say open
and it'll load it up and I can then
start providing details about this
publication I can just click publish
right now and it will publish it but
just for fun i will show you the
publication details that i can add if i
feel like it i can describe the data
deedle i could put my name and i can
give drew credit because drew did the
work of building distribution modeler
I can create a thumbnail and put it in
here I can put some tags to make it more
searchable I can add other data files
for example I could attach the Excel
data file that I use to generate this
and so forth so there's a lot of
machinery here for publishing stuff
that's associated with your main content
but since I'm trying to be time
efficient here I'll simply say okay
that's pretty much everything I needed
to do i'll click publish and the website
will then create a dedicated page to
this content and if i click on this link
and copy that link and i can go over to
my tutorial page here I'm not logged in
I can edit this page and paste that link
in here and then you can just click on
the link and you can go get that tour so
that's the basic idea of layer scape is
to facilitate people to who are who have
gone through the process of learning how
to use worldwide telescope to then
publish content here you don't have to
publish tours you could publish layers
you can publish excel files you can
publish JPEGs anything you like links
there's no restriction you just have to
have a windows live ID to play along and
then there's also the ability to create
a community or a group and then to
control permission and access to that so
this website which is powered by Windows
Azure the Microsoft cloud service is
freely available as is everything else
that I've described today and you can
just go ahead and use it by virtue of
having a windows live ID if you go to
layer escape the front page of layer
escape the home page I should say has a
bunch of featured communities and a
bunch of featured content and this would
be a good place to start to go to sort
of explore what's going on you can see
there's listing of four different things
here the first three are tours and the
fourth one is a PowerPoint presentation
so if you click on download content you
get a powerpoint presentation which is a
bunch of slides about how to use
worldwide telescope it takes about an
hour to go through and it walks you
through generating a synthetic data set
in Excel exporting that's world wide
telescope and in publishing it's a layer
escape so everything kind of fits
together and you can learn about how to
do it first of all you can sort of get
excited by going ahead and playing
around with playing these different
featured tours and then you can start to
learn through the tutorial okay and when
you go to a particular page let's say
robotic ocean data tour so I clicked on
that it took me to a dedicated page this
one happens to have a video embedded of
what the content looks like so i can
instead of downloading out i can just
press play now the good side about
pressing plays i could just do it from
my browser but the bad side about
pressing play is that I didn't have to
install a worldwide telescope to look at
the content and what we're hoping for is
that worldwide telescope gets adopted
and so we would like is for people to
actually have it installed and click on
the blue button view tour because view
tour will pull in the world wide
telescope file and play the tour back
like we've been doing today but I simply
click on the play button it'll just play
the tour back as a video okay so the
very last thing and I have 26 minutes so
I might actually finish a little bit
early the very very very last thing is
to talk about world wide telescope from
a computer programmers point of view and
I mentioned earlier that that boils down
to basically being able to do print
statements that are in the right format
so worldwide telescope when you have it
up and running is listening to a port on
your computer sort of like paying
attention to a little text box and if
you print into that text box then roll
by telescope will see that and it will
try and gobble it up and parse it and
turn it into actions that it takes okay
so I'd like to show briefly show how
that happens from a programmers point of
view
one of these days my mouse is going to
show up okay there it is I was saying
from a programmers point of view so here
is a programming environment this is
called visual studio and there's a free
version online this is developed by
Microsoft and its back to the free
version online is called visual studio
express works just great and it allows
you to write programs so the stuff
that's in green there is is code it's
commented out which is why it's green
and then the stuff in the other boxes is
sort of support information around that
and this program gets kind of long and
involved because it's it's sort of a
Swiss Army knife of programs it does a
lot of different things but one of the
things that it does well let me just
build the program and show you what the
program looks like see if it builds oh
it did build I just didn't okay so it
builds in and runs so this is what the
program looks like all my programs have
a halt button here at the top because I
usually want them to stop doing whatever
they're doing it's got all these little
tabs here and each one of these tabs is
a different demonstration of talking to
worldwide telescope including this one
here called lat long lines so if I bring
up worldwide telescope when last we left
world wide telescope it was doing deedle
deedle dee somewhere in the middle of
the Atlantic Ocean way down there but
for this demonstration I want to pull
back so here's my application and it
says build some latitude and longitude
lines that are gold there are a hundred
thousand meters above the surface of the
earth or a thousand is something like
that every ten degrees and from negative
ninety to ninety latitude and all the
way around the longitude so we just
click on this button and it worked so
I've now put the earth in a little gold
cage okay and so what did that look like
inside of the program
see I want to bring this back up I'm
going to stop the program
gotta guessed correctly
right spiral generate lat long lines
okay so when I click that button this
little routine ran and first it just
gets a bunch of parameters but the
critical piece here that I wanted to
point out is that there's one line of
code here that creates a layer in
worldwide telescope and so without going
into the details of you know the exact
format of this line the point is that
one line of code called fiducial layer
which is those those that bird cage
around the earth that we just drew is
generated by calling this make earth
layer and then I gave it a couple of
arguments I said it's going to be called
lat long lines that's the name of the
layer and then geometry color is the
format of what I'm going to send you so
I'm going to send you a bunch of
geometry and a bunch of color and the
geometry is just a little individual
line segments that make up that bird
cage and the color is always gold okay
so that line of code right there created
the layer in the earth and then there's
some more code here that actually
generates all of those little things and
you can see the word string shows up a
lot that's because we're creating a
string which is a computer science term
for a bunch of text and at the very end
that layer that we created at the
beginning we call a second time and we
say append all and s is just the
description of the bird cage and it gets
sent to that little window that
worldwide telescope pays attention to
and world wide telescope inhales all
that information in it and it prints the
bird cage the gold framework around the
earth so you say well that's that's easy
for you to say you know it's easy for
you to say because it's already been
done in and it looks fairly
straightforward but the point that I
want to make here lastly is that as a
developer when I get to write code I
don't like to have to go and do things
over and over and over and over again if
I've already solved a problem once I
want that to be it
so that the next time I come back and I
want to do something like this I can use
the solution from the previous time and
not have to make it up again for gosh
sakes so we've done that with the
developer tools for talking to worldwide
telescope and so those are published
it's open source code that you can go
and get the link to it is on that same
webpage as I keep referring to and if
you were to say I gosh I'd like to write
some code that talks to worldwide
telescope you can go and get this code
it's called Narwhal like the whale that
has the Tusk and you can use that code
to simplify the process of talking to or
wide telescope and sending data in there
and so it's not it's I want to minimize
what it takes to become a computer
programmer if you don't happen to have
that skill set yet it requires time and
dedication but on the other hand then
you have the sort of capacity to go off
and do stuff like this and for me it's
very worthwhile and so I'd like to
encourage you to sort of open up the
possibility if you haven't gotten there
and if you already are a developer then
I would say that this kind of
environment is fun to play around with
and it's sitting there available for
free and so you have that option open to
you so to sort of wrap everything up
what I've tried to show today is that
Microsoft Research is very interested in
new frontiers in computer science
technology that we consider that to be
something that happens not in a in a V
tower and a bubble but actually in
relationship to real-world issues and
real problems I'm very very lucky in my
own view of things to be able to work in
the piece of that that applies to
environmental science and so the
problems that are attendant in
environmental science to developing
technology that enables us to sort of
understand this flood of data that we've
created for ourselves is a complex and
interesting set of problems and what we
want to be able to do then is to offer
scientists and students and researchers
and government officials and everybody
out to somebody who's wondering when to
plant their crops solutions that they
can then use to not have to reinvent
things all the time and furthermore to
go way beyond that and to say
the solutions that we're generating our
stuff that you haven't even imagined yet
and if you think about them and see
where that can take you it could take
you much further down the road in what
you're trying to ultimately accomplish
so that's kind of where we're coming
from and in particular we have this
visualization engine which I've able to
talk to you about and then drew will
come in later and he'll describe the
Cambridge tools which will include
distribution modeler which you've
already seen a little bit of an fetch
climate and let's see I think that's I
think that's pretty much everything I'd
like to say so thank you very much for
you've been very patient through a lot
of demos here and we have a couple
minutes if we do want to do any
questions and we can bring up the lights
when ever they can bring the light
person to bear on the lights so but I
can still see you thank
yeah I see a couple of hands
so in microsoft office when you're
working an excel file or excel sheet
into microsoft word for example they are
somehow linked so that if you change
data in Microsoft Excel you see the
changes in months of the word also is it
the possible to do something like this
in this word story exel to wwt yes so
the question is can can you see changes
in your data immediately and that's one
of the things I didn't mention this but
if you install the excel add-in for
worldwide telescope and you have
connected a block of data to a layer in
worldwide telescope and you make a
change to the block of data in excel at
the excel add-in will immediately notify
worldwide telescope and it'll send that
data and refresh it so the two are
connected together I was having the
rocky time with the demos or I would
have shown that but yeah it's absolutely
tied together yep all right thank you
for the demonstration it right here yes
the question is that seem that this
software doing like climate matching
mainly for species distribution models
eating or climate matching yeah so this
software is generalized i use it for
looking at the paths migration migratory
paths of sharks I use it for atmospheric
pressure i use it for seismology i use
it for organic molecules i use it for
anything i can think of it's a generic
tool but you're right that that climate
and the scale of the earth is well
adapted to visualization here my main
question is that when it tries to
predict for other areas what kind of
algorithm it uses like for some model
they use maximum entropy or post like GL
and models what kind of you know
statistic is behind is ripe addictions
so the if your question is what kind of
models are available absolutely the best
guy to ask that question of is drew
purvis who's our second speaker today so
he'll talk about not only climate models
but also global carbon models and
ecological models they have something
called a mattingly model particular
they've worked on where they've sort of
solved for the entire Earth
carbon cycle anyway so I'll just shut up
and let you ask him please do ask him
because he's got some great stuff on
that I have a question when you look at
the locations that long UTM are there
any ways of actually working on map
projections on the tool or if you have
to change anything if you then also the
other question is uh the quality of the
data of fetch climate is there a
metadata what did you get that type of
data set trim satellite or write local
meteorological stations and all them
right so fetch climate does have
metadata you can drill into the fetch
climate data and find out where it came
from and there are some cases where
there's overlapping data values you can
actually choose what source you want
your data to come from so yeah fetch
climate is definitely more than just
giving you a number it's giving you a
number and an uncertainty and a source
so that you can work your way back into
where this data come from and I'm sorry
your first what was your first part it
was more on the GIS yes right what's the
so the basic earth mall here is some
kind of spherical Mercator and that's
the only projection it's that's
available in this virtual globe there's
another sort of actually there's another
productive system called toast which
stands for something but it's more
suited to working at the polls so it's
like a equirectangular projection that
gets draped around the earth model but
that's about all I know about the earth
model at the moment yeah
she's right here
I have a question concerning publishing
the data when you upload the data into
the system is it then Microsoft and
allowed to use it oh right so right
right date embargo so the question is if
you upload your data into worldwide
telescope de Zack somehow become
available to Microsoft and you know
what's the guidelines restrictions and
so forth so first of all when you
install a software you have to you do
the usual I agree to the license thing
and you can read that thing but you're
installing it on your computer and you
can unplug from the internet and use
worldwide telescope on your computer
without ever it connecting to anybody
and in any case even if you were
connected to the outside world your data
would stay on your computer it doesn't
go to Microsoft Microsoft has no
interest in getting data from the
application but it's a very important
question because you need to know
particularly if your data is say
suitable for publication you don't want
it to end up in the wrong hands this led
to us when we built Leigh escape to
create a system of authentication which
is why you need a windows live ID and
you can actually embargo your data in
layer escapes so you can put it inside
of a private folder that only you have
access to and then you can grant access
to your colleagues so that you could
collaborate in that folder but no one
else would never know it was there so
we're very very serious about guarding
your privacy rights around that your
data and we don't want to try and you
know pull that kind of information it's
it's there as a platform for you to use
it's not for us to use yeah
is there anybody else okay good well
let's call that too good I'm around
today and through the rest of this
