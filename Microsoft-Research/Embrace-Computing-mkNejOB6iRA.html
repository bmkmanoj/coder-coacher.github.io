students coming up into the various
domains as a computer science student
comes up in a computer science program a
biology student comes up in a biology
program biology programs don't select
for students that are totally and
utterly enamored of computer science and
it tends also to be the case that
computer science department staff yet
what we're trying to do is to create
this environment where somebody coming
up in one discipline actually not only
understands the value of the other
discipline but actually enjoys it and
appreciate it
so there's one piece of advice and this
is aimed largely like biology graduate
students is embrace computing you have
to ask yourself what you're going to
need to be contemporary 10 years past
your doctoral degree and that means you
need to look back 10 years and see how
your discipline has been completely and
utterly transformed by computing
computing technology so the advice to
the biology students is for heaven's
sakes look to computing and make sure
you graduate with some skills in that
domain
my advice to computer scientists is look
to biology it is about the most exciting
and rapidly changing discipline crying
out for collaboration dealing with
complex neural systems massive databases
genomic proteomic metabolomic networks
it's the world of the omics and computer
scientists are going to be a critical
part of this
