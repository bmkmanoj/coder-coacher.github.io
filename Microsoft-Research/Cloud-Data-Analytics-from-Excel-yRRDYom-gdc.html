extreme computing group and Microsoft
Research and I'm here to show you a
project for people who have problems
working with very large data and would
like to be able to do that with very
familiar tools we have a project which
we've put together which allows you to
use Microsoft Excel to take your large
data work with it up inside of the cloud
how'd that work done for you and be able
to get some meaning out of that data let
me show you what we've put together ok
so what you're looking at here is
Microsoft Excel hundreds and millions of
people use Microsoft Excel every day to
do their work now suppose that you're an
oceanographer and you've gone out and to
do your science you've placed a lot of
sensors out into the ocean already and
they've been collecting data and you
have hundreds of millions of data points
to work with that's not something you
can bring into Microsoft Excel and get
some meaning out of right away but you
can with our technology working with the
cloud so I want to go look at my data I
press the import button and I can see
what data is available to me in this
case I'm gonna click on this ocean data
I don't want to bring all of that ocean
data down right now I just want to get a
sense that this is the data I want to
work with before I launch an algorithm
that could take minutes or hours to work
on so at the bottom here I have the
option to sample that data I'm gonna
look at the first 25 rows in this case
and import my data down and yes this is
what I want to work with this has depth
temperature salinity values and the
location where that data came from so
what I'm gonna do is use a clustering
algorithm that's been written for me and
it's going to give me the options that I
need to work on my data I'm going to
name the task which I'm going to run
I'll call it ocean and the name of the
data result that I'm going to work with
ocean result I know I liked that
particular option data file that I was
that I just sampled from so I'm gonna
select that one tell it to work on that
data and execute the algorithm what you
see here is a sampling of the data which
we just generated from here we can pivot
on the various attributes inside of our
data we see a pattern inside of here we
see that in certain geographical areas
which we colored blue and green it is in
fact at a higher salinity value than our
other areas which we had sampled from if
we had sampled on some other attribute
of the data say it's depth or maybe even
its temperature we don't see that same
pattern
but by having clustered this together
using the cloud brought down through
Excel and brought into this
visualization tool we do know that there
is a value in this case salinity which
maps to the clusters which we did
geographically all right so now you've
seen our project it's a great way of
marrying the technologies of the cloud
Microsoft Excel and a great visualizer
like pivot to get meaning out of large
and complex data boiled down to
something that a user can make easy use
of if you'd like to learn more about it
