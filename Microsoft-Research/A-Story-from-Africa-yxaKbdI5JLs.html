hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
alright so what what are some of the
things that rest up do you mind what you
think of Africa go no don't think I just
shoot quickly quickly for our
presentation
which
okay you can stop down
I pray to the ones too but this is
really interesting end and then hold a
special place in my heart this is the
mca's picture of the night sky and so
you have North America you guys here
everyone in this room rather we have
softened
euro-asia that stuff yeah we got here
for the food on and maybe out where I
promise that original event but if you
look at this and if this was the only
thing she was judged the entire
continent over 1.1 billion people by
there is an opportunity for more reasons
than one and that that was echoed by the
front cover of The Economist from
husband about us why not go and now some
doubt boobies right so I got like like
you said you know you just shot from the
hip and so have a lot of other people
over the past 30 years and the
narratives about Africa and really what
the world had to say suddenly what you
could describe as the Western
we decided before you
but this is one of the covers that that
had a descriptor at least one person's
perspective about this entire continent
and the future of it and so all is not
lost I'm from Africa but basically
African stereotypes sent to fall into
two protein sequence one is uh this
crisis in Africa this is a mass Slavic
child at Mount of the gun that evil
warlord dictator you saw the movie and
everything in between right so this is
like crisis that that is we presented to
you in a very jarring flipping way that
you need to act on something this is
what wants a lot of the news and then
what you rightly said you know the
discovery channel here we can forget
you will untouched pristine beaches you
have the zebra you have Madagascar you
have you know everything that forms the
beauty and majesty of Africa's untouched
lands and then you have one thing hand
don't know a tree falls but in somewhere
between those two and as the little
children of africa and that beautiful
child right there happens to be none
other than
so this is actuated valve pointed it out
and civilized probably some of internets
while I let go suck enough to set them
on their way with this little story so
George Lucas gave man visionary
filmmaker genius in many respects now
he's famous for the likes o
yeah so so Indiana Jones besides being
an amazing franchise of films sigh has
supported and over whether people had a
television series how many people
remember the chronicles of young Indiana
Jones all right okay that's why the
smell something to followed it down
maybe add a joy and a schism now that
serious answer so amongst these ten
eleven seasons of television series
there was one particular season where
Africa came to mind and specifically
within that one season they decided to
go to Kenya of all places and when they
decided for Kenya my dad blessing I
decided to take me young child actor to
be to the casting session and eyeliner
the role of what are some script do you
bang you boys
a little child style episode and I'll
set the scene for you so it's the
pre-colonial African times and indeed
young Indiana's in the middle of the
African portions working his way through
with a big group of people by his side
and it's a British colonial times and so
they just working their way through the
heart of the Jumbo and the Colossus
village all right and something strikes
them as odd about this village it's not
any commotion it's very very still and
then they kind of get this eerie feeling
that something's happened and so they
can't find any of the people because
supposedly they died going to serious
disease and from that little hazy busy
Max's vodka and so this is big dilemma
Indiana's like you know like the kid is
going to come with us and everybody else
like know what it is of the sequel to
series means like Norway and in the end
I get to ride along
this particular shots important because
that was the follow particularly French
of francophone cinema that's his active
and plays an incredible French actor
also active Hollywood films as well but
yeah so there we were we were kind of
making our way through the jungle and
dated on the episode yes this is great
said scene and Indiana has to kind of
break the news to me that okay fought
the good fight but we're going to have
to kind of find a way to get you
somewhere else and so Kyra pools in its
raining the tour bus and a tent he's
looking in my eyes looking in his eyes
in my eyes like you know something's
gotta give but I'm serving the cutie Oh
puppy dog eyes okay I gotta tell the kid
and so you know you can cut the tension
that I parents pretty close in person I
have no lines in this entire episode
look at him consider him in swahili i
need go beauty
and and and trip it all back is in the
final cut until today
to make kids appears the genius
and so kind of summing it up I went
through behind it avoid clock and no
lines of all George Lucas's for that
production about the Africa that I was
supposed to portray to almost two
decades later world premiere of my
question pool in interval which is
pretty much one of activity out this
time you know durban insightful too
personal I read a short report our and I
happened to meet exactly one plate 20
years later
take my bar to do and this is some of
you may recognize this this is
Facebook's map that came out in 2010 by
Paul bottle of an internet-based punk at
the time and it shows every single
connection on the social network and
yeah so basically Africa is not the dark
one set it all last week mobile I'm all
alone the questions rising for all
number of things and if i can give you
one thing that i know i came to me like
this the public school of young people
stories way more awesome tonight your
history they would and this is what you
should think of the next time you see of
Africa
