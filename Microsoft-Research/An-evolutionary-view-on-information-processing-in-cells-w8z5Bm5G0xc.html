you
so it's a big title but i'll try to fill
it fill it with some stuff tribe at the
University of Warwick and running your
wet and dry lab the wet part is very new
so don't ask me questions about that so
what we are interested is is basically
this very simple statement that biology
is a result of evolution so you like to
understand how this process of evolution
works and what kinds of things that can
generate and what kind of processes
drives it and obviously we know about
selections of fit gets fitter but
obviously there are additional processes
in place and even if it's just driven by
selection and we're interested in
understanding what those selective
pressures are so you can abstract the
evolution by this concept of a genotype
phenotype mapping where genotype
represents all the parameters you can
think about that can change a particular
trait and your trade is this phenotype
so you can have this multi-dimensional
mapping between these things that you
can tune or the evolution can tune and
the resulting higher-level behavior that
comes from that so you can put different
species on this kind of a map obviously
this is not multi-dimensional enough but
obviously people will be there and all
the other organisms so we tend to work a
lot on sort of microbial systems because
they are easier to work with but we also
aspire maybe at some point to understand
things like at humans and there are
interesting things happening you come
for example imagine a particle region of
that genotype space could correspond to
very similar phenotypes although they
will be different so for example the
genotypic pole of italy have produced
great politicians but it also produced
great scientists so i also like to
so there are subtle things happening
that we like to understand I also like
to point point out that Luca is used in
evolutionary biology as a as an acronym
for the late the last Universal common
ancestor so that the living thing the
first living thing that gave rise to all
other living things so maybe that's why
I location involved in so many projects
so organisms are obviously difficult to
understand so we take baby steps we try
to first understand and answer some of
these evolutionary questions in the
context of cellular systems and
obviously there is a long history about
this genotype-phenotype mapping and
understanding it in the context of RNA
structure or protein structure we sort
of took the next step of asking very
similar questions for cellular systems
and obviously we already heard that we
can abstract cellular systems as
networks of interacting elements so you
can imagine there's a bunch of different
networks and some of these networks do
different things so the question is how
does evolution move in this space okay
so let me make this a bit more specific
so you can think about cellular networks
that mediate some particular cellular
behavior some some form of information
processing if you want to call it that
way so the here are two examples one is
from chemotaxis a textbook example and
the other one is from yeast
osmoregulation these are arguably the
best studied signaling systems or if you
wish information processing systems in
microbial cells so very briefly kemah
texas involves this kind of random bias
walk so the bacteria will swim around
and every now and then they will make
these tumbles which will cause them to
change their direction and then they
will run again for a period of time
before they change their direction again
so if you put some attractants into the
media you will observe that the bacteria
would go towards that attractant through
this prostitute through manipulating
this process of swimming straight and
tumbling and changing direction so the
underlying signaling network for this
system is very well studied and it turns
out if you look at the dynamics of that
system
I don't know if there is a yeah if you
look at the dynamics of this system
you'll observe this kind of thing if
there is an attractant in the media and
you measure atty protein in that system
this will be the temporal dynamics you
get pay attention to this part where we
have a step change in the signal and the
system responds to that step change but
then goes back to its original level so
that's called an adaptive response
nothing to do with biological adaptation
but adaptive response over time and a
similar response is seen in the ethos
more regulation system but this time it
involves the volume of the cell so we
were interested in understanding how
these systems networks evolve that
provide this kind of adaptive dynamics
which seemed to underline this
physiological behavior and people have
already been thinking about what this
adaptive dynamics might mean and
especially engineering folk have looked
at this and and concluded that this is
actually an implementation of what is
known as an integral negative feedback
control okay so you have a system that
you measure and you like that system to
be at a certain level when the system
deviates from that level you take that
as an error you integrate that error and
you feed that back into the system is a
negative feedback and that will bring
you back to this original state now this
is one particular sort of control
mechanism you can implement but it gives
you two features which are very
interesting one is that kind of
integration integral negative feedback
loop is very robust so you can put any
parameters on it but it will always give
you perfect adaptation and it is it so
that those are the two features it's
very robust and it gives you perfect
adaptation and people then if looked if
chemotaxis do does have those things and
it turns out it does it does have a
negative feedback loop to start with in
terms of the biochemistry that
implements this and it provides very
perfect adaptation and that is quite
robust if you change the kinetic rates
in the system so I'm just realizing I
have too many slides so I'm just going
to go keep going faster
bear with me so we were interested this
is all fine but here we have a complex
network that implements this adaptive
dynamics so the question is well this
dystopia C cannot just come about from
outer space so how do you get there so
what could be alternative systems that
gives this kind of dynamics so to try to
answer that we set up a network sort of
that are evolving in the computer and in
particular we implemented those networks
in cells and let the cells do chemotaxis
so these are results from those types of
simulations you start cells over here
you let them swim around due to the
output of their cellular networks and
these are the generations so over time
you find some cells start to do
chemotaxis so you can then quantify that
level of chemotaxis and look what kind
of networks you have evolved and to our
surprise we didn't find adaptive
dynamics but we have found ultra
sensitive dynamics so i will not go into
the detail of how this works but we
could then use even simpler models to
quantify that this kind of response can
indeed lead to kemah texas and if you
and its performance this of this non
adaptive dynamics depends on sensitivity
and so does the performance of this
adaptive response so we had this sort of
evolutionary idea that as sensitivity of
the system evolves over time there might
have been a time where ultra-sensitive
dynamics might have been preferred
solutions to chemotaxis so this gave us
this idea that maybe ultra sensitivity
is important but we were using
especially in those evolutionary
simulations very simple abstract models
of how these interactions in cellular
networks work so we were interested in
understanding how these different
strategies or responses might be
implemented in real biological systems
and ultra sensitivity is actually very
well known to be all over the place in
biology so there are different ways of
implementing ultra sensitivity there are
these map key signaling pathways that we
heard of and sort of feedback loops in
transcription and so on but in bacteria
some of these sister
they're present but if you look at
bacterial signaling that underlines
something like chemotaxis it doesn't
work like in the in the mouth k system
it works through these so-called two
component systems and these are slightly
different because they use a different
biochemistry so instead of using ATP
mediated phosphorylation they use these
phosphotransfer reactions so there's a
receptor with get auto phosphorylated
upon some signal receiving of a signal
and that force forget transferred to
another protein that when phosphorylated
ex is a as a functional protein and does
something gene regulation or whatever
interestingly the dynamics you get from
these kinds of systems is it's very
simple and you can't imagine having
ultra sensitivity or by stability unless
you start to sort of write very complex
reaction teams involving sort of data
and complexes and things like that so we
wants to understand what evolution can
make with these kinds of two component
systems and obviously this is yes so
evolution has to work with what is there
right that what the figure is try to
represent so you have different kinds of
architectures when you look at these two
component systems in particular those
kinds of transfer reactions can be
implemented between different domains so
you can move domains around and you can
have different configurations of
phosphoric transfers so you can have
multiple domains for example then you
end up with these kinds of relays or
what people call relays or you can have
two different endpoints where the
phosphoric and transfer and so on so the
question was why why do we have these
kinds of architectures what is happening
here what kind of dynamics are possible
I'm shooting for 15 minutes is that fun
so the way we went about this is
basically it is similar to exploring
this genotype phenotype space right so I
have obviously I have constrained it
largely but I do especially want to look
at these phosphorylate systems where you
can have all kinds of false for transfer
reactions and all of them can go
backwards as well so these represent
different domains where the phosphate
can go and you can now say well I can
enumerate
the system in terms of the parameters
and obviously I can set some parameters
to 0 such that some of the transfers
don't happen so we wanted to understand
which we do that and you can say that
these things then will correspond to
some topologies we want to look over
topologies and what kind of dynamics
that they can do and particularly we're
interested in this ultra sensitivity
because we think it's embolden
chemotaxis or in general it's an
interesting nonlinear dynamics to look
at so we want to characterize this sort
of final step here and look whether it
behaves sort of in a saturating manner
or in a nonlinear sort of ultra
sensitive demeanor when we input a
signal at the top so and we can sort of
simulate multiple parameters so we
created sort of thousands of systems for
each of the topology and and you just
classify them so we were sort of doing
on this this thing and then some
mathematicians came along and they say
what are you guys doing we can just
solve these systems and tell you what
the answer is going to be and that was
great because they could really solve
solve the systems but because before I
give the punch point what we were seeing
from those simulations is only few
topologies gave rise to nonlinear
dynamics and only in certain parameter
regions in particular we were finding
that there is this reverse
phosphorylation reactions that needed to
be high compared to forward
phosphorylation reactions so this black
here represents the output it's sort of
linear saturating here non linear over
here and that's exactly what the
mathematicians found they found these
conditions on the parameters that were
sufficient that were required sorry for
those response or the output of the
system to be sigmoid ille so that was
great and that was confirming that the
these reverse force relations needed to
be larger than the forward
phosphorylation so then we looked at the
sort of simplest system that can
implement that kind of reverse
phosphorylation a system with two
endpoints which then can reverse
forcefully and we could again but
symmetrically show the conditions for
the nonce it non-linearity here but also
experimentally show it because this
system is small and simple enough we can
reconstitute unit as
so okay I'll have to rush through this
but this is the fun bit so the other
interesting aspect in biology of these
systems is that there are exists and
phosphorylates where each of these
domains are encoded on a different
protein and there are others where these
domains are encoded in the same protein
so like here so you can combine the
first three steps in one or the last
three steps into one it turns out that
this this system does not allow any
amount of stability but when you combine
things in a single protein then you have
my list ability possible so working
together with the same motivations we
could well actually first we could
intuitively understand what is going on
here so we took that the simpler system
sorry the simpler system and sort of
took away reactions one by one until the
lost by stability when you do that you
end up with this system which is the
simpler system you can still have I
stability and there you can then start
getting your intuitive understanding of
how that by stability is achieved so you
basically have four states of this to
domain protein and you can sort of write
down the reaction cycles how the system
goes between those four states and you
can start to understand where the by
stability comes from yeah overestimated
my ability to rush through slide but the
point is that what we could then
mathematically prove is that as you
increase the number of the small T
domain top protein in the system and
connect them to the same downstream
protein we can reach unlimited multi
stability here and the multi stability
scales up with the number of systems you
can hook up to the same guy at the
bottom and here's the relation with the
number of steady States for any systems
you get to n plus 1 steady States in
this kind of system what it does for so
this is very interesting mathematically
because you can get
multi stability assuming that the
signals so all these things are the same
we don't really know what that means for
a bacteria but we can also show that if
those systems were receiving different
signals then you can easily implement
logic gates in the system and this is
thanks to look at that he sort of looked
at these and provided us with some
parameters where we can easily show that
these systems can do end or great or
gates and so on and it also sort of
functions like editor which
interestingly experimentally have shot
it has been shown place in one system
that this system makes is another so I
have final few slides here if I can
borrow one minute so where we want to go
is really so we had these evolutionary
simulations which were we use really
abstract systems and then we had these
sort of genotype phenotype mapping
studies where we try to understand what
these biochemistry is really mean so
ideal situation is to combine the two
things right and somebody already used
this quote so everything must be simpler
but it's possible but not simpler so
what are the sort of aspects that we
would like to have in the evolutionary
simulations and if we input those
aspects how are we dealing with the
evolution and there have been recently
trying to work with rule-based models
because we think they better deal with
the complexity and we try to put
rule-based modeling's in an evolutionary
context sort of to try to encode these
kinds of models in a genome and evolve
the genome to get sort of complex
structures that better represent
biochemistry but obviously much more
difficult to analyze so with that I
thank you all and especially</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
