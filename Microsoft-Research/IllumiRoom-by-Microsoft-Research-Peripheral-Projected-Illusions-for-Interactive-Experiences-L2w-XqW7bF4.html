system that augments the room
surrounding a television screen with
peripheral projected illusions to
enhance traditional gaming experiences
for example such illusions can change
the appearance of the room turning the
living room into a cartoon world the
illusions can distort reality extend
field of view and enable entirely new
gaming experiences our vision for a
productized illumiroom system is an
ultra wide field-of-view device that
sits on the user's coffee table and can
cover a large area surrounding the
television
our current prototype uses a commodity
wide field-of-view projector and a
Kinect sensor the Kinect captures color
in geometry of the room and the
projector displays illusions around a
television screen the illumiroom system
is self calibrating and designed to work
in any living room
the most obvious way to increase
immersion is to simply extend the
content from the television screen out
into the room replacing the physical
reality with the game's reality instead
of simply extending the game content one
can focus only on the high contrast
features for example highlighting only
the edges with focus plus context
selective only certain game elements
escape the television for instance with
the first-person shooter we can bleed
only weapons fire or explosions out of
the television we can also display
markers representing other characters or
key items in the game the room furniture
can be used to mask out some areas
making it appear that the game is being
played beyond the wall of the room
illumiroom can change the appearance of
the room to match the mood of the
on-screen content
for example one can saturate the room
colors make the room appear
black-and-white or highlight the rooms
edges by distorting and reprojected
texture it is possible to warp reality
and make it appear as if the room itself
is responding to the game we can also
generate completely abstract illusions
which greatly enhance the peripheral
motion but do not borrow content from
the game or the room with the snow
illusion snowflakes can be affected by
the speed of the racecar but they can
also bounce off the real furniture or
accumulate on the floor of the room
motion effects can also be illustrated
by bringing lighting from the game into
the room
and finally a game object could fall out
of the screen and bounce on the real
floor of the room or roll under the
coffee table using the same physics as
in the game
some illusions like focus plus context
full require direct access to the game
source code and it's rendering however
it is also possible to drive the
illusions with limited or no access to
the game for example we implemented a
real-time optical flow computation to
infer camera motion from any video
footage like the game borderlands shown
here we can also intercept controller
input directly and use it to drive
peripheral projected illusions this
example shows commercial game portal
augmented in such a way finally almost
all illusions can be combined with one
another which makes them an easy and
flexible palette for designers to tailor
the desired experience to any given game
or other video content
in addition to playing games a loom room
can be used to watch movies and
television we can display panoramic
video content with focus plus context
full or with focus plus contact
segmented displaying the video only on a
portion of the wall
we can also blur the peripheral content
to decrease its emphasis this footage
was captured with a custom dual camera
rig that simultaneously captures a
narrow and a wide field of view video
because we are not projecting on a flat
white screen
we must compensate for the color and
geometry of the rooms furniture on the
Left we see the image the projector is
displaying and on the right what the
viewer sees with any projector it is
difficult to completely neutralize the
effect of bright ambient illumination
here you can see the performance of
illumiroom with the lights on these
illusions are just a small sample of
what is possible with the illumiroom
system in summary illumiroom enables a
palette of peripheral projected
illusions that create novel interactive
experiences in any room</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
