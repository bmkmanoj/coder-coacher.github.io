hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
so this is a talk about dangerous ideas
we're going to be covering five
Dangerous Ideas tonight I know I've been
invited here under the auspices of
speaking about apps and having nice
designed apps and we're going to get to
that point but we can't really talk
about design unless we zoom out and talk
about creativity and creativity itself
is a dangerous idea because creativity
forces us to ask why not just how when
you mix creativity with technology you
get a very volatile combination and that
also is dangerous but these five ideas
aren't going to be dangerous tonight
just because of that the five ideas I'll
be arguing for tonight may be dangerous
because they might go against what you
believe about code what you believe
about programming what you've been
taught to believe makes a good app makes
good design how people should think
about it it might force you to think as
we move from a software engineering
company to a devices and service company
just exactly what type of developer is
going to be best suited to take
advantage of that transition in our own
Microsoft future and those might be
challenging to you I hope they are I
personally believe them what I'm going
to be saying the next five ideas that
will be talking through doesn't mean you
necessarily have to believe them in fact
I kind of hope you don't but it's
important to me that we have this debate
because these five ideas I don't think
we're talking about them enough here at
Microsoft and it's what I'm passionate
about it's what my career has been
focused on and it's these conversations
I think we desperately need to get to
continue to be relevant and to thrive in
the future that we're building out for
ourselves and for and for the world so
the only thing I ask of you is an open
mind for the next hour and let's go
through these ideas so let's get started
here's the first idea you can't have
great design without creativity this
might make sense on the surface when you
think about it though a lot of
people don't act as if this is true
they'll find the design they'll try and
pick it from somewhere else and then
they'll bring it on to their platform
but it hasn't actually been natively
grown the challenge of this is based in
to the word design itself because design
is both a noun and a verb so there is a
duality to design we'll talk about it
people will often talk about design as a
noun I like the design of that app but
if you talk to designers you talk to
professionals they usually think of
design as a verb I design great apps
when we think of design as a verb it's
this behavior that we go through so as
you're building your apps if you are
really going to be designing your apps
this is what great design looks like
when you ask professionals what design
is this is from Donald dorman great
design is visceral design plus
behavioral design plus reflective design
visceral design is that gut feeling that
ten-second Wow when you fire up a nap
when you do any experience isn't just
for apps this is design in general
what's that feeling that you immediately
get that's the visceral design
behavioral design of course is how it
works is it stable is it solid and
reflective design is is this app is this
operating system is this device
reflecting back on to me the tasks the
apps the desires that I want to embrace
in my lifestyle is it reflecting back on
me what I want to do when the types of
experiences I want to have all three of
these together is what makes a great app
but in order for this process of design
to really be sustainable it requires
creativity because those artifacts those
nouns that most of the world thinks
about when they say design that frutiger
that grows off the tree which is the
process of design that tree requires a
fertile territory of creativity and
creativity looks very very different
from how a lot of us might be used to
writing code in writing apps because
creativity requires four elements to
thrive it requires exploration
experimentation the freedom to fail and
most importantly fun these
for things in any OS in any app in any
device in anything you build if you can
nail these four things you will start
generating and churning through
creativity you will be attracting
creative talent and you will be
generating creative talent and as you
milled the soil of creativity good
design eventually starts growing I say
eventually because most of us are
comfortable with exploration and
experimentation but a lot of us aren't
too comfortable with this and a lot of
us don't even think of this as being on
our scorecards but these two are
actually two of the most important ones
in order to get a sustainable level of
creativity and you need a sustainable
level of creativity to get that design
and to start consistently generating a
harvest of well-designed apps and
well-designed experiences the second
idea and these kind of build off of each
other so once we kind of have an
understanding of what design is in the
context of creativity and more
importantly why creativity is important
the next dangerous idea that builds on
that is this the main space of the light
here's what I mean that Microsoft our
windows store when we're thinking about
apps there are many times we have a very
binary concept of apps you might have
heard this yourself I know I've heard
this in the almost two years I've been
here well is it a game or is it an app
kind of make you want to choose one or
the other who's it for is it enterprise
or is it consumer Enterprise to consumer
creates a spectrum of potentiality same
with transactional to immersive I'm not
going to use gaming because actually
we're talking about immersive
experiences that paper app that a lot of
the ex courier guys made that's on ipad
is that a game or is that a transaction
lap it you know where exactly does that
fall in its values that it's immersive
the crafting of the light there isn't
the same thing as building a game you're
creating a delightful experience for
whatever your app is trying to do well
so instead of thinking of these as
binary if you work at an agency house
creative director at a company of record
for us before joining microsoft anybody
who walked in through that door
regardless of what type of app or
experience they needed would fall
somewhere
on this domain space of delight and no
matter where you fall you can craft a
delightful experience but it would fall
somewhere between transactional to
immersive somewhere between Enterprise
to consumer a challenge we have at
Microsoft and what I've been finding is
we make gazillions of dollars down here
at the transactional Enterprise corner
we're really really good at that we also
make gazillions of dollars up at the
highly immersive consumer targeted
corners and so we kind of do want to
fill into this well what bucket is it
going for but what's interesting when we
talk about crafting the light and
creative coding and the changes that
have been going on in the past decade is
that most of those experiences have come
in from this kind of mid band over here
that sometimes you get a little
uncomfortable with but if you understand
this graph there's one more dimension I
need to add to it that's the dimension
of data density these three dimensions
plot the domain space of delight as a
professional designer if you're working
on your app your app is going to fall
somewhere in this cube and where it
falls on that cube will determine what
type of design it has which will
determine what type of delightful
experience you can craft for it let me
give you some examples here Visual
Studio zenterprise focus that's highly
transactional but it has a very high
data density whereas a crud app will
create read update the lead app you want
to add a time card it's a very low data
density but it's just as enterprise and
it's just as transactional something
like a basic weather app still
transactional but it's focused for
consumer and it usually has low data
density now gaining is interesting
because you can have something like halo
which we normally think of as gaming
which is high data density a lot of
vertex shader a lot of shaders going on
about a 3d modeling going on a lot of
rendering going on hi data density
highly immersive highly consumer but
then you could have something like Angry
Birds it just as immersive just as
consumer focused but it's low data
density what is delightful about each
one of these apps and wherever your app
is going to be falling on this domain
will help influence how exactly to kind
of
turn out call out that delight from your
experiences one challenge we have is for
Windows Store our current design
guidelines which I believe in are very
optimized toward low data density and
they're optimized toward transactional
they're doing a very good job of
balancing out enterprise to consumer
again they're doing a great job and our
messaging is very strong on this but
against the cube of possible experiences
there's still a lot of area that's
undefined and we should ask ourselves
why is this the case is there something
specific to how we think about code that
is causing us to be over optimized in
these areas I think there is and it
takes us to the third dangerous idea
this is going to be one of Legos versus
clay the argument is that there are two
ways of looking at code there's a way we
look at code traditionally here at
Microsoft and I not just Microsoft the
world of classical engineering but there
is an equal opposite equivalent way of
looking at code this metaphor of Legos
versus clay might help us to kind of
understand what I'm talking about Legos
are great for certain reasons they're
highly object-oriented they're very
valuable unreadable the reusable pneus
of this right it's repeatable the way
you work with Legos most importantly
it's dependable you can build in its
scales these are great engineering
qualities to have clay on the other hand
is freeform very expressive exploratory
in nature and disposable which shouldn't
be taken lightly there's value in being
able to whip up a quick sketch in clay
mess it right up throw it away splatter
it build something and that's not even
your final it's not even a beta it's not
even your finished thing you're going to
have to rebuild it again later on but
you're using clay because you're
exploring ideas you're trying to figure
out and pull out that delight from
whatever you're trying to build I don't
want to take anything away from legos
you can be very creative with Legos fact
they're very few things cooler in this
universe than a star Kraken right then a
space crack and destroying a Star
Destroyer that's just one of the coolest
things I've ever seen you can be
creative with Legos of course what's
interesting is Legos though the process
you generally start Legos are themselves
components you start with the template
most people do right most of us don't
instantly become Lego masters great
creating freeform whatever we want most
of us start with the template think of
it in terms of components and then build
something that's already been conceived
somewhere else even when we think about
this again I love Legos it's very very
cool they can be very expressive but
seriously here if we're talking about
professional and not even professional
just passionate design if your desire is
bringing shape and form to an idea that
hasn't been expressed before if it's
really about innovation and breaking the
barriers clays what they teach you you
don't go to art school and have a class
on late you know have a course on Legos
you might write it I'd be an easy a or I
had to be here like a fun class but come
on Stan Winston when you're working on
Hollywood and it's not just Hollywood
kids with play-doh Lego innately has
these properties for also being creative
they're both equally they both have that
sense of creativity but the way you work
with Legos is very very specific and
very different from the way you work
with clay the level of detail is great
now for most of us I'm going to assume
maybe a lot of you if you've come to
this talk on creative coding most of us
here in 2013 we got our start in flash
can I just see how many people actually
maybe started with flash or played with
flash back in the day all right cool hi
flash was that revolutionary technology
that was that first digital lump of clay
that a lot of us had been waiting all
our lives for and it said here be smart
and creative at the same time it's ok to
be messy this was revolutionary for us I
don't want to oversell it but flash in a
certain way almost single-handedly
helped us do this transition from web 10
to web 20 web 10 where it just works to
web 20 it's delightful it was flash that
did this these were the experiences
that's flat started enabling in the
early turn of the this 21st century and
it reach Ainge twee thought was possible
for creative coding for coding in
general for interactive experiences of
delight it's flash that this and for a
lot of us flash was his first low for us
that let us be messy and we didn't know
what we were doing all right you have
street artists coming in tattooed all up
and they're writing books that are
bestsellers you know flash to the core
by Joshua Davis he goes on and works on
the UI for a big blue from the Jeopardy
computer right yeah so flash did the
sports flash was amazing flash gave this
to us and it changed and what's
interesting is once you move from
something being functional to something
being delightful you can't go back this
is we're going to get back to this point
and a little bit but something happens
during this fundamental clay technology
that flash was and it gave us this
acknowledgement that it was okay to be
messy it didn't have to be about
components it could be about clay it
could be about mistakes the lego
builders come in and they say here let
me fix that for you so now let me look
at what you're doing oh my goodness you
have a go to and play frame flirty on
your timeline where in the world is the
code for that it's buried behind a movie
clip on this what's going on here you
have no object oriented you have no MVC
you have you have designers writing code
designers don't write code why would
they ever want to write code designers
like mark up the big meme at the time
was designers don't code they need
markup on the front and we'll put the
code behind in the back for the real
programmers to come in and do their
thing right that's nice thanks for
playing clay but this is a Lego world
and they get flashed and they turn it
into a lego scalable product that's not
wrong because even for anything that's
dependable clay can be very expressive
you get to a certain point if you don't
think architecture just falls in on each
other right I'm not arguing for clay /
Legos I'm making the point that these
are two equally valid ways of looking at
code
the reaction of course to that for most
of us who were originally flashes down
that is in my Tesla bro right I mean I
like coding messy I like playing with
clay don't instantly try to over
engineer and over optimized it but Flex
is needed because at a certain point the
creativity and innovation generally
comes from clay and in Lagos comes in
when you need to start investing on
scale on reusability on dependability
this is the way business works and so
it's very valid and flex became
important for businesses making a lot of
money but flash kind of stayed that
fertile area of creativity who read
aloud artists to be messy to sketch
Microsoft like many others at the time
because we have Legos in our DNA it's
how we think about programming and we're
optimized for that we like that concept
of some xml-based definition on the
front end and real code on the back end
so we bring in WPF that brought in WPF
3d which led us to do some really cool
things and made it accessible XNA which
didn't have the market on the front end
was pretty much one of the closest to
the clay type of technologies we had and
of course Silverlight started as WPF II
everywhere these were good tools these
were good Lego tools and a lot of us
coming from the flash world made a lot
of good money bringing our clay
techniques into this space for Microsoft
but while Microsoft and many other of
the those that are in the business of
software and we are we're following the
LEGO model which you need for
scalability something interesting
happened in the clay world eventually
they needed more so Casey Reyes Ben Frey
John Maeda at MIT they started off with
the draw by numbers this trend started
coming in that coding stopped being just
for people wanting to be serious
computer science degree holding
programmers and everybody was slowly
starting to realize that code is the
medium of the day artists started
realizing that code is the relevant
medium of the day fashion designers
started realizing that code architects
start to realize
that code many many in the industry
started needing to code and they don't
necessarily think in this lego model
world that works so well for us mit
starts off processing and it really
explodes up today it could be argued
it's the lingua franca of programming if
you're not in the business of software
processing is usually the first language
you learn if you go to Khan Academy and
you're a young person and you want to
learn programming they teach you
processing we come from a world where
our first application most likely was a
hello world and then 200 pages later
into our C++ book we might actually draw
something onto the screen the world
today in 2013 most people unless you're
becoming that type of programmer their
first app is drawing a red circle on the
screen that's our first introduction to
programming this entire concept of
shifting from compiler up to experience
down is already out there and processing
now is the lingua franca processing was
java-based and eventually they need it
even more because designers and
creatives needed even more power so
Parsons School of Design Zach Lieberman
couple others they wanted to get all the
way down to C++ so they create
openframeworks it's an abstraction
library for working with C++ comes out
of Parsons School of Design a couple
years later as canvas starts getting
important html5 starts getting here John
Resig start sporting a lot of the
processing concepts to be viable in the
browser we have processing jazz 2010 the
barbarian group who just finished
winning the gold line at Cannes a couple
months ago for their work on cinder open
source their abstraction libraries I
think here I've heard through the
grapevine right an MSR has their own
obstruction divers right they work
because you want to get the most pull
out of your code doing C++ to the GPU is
the best way to do that especially as we
move from a plugged into the wall in
limited CPU in the GPU world to a
devices world where its calculations per
watt and cost per pixel of course it's
going to be C++ in the GPU these are
abstraction libraries that the open
source community that the clay
developers started working on iterative
ly to be able to experiment lower and
lower into the computer
but again they're not thinking compiler
up there thinking C++ experience down
that requires abstraction libraries
these are the types of experiences I'm
talking about and the types of
developers on talking about when we
release the Kinect hardware cinder the
barbarian group right Robert Hodgins
creates his body dysmorphia video like a
week after week after the deal the
drivers get out Robert Hodgins starts
doing this and it starts going viral we
and especially MSR and I want to give ms
are the props that they deserve have
always been are having a good
relationship with these people but in
the rest of the company we're not really
having that many conversations with them
these are the people that were creating
the Kinect experiences a year before we
released our own windows drivers they
had to use hacked open and I drivers on
our own hardware using C++ in visual
studio but because they don't look and
act like our traditional MVPs they're
pretty much this dark matter of our
developer universe last thing I want to
bring out the paper app as we know a lot
of the the people here from paper that
came out and just exploded as a one as
one of the best experiences on the iPad
they were the people who are working on
courier and so I write them up I go hey
do you use openframeworks in der cuz I'm
giving this talk so I'm trying to figure
out you know what what's what's out
there and he writes back and he says hey
a number of us both on the engineering
and design site at 53 are former
Microsoft errs I used to work on bing
maps street side and Photosynth
currently papers rendering components
are all written in cross-platform C++
using OpenGL ES for both ink rendering
and other views that showed journals and
pages our production code doesn't use
openframeworks or cinder it's all custom
we do develop prototypes using
frameworks as well as lighter weight
technologies like JavaScript and this
value of when you're creating an
experience that's never existed before
and you need to experiment and you need
to fail and you need to be driven by fun
and passion and you're prototyping
rapidly
you need to think of code in a way that
fosters that and that's not components
and starting with templates and putting
code behind it's these types of
transitions which leads to the fourth
dangerous idea we are currently in a war
of attrition for hackers of delight
this is not about platforms this isn't
windows vs apple at all this is
paradigms how you think about code
because again all of these run on
windows 7 and most of them with the
exception of processing which has its
own IDE all of them have strong visual
studio support they all are creating
experiences that they tried to reach as
broadly as possible so of course they're
using OpenGL because that also ran on
our desktop it's a way how you think
about code we're doing this and again
some of us are bilingual we would take
the tricks from over there and make good
money bringing them down into here so
we're fine as well but this was the
ecosystem we had so before I show you
the next slide I want to make sure you
know that I work at Microsoft cuz I
believe in Microsoft I believe are in a
good position and are going to go that
way I believe in when Artie and I
believe in our strategy I came here
because of that because build 2011
convinced me to leave my job in
Microsoft was going to be able to help
build the future but this is what
happened last year and I knew this
coming in Windows Store apps winrt
because it's direct x only for right now
cinder processing well cinder
openframeworks processing all of the
abstraction libraries that use open jail
they can't deploy on a surface RT
because when our T's directx only we
also went ahead and don't have these on
our Windows Store applications I say
well Rick well we still have W we stop
see sharpens Amal yeah that's true but
it's not the same thing as WPF because
every language in every paradigm has
kind of probably should have done it as
a slide instead of my hand shadow but
you have the zone of probability and
then you have a much broader zone a
possibility right here are the things
you're most likely going to do with this
language here's actually the broader
zone of everything you pretty much can
do with that language WPF was great
because it had a very clear way of
thinking about software and data binding
and
IM riding components and storyboards but
it gave you all this messiness to it was
great it gave you WPF 3d it gave you
pixel shaders not necessarily vertex
shaders because so that's great we
though and I agree with this decision
optimized see sharpens Amal for Windows
Store and we definitely reduce down that
zone we've made see sharpens Amal lean
and mean and really tight for certain
types of template derived applications
but you can no longer do 3d which for us
was our hawk right we came from the clay
world bringing all our Phoenix the bag
felix the cat bag of tricks right we
can't do shaders anymore we can't have
non-rectangular clipping paths we can
clip as long as it's a rectangle masking
all that's gone because it's become lean
and mean for a certain type of app and
it's very very good at it if you want to
do anything other than that you say all
you have to do it in c++ and directx but
again war of attrition c++ directx11
first how many schools are teaching
DirectX again preface it I love DirectX
so an amazing technology and just
metrics two metrics I believe it is
stronger and better than OpenGL that's
not the point I'm making when I walk
into a bookstore and there's tons of
OpenGL es2 there's tons of WebGL books
there's three books right now on directx
11 all three of the books are obsoleted
on Windows 8 because all three of the
books use ad3d ex-library that's also
not supported on Windows Store we have
HTML in canvas but at this point last
year we didn't have WebGL this is the
depressing slide of the talk it gets
better you know so don't leave now or
you'll just leave the press that gets
much much better but this is being Frank
of where we are there's one of the
values in DP and having this
conversation so we can understand it's
not that they're not here because they
don't want to be it's just we kind of
undercut the abstraction libraries that
they're used to now we quickly need to
start filling it back up not only did we
undercut it to them we undercut it to
the agencies where I come from
that we're getting paid for making
amazing things here it's really really
hard to do something that's not
transactional that's immersive on our
platform let me put it a much more easy
way is it fun is it fun for you to code
to experiment on a Windows Store app if
it's not fun if it's not delightful
you're not going to get fun and
delightful so here's some of the things
we've been doing now it starts getting
better unity we lost XNA but we got
unity this is amazing and this is a high
meh over in DP as well as a lot of other
people they gorge acciardo they've been
pushing this through unity this is a
good choice because unity that's us
deploy and that's gamers deploy and in
these deploy across all the platforms
they want and we're getting in there as
a first-party level of distribution for
Windows Store going out to phone this is
really good I heard thirty percent of
all unity apps aren't games focused
right but forty-two percent of all
statistics are made up on the spot right
but I heard thirty percent those are the
types of apps we're talking about there
is a reason when I'd go to even to MSR
as a tech fest how many times an MSR did
you have to use XNA because it was the
easiest way of throwing in a 3d model
and then doing some crazy MSR vision on
them everybody used XNA or silver light
as you need to start creating Windows 8
what library going to use unity is there
for you processing j/s because we have
JavaScript applications again brilliant
idea I thoroughly lot it processing.js
can come over and I've created around
six hours of content on Channel nine
courses on teaching you how to use this
but it's still only 2d but the biggest
one is ms open Tek after banging and
knocking on their door and really just
begging they took on the challenge of
porting cinder over and they did it you
being cinder for Windows Store and it's
there it's the first iteration but this
is good and I'll be showing this code
specifically because I was really really
excited that we got this
but cinder now can port to Windows Store
there are a couple things we'd like to
do but we're get to their cinders there
now this is the serious one it's a c++
abstraction library fire Visual Studio
2013 making a Windows Store nothing
fancy but you bring it in and you now
have an abstraction layer that lets you
easily have fun and explore and create
in C++ the rest of the world was doing
it we like to think in a C++ is the much
more reserved hey no graybeard
technology the rest of the world's using
C++ for fun artists are coding C++
because these abstraction libraries are
giving them that power I do want to call
out a couple other efforts that I think
are worth mentioning Roberto sannino
from and more people from the visual
studio team created a visual studio 3d
starter kit if you did want to start
looking at directx11 natively you
definitely start there Sean Hargreaves
and Chuck Walburn of XNA Fame we're able
to map lot of the thinking it's
something called a direct text tool kit
if you're coming from XNA you want to be
experimenting with this I would
definitely start there a lot of us
though didn't come from XNA but if you
are coming from that those are great
great tools to check out data-driven
documents I'm not sure exactly what the
support is yet it's one of the things
next on my list but my buddy and also
flash a guru from back in the day grant
Skinner created create j/s and easeljs
which are amazing for JavaScript based
applications so if you're going to
JavaScript you have support starting up
now if you're coming from the creative
space you can at least start at cinder
and some works with processing if you're
coming from this stack down here you can
be jumping into here so we're getting
these tools just a lot of people are
talking about them I'd love to see us
start using these more as we're figuring
out our delightful experiences the
biggest news and the thing that just
made me really really happy this year
after we got cinder 8.1 WebGL this is
huge for us to get back that credibility
on this stack up here it's really really
really big WebGL is coming with three
J's support another homegrown feature of
one of our dpe big brains out of France
created a library just recently released
it called Babylon j/s which might help
out if you still don't trust this kind
of open source way of doing things
no these are dangerous ideas also most
importantly cocos2d which is a good
gaming platform but there's a difference
here between what I'm talking about in
these types of things like unity and
cocos2d i fire up unity i fire up
cocos2d they're already assuming I'm in
a game space you start a direct example
or at least that eight point 0 they've
changed this down we've been talking
with them to try and get them to change
that it would be well what's your game
render we're talking about experiences
aren't necessarily under the paradigm of
gaming it's experiences that are messy
by nature so this is really good our
futures getting there and it's very very
bright we can be working on this if you
want to learn more about any of the
things up on the board please let me
know after it I can definitely be
helping you up with the samples and
tutorials that I've been finding this is
really the deal good slide we're working
on it it's a work on progress to build
those bridges back to the clay area I'd
say that our last dangerous idea though
is that it's not about experiences or
excuse me it's about experiences let me
read my own slide here what iron it's a
bad experience is not app and I really
do believe that we can win this it's
dangerous because of this if you haven't
seen bill Buxton's talk a couple weeks
back on build on liquidus complete
computing please go see that now and I
apologize ahead of time for mr. Buxton
because I will most likely misquote him
and probably misrepresent him but as of
right now I'm co-opting his ideas
because I thought it was just brilliant
brilliant talk but here's my main
takeaway from this we talked about that
shift that happened in flash with the
web web 102 web 20 first it worked then
it had to be delightful and once you got
to delight you really can't go back this
is how bill framed the idea and really
expanded on it that there's these
miracles that define delightfulness when
computers first came out in the late 70s
and all of a sudden you can get the kit
and make it yourself right and yet to
save after 60 bytes because there's
going to buffer out at anybody so I was
just really really painful back in the
day but we loved it the little time
extent Claire's ride and those old
machines and we loved hacking on them
and it was painful and we'd hook it up
through an RF 4c around the TV and
everything be fuzzier I didn't making
those phone calls it was great
was delightful because the miracle was
that it just worked the fact that all of
a sudden we had a computer in our house
was insane it exists it works that was
the miracle that was the light but as we
lived and survived through web 20 and
now we're entering into this PC plus
world of devices of liquidus computing
all these other things today people
expect it to work what they really want
is for it to delight them that's what
the driver is doing now and you can't
just give them delightful you just can't
give them a magnesium shell and think
it's going to be a premium product it
also has to be a rock-solid OS but if
you have these two things because
they're assuming that it works but you
craft delight you get adoption and its
delight and dependability that bring
adoption it's not the number of apps you
have on your store delight and
dependability right now today is what
gets adoption this is what we're trying
to improve more this is what we're
wrestling on or this is what we're
working through and this is why I'm here
to help us with that but bill makes a
really interesting point the future
though once everybody is expecting the
experiences to be delightful and so of
course expecting them to work the next
wave of the light will be is it
interconnected is it connected because
that's the delightful experience i'm
expecting now i'm expecting to be on my
windows phone and get in the car and it
seamlessly carry the phone call over so
my phone becomes the car and I get home
and it seamlessly comes up and I walk
into my house and it seamlessly
transitions that all of my apps and all
of my data and all of my experiences are
shared and collaborative and they
communicate that will be the delightful
experience that will be driving the next
ten years so if we can go through the
hurdle of delight really investing in
creativity not just trying to pour it
over design or not just thinking of
design as the nouns but we really get to
the verb of design and we get to that
area of creativity we are all set
for the future and here's why our
competitors most of the world this is
how they think about what they're doing
you might have come in here with a nap
in mind that you wanted to build and you
might be thinking about it like this I'm
building an app but we're already in
2013 microsoft windows 8.0 moving into
8.1 already past this brought in out
your minds we're in an area right now
that it's not just your app as a finite
noun it's your app as a verb as an
experience it's your app that gets to
leverage shared identity that we're
doing it's your app that gets to
leverage and assume a cloud across their
devices and services that we're doing
it's your app that gets to seamlessly
plug into the being api's and get
software driven intelligences bringing
that soft AI into your app when you
start thinking of your app are you
realizing that this is the family that's
tightly coupled to right now these are
available to you this will help you
think what does it actually mean for you
to have a delightful app what exactly is
your delightful experience most
importantly moving forward this is what
one windows means to me as you deploy
your app that seamlessly has identity
that seamlessly can leverage SkyDrive in
the cloud that seamlessly brings in
additional areas of of intelligence how
it interacts in the domain of search
right not just browsing but also seeking
and sorting decision-making activities
for your user in pattern matching
productivity of course how leverages
through and plays with office and the
office suite how can be used for
personal expression communication
personal as well as social at enterprise
right mobility and what exactly does
mobility mean not just hand scale
mobility but arm scale tablet mobility
finger scale wearable and ubiquitous
mobility body scale mobility as you move
into a car the true nature of mobility
media and entertainment right passive
active and social gaming of course
serious casual and social this is the
Microsoft world this is the Microsoft
ecosystem and everybody's trying to rush
here Apple's trying to rush here and
Google's trying to rush your and we're
trying to rush your and we're the ones
best suited to deliver this our
competitors aren't even close
and so many people right now are
focusing on the ball of delight the
reason I joined Microsoft is because we
are such good Lego builders we've been
seen this coming and we've been building
the infrastructure for this but we can't
skip over delight but if we can solve
that if we can get sustainable design
here by investing in creativity and we
are able to grow delightfulness from the
inside out we are all set to take over
the future it's why I'm here I believe
in our stock I believe in our design
language and if we can get this this is
what I think one Microsoft looks like to
me thank you very much some people might
want to break out what I'm going to do
right now is I'm going to fire up visual
studio and I'll walk you through a
really quick example of using cinder but
if some people did want to break out if
you want to stay in I was vacillating
between doing it in JavaScript with
processing or doing it in cinder but the
description said cinder so we'll fire
that one up if you're curious on that
happy to show it to you otherwise feel
free to to go into your breakout
sessions or grab more pizza right so
let's see if we can get this working
we're going to do one of those things
you're never supposed to do is live code
I do have a cheat sheet so let me pull
that out probably should have tested the
code before I uh brought it up so the
one thing if you if you want to get
started on your own when you leave here
just go and do it being searched for
cinder Windows Store you can also if you
do sindo cinders Windows Store it pops
up getting started with cinder for
Windows Store you open this up take us
to our channel 9 m sdn code well that's
going on just let you know if you do a
search for processing j/s Windows Store
it also brings in both the code plus the
codeplex project and my series of
tutorials and getting started on
creative coding with processing.js for
windows 8 javascript also on channel 9
but for cinder we created with the
community leaders a very detailed
walkthrough of how to go through
download it off of github setting it up
what exactly it means and this tutorial
was written as much for you guys getting
introduced to cinder but more
importantly for us having a detailed
walkthrough for the cinder people
working in other areas to realize hey
you can start bringing your awesome on
to our store we've we've gotten rid of
the roadblocks for you and that's where
we get to have really really coolness so
coming to hear again sender for Windows
Store or do processing for Windows Store
but once you do get it you'll bring in
cinder you'll switch to the DX branch
because of course it needs to use a
directx renderer you'll have a
collection of tools here and one of them
is called tinderbox windows I know this
isn't the way we normally do things but
this is the way cinder does it because
sender has so many different users
across so many platforms they have a
cool tool called tinder box that does
all the C++ linking for you again
although their coding in C++ most of
these people do not consider themselves
C++ programmers they consider themselves
creative coders so they have these tools
things such as going deep into linking
the things that took me like weeks to
understand before I could even compile
my first C++ code this is all about
intelligent defaults write getting those
intelligent defaults reducing those
barriers so people can start playing and
having fun first and once they're
playing and having fun and invested then
they'll learn what exactly they need to
do is they start tweaking it so when you
fire up tinderbox i'll just create an
application here it's going to be a
visual studio 2012 by default i'm going
to select winrt and hope this works ok
it creates a project for me with all of
the lincolns in here i'm going to go
into my visual c plus plus 2012 winrt
project open it up since i'm running 8.1
this works on eight-point oh by the way
but i'm just running 8.1 right now it's
going to retarget it no problem there
and this is what cinder looks like when
you first fire it up if you're coming
from processing or even XNA or any of
the creative code
the languages it should look familiar
there's one important file here called
cinder project app and if I open it up
this is what I get now a lot of old
school C++ people which I'm not I know a
lot of you been like writing c++ for 10
years I've been writing it for 10 months
so please don't hold that against me but
this will open up and it kind of sets up
I have my class definition up here so I
don't even have to worry or conceptually
understand this dot H versus c++ not to
get started just the very first one
that's just put it all up on here cinder
as an abstraction library has already
given me the handlers for calling a
setup mouse down update and draw so just
like processing just like all the other
languages openframeworks just like XNA
this is how I think about sketching with
code I'm gonna have a setup function
I'll have an update function and I'll
have a draw function it's even gone
ahead and clearing it out to black let
me switch this really quick to read to
make sure that everything's worked
please hope this works otherwise the
talks done and in C++ fashion especially
because i'm under debugging it's going
to take a bit of time there we go if you
have a red screen in Windows Store good
so at least we know tinder blocks isn't
broken on Windows 8.1 okay i'm coding
and testing real-time lives so please
bear with me so how did we start
thinking about code let's kind of walk
through some basics we already saw the
ability of changing a background color
talking to our Direct X context so all
the heavy lifting of getting our
contacts talking to GPU that's all done
behind the scenes that's what in the
abstraction library should do let me
come up here let me start doing
something interesting so i'll do a veck
2f and i'm going to call this mouse
just leave this first right now under
set up I'm going to instantiate my mouse
equal to a vector the two-dimensional
vector of type float going to zero it
out it's just good clean code under
mouse down I'm going to have my mouse
equal my events cut position which
returns a type vector to and during draw
first thing I'll do is assign a color
let me change this back to black for
right now so I can draw a nice red
circle RGB so once I set my color for
what my graphics card is going to draw
I'll then say there you go draw solid
color circle it's going to ask for a
position so of course i'll say mouse and
the radius will just give it 10 for
right now if i run this again we're
starting ugly and then we'll slowly be
weaning through delight hopefully I
should get black as I move my mouse I
should have a red circle following it
it's pretty much the hello world of hope
because i have mouse down sorry okay so
mouse down and it's on touch as well
okay let's start making this a little
bit more interesting though
if I wanted to add this to mouse move
all right and of course I got to come up
here to my class and to find that down
here let me do Veck 2f and do position
as I move my mouse that red dots going
to follow it a lot of people are pretty
much happy with that I've always thought
that's kind of ugly right but this is
one of the first things eaten so Art
Institute teaching flash or Silverlight
right or creative coding or processing
this is just creative coding 101 one of
the most basic ways to get set set up
one of the first things you learn is how
to procedurally add some easing because
easing works a lot better on the eyes so
while we're going to be drawing the
circle in red let me come over here and
in green change color draw a solid color
color circle to wherever my position is
also 10 and if I do this right now if I
move my mouse the red mouse is going to
follow position though kits instantiated
at 0 but isn't getting updated yet let's
see if i run this we're going to have a
fixed green and a red that follows my
cursor the rest of the magic is all
going to happen here in the update loop
so Cindy runs
cab green
just must be here and set there we go
thanks
I actually was setting posed the pause
2d vector in my mouse movie that's not
what we want so if i run this we will
get a green stationary red moving
wherever my mouse is at the speed of my
mouse and a lot of times we like to
think oh that's what people want they
want to be really really snappy but
that's not really an experienced people
are used to in the real world so my
green stationary my red is moving as my
mouse moves let's add a little easing to
this there is a function that happens
here really quick let me double check
okay these two lines of code if this is
your first foray into creative coding
this algorithm is your hammer you use
this algorithm everywhere so easing
algorithm it's basically the visual
equivalent of Zeno's paradox right it's
oies where you want to be minus where
you are times a fraction added to where
you are if you think about that Zeno's
paradox you know the account walk out
the door because they'll be fifty
percent and fifty percent fifty percent
but by doing it as a percentage instead
of a fixed set it gradually makes your
steps gets below gets smaller and
smaller this is the same thing so while
my mouse is going to be moving
immediately where my mouse is I'm
figuring out the Delta basically where
do I want to be at the mouse minus where
I am gives me how far away I am but then
you need two times at times a percentage
and that'll say okay twenty percent of
the distance so my first iteration I'm
going to do a big jump but since I've
gotten closer my next iteration will be
a little bit smaller and a little bit
smaller and as I get really close it'll
slow down and this one algorithm and you
can use this algorithm for anything
whoops sorry about that hope nobody saw
that this is visually what it looks like
but you'll be amazed once you realize
that this algorithm exists and it's out
in the wild and how people do things you
see it everywhere because it's what's
pleasant to our eyes as i move my red my
green arrow slowly and casually starts
following it because Nature has taught
us that these moves are organic we start
with gross motor movements and then we
find control down to eventually pick up
the thing we want to do so as we code
into this now it doesn't have to be
movement we do this with sound we do it
with color we do it with transparency
but this is like the killer algorithm
for creative coding 101 remember this
one we're going to get much more deeper
than this but let's go a little bit more
now that's fine if you want to move
circles if you want to be finite but
let's start moving it up a little bit
better you guys want more since this is
c plus plus I
I was going to create a class a cpp and
a header file for those of you coming
from C++ but for those of you who aren't
don't worry about it you can create a
struct for some basic stuff or what
we're doing it's totally fine it's like
a mini object so I'm going to create a
struct called a dot it'll have a
position it'll have velocity and it will
have life because I don't want to just
have the things moving with my mouse as
I move my mouse I want it to be dropping
out these particles and we're kind of
doing this we're experimenting right
that's what grade of coatings about
we're experimenting making mistakes and
that's fine i'm also going to need to
start including some files because it's
c++ then i'm going to be using i'm going
to do include cinders random function
include cinders vector and include c++
as a vector i'm going to want to start
dropping particles as i move my mouse
and so i'm going to have a vector that
holds my dots i'll call that m dots
so let's do this for mouse down that's
not good Oh see here on mouse down
I don't want to do it as I'm dragging my
mouse and again we're be an experimental
here a lot of C++ people god that's very
that's not a very optimum way of doing
it it's okay we don't want to optimize
too early we're just experimenting so
I'm going to do something when i click
on the mouse i want to start creating
some particles so let me do for you i
equals 0 ally is less than will do 10
for right now i plus plus so i'm going
to create a dot i'm going to give it
life i'm going to have its position be
wherever my mouse currently is and its
velocity I want them all to have their
own personality so i'll create two
dimensional vector i'm going to call on
my ram function and create a random
float and i want it to have the range
from negative 6 point 0 to positive 6
point 0 for the x and then the same
thing for the why most importantly
I'm going to throw it into my array
oh thanks a lot I'm so glad you guys are
here good make sense so far so a little
by little rebuilding it up mousedown
going to create these trucks throw them
into their we're not going to be looking
at destroyers or anything like that
because really the type of overhead
we're looking out right now we're just
trying to make it cool and then later on
we can optimize it later that's fine so
I'm creating these objects as data
straight off a struct now under update
we were already doing this stuff but now
let's start doing this for the dots
since it's c plus plus I get to do my
cool C++ tricks so I get to iterate
through all my objects in my vector just
like that and every time it updates I'm
going to update its velocity we'll just
leave it right there for right now okay
we'll just leave it right there we're
going to add much more to this to make
it cool right now we're just making it
work and then when we're drawing we're
clearing out our stage here but you know
what that's a kind of tired of the black
so let's do a nice heather gray or so
okay we want to draw the mouse and we're
going to draw the mouse and we're going
to start using some alpha transparencies
and we'll do some additive blend it
starts making things a bit prettier so
we're going to create a nice purple half
transparency let's draw the follow
and for and for him we will do a let's
do a white it's also going to be an
alpha though so it'll be a quasi opaque
white now I'm doing all my stuff in
drawing later on we would abstract this
out on classes they'd have their own
draw commands and don't worry about it
everything's fine also you're going to
be thinking about batching ms open tech
guys already did this for you the
batching is taken care of on the back
and it's already high very optimized
here but we're clearing out the window
to a gray we solve the mouse and follow
but now let's start visualizing our dots
for dot of type dot this guy in all of
these guys until I have all my c++ lingo
down and let's be a little conservative
if life is greater than 0 0 now we want
to draw them here's something else we're
going to tweak a little bit later right
now let's just draw them red and let's
drum white it'll look a little ugly for
right now but that's okay switch into
white
draw a solid circle wherever the
position is and we're going to give it a
diameter of seven point 0 this will
still be ugly but at least we'll see if
it works Oh probably the important thing
I didn't show you this is the glory of
abstraction libraries that's all it took
I'm in visual studio I'm targeting
windows store application but because i
have an abstraction library and all the
references are done for me in tinderbox
this one macro is what flip the bit for
me all of this code most of this code
it's just swapping out a GL namespace
for a DX namespace and it works fine in
any center project you want we go to the
agencies that are doing the kind that
are doing the Saatchi and Saatchi that
are winning the awards they understand
this code this is how they think this is
how they explore the south a prototype
now they can prototype on our platform
and here's what it is normally this says
renderer GL ms open tech and Charlotte
sedale stammen alberto for st mark
geiler and the entire team that made
this happen it's right there this is the
one magic code that does it all that
does all the gunk in the back end again
I'm not a programmer I'm a creative
coder and I'm thankful for Microsoft for
doing this so if we run this now we
should at least start having the
beginnings of something interesting we
change the background to gray so that
should be a little prettier we added
some coloring to the mouse and follow
see if that still works ok nice purple
shows where we are and eventually you
would just get rid of purple right but
this is showing the point now if I click
somewhere okay we're shooting out black
black artifact the visual artifact you
not sure what it is it might be on the
windows 8.1 but we'll check that out so
pay no attention to the artifact but ok
so we're getting here we're getting some
more clothes let's start adding some
elegance to it again reviewing the logic
we didn't even need to go through a full
class because it's just data right now
we've created a struct we have a vector
that's holding the struct every time we
do a mouse down we're creating 10
elements every time we call update we're
doing the very simple adding the
velocity to the position which is why
they keep going in a straight line
forever and then under the draw loop
besides drawing the mouse and the follow
with this line of code iterating through
all the dots we're seeing if they're
still alive and of course they're all
still alive because we haven't been
dropping their life yet in the update
loop if you're still alive color
yourself black all right there where we
want you let's start making some fun
things though first of all let's start
from the moment they're born let's start
having them slowly die so we're updating
their position what if we do dot that
life because they start at one let's
just have them slowly start fading out
now since they're starting at one of
their life and slowly going to be
getting down and right here we're
checking to make sure that they're
already above zero if we do something
like this so the black it should have
been white that's full alpha if we just
say you know what let's do the dots life
we're overloading their life which is
moving from one point 0 to 0 point 0 as
the Alpha property for them so with just
this little change as they move out
they'll slowly start fading away
so I got home I click OH or they won't
because right up here of course there's
two things actually there's the enable
alpha blending which is if you're
dealing with putting a lot of PNG's
putting a lot of graphics on the page
that have alpha in them you need to flip
this bit so that we know because the run
remember this is highly optimized for
you on the back end so if you want the
GPU to think about alpha then make sure
you tell it but we want to go one step
further instead of just awful blending
let's do some additive letting additive
is basically like in screen mode if
you're in Photoshop two colors together
they get brighter it's not just a
question of office it's a question of
brightness so if we enable additive
blending which will also automatically
give us alpha blending I hope
good so we have a nice easy algorithm
there which looks nice and we'll figure
it out it's okay failure oh there we go
alright so some of the older guys start
fading out yeah the life is the life's
too long and also probably a good thing
to note as I'm running in debug mode
doing C++ doing this type of code in
debug mode drastically drops your frames
per second if we switch this over to
release mode and we run it as to rebuild
for release mode but we'll see a speed
difference there I don't know how much
because we're not really even print not
even out of first gear with the type of
stuff we're doing here today that's okay
I'll show you some cool stuff right now
so we have life we're giving the
particles life we're taking that life
into their visual account but and we
have easing on the follow but it's still
very Newtonian it's still very fixed I
click on it the particles are just kind
of flying out we can start experimenting
and doing some cooler stuff
if we have life already we have this
velocity and they're storing a velocity
so we've taught you the Zeno's paradox
the easing algorithm here's something
else we can do their velocity let's do
two things let's add a little bit of
noise every time we update them and
it'll be a little bit to let me turn
this down a little bit
so at first was very Newtonian velocity
was fixed they're born going a certain
velocity but now every update loop their
velocity is going to iterate a little
bit it's going to pick a number between
negative 2 to positive 2 for the x and y
and add it because we're adding to it
it's going to get a little bit nuts
sometimes it'll accelerate it sometimes
it'll slow it down but to really make it
cool just cuz it take so long to compile
let me just kind of cut to the chase
we're going to add this little guy these
two guys together free algorithm lesson
number two for tonight this little trick
here adds a Brownian motion to your
effects because you're starting off
strong in a certain direction and every
update you're either going to push it a
little further or hinder it a little bit
more but no matter what your always
dampening back down that velocity as if
that object is moving through a liquid
of some sort based on how much you
dampen it down will determine the visual
effect of what how thick that liquid is
moving so i run this now
I should really talk compiled and talk I
think that might be a little better
again I had years coding in c sharpens
amal so I'm still getting used to the
compile times on this but I love it c++
Direct X love it instead I like my job
as well good things running through so
now I'm moving around I click on it I
start wandering out and fading out I
like your suggestion of the life taking
a little too long so let's come back
again experimentation exploration so
under life let's the what yeah because
it's a velocity exactly yeah so the
position is always adding its velocity
and so because of that if we're tweaking
the velocity will will be tweaking where
its position is right and that's so that
you can see the effect if I really force
it back to zero faster it'll make the
viscosity of the platform seem more
thick because it'll be more likely to go
to zero so you'll see the kind of
Brownian motion much more actively by
forcing it to get 20 a little bit faster
oh I changed this from point nine eight
so it was just slowly always turning it
down to zero and it doesn't matter
because the next thing it's going to be
pushing a little bit more the butt oh
and then life also somebody said it was
taken to long life hey that's fine this
is all about experimentation let's speed
it up so I come through i click
cool now probably one of the last things
go here's something else we can change
since we have that life going from one
point 0 to 0 and since I'm already
testing I'm not going to draw it if its
life is less than zero what if I just do
this let me turn this up a little bit up
first it's not exactly my notes but
we're experimenting so they're going to
start off at seven this is their maximum
health maximum life size and as they get
older they will both disappear and get
smaller let me come up and let me slow
them down a little bit more here I'm
going to boost this guy back up to 95 as
you sell most developers I've worked
with here at Microsoft they love me
because of my magic numbers it's like Oh
magic numbers joy right but really on
creative coding it's all about magic
numbers at first once you understand
what they are then begrudgingly I'm
saying yes put them into constants and
stuff like that but a lot of a starting
on flash it's like hey hey works right
Alex cool works on my machine so moving
it through click and you see them slowly
gets smaller fade away starts looking
kind of pretty so one thing we can do
okay I like that effect start cranking
it up to 11 now last thing we can do is
this guy right here we've been making
them white we have a nice gray we have a
nice white we have a nice purple but the
particles it's a little bit boring so
what if we start tweaking their color
based on their position on the screen so
whatever your current position so again
remember color outfits RGB will always
keep the G the green turned all the way
up that's fine but we have their x and y
position as an input for our draw
command if we
have it as an input let's start
experimenting us to start tweak and see
what happens so I'll do wherever your
position is this has to be from has to
be normalized so we need a way of
finding out what the window screen is
thankfully cinder is good at that
oops positioned that why so wherever you
are on the screen / however high the
screen is that's my normalized value of
0 to 1 that's your r-value I want you to
have I'll just do the exact same thing
for my blue value except instead of
height will do with our exposition / y
position and probably the last thing
here is 10 seemed so boring 42 is what
we really want because that's really the
life the answer right to life the
universe and everything so now if we
test this I think for this particular
sketch I kind of started free forming
and I did do this one free forming
yesterday I printed out some of the code
because yeah I'm not dumb funded at
least have tested once before but this
is just what creative coding looks like
we're trying things in were throwing
them on there we're doing it in C++
right it runs out it's a lot of running
and testing this is what sketching looks
like bill Buxton also to misquote him
again and I apologize again 30 follower
if we click it up up here very low X
very low why so it's very green but as
they start moving down the screen very
high red and green but no bluemix yellow
click on over here the red gets turned
down but the green and blue is turned up
and of course as we come down here
everything's full throttle all the way
up to 1 so of course we get white so
something like this is kind of cool
right and from here you just go on and
experiment and do whatever you want but
let me go back to kind of show that
and I really wanted to emphasize this
hold on there we go I really wanted to
say under 100 lines of code under a
hundred lines of code in C++ we're
coding against the GPU with pre-built
graphics and colors with one line
commands loading a texture and I won't
show this today let me show you let me
show you a couple other note not code
now but let's just kind of see some of
the things so that was our example if
you download getting started with cinder
on Windows Store I wrote the DirectX
samples these are some of the samples
that I wrote out to the community so
they can start seeing what's possible
DirectX on Windows Store here's Hodgins
particles which is a common demo on iOS
so it's kind of what we were doing but
you can see this texture and it's now
drawing PNG's that are glowing and we're
getting that effect that's the main
thing it's still awful the PNG more
importantly though so let me keep going
to the quad counts that we're having
obviously this is slightly more
optimized code but not that much more
see our quad counts up there are frame
rates and I 60 frames a second let's
start loading it up though but if we add
gravity okay well now they start falling
that's cool if they're falling let's
maybe out of floor oh that's cool it's
kind of visualize that a little bit
let's add some tales to it okay nice
it's still very Newtonian that's add a
little bit we were doing like cheap
pearl in because we were exactly more
Brownian motion but there's an entire
pearl in function already baked into
cinder so I add pearl in to the velocity
and now we get now we start getting the
types of examples and as you can see
additive blending is turned on so as
they overlap they get white and bright
alright these types of things and of
course touching in point it's all point
integrated in your single point right
now but we have other examples from
multi-point that's pretty cool this is a
type of stuff people have fun with we go
to students we go to academy we go to
MIT we go to Parsons we give them a
surface tablet we say that cinder that
you're using on here it's already
pre-loaded right he
we have windows 8 here yet Visual Studio
2013 here you have the temp off of
tinder box you can start playing on our
tablet and by the way do you know that
we support multitouch all right by the
way we start bringing in a couple more
brainiacs if you since we are using
directx do you know that directx 11.1
allows stereoscopic output blew your
mind what ipad doesn't have it what we
have it out of the box on Windows 8
nobody touches of it because DX is hard
it's hard to learn C++ in the X we don't
have any abstraction libraries this is
an obstruction library for c++ the X
right they can start getting it they can
start playing with it they can start
getting excited about our platform most
importantly we're bringing fun back to
our platform here's another example this
was like again under a hundred lines of
code grabbing an image iterating through
their RGB values creating a point cloud
of the color value and then offsetting
that mesh in z space based on the
brightness of the screen right again
simple dumb examples c++ directx i
personally like this one quite a bit
right this is the stuff people play with
this is what artists want to play with
we have this now on our platform a
cinder but there's a little bit more
right we're trying to get openframeworks
that's the big one trying to get full
processing support over on our own but
that's what it looks like again thank
you I went a little bit more over time I
just really wanted to show you that code
it's on their search cinder for Windows
Store you can get started I'm Rick bar
at Microsoft or a trick brazo happy to
help you guys out let's just let's just
get this let's just get this mood out
right I we're in such a good position we
can bring fun again make coding fun for
Windows Store if we do that we'll get
creatives if we get creatives will get
good design and if you get design
everything will be delightful alright so
again second thank you for the evening I
appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
