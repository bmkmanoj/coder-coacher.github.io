hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
thanks everyone for coming out I'm Dan
Liebling I'll be interesting Dave's
elbow who's here as part of the
Microsoft Research visiting speaker
series I know Dave through the Cal Tech
alumni network I was fortunate or
perhaps unfortunate enough to sit
through a screening of sharknado with
him as a narrator I heard that headon
tried to write a book about the science
of sharknado but he was gonna get paid
by the page so it was gonna be $0 that's
my attempt at comedy but Dave is a
part-time comedian part-time author he
is also an was a software engineer he
worked on things like dBase back in the
day he told me he also while writing his
book wrote some shell scripts to
actually make the output into a Word
document so he still has some technical
talent at least finally he also does
things around those scientists area like
trash for teaching where he picks up old
discarded hardware and puts these
together in programs that help kids
learn to use hardware and software so
really fascinating person so today he's
here to talk about his his book the
science of the Big Bang Theory so
welcome Dave thanks Dan thanks all of
you I will start by making sure you
understand not only Who I am but who I'm
not see if I can make this work oops
we're sleeping
I am NOT Bill Nye the Science Guy I'm
not Steve Carell I know you won't
believe me but a cop in LA really tried
to convince me I was this gentleman and
what I usually get is this Sam Waterston
the guy from Law &amp;amp; Order I'm not him
sorry I'm a science humorist which is
basically a scientists science writer
science it's got the word science in it
somewhere
it's really a science writer who's
trying to be funny any of you have
perhaps seen or read a book called
longitude about the race to build the
first reliable chronometer for ships
that was written by someone who isn't me
either
her name is Davis Oh Bell which sounds a
lot like my name but it's not exactly
the same name and it's not exactly the
same person and I've spoken with her and
it's my opinion that she is in far more
terror of being mistaken for me than I
am of being mistaken for her also I'm
not a writer for the Big Bang Theory
these are some of the writers for the
Big Bang Theory and as it happens they
are seated more or less chronologically
according to how long they've been
working on the show so the two gentlemen
on the left with the most fear in their
eyes have been there the longest and the
happy people on the right had only been
working there a few years when this
photo was taken they have a large number
of writers and none of them are
scientists and they're not even science
writers but they do write about science
topics probably some of you are familiar
with the show so you know what I'm
talking about for the rest of you I will
quickly introduce some of the characters
well uh Oh welcome to the building
oh thank you maybe we can have coffee
sometime oh great great
right no we're gonna start season two of
Battlestar Galactica there you go see
you were thinking nothing is gonna
happen on this show and it's already
into its eighth season but they were
gonna go watch Battlestar Galactica so
yay your three main characters here are
from left to right Sheldon Penny and
Leonard originally the show I think was
going to be called Lenny penny and Kenny
they changed it which is nice so we can
maybe try to tell these people apart
Sheldon the gentleman on the left is a
theoretical physicist penny in the
center is an aspiring actor and
sometimes waitress and sometimes sales
rep and Leonard on the right is an
experimental physicist who is a
specialist with lasers if you would like
to try to keep Sheldon and Leonard apart
in your head which I recommend you can
use a mnemonic like Leonard has the
lenses and Sheldon has the sharper
features or Leonard is not lanky and
Sheldon is not short or Leonard is a
laser head and Sheldon is a theoretical
physicist I should actually I shouldn't
be unkind to Sheldon he is not any
weirder than any of his friends and here
are two of his closest ones so you guys
work with Leonard and Sheldon at the
University
I'm sorry do you speak English he speaks
English he just can't speak to women
really why he's kind of a nerd juice box
so that was Raj and Howard it's not all
about just making fun of nerds on this
show there is really quite a lot of
science things don't go out with Leonard
I wasn't losing a really good friend I
mean I'm guessing he's not looking for a
fling he's the kind of guy that gets
into a relationship for I don't know
like you would say light-years I would
not say that no one would say that a
Lightyear is a unit of distance not time
people hear the word year and they think
duration if foot-pound has the same
problem that's a unit of work not of
weight right thanks mm it's common
mistake not the first one I've made
today so you're wondering do you learn
science from this show do you learn to
make fun of scientists are you gonna be
tested at the end of the show and what a
foot pound is it's I actually am very
much in awe of this show because they
have somehow managed to take many of the
people I grew up with and make them
lovable instead of just irritating which
is what we all which is what they all
were back then
and so when Sheldon is talking about
science everything is saying is correct
it's CBS it's not PBS we're not expect
the show is not expecting us to come
away from it with a good knowledge of
science but somehow you do sometimes
pick up a little bit you're wondering
what's going on with Sheldon and why he
felt the need to be so precise when
penny was just asking a more general
question and the answer is that Sheldon
has a condition some people have noticed
similarities between that and the autism
spectrum
but the creators of the show assure us
it's just Sheldon being Sheldon II now
that you and I are friends again I am at
your disposal and frankly lending my
name and reputation to it will help
because a lot of people think that
you're a washed-up has-been or dead
I should be so lucky so what do you say
you know if it's all the same with you I
think I'll I'll stick with Leonard yeah
it's because I'm annoying right I know
it is - say it say it say I'm annoying
no say it say it say it I'm annoying say
it you're annoying
Wow that really hurt and what was your
question
Sheldon has his mother had him tested
that's correct that is a that's a
recurring gag these folks don't just
live in a vacuum they actually live in a
real place their address comes up often
on the show here's an example yes hello
this is dr. Sheldon Cooper
yeah I'm at 2311 North Los Robles Avenue
I'd like to report a dangerous wild
animal WJ when Sheldon says Los Robles
the inhabitants of Pasadena California
tend to say Los Robles but it is really
Pasadena California and here is Los
Robles or Los Robles that's the South
section this is the North section he
lives at 2311 why do I care so much
about this because the creators of the
show seem to care so much about it they
care so much about it they gave him an
address that doesn't exist I went all
the way up North Los Robles and I got to
2061 and then I was in Alhambra not a
hembra Altadena and that was the end of
the the numbering on Los Robles but this
is some kind of a it's sort of an
apartment building mixed with a strip
mall called hen's teeth square and I
don't know I like the name and I don't
know why they did that there is one
episode in which they have actually a
real address in Pasadena California also
sent Amy a relationship termination
notice and changed my cell phone number
and email address
she just comes over she'll get lost we
no longer live at 2311 Los Robles we now
live at 311 less robliz so of course
like a good fan I went to 311 Los Robles
and it is this imposing edifice
something straight out of men in black
so I stepped back a little bit to take a
more realistic shot of it that's a
little utility box over there even
Leonard couldn't fit into it you're
wondering why I'm talking about their
address when this talk is supposed to be
about science we will get to it the view
out their window is actually some
buildings in the real Pasadena
California on the left is the iconic
dome of City Hall and on the right is a
building that is actually about a mile
away from City Hall but thanks to the
miracle of telephoto lenses it appears
to be right next to it
okay let's get into the science it's
like some serious stuff what did you do
this actually that's my work Wow yeah
well there's just some quantum mechanics
with a little string theory doodling
around the edges that part there that's
just a joke it's a spoof of the
born-oppenheimer approximation this is
my holy smokes these guys don't just do
this for fun they actually have jobs
doing this they work at a place that is
in Pasadena California where a lot of
smart people work
he mentioned Caltech that is a real
place it is not Caltech the San Antonio
programming house it does not
Caltech the Quebec calibration company
it is not Caltech the auto body repair
shop in Milpitas and I probably don't
have to tell you that it is not Caltech
the construction company in East Timor
it is actually the California Institute
of Technology you know not the Southern
California Institute of Technology which
is this building in Anaheim the real
California Institute of Technology you
may have seen it
movies are TV you may have seen it in
the opening credits of Legally Blonde or
you may have seen it pretty recently on
Modern Family
where they even called it Caltech or on
Mission Impossible some some decades ago
it was even used very often as a filming
location for the show numbers which was
a procedural drama about an FBI agent
and his brother the mathematician who
was much smarter than him and did all of
his work for him basically and I found
out from personal experience that if you
hang around on a street corner long
enough you too can appear in numbers as
splotchy blotch of pixels number two do
you see it now the show The Big Bang
Theory has been on for eight seasons and
only once have they ever actually filmed
at Caltech which was this scene where
Sheldon presents his work to the
legendary Stephen Hawking playing
himself it's not entirely clear what
Sheldon does all the time if he really
were working at Caltech he would be a
professor he can't just hide himself
away in an office and be brilliant but
he we know he's not a graduate student
although he does sort of grad student
type hard labor from time to time
Leonard and Sheldon are lifting a box up
their staircase in their building and
you can sort of see on the right-hand
side the stairs come up from below on
the left-hand side they go up above and
they turn around behind and continue on
up the elevator has been out of order
since the pilot there are no plans for
it to be in order they live on the
fourth floor so there's quite a lot of
walking up and down the stairs
the stairs are at a 30-degree angle
which is very nice because it gives them
the opportunities to talk about signs of
angles and their apartment in this case
is just off the screen to the right
Penny's apartment is just off the screen
to the left down at the bottom weird
things are going on because here we are
in the lobby the stairs are coming down
the stairs do not go down into the
basement on the right but there is way
over I'll see if my little laser pointer
works way over here at this building
this is stairway and apparently by going
through that door you can suddenly drop
eight feet and beyond the stairs that go
down to the basement although
interestingly the
before this one that same door said
maintenance and there was a maintenance
bucket outside so okay I'm a little
fixated on this apartment building but
I'll tell you why it doesn't have
anything to do with science but it's you
know they give the address and it's
right there in Pasadena and and people
weirder than me have actually gone
around the streets of Pasadena trying to
find this place and there's quite a
healthy online
I shouldn't say healthy but they're
active online community talking about I
know those guys or I know that apartment
building or I totally used to live there
and so I thought it would be helpful if
we could actually figure out where it
was now there's one episode where we
actually see a bird's-eye view of the
apartment building spoiler they get
married
okay if you missed it we will zoom back
in I don't know how good your Southern
California geography is but here we go
oh and incidentally did you
you may notice oh you probably already
knew that if you play Vivaldi's spring
backwards it sounds like the beginning
of trumpet voluntary which is another
popular wedding song I just throw that
out there for you well the first six
notes six notes anyway
alright here we are unfortunately this
is not Los Robles Los Robles or Los
Robles this is actually Madison Avenue
and Los Robles is over here but I'm not
I'm not discouraged I think we still
might be able to find it here's Leonard
talking to his mom I think you'll find
my work pretty interesting I'm
attempting to replicate the Dark Matter
signal thurman sodium iodide crystals by
the Italians so no original research no
what's the point of my singing and I
could just read the paper the Italians
wrote
hey that was real science replicating
the dark matter signal found in sodium
iodide crystals by the Italians and I
told you before that the science that
the writers of the show did not have
science degrees okay here's what that
script page actually looks like I think
you'll find this pretty interesting I'm
attempting to replicate the brackets
science to come close brackets this
happens in every script and the reason
is because we don't really know what the
science is going to be until a
professional comes in and tells us
fortunately the Big Bang Theory has a
professional I got one camera
girlfriend Bernadette my girlfriend I'll
wind it back so you can catch him
because it's a blink and miss it
the gentleman with the critical look on
the right there is David Salzburg he is
actually a particle astrophysicist at
UCLA and his job is to look at every
script and fill in something for science
to come and also correct things that
look like they are not actually good
science which has happened occasionally
he's a very busy man because of him
there is a book about the science of the
Big Bang Theory if he weren't there and
the Big Bang Theory were nothing but
Delicia miss ttles and holodecks and
infinite improbability drives and sonic
screwdrivers there wouldn't really be
anything to write about the longest word
in Shakespeare you think I'm changing
gears is honorific ability Dan a Tata
bus and David salts Berg's personal
honorific ability Dan the Tata bus and I
just won $5 for using that twice in the
same sentence comes in this episode why
don't you just get a license at 16 like
everybody else I was otherwise engaged
doing what examining perturbative
amplitudes in in equals 4 supersymmetric
theories leading to a re-examination of
the ultraviolet properties of multi loop
n equals 8 super gravity using modern
twist or theory how about when you were
17 okay so that whole paragraph there
was originally of course science to come
in brackets and David Saltzburg took a
lot of grief from people because they
said you were just going through your
thesaurus throwing in all this science
words but that actually was the title of
a paper that a friend of his was working
on at the time so he tossed that in
there Saltzburg himself did some
research and included it on those white
boards that you have seen sort of
hovering in the background and in one
case he worked on a problem for several
months and then realized to his horror
that he was off by a factor of 10 to the
25th oops but you know no sense in
wasting the work so he put that on a
white board as well and you have to be
quick to notice the little frowny face
oops
I'm sorry
have you seen Howard I think he's eating
lunch Sheldon I wanted to meet Neil
deGrasse Tyson from the Hayden
Planetarium in New York I'm quite
familiar with dr. Tyson he's responsible
for the demotion of Pluto from planetary
status
I liked Pluto
ergo I do not like you but I actually
didn't demote Pluto that was a vote of
the International Astronomical Union if
ifs and buts were candy and nuts we'd
all have a Merry Christmas think about
that dr. Tyson the guy you were telling
me about no yeah so that's Neil deGrasse
Tyson really playing himself there have
been several luminaries from the science
world who have appeared on the show
there have also been people playing
playing people from other than the
science world and Leonard who as I
mentioned is an experimental physicist
will now give us a demonstration of how
not to talk to an FBI agent you work
with mr. Wolowitz here at the University
correct yes of course were in different
departments he's an engineer and I'm an
experimental physicist you know one of
those guys who examines the building
blocks of creation and says hello maker
of the universe I see what you did there
good one right all right and the reason
that I bring that up is because
experimental physics in many ways is
easier to grasp if you are not an
experimental physicist than theoretical
physics is if you are not a theoretical
physicist so to the extent that this
show can actually appeal to people who
are not physicists of any kind
Leonard probably has a better shot at it
than Sheldon does here's Leonard doing a
classic experiment first done by Galileo
under slightly different circumstances
thirty feet okay that's pretty cool he
did that in his head even though he
obviously had other things on his mind
he dropped the bottle in 2.1 seconds
later he heard it go smash yes I timed
it and he did all that in his head an
account with 30 feet great that's you
can use that to start teaching a kid
about you know D equals one-half a T
squared the only problem is that after
2.1 seconds any object starting at rest
will fall 70 feet not 30 feet you did
that in your head didn't you uh-huh so
actually I'm really I mean I don't want
to pick on the sound effects guy but
Leonard actually kind of didn't get it
right or or he lives in an apartment
building stay with me where things fall
slower in elevator shafts than they do
elsewhere
so yeah this apartment building I'm
really fixated on it check out what
happens when you throw stuff out the
window I need to use your window go
ahead
it hit the ground after falling four
feet I mean thank you okay even if there
weren't any air resistance on that
whiteboard I mean the best it could do
in that short amount of time between
when he threw it and when we heard the
smash and the hunk is it could fall to
about the middle of the third floor if
he's living on the fourth floor so I
guess what that means is we're looking
for an apartment building where the
traffic runs at the third floor level
but I'm convinced that we can find this
apartment building here's what it looks
like from the outside a little bit hard
to see here but here's the here are the
main doors on the left is a storefront
and on the right is another storefront
so this is a very narrow apartment
building on the ground floor we have 16
mailboxes presumably if we have two
apartments per floor that means it's an
eight story building which actually is a
violation of zoning ordinances in
Pasadena but maybe they got some kind of
a special dispensation I don't know it
does have kind of a weird front door
because the security system is not
really what you would expect it the door
swings both ways
not really sure if there's any point in
locking it if you can just push it penny
coming through the other door actually
demonstrates one of the weirdest
features which is that she will come
through this door go up the stairs and
then go into her apartment by going
directly in the opposite direction of
the way she's going now which means that
all the apartments on her side of the
building hang out over the street
I guess that's possible I don't know
when you look through you can't really
tell what's happening here but Sheldon
is standing in his kitchen and we're
looking through his kitchen window and
we see a brick building behind him that
brick if you actually do make a
blueprint of the yes I did
of the apartment you see that that's
actually the back of Leonard's closet so
this apartment has a little outside
space somehow built into it okay at this
point I didn't know what to do so I
wrote to City Hall and I actually heard
back from the mayor himself Bill bogaard
the mayor of Pasadena explained to me
what I had been missing and I will quote
him he said Pasadena is home to some of
the most brilliant people in the world
and then he listed several of them in
several the institutions including JPL
and Idealab the Planetary Society and
also he mentioned some of the architects
who have left their imprint such as
green and green and Myron Hunt then he
said with this much scientific and
architectural talent in the most
economically and ethnically diverse city
in the state it is not surprising to me
to find an apartment building that's
bigger on the inside so the mayor
obviously a Doctor Who fan and that's
all we just need to be looking for a
TARDIS changing subjects for a moment
Roger sent me some video of Buzz Aldrin
it's a Milky Way the Milky Way's a
galaxy in space
- his face
is a Mars bar I'm an astronaut I've done
the moon what you got okay it's always
sad when your heroes turn out to be
jerks but that really was Buzz Aldrin
playing himself as a jerk which was
which was very sweet of him this is Buzz
Aldrin actually doing his job back
during the Apollo 11 mission he's walked
on the moon and he placed this object
here which in higher resolution looks
like that that's a retroreflector
array each of those little cells is
actually three mirrors at 90 degree
angles to each other and has the
property that any light going into it
comes back out in the exact opposite
direction
this is useful if you want to say bounce
a light off of the moon from the earth
and time its flight and then divide by
two and figure out how far away the moon
is because the moon is not a single
distance away it's always changing and
they do that very experiment in one
episode of The Big Bang Theory an
experiment that they don't do is this
where Leonard is upset with Sheldon who
is in the back of his car I happen to
notice that this crane thing here and
these stairs and this stuff here that
you see out Leonard's window you also
see in his rear view mirror in exactly
the same formation not even reversed so
that's not a retroreflector I think
that's probably a rushed post-production
supervisor but I just call that to your
attention in case you were wondering
about it there's a lot about science
that is hard to understand and a lot
that is hard to explain even if you do
understand it and one of the things that
comes up a lot on the Big Bang Theory is
this one all right what response on my
part would bring this conversation to a
speedy conclusion tell me whether or not
to go through with the date
Schrodinger's cat wow that's brilliant
you sound surprised I think most people
have a conception of Schrodinger's cat
is something about you put a cat in a
box and you threaten its life and you go
away and then until you open the box you
don't know whether the cat died or not
which is a bit of a simplification
because you kind of learned that at your
first birthday right until you open the
box you don't know what's in it
so it's actually it's more subtle than
that I I will not do justice to it but
I'll just say that if you could somehow
isolate the contents of the box from
everything in the universe then you
can't really say what's in the box it's
not a question of is the cat alive or
dead I just don't know it's there's no
thing in there to talk about it's kind
of like what cat it's kind of like and
that's I'm not taking a cheap shot there
it really like what is in the box not
only don't we know but it has no meaning
you could say there's a live cat you
could say there's dead cat you could say
there's a cat wearing a gas mask that it
would for itself out of hair balls you
could say there's two cats discussing
politics with an iguana in Esperanto I
mean you don't know it it's not a thing
that you could know if only you knew
it's there isn't any way to know it I
didn't do a very good job of that
perhaps Sheldon can do it better than
you grab me water
possibly not that simple Leonard never
is it at this moment our relationship
exists in two mutually contradictory
states until you either do not go or go
to wil Wheaton's party you are
simultaneously my friend and not my
friend
I'm characterizing this phenomenon as
Schrodinger's friendship got it and add
my water no of course I get it you're
savvy traitor
okay what is going on in case you have
forgotten Schrodinger's cat as a thought
experiment I didn't forget um there's
this cat in a box and until you open it
it's either dead or alive or both
although back in Nebraska our cat got
stuck on my brother's camp trunk and we
did not need to open it - no there was
all kinds of dead cat America
okay so I don't want to gross everybody
out by continuing this discussion of
cats warm and cold but believe it or not
it is possible to take something as cold
and difficult to wrap your head around
as Schrodinger's cat and turn it into a
pretty beautiful statement on personal
relationships and so if you will indulge
me we will let Sheldon take one more
crack at it in a way that although it
still doesn't get any closer to the
science does perhaps get closer to the
heart that is anything to do with you
know what I'm talking about well let's
see we might consider Schrodinger's cat
Schrodinger is that the woman into a I
know that's mrs. Grossinger
and she doesn't have a cat she has a
Mexican hairless annoying little animal
sorry you diverted me anyway in 1935
Erwin Schrodinger in an attempt to
explain the Copenhagen interpretation of
quantum physics he proposed an
experiment where a cat is placed in a
box with a sealed vial of poison that
will break open at a random time now
since no one knows when or if the poison
has been released until the box is
opened the cat can be thought of is both
alive and dead
I'm sorry I don't get the point of
course you don't get it I haven't made
it yet we have to be psychic to get it
and there's no such thing as psychic
just like Schrodinger's cat your
potential relationship with Leonard
right now can be thought of as both good
and bad it is only by opening the box
that you'll find out which it is okay so
you're saying I should go out with
Leonard no no let me start again in 1930
this could go on forever so well we will
move along this is kind of a big thing
the keynote address is being delivered
by George Smoot oh my god the George
Smoot you've heard him of course they
have George Smoot is a Nobel Prize
winning physicist one of the great minds
of our time his work in black body form
and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave
background radiation cemented our
understanding of the origin of the
universe it's kind of a funny name
though Smoot
I'm talking to a chimp and just in case
you were wondering they didn't just use
Smoots name they use what you thinking
you won the Nobel Prize what three years
ago so you must deal with a whole lot of
what has Smoot done lately my thought is
we continue my research as a team you
know Cooper Smoot alphabetical when we
win the Nobel Prize you'll be back on
top with all due respect dr. Cooper are
you one crack fine Smoot Cooper what
deeper the history of that is that
George Smoot is a fan of the show called
them up and said can you work me in sure
you can and they said okay can we make
fun of your name and I think he was used
to that so he said sure it's a little
bit funny that penny is the character
making fun of Smoots name because
diehard fans of the show may know this
penny is the only character whose name
has never been revealed it's penny
something we don't know her last name it
may never be revealed here's another
famous person who called up the show and
said you can make room for me can't you
it just so happens I'm also spending the
day with a beloved children's television
science personality isn't that right new
friend and colleague Bill Nye the
Science Guy
sorry I replaced you with a newer model
Wow Arthur Jeffries it's an honor to
meet you my show never would have
happened without yours that's what I
told my lawyers hello I'm sorry he got
you involved in this nonsense he said
I'd be speaking to a class no I said you
were teaching someone a lesson I
personally can't imagine spending more
than a couple of minutes with Sheldon
but I have met people who would love to
meet him if only he were a real person
and I don't follow that Sheldon at one
point is fixated on Halle Berry and some
of the other people who have played
Catwoman
she's like my fourth favorite Catwoman
no kidding yeah
Julie Newmar of Michelle Pfeiffer Eartha
Kitt and then her what about Lee
Meriwether oh I forgot about Lee
Meriwether I'm glad that's settled
shall I bury my fifth favorite Catwoman
as Julie Newmar Michelle Pfeiffer Eartha
Kitt Lee Meriwether please I'm begging
you go to sleep I'm trying I'm counting
Catwomen I contacted Julie Newmar who
had not been aware of that particular
scene and while I was researching that I
discovered that her older brother had
gone to Caltech in the early 1960s when
she was I'm sorry her younger brother
when she was already an actress and she
had gone to visit him at one time in his
dorm room I'm not making this up you'll
see why I said that in a moment there is
a photo of her in the 1962 volume of the
California Tech which is the student
newspaper
so here's Julie Newmar her brother and
three would-be Swain's
and I just found the parallels between
that and season three of The Big Bang
Theory official photo to be a little
creepy I've asked her about that and she
has not responded the most famous
science experiment even beyond
Schrodinger's cat is probably the double
slit experiment and that is the one
where you have two slits and a board and
you pass light through it and the light
acts like a wave unless
you're trying to catch it being a
particle and then it acts like a
particle and the same thing happens if
you try to pass particles through and
whenever you're not trying to catch the
particles being particles to act like
waves and it makes everybody scratch
their heads and I'm not going to begin
to try to explain it now because I still
don't understand it but I can tell you
that the readers of physics world
magazine voted it the most beautiful
experiment of all time so if you thought
the words beautiful and experiment could
not appear together in a sentence the
readers of physics world would disagree
with you it gives me a little bit of a
flutter to realize that the very first
words spoken in the first episode of the
first season of The Big Bang Theory were
on this exact topic here is the opening
shot from the pilot so if a photon is
directed through a plane with two slits
in it and either slit is observed will
not go through both slits if it's
unobserved it will however if it's
observed after it's left the plane but
before it hits its target it will not
have gone through both slits great
what's your point
it's no point I just think it's a good
idea for t-shirt I applaud the creators
of the show for opening with something
that abstruse and I would love to direct
you to a resource where you can read
more about this this resource doesn't
yet physically exist however but it's
coming out in June so if you are curious
about other aspects of science on the
show and if you would like to find out
where exactly that apartment building
really turns out to be you may find that
in there thank you all so much for your
attention and I'd love to take questions
or not oh I will point something out to
to the diehards the forward is by Howard
Wolowitz Howard Wolowitz is the name of
the character you saw handing a juice
box to penny early on Howard Wolowitz is
also a real person he is a friend of one
of the creators of the show and when the
when they were putting the show together
Bill Prady the co-creator wrote to him
and said can we please use your name
it's a perfect name for a nerd and
Wolowitz bless him said sure why not so
I got in touch with him and said can you
write something funny about what it's
like to have a nerdy character named
after you and he he happily did that yes
oh you get a prize for asking a question
I can't give you a book but I can give
you a bookmark you could have had that
yes it was a tale I remember hearing
about the problems of the different
whiteboards throughout the show that the
professor who supplied those actually
used them in his exams and he made the
comment that his students had just watch
the show they would even if it's not
true it should be but that's absolutely
right and that professor is allowed to
bring one guest to each taping and that
particular time he brought his entire
introductory physics class and they all
sat there and gradually realized with
some amount of horror that what he had
put on the whiteboards was the answers
to the physics test
absolutely right yes so as somebody that
watches the sort of the show fairly
frequently it surprises me the number of
real-life scientists or people involved
in science that are on it what is the
what do you think the the interest is
for other people unrelated to the show
to appear all right so the question is
what do I think is the is the reason
that scientists are so interested in
this show and try to be on it Stephen
Hawking for instance has played himself
about six times sometimes just in
voiceovers but also also actually on the
show Hawking gave me a quote to use in
the book and it
was so simple and so elegant and so
impossible for me to pick apart that I I
could actually use your help figuring
out I wrote to him and I said dear dr.
Hawking I'm just this science humorist
and in this book about this show would
you care to maybe say something about it
and he wrote back and you know it's hard
for Stephen Hawking to write so I was
grateful to get anything from him he
wrote at last a show that makes physics
cool I don't see cool physicists on this
show I see kind of freaky physicists on
this show but they're struggling to be
cool and so maybe it's more about the
struggle than about the actual
accomplishment you know I don't know
that kids watching this show or maybe
teenagers are thinking that's what I
want to be I want to be Sheldon and
annoy everybody and then put my
consciousness into some orbiting
satellite and then just you know be the
ruler of the world but but for whatever
reason you know it's it touches that
human nerve and hey scientists are
humans too and scientists do not walk
around with all the answers you all know
this they walk around with lots of great
questions yes the biology oh that Amy
and Bernadette pursue the is it real so
the characters of Amy and Bernadette you
saw Bernadette briefly you didn't you
saw Amy even more briefly the actor who
plays Amy has a PhD in neurobiology in
real life from UCLA her name is Mayim
Bialik and when she is doing research
they often show scenes where she is
sectioning a brain or probing a starfish
she is able to use her experience to for
instance not cut her finger off which is
good she I believe they also take some
liberties I know for a fact they take
some liberties because there's one scene
where she is poking a starfish and going
I'm stimulating its pleasure centers and
for an animal that doesn't even have a
brain it's sort of impossible to find
any kind of pleasure centers so that's
me editorializing she doesn't say that
part the the other character that's Amy
so the other character Bernadette
we never actually see her research we
just know that she works in
pharmaceutics making scary things or
possibly isolating scary things and yes
there are scary bugs out there in the
real world so that's as true as it can
be yes so does the unauthorised guy did
you reach out to the creators and I'm so
really helpful and these receivers the
reason it says the unauthorized guide is
because in order for this to be an
authorized guide and I feel kind of like
I don't want my mom to see this it's
like a smudge but for it to be an
authorized guide it would have to be
basically written by people under
contract to Warner Brothers and Chuck
Lorre productions they are not at this
time interested in coming out with a
book like this so the only alternative
is to do it as unauthorized they have
not sent me a cease and desist so I'm
happy you know what you can have a you
can have a bookmark for that question
you know there's no way to pass it back
to you you'll have to get it from one of
your neighbors yes back there and he
plans to write a book on the science of
the other highest rated scripted show
The Walking Dead do I want to write
about the Walking Dead I don't I hope I
won't offend anybody
there's Schrodinger and there's zombies
and I don't know that zombies don't
exist but I did so much research on real
science here it would really be hard to
do research on sort of the the other
side I need to kind of know
yes never been in contact with the
actual opposite of the show right I have
been to a taping I made friends with a
crew member got into a taping sat up in
the stratosphere with the guy who runs
the lights and learned a lot about the
show that way and I'll just jump in and
say several people criticized shows like
this because of the laugh track I can
assure you that they do not use a laugh
track on Big Bang Theory those sorts of
shows are always taped in front of an
audience of approximately the size of
this room crowded together for five
hours freezing in the air-conditioning
because the lights are so hot and I know
this because I mean I know that they
don't sweeten it because I deliberately
laughed at the wrong time at one point
and I heard it in my episode so it's
it's not a laugh track there's no need
for a laugh track it's much better to
get real live people I I'm just curious
of the explanation like for example the
Nellie mrs. Wolowitz yes but never
actually shown on the screen yes briefly
very briefly we couldn't even see her in
that wedding scene right I'm just
wondering what the deal is Howard's
mother does not ever appear on screen
the character just recently passed so
you're you're asking about why does she
never appear on screen
why did Hitchcock appear in every one of
his movies just do a little cameo
because it's fun I think I think it was
fun for them to have mrs. Wolowitz not
ever be quite there why was the neighbor
in home improvement never seen below and
I went to a taping of that as well and
you know what he's a little short guy
he's like this tall then he says feet on
the bottom okay anyway it's it's just
it's what TV people do I make no
apologies for them yes okay one more
question
yes Simpsons paradox ayman Singh's book
that came out on the mathematics of The
Simpsons so he did that in collaboration
with
Kru that makes the Simpsons Simpsons has
many more episodes than Big Bang Theory
Simon Singh is much more prolific and
much smarter than I am he's a much
better writer all you're doing is
finding differences thanks for your
question thank you all for your
questions and your attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
