collaboration between Microsoft Research
and a host institution in a specific
country that's a very deep collaboration
with many researchers involved from both
sides and that it's really quite a
long-term engagement between the two
sides it was initially created to
investigate research in formal methods
it's been renewed twice since then it's
grown to encompass many topics now it's
structured in four themes for more
methods computer vision and medical
imaging one on big data and machine
learning and finally one on privacy
preservation and online social networks
in the 4g MRI project our researchers
developed very accurate models of the
heart behavior and this is key to very
important applications in this
particular project we are looking at
four dimensional images so these are 3d
images you know plus time 3d images of
you moving beating human hearts we're
trying to analyze these images in an
automatic way to figure out whether
there are anomalies for instance either
in the shape of the heart or in the way
the heart moves in order to turn those
medical images into quantifiable
measurements we rely upon modern machine
learning techniques so that means that
we rely upon a lot of data which has
been labeled tagged in some way or
another by experts and then what we do
is you know we throw this data into our
machine learning algorithms which try to
distill it try to understand
automatically what's important about the
data what is not which will then you
know inform you know the possible
therapy
the mathematical components project has
had as objective to develop methods to
allow mathematicians to have their
proofs verified by computers in
particular the researchers took one hard
theorem of modern mathematics and
developed a whole library of software
components that in turn were leveraged
to do a verification by computer that
the proof was indeed accurate we're
building tools that let mathematicians
enter their theories in a computer and
have a computer understand what they're
saying and check whether whether same
action makes sense and the goal is to
help Adam editions avoid hard to spot
errors the biggest challenge in this
project was making sense of mathematical
notation it has the minimal amount of
information and the meaning has to be
reconstructed from context and what we
did was figure out a way of doing
programming this reconstruction using
types this was a fairly ambitious
project one that required pooling the
resources from both Microsoft and inria
roughly a year after working in the
project we finally understood how group
Theory notation work and once we program
that in the computer about two-thirds of
our proofs disappeared because they were
all handled by the notation
this result is a landmark achievement
indeed it suggests new ways of doing
mathematics with our newly started 11
projects we have a set of very exciting
objectives in sight and while looking
forward to pushing further the frontiers
of our domain computer science and to
also have an impact on other sciences as
well with the current setup of the joint
research center within Orion France
where we have great researchers and
postdocs and PhD students working on
important research topics and very
highly relevant fields of computer
science we have great potential to
achieve great research impact and the
future each year microsoft research
helps hundreds of influential speakers
from around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
