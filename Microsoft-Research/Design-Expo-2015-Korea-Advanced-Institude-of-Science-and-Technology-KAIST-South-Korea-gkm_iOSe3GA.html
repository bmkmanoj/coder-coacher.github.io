you
next up we have Geist Korea advanced
Institute of Science and Technology from
Korea it's the first time participating
in design Expo their projects called
Sparkle it's a visual descript feature
description system hey a virgin sparkle
from Christ Korea I'm corrosion and
these are my team members jong il sung
bae and someone let's start with how our
idea emerged and led us here 285 billion
people in this world which is
approximately one in 25 people or with
visual impairment most of them have
visions most of them some of them have
no visions at all but most of them have
a sense of color we conducted a
contextual inquiry with people with
visual impairments we followed them
shopping and we volunteered to help them
shopping and we found out this I would
like pink box a cardigan they say its
trend they say is a women with visual
impairment trendiness and fashion matter
to sighted people and not surprisingly
they also matter to people with visual
impairment but how do they wear and
choose cause without visions so this is
a very question that led us here to
Redmond out of people with visual
impairment see quads what this question
in mind we conducted more interviews
with people with your impairment and we
found out there are two kinds of
information during the shopping first
known these your information like
thickness material texture can be
gathered directly by the people with
your impairments to touch 2nd visual
information however can only be gathered
indirectly through the help of another
person assistants like clerks friends
family have to need to verbally
communicate and describe the colors and
patterns to people with you during care
and we noticed that there is a great
deal of inconvenience during this
process especially around the color is
indeed especially around the describing
colors and patterns imagine you're
describing this call to your friend how
would you describe the patterns to your
friend what about colors let's take a
look at this two colors how would you
describe the difference between two
colors I can say it the tour blues and
own it's darker and one it's lighter but
that's not the only things that we see
you know that the two are similar but
definitely different and it is hard for
us to verbally describe the difference
and this is what happens during the
process assistance even if they eager to
help they struggle to verbally describe
the difference and we wanted to sparkle
up the situation we decided to help and
improve the verbal description process
for that we're going to use cross power
and technologies there are two people
involved in the shopping process
assistants are going to use the sparklab
to better describe what they see and
people with visual impairment will use
the sparkle band to better recognize
patterns of the cloth and this together
is called Sparkle and here is our video
and after the video the rather will
continue the presentation thank you
jealous her visions just few years ago
despite her disability she still
actively enjoys cultural lives he or she
suddenly feels like she should go out
and buy some new clothes
yo yo is a good brother but certainly
not a fashion star yongjia tells her
brother to take her shopping brother
assist see the first thing he wants to
enjoy the weekend as his sister insists
he says yes he is a good brother
the two arrives at the department store
injuries trying to buy some cool quality
for spring and summer
it seems like she's a pic you wonder how
does its parish would like oh the
patterns are too complicated for her
brother to explain she does not just
stand there and watch she uses her
Sparkle
the spark evangelist information about
post by analyzing the false images
displayed on the Braille display who
know uses a spark lab the sparkle band
sends a visual data to spark lab the
sparklab displays a suitable description
words of the visual data on the screen
who have described some closed loops and
feel so young doing more detail with the
hell from the sparkle with a good
brother and news falls far hope she
continues to shop they shop and shop and
shop until the brother begged her to
stop it seems like it was a nice day at
least for one of them isn't it let's
talk some more about details there are
three bands tech holders in our system
first everyone who can see denoted by
green a grey second the assistance of
people with visual impairment denotes by
green and finally the people with visual
impairment marked red we will describe
how each user group contribs to and take
advantage of our service let's say we
have a piece of clothing that has that
has some complex patterns using the
camera sparkle band can transform the
pattern information into a Braille that
people with visual impairment can feel
with their fingertips so how does it
actually work we have a software demo
for this the Braille on the surface of
the band will move up and down to create
a texture that resembles the pattern the
color of each cell represents the height
of its Braille so the whiter the cell
the higher the corresponding Braille
piece now let's see how such people and
assistants are involved in our system
first sighs the people when they shop
for clothes online they will be asked to
do a very small task for the visually of
older people with visual impairment
the system will ask them to describe the
colors they see with a few words this
cross search data will be sort stored at
the central database and it will be used
by sparkle sparkle band and other
services these crossers theta can be
useful for everyone even the sighted
people for example Sparkle can offer the
advanced searching and rich color
dictionary really sparkles rich color
vocabulary system made by people we can
now search with a quarry like British
with tea and expect some clothes which
match that description furthermore now
we have a color distinction airy that
also contains descriptors of emotions
and feelings attached it to colors
designers can easily reference and pick
colors accordingly as you saw in the
video the resistance can use the sparkle
app to get recommendations and describe
colors easier do you still remember
these colors we got some help from the
crowd through surveys and this is what
we got using the system assistant can
say about the color on the right and
this is a light blue color which reminds
me cloudy day and makes me relaxed so
people who acquire the visual impairment
can imagine colors easily with the
descriptions given and people born with
visual impairment can share the feelings
that the sighted people feel from the
color and we will talk some more about
the future applications of sparkle first
independence is important to all of us
but some of us don't fully enjoy it we
want to help people with visual
impairment to shop freely on their own
with sparkle Sparkle can try them
where's the shopping mall day they are
looking for and let them choose clothes
and describe colors and patterns to them
and second
those are not the only ones that are
hard to explain furniture accessories
drawings there are tons of things that
are hard to describe Sparkle makes this
squad can make describe easier thank you
any questions
Thank You Korea who would like to start
great job guys I I really like this
concept I think you guys have done an
amazing job actually it's got a ton of
detail in here there's a software
service that you've designed a platform
for crowd-sourced information and you
know subjective qualitative descriptions
of color there's a hardware device in
here this obviously got its own gamut of
scenarios that you've only lightly
touched on here not only that you've the
graphic communication work the design of
your presentation is really beautiful
the character design and all of those
things I think I think there's just tons
to commend you on and it even looks like
there was some software image processing
work done just to do some live video
presentation and and let me let me just
say that quite a lot of that happened
between Monday and today so you know
even more impressive for how far it's
come so well done thank you so I think
um that was really interesting I'm i
really like many aspects of this I
thought the the Braille the sort of
representation of patent virus sort of a
tactile pattern thing was really
interesting i don't know it'd be great
to see some kind of you know progression
on that and testing and how can people
really feel it and what does it mean to
have polka dots but yeah anyway it's an
awful lot of kind of understanding
patterns was really interesting and I I
like the way that you thought about
color in a and different ways of
explaining that as well I mean I think
it would have been great to see I was
not completely convinced by the way that
the cut you know the wrist thing work
with the app and the description of the
color versus the pattern I think that
that felt a little bit kind of
disconnected
apart from that bit was really nice and
it had great job explaining it yeah
that's right i think this is really
really neat I mean I it took me a most
uh di it took me a little while to get
when because the pattern that was taken
off the rack had texture to it I threw
me off you probably already heard this
feedback so i won't believe it at the
point but once I got it I I started to
kind of appreciate the kind of
expansiveness of what you guys are going
for here this is a lot of vision and and
I always worry in the situations that
maybe it's a lot in platform but if you
can produce that entire experience I see
the vision you know I think it's really
really exciting so what I was most
excited about was the end result you
know I thought that the crowd sourced
actual description was really kind of
very helpful very meaningful kind of in
that response and so just getting that
part right in terms of how people give
you the right words and how you discern
that these are the right ones for this
thing and for each of those cases each
color each garment I mean that's a very
expansive problem even if you don't have
hardware or anything else contributing
to that so you know I really really like
that part and I see that as as a piece
of it that in and of itself has a lot of
value I don't know if that helps you at
all but but I do enjoy the project I
like the branding like the look so
congrats a lot a lot of great work thank
I have time for one question Cindy
you
you
so the question was if you got you guys
did any thinking about shopping online
because when you shop online you have to
rely a lot a lot of the metadata that
the website provides so we actually met
a communicator with people with your
impairments and we asked about the
online shopping and the answer was like
depressed we were depressed appear that
they do not enjoy online shopping as
much as we do they said that they use
online shopping only with offline
shopping say what it off why more and
they vary and they try it out and they'd
go back to the homes and they already
online because it's super and we did not
quite think about how to make the online
shopping better yes that's all okay
ah yes thank you thank you everybody
