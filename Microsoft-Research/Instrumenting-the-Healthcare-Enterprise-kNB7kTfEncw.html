you
I see everyone back here we're looking
forward to a great afternoon of talks
after our rescheduling this morning I
can honestly say that I now just in the
man we've all been waiting to hear Zack
kahani of harvard medical school so
thank you very much so first of all my
sincere thanks to the organizers for
their flexibility in the effect that I'm
a disorganized nerd and I showed up five
minutes too late to get my talk what oh
my god Michael Michael there we go can
you hear me now excellent so I'm going
to try to make the falling point that
there is a larger world of data that
those of us in the computational biology
community should be making a should be
availing ourselves up and just by way of
context I lead a center of biomedical
informatics at harvard medical school
which is located at the medical library
of harvard medical school so even though
i don't wear my hair in a bun the nor do
I have enough hair to put in a bun I'm
actually also the librarian of a Harvard
Medical School and why would that be
it's because the former dean of harvard
medical school recognized a that no one
goes to libraries anymore and that be it
may in fact be the case that medical
informatics and bioinformatics is in
fact the new information curation
dissemination challenge in medicine and
that we need that much more at the
center of the medical school that had
been the case and it's probably true
because in fact we have these nano
courses of my informatics and we've had
6,000 students go through these nano
courses this because in fact our the
mass of our PhD students which are most
the life science PhD students at Harvard
don't have enough quantitative skills
and so by way of introduction i'm a md
PhD type my PhD is in computer science
my thesis advisor Pete's Oliver
here at MIT always told me to go to to
the bitter end on my clinical training
which I did I'm glad I did and so I'm
very part time maybe one clinic a month
also a pediatric endocrinologist at
Children's Hospital so I'm showing the
slide because there's a piece of a
rather big piece of open-source software
that I was lead on something called I to
be two informatics for integrating
biology and the bedside and this
software was adopted by over a hundred
academic health centers across the world
and it's a big deal because this
software is free it's free like a pony
which is that is you have to feed it and
you clean up after it and so this
software requires you know literally a
million-dollar investment minimum by
these academic health centers yet they
made that investment or why is that
because what this software does is it
pulls data out of the electronic health
record allows you to analyze it and
allows you to link it to biospecimens
and various other data tool kits and
that's hugely empowering for these
academic health centers across across
the country so it's been and the world
so it's been quite impactful in that
sense and just let you know that was
through a grant a national center for
biomedical computing grant from NIH
which was the predecessor to the current
bd2k grants and it the actual tool when
you use it looks like this it looks like
a like a screen where you have when you
drop in an ontology from let's say n CBO
or some other place it creates a
hierarchical structure which allows you
to combine in bullion fashion various
attributes some of the attributes are
generated from the narrative from the
codified data like diagnostic codes
medications laboratory studies and
others are codified data generated
posthawk by doing natural language
processing on the
notes and that's important to note
because what our billing codes billing
codes our billing codes what are what
does it what are we trying to maximize
in billing codes truth no income and so
therefore billing codes which are claims
data which are what most policymakers
used for analyzing the health care
system are maximized for income not for
granular truth and as bad as dr. notes
are doing natural language processing on
the clinical notes actually gives you
much much more insight into the actual
underlying medical status of the
patients and in fact I can regale you
with lots of stories that might actually
underline in some of the G wasps where
the where what you have in patients is
wrong about half the time based on these
diagnostic codes and so this tool is
freely available it's downloadable there
are VMs that you can download and you
can play with it and what's amazing
about it it works so this is a an old
school genome-wide Association study so
shown in here on the x-axis are snips
ranked by odds ratio an odds ratio on is
on the y-axis and shown in the blue are
it was a multi-million dollar multi-year
a genome-wide Association study on
rheumatoid arthritis multi-year
multi-million dollar and using I to be
too we selected our patients with
rheumatoid arthritis based on natural
language processing and codified data
came up with a lassoo rink shrunk
regression model to define who had
diabetes identified then the samples
that were discarded in the healthcare
system and and genotyped them and what
we were able to show here with the red
dots is that we almost beautifully
recapitulated how often do you see this
kind of reproduction the expensive jiwa
jiwa with this study that would happen
in approximately a tenth of time and a
tenth of the cost not only that but
because this was through the electronic
medical record system we were able to
say oh this study had been previously
done on what
called MP citroen donated protein
antibody positive patients that's a very
specific biomarker antibody biomarker
for rheumatoid arthritis but there's
also act by negative patients and a Jew
I had never been done for act panetta
patient's so literally we just press the
button reran the study and we had a
different set of odds ratios and then we
did something that was never done before
so which groups are super
underrepresented in hey I'm seeing some
some friendly faces who which groups are
super represented in these studies under
represented minorities are very
underrepresented in G was but where are
underrepresented minorities
over-represented in academic health
centers they tend to use them as primary
care centers for a variety of reasons
and so at a press of button we're able
to repeat and do the first jiwa on
rheumatoid arthritis for African
Americans and Hispanic Americans and
actually this is one of the few cases
where in fact their risk profile looks
very similar but the point I'm making
here is without doing costly phenotyping
just using machine driven phenotyping
and then discards we could get at the
tenth of the cost and a tenth of the
time a the study and as a result we've
had a lot of farmers approached us and
or others and use this as their business
model to do a lot of target validation
studies and a version of I to be too was
taken by and J executive Eric / axis who
a CIO at johnson Johnson then recently
CIO and the food and drug administration
and a joint just joined my group but
when he was at johnson Johnson he
creates something called trans Mart
based on I to be too and here shows we
show in there there I to be two instance
in Paris how they subselect 'add
patients with I think head neck cancer
and stratified them based on their k
rats mutational status and they are able
to on-the-fly generate the figures for
survival that were published directly in
jco giving you a sense of what kind of
translational pipeline this is now I to
be too
allows you to share data to sorry to
extract data from electronic health
record systems but electronic health
record systems are not the only office
obstacle to getting access to data
people talk about privacy a lot but the
real truth as you all know is a lot of
the barriers are institutional people
don't like to share data because you
might even find skeletons in the closet
or find competitive data and so when I
propose that we actually use all of the
Harvard hospitals to actually look at
data across the Harvard hospitals using
something that we developed called the
shared health research informatics
Network shrine I basically had senior
vice president screaming on my cell
phone why was I actually doing this
because I you know there are no
hospitals that dislike each other more
than the primary Harvard hospitals I
mean because these are the ones that are
in direct competition with one another
it's easier to collaborate with a San
Francisco hospital than it is with
another Harvard Huff's well nonetheless
we actually defined the up a the
governance but be i defined the same
kind of a peer-to-peer network
infrastructure that was used for file
stealing I mean sharing networks like
Napster to actually do it for shrine so
that everybody gets to keep their own
data but what we do is we send out a
Negra query across these hospitals so
that we had in toto 10 billion facts on
6 million patients and also I made it
nerd Flint nerd friendly which is we
said if you are with we're going to do
real-time evaluation are you an employee
of one of these hospitals and are you on
the faculty of Harvard Medical School
and if those two criteria are true
checked in real time will allow you to
do a study of the aggregate data and
find to find patients without any
further IRB review and we got that
passed all the institutional review
boards of these hospitals and what's
cool about that is that a lot of people
did studies that was unaware of and I
would have only been become I only
became aware of them because in my
narcissistic a perspective I had Google
Alerts going off
a paper that had written was cited by
one of someone else's paper and so as a
result this paper got my attention I
would have never read it otherwise it's
a paper in nature about this really
nasty disease extremely rare that kills
women in their third trimester of
pregnancy peripartum cardiomyopathy I've
never heard of it before but apparently
it now exists but it really kills people
to our day and this paper nature was
started by investigators at the Beth
Israel who I didn't know at all and they
had some interesting leads to suggest
that it was angiogenic imbalance I was
leading to this problem however they
only had a handful of patients at Beth
Israel and not enough to be make a
convincing story for nature so without
my knowing just we'd put out the word
that shrine was available they used
shrine and now they usually use across
all the Harvard hospitals they had maybe
four or five handfuls of patients enough
to make a good story so here you have an
example of a rare disease that by giving
access to Big Data you're able to get a
good handle on and of course it works
the other way for common diseases where
you either have a multiplicity of rare
variants or a multiplicity of common
variants either way you need large
numbers to vet it and this system really
scales both politically and technically
now a point that I would I should not
hesitate to make is the following check
you on your Bible studies here who are
these people who are these people yes
and what are they about to eat well
maybe apples but what or but whatever
function what is it knowledge and what
happens when they when they when I just
like realizes go guy goes to the my
synagogue anyway so I better watch what
I say and what do they realize when they
eat the treat from the tree of knowledge
that are naked who say this batting you
are doing great you're on my team
and so that's right they reasons I
they're naked and so it's very
problematic actually doing this kind of
analysis because the things that we
reveal about our health care system are
not pretty and we realized just how
naked we are I don't have time because
the skinflint present organizers only
gave me 20 minutes to tell you about all
the stuff we've done on showing how a
variety of drugs that are commonly used
are just bad players and in fact in
research with our research mode we've
actually led the FDA to black box some
common drugs because we're able to show
they were that we were killing our own
patients in a fairly unsubtle fashion
using these common drugs using this
large system so yes there is a lot of
low-hanging fruit but they're going to
tell us a lot about how it's just how
naked we are now I hate to bring you
back to public genetics 101 but you've
all seen this this thing about variants
of the phenotype being the addition of
all those other variances and here's a
thing and I don't think we think about
it often enough we're doing pretty well
now on getting the variance in genetics
yeah everyone's missing heredity but we
are pretty darn good at measuring
genetic variants at this point I cannot
overemphasize how bad we are at
measuring phenotypic variance and this
is done extremely poorly in all the
studies that you know that are published
and this I mean if we believe that most
comes eases have heritability around
fifty percent on a good day this is a
half the story and we're doing a
terrible job estimating this variance
let alone this one of the interaction
and so that's highly problematic if we
want to come up with explanatory models
of human disease if we're going to
actually just focus on the thing that's
technologically for us nerds the easiest
to focus on this one I think we have to
get a little more creative and start
dealing with some really messy data to
actually stretch our wings and really
understand what's going on with us from
perspective health so let me give you a
quick story about autism so autism as
you probably know is a quality of
impairment in communication a quality of
impairment in social interactions
stricted oh serio typical pattern of
activities you know interests and
behaviors in other words most of people
in this room and and so I was very late
to the game and not trainers in your
scientist but I had this notion for that
I can't I don't time to explain what
that we wouldn't be able to measure the
same gene disturbances or perturbations
that might be present in the brain in
peripheral blood in peripheral whole
blood in the RNA of white blood cells
and to make a long story short we did a
study and the ROC car RAC curves there
are not great I mean as you can see
there in the 70s maybe 80 on a good day
cross-validated internally and on
external populations and disclosure here
it's pretty exciting because a
entrepreneur by name is Stanley Lapidus
took our test and licensed the IP I
don't have shares in the company but
they did licensed IP from Children's
Hospital and they're off and doing now
the FDA trials to look at it so it's
kind of cool that we could do that but
here's that's not what I want to talk to
you about when you did simple go
enrichment I saw the following I saw
neurotrophin signaling pathway and I saw
a long-term potentiation extremely
reassuring because those that growth of
nerves during development and long-term
potentiation which is the reinforcement
of circuitry during laying down a memory
have been implicated in autism I said
great the stuff works we're seeing it in
the peripheral blood hypothesis seems to
be paying off but then I saw all these
other things like chemokines signaling
pathway and focal adhesion and FC gamma
are mediated phagocytosis I said that's
immunological stuff and then all my
postdocs and grad students who give me
zero respect Tommy Zack you screwed up
what do you expect this white blood
cells you've seen an immunological
signature I said wait a second but there
was a difference between the cases and
controls that was systemic so again I
don't have too long to elaborate upon it
but suffice to say if you go around
Harvard and MIT mostly hear about autism
a disease of synapses of connections
between neurons however if you go to
Caltech and other places turns out
there's a wide history of immunological
disorders in autism and if you look at
the brain the brain pathology you can
see these microglia the macrophages the
brain super activated and the same
microglia are not only appeared to be
destroying parts of the brain but these
are the same things that are supposed to
crop synapses synaptic boutons and so
there's a credible reason to believe
that in fact there is a problem with
immunological stories but I asked myself
hey we have this shrine network that I
just told you about and we have hundreds
of academic collaborators across the
United States and I said can we create
an ad hoc network across the United
States this was in 2012 and although
this will sound like a lot of money to
you it's not with $300,000 we got eight
large academic health centers to create
a shrine network for a year to study
autism and what we found was first of
all unsurprisingly there was a lot of
seizure disorders but but country to
what a lot of developmental medicine
specialists would say we found a lot of
bowel disorders eleven to twelve percent
and we found a fair amount of
inflammatory bowel disease and type 1
diabetes type 1 diabetes is the
autoimmune diabetes is not the diabetes
you get from higher caloric intake and a
few other immunological disorders more
MORE just as interestingly the same core
morbidities that we found reproduced at
every single health system so here for
example shows Children's Hospital Boston
and wake forest in the middle of United
States and the school morbidity pattern
is essentially identical across
different populations across different
health care centers and by the way when
I first published this in a small
journal the Simons Foundation asked me
to write three paragraphs about it and i
put it up on their blog and then a week
later the program officer in a panic
called me said zack you must get back to
the
there's a lot of parents and they really
really need to answer it and I what I
saw was a lot of very very heated both
positive and negative comments but all
we're saying the same thing how come
this is the first time that someone
recognizes what I knew about my kid
already that my kid has all these
disorders because previously the way
autism was looked at was that there's
this neurobehavioral phenotype but
there's all these other phenotypes that
have to val disorders and have to do
with ear infections and and a variety of
other symptoms that are typically not
addressed in developmental medicine
center in fact are typically described
as incidental findings that are of no
significance and so with suggest at a
glance give you a sense of what this
study population is was it was really
about tourism magnitude larger than any
prior comorbidity study and although the
software shrine took dozens of people to
to stand up I made sure that I was the
only person doing the analysis just to
get a sense of what it would take and so
I ran this committee study over 13,000
patients a half percent of the hospital
population with a five-to-one male to
female ratio autism is a typically
thought of as a four-to-one ratio and
they had 5600 diagnosis other than
autism and they had three million
measurements laboratory measurements on
about 3,500 laboratory measurement types
and hundreds of thousands of medications
so one of my postdocs finale doshi a
recent korsak's graduate did a very nice
analysis what she did is she took these
patients and she took their history
across a 15-year throat with an
electronic medical record you can look
at these patients that you throw and she
broke up their lives over 50 years to
six-month chunks and this is a few
groups I can say this without trying too
hard to explain it in each one of these
six-month chunks she created a bit
vector of which of the five thousand
other diagnoses each of these patients
had
okay so each patient is now described by
six months chunks with 5,000 element bit
vectors spread out all to 15 years and
then she did simple clustering of these
patients and what we found is in fact
several where we found one thing which
I'm not gonna show here which was one
big cluster that was just everything
mixed together we probably didn't have
enough resolving power to tease it apart
but then we found one cluster where we
saw across time a lot of epilepsy
pervasive developmental disorder and
cerebral policy so this is a subgroup of
patients this one cluster that looks
like has a lot of seizures now we notice
that epilepsy is a frequent maybe twenty
percent component of autism but there's
a pre read there was no reason to
believe that was not spread uniformly
across the disease this is saying there
is a subset of autism where most of that
is happening there's a group that has a
phenotype that looks much more like a
seizure disorder then there's another
cluster where you have a titus media ear
infections specific developmental
disorders and infections with viral
infections and chlamydial infections in
the lung as well and then make it to the
threshold inflammatory bowel disease and
so this looks like much more of an
infectious immunological disorder and
the second to this very distinct paths
or trajectory over time then the first
autism that I showed you and then
there's a third group and again these
groups are very robustly on anyway you
try to cluster these these clusters
reform that has persistent pervasive
this developmental disorder but also
hyperactivity or ADHD and anxiety and
also which genomic threshold
schizophrenia and so this looks much
more like a neuropsych
theatrics phenotype so we've actually
what with what have we done here we've
actually identified three new diseases
these are things that we are all calling
autism just as but 200 years ago we
called old heart failure dropsy because
people would get filled with liquid but
drop see now we know is right heart
failure left heart failure viral
myocarditis genetic disorders and this
is a first cut using very very available
data to actually tease apart distinct
clinical biological trajectories and
that's important of course because it's
allows us to focus now one of the
problems made that we may have in
running these genome-wide Association
studies whether rare variant or
convarion is that we're mixing together
all these disparate diseases and we're
hoping to have a common signal
distinguishing them cases whereas if
they in fact there is such heterogeneity
with different mechanisms it's really
going to take a lot more patients to
actually disentangle it whereas if we
start with much better defined
phenotypes getting the variation of the
phenotype down right as i showed you
that first equation i think we can
actually be much better leveraged and
this also suggests to me that
probabilistic multi dimensional modeling
together are the clinical and the
molecular phenotypes in a much more
systematic fashion is where we have to
go and when i say clinical phenotypes i
mean fine grained clinical phenotype not
just simply you have or do not have the
disease because very few diseases have
that nice on/off threshold phenomenon
most of them when you start digging down
all have a spectrum like quality and
this will allow us i thing to get much
closer to mechanistic hypotheses I
realize I'm ending getting out of time
by just would be remiss not to point out
work done by shrug Patel formerly of
Stanford we just recruited him to
Harvard and what he did essentially
using the N Haines data I did not know
this but they have on these thousands of
patients I knew only knew about the
heights and weights they have hundreds
or thousands of biochemicals measuring
the bloody urine of all
patience and they're able to do and and
what that's what chirag did the first
ever he was environmental wide
Association study we're on the bottom of
the Manhattan plot is not snips but
different biochemicals and on the y-axis
as usual the love the negative log odds
ratio and you can see and he's
reproduced us several times which
pesticides in this case I think this is
a type 2 diabetes which which pesticides
and PCBs are systematically associated
with this disease all right I got the
guy one last okay one less remind well
I'm just going to go past this sorry
guys that's just my slide of what it
takes to a multidisciplinary team to
have this happen so what are the
questions and challenges who's going to
curate these data these data are messy
these data are messy and there's sparse
in many dimensions but they're worth
curating how do we insert family history
and genomic data is there a role for the
healthcare system I believe the answer
is yes but how do we actually address
that is a longer discussion how do we
create a larger market for this
information Commons where we Center all
the data around individuals and do we
have useful prob listing models that
scale well for these interestingly
np-hard translational problems I mean
you we all think it's hard to do a
dynamic bayesian network on gene
expression on tens of thousands of genes
think how hard it is when we are
including a few million other clinical
variables and what are we going to do to
uniquely identify patients as another
heart problem and last of all this
question I want to I want you to think
about the most as our computer
computational biology going to ask the
questions because here's a point if you
don't ask the questions I don't think
many of these questions will be answered
otherwise I found in my research in
autism there are things that because I
look at the data in a data-driven
fashion
I'm asked I'm I get to ask opportunites
the opportunistic questions that someone
who has an ax to grind at the beginning
might not have otherwise so I so I hope
you'll answer the last question in the
affirmative and with that I'll thank you
very much for the opportunity for
speaking to you and to the organizers
thank you very much come on brave
questioner no brave questioners yes yes
so there's an excellent question here
which is am I worried about Geographic
stratification so on the one hand I
certainly could be worried about
Geographic stratification as evidenced
by with a net with ethnic stratification
driving some differences that makes me
so first of all yes but we can actually
check for it the second ball but if I
find the same things across these very
disparate systems as we didn't autism it
gives me far greater confidence and the
results in other words we know that
these healthcare siz are different we
know the way the ascertain patients are
different and yet if we still come up
with the same answers and the same
predictors that makes me feel much more
confident and here's a secret answer
remember those low hanging fruit there
are lots of them so whereas there are
some drug effects for example that are
very hard to sort out using this kind of
techniques I described if I had time to
tell you about the display Hughes odd
ratios on things from domestic abuse to
the effect of vioxx on the system that
will be reproducible everywhere you
would appreciate that despite the
stratification risk which can be
addressed but we have signals that just
dominate all other sources of variation
and urgently need to be looked at sooner
than later phrase another way great
opportunity for you guys to actually
make a lot of academic a and B socially
useful all right thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
