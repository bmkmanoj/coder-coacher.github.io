just just a quick run through we had me
for microsoft research and the bot
framework team who's after me there was
Ben was in here yeah ben Brown from
howdy I've are talked about kick Mike
you talked about beep boop just now Rob
talked about superscript from slack
right Brian talked about serverless pots
and I forgot your name got your from
gupshup that's right yes so any
questions for all of us or individuals a
second row our third row sorry
everybody else
you know
oh yes hey anyone want to jump in yeah
so so the most advanced part on the gup
shup platform so we working with sage
sage is the global accounting software
company kind of like into it so they're
launching an income and expense capture
reporting and so on essentially
accounting software one of the most
boring and dull categories but they want
to enable you know users worldwide
capture these things so there's a NLP
interface you know just in the moment
you can say I paid 50 bucks fifty
dollars at starbucks for a client
meeting and it just captures that
inserts it in the record or received one
hundred thousand dollars for web design
whatever it is right so in the moment
you capture all these events but behind
the scenes it's aggregating into the
into the accounting software that's one
example but we work in Barclays Bank for
support you know NBC sort of movie
recommendation BOTS a recruiting company
building a whole sort of recruiting
workflow and so on plus lots and 1000s
of self-serve bought some of which I may
not even be aware of but they just use
the platform to do things so so lots of
it yeah yeah I guess more perspective
since we launched spots as containers
and you any language any flop platforms
so it's really like what those
frameworks provide and what you could do
and so we see is especially in our
platform a lot of people doing like be
spook these folk custom integrations
with all sorts like on slack with
whatever systems are used for example
we're building or helping build a secret
shopper app for a particular brand that
does secret shopper has secret shoppers
that go into stores and so they're
helping facilitate and coordinate and
gather feedback from all those shoppers
in slack because they're you slack and
there's a mobile app for slack and so
it's you know what it's the same sort of
mix match burn kind of experience with
API is that you would call like on our
platform and since you know we get
developers full control to be able to
code the bot they want in the language
and the framework they want they could
do sort of whatever they want whatever
is possible but we're built most of our
people tend to go bots a note on bucket
we have a lot of other people to build
in Python but it's primarily known
buckets
the most advanced features I I would say
like it's less about the features and
more about the compelling experiences
it's right now so in terms of features a
lot of the brainstorming I've heard
yesterday and I think a lot of the
platforms are going to head towards the
direction is the group box what can bots
do within a group and it makes perfect
sense so but I would say like right this
very moment some of the most compelling
bots we have on cake are the narrative
bots a lot to tell a story and with kick
you can do comp combine bots +
interactive html5 web pages so we have
this block called survival which you
know has you in a zombie apocalypse
situation and you have to escape that
situation by a combination of
storytelling and real you know quick
action of a quick action type of our k
type of experiences so it's a it's a
combination of a narrative plus fast
action game and it's alex seems more
compelling than feature-rich i think
many of you know some of the smart chat
BOTS we've launched on microsoft's
platform caption bot which captions
images we have lots of swap faces and
you may also be thinking of some of our
other chat bots I won't belabor although
I like we do have a lot of bots at
various layers of our second you
actually play around with a lot of month
skype and other data platforms we
support but yeah you your guys stuff has
like actually more primitive sort of
elements than than any other platforms I
think like you have like integer types
and like dates and stuff that you can
actually like expose and conversations
for what's worth like so I think the
Microsoft one is very like fully
featured like app development thing I
mean III think you know where our thing
is a node application so you can do
basically anything you want you know
that your application logic lives in
between the messages being sent right so
it's there's not really limit you can
have very very complex conversations
with just a couple of Tears deep of calm
of callbacks and ours but like I would
point at like Kip is running on bot kit
you know stat spot is running on
unbought kit how he is running on pocket
you know these are things that operate
in many channels and coordinate activity
across direct messages and pub
channels and aggregate the information
and send it out to AP is and send them
to internal services and all that stuff
so I don't think there's any like hard
limit on what any of these things can do
a great question i am i don't know i can
i can certainly hook up with a louis
folks and we do have slop filling at two
different levels so we have slot filling
at the natural language level and we
also have a form filling system where if
you define your data types we have a
conversation engine that walks over that
and puts fields in essentially your raw
data types but i'll connect with Louis
actually don't know which one sure so
the user responds
my favorite color is green John then you
end up with a response that looks very
Eliza like absolutely yep so the
question is do we parse units
semantically and under the hood and the
answer is not in the traditional sense
so there's no deep or shallow semantic
parsing happening or any like parse
trees that are being constructed that
particular example is fairly contrived
but in that case I was looking for one
word after so is expecting one color
unit but you could essentially put in
some sort of entity extraction that
would understand Alyssa or host of
colors and then pull that unit out you
know very specifically if you wanted to
or you could plug in a parser
so in our case on the CAPTCHA platform
what we've done is you know we try to do
the combination of sort of
cross-platform as well as native if
that's the word okay because different
messages render differently right so you
can have structured messages in facebook
the templates the carousel slack is
talking about structured messages you
know telegram and cake have custom
keyboards and so on so our goal is to
have a single common API that still
renders differently or natively in each
of the messaging platforms right so
wherever possible you can still
normalize the API without normalizing
the the actual rendering in our case
yeah we take kind of a very similar
approach in the bot framework we've
taken the concepts that seem to apply
kind of generically and uniformly across
all the platforms everyone has a concept
of a message and we we model those in
ways that seem to be conventional across
all those platforms and then in cases
where certain platforms have extra
functionality we have a hook through you
know our approach to this has been that
if we build a platform that hides
features in facebook and slack and
kickin others that you're not going to
write to our API you're just going to
write directly to those and so we have
passed through for all those mechanisms
and then we also conventional eyes the
stuff that everyone seems to agree on
you go first no nothing I would just say
mmm dramatically more of all of those
things you know probably oats on our
platform so you had the brand's and you
had the retail what was the first one
native services i would say brands would
be sixty percent retail 20 and the rest
20 you know i think i see i see bots not
sort of as a special use case that
applies to some verticals but I see them
is just the latest reincarnation of of a
website or a nap right so if you look at
if you ask the same questions about
websites right what's the distribution
between brands and use cases and
verticals I mean I don't know the answer
but but it's just a lot of each of those
and and frankly you know to me what's
driving the bot phenomena is the fact
that you have a ton of eyeballs right
three to four billion you mobile users
worldwide opening the messaging app
dozens of times a day so every website
every app will have to repurpose
reinvent reformat itself for the bot
ecosystem and you're just gonna have I
don't know millions of parts because it
just makes sense it's a convenient
format now of course there'll be a lot
of unique and new innovations that we
haven't yet anticipated or can even
think of right but I would resist this
thing about okay here are these 12 use
cases that are good for BOTS while
others are for other things I think you
just go know it tips over right for the
first hundred of the first thousand use
cases once they're covered by BOTS
suddenly consumers are there and they
expect to be there and they expect every
other brand to be there too and then
everyone has to be there right and it's
so reminiscent of what happened in the
mid-90s with websites where we said okay
you know we'll keep office and
PowerPoint and so on on the desktop but
we'll move some of the thing what is the
website good for well maybe marketing
broadcasting or something and then it
just became everything right and accept
barring a few exceptions it just
transforms everything and I my god does
it's going to be the same thoughts
alright just quick I think if I would
hazard a quick quest I think it'll be
the long tail use cases they'll jump
onto it faster because if you think
about uber it's already a top ten app or
something right and for them bots is
just an extra channel but there are so
many other apps that it's really hard to
get downloaded but bots provides a huge
venue so they're going to jump onto it
with both feet and and so on so anyway
slightly alternate view bots aren't
really knew that kind of old they've
been around for a while and for the most
part they've been kind of RT so a
different scene it reminds me of the
early web there's a lot of sort of
freaky art show experimental bots on my
place like Twitter and IRC so games
could end up being a huge venue for the
early world of bots I don't know I don't
know what I'm talking about all right
let's thank you all thank everybody huh
oh no no no no if you have what more
questions find us
