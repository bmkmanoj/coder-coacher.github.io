hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
thank you for coming my name is Amy
Draves and I'm pleased to welcome Rajeev
no wrong to the Microsoft Research
visiting speaker series Rajeev is here
to discuss his book is I should say
well-received book orbit shifting
innovation if an idea is to be orbit
shifting it must go beyond the
boundaries of conventional thinking and
be among the most disruptive and
revolutionary the planetary metaphor of
gravity and orbits frames the
exploration of hidden forces and
surprising allies to innovation he is
the founder of the consulting firm
Erewhon and has recognized as India's
innovation thought leader he has
inspired people and organizations across
cultures and across the world to shift
their thought orbits the book by the way
includes testimonials from actual
clients that have tried these techniques
please join me in giving him a very very
warm welcome well formally a very good
afternoon ladies and gentlemen a great
pleasure being here and I'm hoping that
over the next hour or so I'll take you
into a hyper speed walk into what does
it take to make an orbit shift happen
and through littered with our
experiences and insights over the last
20 orders so I was lucky enough to have
married passion and profession very
early in life and really have invested
the whole life and this book is really
and it is nothing but a synthesis of the
learnings so I'm going to share some of
those with you very quickly and of
course I'm sure your questions and
challenges will may make it that much
more enriching so for those of you who
are curious I am sure you you have
decoded everyone by now have some of you
decoded it or are they still some
questions because I say I do do keep our
this question today that does come up
occasionally
Erewhon well sounds German or to some
people it sounds Korean sometimes if the
word worn in the end can be very
confusing but I am sure some of you have
decoded it have you
you have a couple of hands at least well
if you read it backwards you'll find it
gives itself away it's really the word
nowhere spelled backwards and when we
were starting out on a journey some 20
years ago in one word it spelt out the
mission actually when you when you look
at the word and you split it up
you notice nowhere becomes now here it's
very fascinating in one word it's spelt
the mission no where to now here
impossible to possible hopelessness - oh
if that's essentially the mission of air
1 and if we were we were lucky really -
I found it right in the beginning and
that that so that I am going to share
with you what has been our journey we
work with organizations obviously but if
our work is not limited there we also
work with social enterprises and
business and public services essentially
wherever a leap is needed is the role of
innovation now this challenge is really
how to make it happen so I am going to
share with you the insights which have
come to us through these 20 years of
trying to find answers to the unanswered
questions around innovation you know
everybody would love to be able to do it
but very few actually manage it and
somehow innovation is also gotten this
know not so good view point that only
10% innovation succeed you know to my
mind I'd like you to junk that right in
the beginning when organizations are in
a spray-and-pray board obviously only
10% will succeed it's fascinating how
will you throw 100 ideas if something
will come through and even 10% is
actually lucky then if it stands that
that onslaught so really what we found
where it is done deliberately and by
design why 10% 70% can succeed so I'd
urge you to junk that right in the
beanie and they then let's start
exploring what does it take to make it
happen I'll share with some of our
learnings and insights and interestingly
enough all the learnings and insights
I'd share with you have drawn from these
three roles that we play the role of a
consultant a facilitator and a coach so
as a consultant clearly the challenge is
how do you get an organization to think
and act innovatively but as a
facilitator
a huge part of our work has been in
facilitating breakthrough journeys from
concept up to in market success so over
250 over these years so really having
seen through the pains of her making it
happen Israel is very where did a lot of
her insights come from and as a coach
coaching leaders in taking their teams
through those leaps and it's fascinating
like that that the world of consultancy
is also split up like everything is
siloed even that is siloed there are
strategy consultants Oh deke
organization development consultants and
leadership consultants and we find in
our world all three have to combine
seamlessly because you never know where
the real barrier to innovation is it
could be at a study it says a strategic
blind spot and organization design error
or it could be simply a leadership
mindset maybe the fear of one guy is
seeming like a strategic issue whereas
it isn't it could very well just be the
fear of one person and it has to be
therefore dealt with at an interpersonal
level it can't be dealt with as a
strategic issue at all and so we work
across we work in India Asia Pacific
Europe also in the u.s. now so it's it's
a very fascinating cross mix of
countries and cultures and as you very
often say we are now domain experts
where innovation experts and magic
happens when innovation expertise
combined with domain expertise but at
all points of time we work with the
organization it's not it's never outside
of it so this is a fascinating mix of
sunrise/sunset industries and literally
across domains and as I mentioned to you
across public services business and
social enterprises two first reactions
to this map quick reactions
if you had if you had it on a piece of
paper in front of you what would I be in
your first reaction a lot of people are
showing you to me actually it's
inevitable isn't it we are used to
seeing the map in one way a fascinating
the maps were designed to be information
but when you've seen a map for a long
period of time it becomes a mindset
there's really one way of looking at the
map there can't be another by now we
even have statements built around it and
over the years it just happened to get
drawn this way right after all the word
is down and we found this map in
Australia with this with this bold
statement below it no apologies are
called for in presenting the map of the
south at the top after hundreds of years
of development southern lands have no
reason to be under the northern
hemisphere a very classic Aussie way of
rebelling against life right maybe they
don't like being called down under but
really over why am i showing this to you
and what connected with me when I saw it
for the first time was that this truly
represents the start of an innovation
drive or question means there's a
positive restlessness to questioning the
world order and not nearly staying with
it because these world orders can be
very implicit or almost invisible
sometimes some of our more visible and
if you look at it across industries you
will find a very pattern emerging one or
two market leaders in most sectors many
many followers and sometimes there
emerges a challenger sometimes I have my
perspective on challenges I'm sure you
have yours so very quickly who what are
the names of organizations come that
come to your mind who would you consider
challengers and not followers thinking
outside of our industry I'm deliberately
taking you outside of our industry so
who would you consider challengers as
organizations and not followers okay any
other names who would you consider
challengers as organizations please
please
any other names come to mind who else
across industries across the world as an
individual yes and more organizations
right now okay so please organizations
who which organizations would you
consider and not leaders
don't tell me we can't think of any
Reiner
actually the original one was Southwest
right that's where it the whole model
really began any others I take your word
for it right now any others
you know it's fascinating that in this
room you must know the names of
thousands of organizations that we are
not thinking about it's fascinating
isn't it how quickly history forgets and
what connects with me very deeply is
there that challenges create history the
rest follow it and so really when you
think of who we remember we remember
those who created it at some point of
time or the other
and did you just gonna quickly share
with you the people some organizations
have come to my mind and just to expand
thinking across the world because what
we also try to do is deliberately work
across sectors across cultures to see
therefore what are the new reference
points you know that the V almost Steve
Jobs is the image or Bill Gates
immediately if I showed it to you but
this is another innovator anything else
is tough one
this is also a an innovation which had a
global impact but in the world of
cataract eye surgery in the you know
where in south of India in a sleepy town
called Madurai this man took on a
mission to eliminate needless blindness
really what he found was in lot of parts
of rural India when people lose their
eyesight due to cataract they actually
don't know it's curable and what's worse
a person at the edge of the poverty line
when he loses his eyesight he could lose
his life so now his response was not
charity but a business model solution so
the challenge was how do I make my
search and who's the most expensive
asset the most productive classical
productivity question which we are all
concerned with all the time he found a
breakthrough which made his surgeon ten
times more productive than the global
West at the same quality 10 10x it's not
merely a point 1 X or a point 2 10 times
more productive and they are now the
global reference point it's called our
wind I care I mean they are literally
mentioned all over the world it is
fascinating when we talk talk about them
that you don't have to be in Silicon
Valley to do great things you can really
be everywhere the challenges people
somehow start to believe that the place
is the reason for their being rather
than them right the place is not boring
maybe I am
that's that the tougher question usually
and the most amazing thing he started
this mission at the age of 58 after
retiring from his previous job the next
20 years he's gone and done this so
really there's hope for everyone in this
room the life is not done to take you
further from India further into the East
the mobile revolution which has been a
huge part of the emerging economy is
really the core innovation the product
innovation started in the Philippines
the the the prepaid card with electronic
recharging not the day they came up with
that and then the business model
innovation came from a company in India
and combined with process so really all
three product process and business model
innovation together have made this
amazing revolution happen because
ultimately while they the prepaid card
was a great idea but it dropped revenues
dramatically the per person consumer
usage rate dropped dramatically to make
that economically viable needed a
business model innovation and when the
three have combined and that's really
the heart of it so really what appears
to be amazing is a combination of three
innovations have you heard of m-pesa you
solve you must have this happened in
Africa Vodafone in Africa they converted
the mobile phone into a mobile wallet
into a mobile bank account and really
Bank the millions of Kenyans who didn't
even have a banker bank account the
first bank account was was not with the
bank what was with the local retailer
with whom some money was deposited a
mobile account opened and then you could
pay with an SMS astonishing isn't it and
today they have 17 million subscribers
in Africa and fascinating were and also
the Vodafone which had never even
attempted something like this in any of
the developed markets they did it in
Africa first so the cell phone becomes a
24 hour by 7 teller literally take you
even further off into the vast lands of
Mongolia where innovation happens
in there you know you can imagine in a
vast everything I'm sure you have images
of Mongolia that the vast terrain of
land nearest hospital far away 35 to 40
kilometers for most people so access to
healthcare a big challenge now how do
you make a health care accessible was
the question so were now the government
was struggling with this question and
interesting enough when a country is
trying to improve access to health care
what would be the most traditional
solution what could be the useful advice
given to these people what would it be
what what do you need to do clinics so
really clinics doctors that's even
tougher the hardware is easier software
is usually tougher I mean especially by
way of people and sending them to rural
even more so you can imagine what an
infrastructure heavy solution that is a
lot of emerging economies their
healthcare infrastructure today is
one-sixth that of a developed nation in
terms of the number of hospitals nurses
doctors now however the fascinating
thing is that they reframe the question
itself that rather than invest in
supplying health care how about reducing
the demand on health care so invest in
wellness now that that's fascinating
isn't it in there there they partnered
with nippon foundation of japan to put
in action a traditional japanese
solution and what was this solution to
put literally pre first aid kits into
each house but we are all our first
doctors aren't we
by now you know right if this is the
problem do this like that doesn't work
we go to a doctor so that first instinct
is there in all of us now writing or
that instinct they played there they
actually put into each house into some
districts a medical kit based on
symptoms that if this is the symptom
this is what you take but coached in
this case it wasn't instinct in anymore
it was and also all the medication was
based on traditional Mongolian medicine
which is herbal and not Western medicine
which is chemical so even if they took
the wrong one there is no side effect
since it is herb now these kits were
placed in houses the doctors were made
in charge of some area so they would go
go around check and even more
fascinating the payment the business
model was post paid not prepaid is like
a hotel minibar you obey you pay based
upon how much you use now the doctor
went around based upon how much they had
used they would pay the outcome has been
most amazing in some districts the
number of people coming to hospital is
reduced by as much as 60% now what could
be a more glorious outcome than that and
if they think about it this is a cost of
this solution versus the cost of
healthcare infrastructure what does it
take to create this are we solving the
wrong problem but that's really what
orbits shifting innovation is about
right about questioning the problem in
itself and how are we attempting it how
are we thinking about it sometimes the
answer may not lie in modern technology
it may lied in lie in ancient wisdom in
this case it was literally ancient
wisdom which came into play you know all
these examples some of those of you
shared with me and I've shared with you
are what stands out about them is that
they were literally they made a quantum
leap it's an orbit shift as we call it
and you know on the other hand you
notice a lot of organizers that you
haven't thought about traditionalists
get stuck in an orbit it happens to the
best of us you know no matter how good a
team you put together it's so easy to
get stuck into a formula which we all
know which is predictable it's why we
all would love to be orbit shifters but
the reality is most of us get stuck into
maintaining the orbit and the biggest
challenge I am sure that you all
recognize is for any organization of the
kind that we are in a part of shifting
the orbit and maintaining it at the same
time is by far the toughest question and
I'm sure you you'll live it everyday
that dilemma and that challenge and
really today by the I sure you've
experienced it but today
I find that no CEO be dare caught not
talking innovation you cannot not talk
it but only there's less than five
percent actually managed to do it but
where is this gap really how it's not a
question of mal-intent
not at all they genuinely wanted so
really very very so what drags down I'm
just sticking with a physics metaphor it
also happens to all of us individually
to where women colleges when students
are leaving a college you know when
about to leave college step out into
life and you meet these people and ask
them what do you want to do you'll hear
a lot of them talk big stuff would you I
want to change the world and you meet
the same people ten years later what is
usually happened what has happened more
often than not unfortunately more often
than not the world has changed them they
become hopelessly practical by now and
the dreams are not dead but dormant
actually they what I have shared with
you or some examples of where people
reclaim those dreams however what really
happens what is that how that happened
over ten years is really what we call
gravity gravity catches up and you throw
it up and no matter how hard you throw
it up it comes down you know the any
community any organization it gathers
gravity over a period no matter what and
that gravity has this power to block
change to prevent it and there was a
very interesting study conducted across
organizations once as to what how do
people majority of the people react to
these ism amazing vision and mission
statements that come out and these
slogans which come out in organizations
what do you think most people what is
their reaction that the large masses you
know that there there is in one word the
reaction of the mask
usually is this too shall pass these
guys must have come from an off-site
somewhere and they're Grant's Logan guys
wait it out long enough and it'll go
away life will continue to be what it is
as comfortable as it always was trouble
is more of more often than not there
it's right they've they've learnt the
fine art of survival by now do nothing
and hopefully it will go away but that
is gravity
you notice the inertia which comes with
gravity that that's the heart of it and
a gravity in itself it gathers over time
and so when we talk thinking out of the
box I'd like you to think about that
carefully because we've explored this
beautiful word that is used so easily
and thrown around these challenges which
box and the boxes are not visible that
that is the bigger question at one level
you have organization gravity a
organization key gathers a way of
working conditioning but over a period
of the industry develops gravity it's
not just one organization the whole
industry one most most interesting story
around this which brings us live
beautifully is really one of Walt
Disney's earlier experiences you know
one of the first film films animation
that they tried out was a three little
pigs
you some of you you must have seen it it
was very successful
so when Walt Disney came back and he was
talking to his studio and asked them so
what film shall we make next what do you
think was the response what would happen
when one genre film began begins begins
to succeed well you know things work big
cell speaks to now that was the very
natural response and the good people
hundred note for a for a minute doubt
their capacity or capability but that's
what conditioning does you know when
Walt Disney thought about it a lot and
he came back and he was saying you know
it struck me now you can't beat pigs
with pigs actually do something else
that is when they went on to make Snow
White in the Seven Dwarves if you know
film history it was perhaps the first
full-length feature film in animation
it started virtually this category of
feature films
animated feature films it took us know
why to beat bigs over a period what
happens to any industry you notice over
a period everything starts to look the
same across an industry everybody is
making pigs in fact the whole industry
becomes a massive pig making factory and
people will tell you well I have a blue
pig I have a slimmer Pig I have a faster
Pig I have a cheaper pig
it's a pig nevertheless there is no snow
white on the agenda even by now and of
course we then say this is commoditized
not this industry completely
commoditized you can't do anything here
but reduce price very naturally right
everybody is doing the same thing I'd
like you to just think about this
question banks the idea of a mutual fund
did not come from a bank over 75 years
across the world the same blind spot and
what was the blind spot that they
thought of their customers as people who
save and don't invest nothing about this
huh very well cultivated businesses and
you you can't fault a bank with hiring
talent they hire the best talent money
can buy and give them the fanciest
designation I'm sure you know that they
are they are masters of this art but
that hardly has insured them against
conditioning seventy five years around
the world the same blind spot in fact
three of the biggest game changes in in
banking have not come from a bank this
one
microfinance did not come from a bank
mobile banking also didn't they were
bought m-pesa came through didn't come
from a bank either
in fact they really resisted it you know
Inc in Kenya they were feeling as if
their domain was getting upset who are
these guys what a phone to do banking
you don't even sound like reasonable
however the these are do you think this
idea would have emerged internally and
would I be in dismissed very likely in
fact where some new guy must have said
you know why not try this and what if a
new guy says this what is he likely to
be told
yeah how long have you been here two
months come on after you be near two
years then I'll ask you I mean after two
years you won't ask these Stephanie
questions right you know what
conditioning teaches people it the
questions not to ask you the best
conditioning is really about that the
fine art of survival is what not to ask
is not about work to raise but this is
implicit in folklore industry gravity
even deeper the deeper boxes our country
and cultural gravity I'd like you to
think about this these are even deeper
up to industry we all think about these
are actually even deeper and to when you
dig it deeper and these boundaries
really come alive when you see different
levels of markets meeting say a
developed a company from a developed
industry trying to enter an emerging
market these boundaries really come
alive they're ups uninterrupted power
supply companies multinationals entered
emerging markets now the UPS industry
had a legacy of their own in their minds
ups was associated with the computer
right so that's how it had worked in
developed markets so when they entered
emerging markets they extended their
thinking you know you attack and exist a
new market with the old markets mindset
that happens to the best of us in this
case they did it so what is the size of
the market equal to the computer
penetration how do you penetrate this
market through electronic stores
extension of the paradigm and what the
mist actually was the biggest
opportunity possible the biggest
opportunity in emerging markets was the
home you inverter because power supply
in itself gets is disrupted people need
it for their livelihood day to day and
they completely missed that is just
simply a blind spot for four years and
till the local entrepreneurs did a big
thing there and actually they reversed
it from creating inverters for the house
they also made them enable them to use
it for the laptops too you can imagine
what happened then however capable
he was there the opportunity was missed
it was not an issue of capability they
could have dealt with it if they knew it
but trouble was the capacity to see it
and seeing in the attempting annexed
market with the old markets mindset and
the biggest so this is one level what
happened to develop markets is companies
which are doing brilliantly in one
market is they try and replicate it I
have heard this very frequently and when
that replication does not succeed in an
emerging market the reaction is this
market is not ready yet have you heard
that one you know what could be a more
imperialistic statement than that now
think about it the markets are ready but
for something else the markets are
always ready for something else the
trouble is they are not ready for what
we want to give them and if only we were
to just step back a little and see what
they are ready for there is so much
weight opportunity waiting out there
it's so fascinating how frequently this
happens the market is not ready it and
on the other hand the finest example of
this arrogance really is also French
wines lost market share for 30 years
running and it's so difficult to change
because the French just don't drink any
other wine they don't believe anybody
else can do it better by the way all the
French wines are labeled in French
because you're not supposed to
understand it it's French it must be
good it's so amazing that's the degree
of it the height to which midget is
taken but 30 years of Weber the market
leaders challengers erupted all around
them Californian wines a new New Zealand
wines South African wines you name it
and though challenges and the French
market share has dropped amazingly a
very very sad however it took them 30
years to even they start changing their
business model 30 years since there's a
very interesting story which we talked
about something called the de Paris
judgement day when French food chefs
compared French wines with Californian
wines and Californian wines scored on a
blind test you think the French believed
it no no no way this was in 1975 and 30
years later the same
the same results but very difficult
you notice arrogance reaches a point
where you deny reality even it is not
easy it's very painful actually the
other side in emerging markets we have a
different kind of a country and cultural
gravity subservience it takes a
different form all together the belief
that how could we have been the first
ones to have come up with it in fact if
we believe in Lord of these economies
even they get a big idea come on how
could we have been the first ones to
have gotten it let me leave we have got
those guys must have actually thought of
it long time ago well no and not done it
it can't be that we've come up with it
in fact one organization which was into
watches their R&amp;amp;D team was thrown this
challenger to create the slimmest
water-resistant watch in the world
slimmest and water-resistant now this
was in India again can you imagine what
the reaction of this team was to this
challenge have the Swiss done it now the
Swiss are the gods of precision
engineering right and the Swiss had not
done it and believed it could not be
done you can imagine what the reaction
was my god the Swiss say it can't be
done it can't be done right now that's
gravity but fortunately they gotten over
they got through this gravity in their
mind and said if the Swiss can't do it
we will it took them six years and they
did the same team did it but that was
the box there you don't need the enemy
outside the enemy inside is far bigger
it's not industry it's country and
culture gravity now playing up which
makes people do reverse engineering
rather than innovation I'm sure you've
seen reverse engineering right pick up
something modify it a little and call it
ours rather than believe that we can we
can live with it but when this
breakthrough happens at that point that
unleashes the new thought so no matter
how much ideation you teach these people
will get used to create even more
reverse engineering faster you I hope
you connect with mirror that is the
barrier is there it doesn't matter how
many ideation techniques they learn who
the ideation will be used to do reverse
engineering faster and better
rather than go to the heart of it as to
where is the real boundary and if you
notice all this that I have been sharing
with you is gravity wave where does it
stem from just one scramble it a little
now minds ideas emerge from frames the
challenges how do we do it now how do we
break through it right as people is the
one thing is to know about how do you do
it
ideas in our minds emerge from frames
imagine frames are like windows to your
mind when you are attacking a question
or a problem you open a window and it
reveals some ideas when we run out of
ideas they prob answers are not finished
the frame is saturated shift the frame
and a new burst of thinking will start
but frames are like windows even deeper
is the mental model the mind says that
we've been talking about that's like the
lens it doesn't matter what window you
open the lens doesn't change the lens is
me is even deeper that's the actually
the premise literally that you start
thinking with and that's the most
invisible as you go deeper so this
gravity gravity's is the form of inter
instrumental models and really all our
work is about how do you recognize them
and then start breaking through those
even recognizing them can be a challenge
this is a big myth around the innovation
world create a structure in a process
and innovation will happen right so we
create a department around innovation
and create a stage-gate process and hope
innovation will happen I have never seen
a breakthrough come through a process
like that I don't know if you have you
know what are we trying to do we are
trying to use the a standard principle
which that's how we handled quality so
we created a department around quality
and it was done but that was alright
because it was maintaining the orbit but
orbit shifting is like creating another
department the most helpless people I
have seen as a chief innovation officers
I mean what do they actually know so
they end up creating this central idea
management system and hope something
will happen how will something happen it
is not on the leadership agenda at all
if they is it and I do keep there they
let's start with this thought or
but shifting is the purpose innovation
is the means managing innovation will
not let innovation happen if there is no
appetite for it
appetite comes from orbit shifting so
you want to transform something and not
merely improve it now doing more of the
same can't do it now there is a need for
innovation innovation can't be managed
it has to be unleashed while learning
over these years is 4-bit shifting is
the purpose innovation will be inter
played it will happen but if the purpose
is mainly to maintain the orbit and all
the discussions around innovation will
in any case end up nowhere there's no
need for it actually nobody actually
wants it it's just a nice thing to talk
about and this is another myth so you
have to hire cowboys from somewhere and
the hope is again something will happen
but the cowboys will become a part of
the gravity in no time the gravity is
far bigger than individuals I mean the
expectation to have four guys will
change something that's only be
temporary at best unless we have so
really the start point is it's not about
structures process or hiring new people
but breaking through that mindset
gravity at the poor and then that
unleashes we've seen the same people do
it it does not take a change of teams in
fact more often than not in our
experiences it did not take a change of
teams the same guys did it the
impossible once the mindset gravity was
unleashed so the other myth is this one
right it starts with an out-of-the-box
idea I'm sure you've seen these romance
discussed a lot some guy and their HR
got this great idea we all these stories
of a romantic in hindsight the trouble
is howdy but these are accidents usually
you can't wait and hope for accident as
an organizational design for it our
learning really is that if not with an
out-of-the-box idea but with an
out-of-the-box challenge is where it
starts deliberate out-of-the-box
challenge which cannot be done through
doing more of the same to give you a
very interesting example of this Korea
SK Telecom into Mobile's now for 3G was
being introduced there as a network
now they took on an out-of-the-box
challenge we'll monitor is the
non-monetized part of the network it was
not grow grow our business by 20% the
moment you do that people do more of the
same even better but this was an
out-of-the-box monetize the
non-monetized part of the network and
it's very interesting the moment they
said that one team one of their partners
was looking at this and recognized that
the ring tone is not monetized that
actually when you call me and my phone
rings 10 times and I don't pick up my
phone I don't respond you actually use
my network and not paid me for it
how about monetizing that that led to
ringtones and all the missed call
services which erupted from there but
where did it start did out-of-the-box
idea didn't come first the challenge
came first starting with an
out-of-the-box challenge leads to an
out-of-the-box idea and not the other
way around and that and I'm mentioning
that when it is done this by design and
deliberately when you want to really
provoke thinking to another level and to
give you another example of one did the
company in Europe a la food was into
dairy products they wanted to create a
big leap and they they they they also
started an out-of-the-box challenge
space food for dairy products
I mean imagine they took on the
challenge of spaceports the business
guys said well how many clients you have
to but the question was then you take
your mind there will create breakthrough
which can then be commercialized so they
actually did need send it up with NASA
and it got commercialized in various
formats but it started there with the
crux is all this talk you might be
saying you're a dream is very fanciful
but who will actually do it I mean in
business in organizations who are the
heroes heroes are people who are great
at under promising and overachieving
right if most organizations build this
culture very beautifully so at the
beginning of the year when the main
planning is happened for next year who
are the heroes the guys who know how to
promise just get a goal which is just
below what they can achieve that's
supposed to be the hallmark of
negotiation skills there is a question
of an out of the box challenge
I mean people have to be nuts to be
taking that on and calling their KPI
absolutely not now think about it if
they there's no question so really the
biggest barrier is not the fear of this
is a myth that it's a fear of commercial
risks the bigger barrier is the fear of
personal risk who will put his
credibility on the line for an out of
the box challenge and how do we
cultivate and a performance system which
did distinguishes the two so managers
leaders don't manage an innovation the
way they manage performance now that's
the trouble with this world also right
that we try and manage innovation the
way we manage performance the reviews
the metrics are not very different the
way of engaging is absolutely similar
for us the crucial difference has been
an orbit shifting challenge is not a
number to be achieved it's a direction
not a destination in the chase of it we
land up miles beyond where we are today
even if we never get there it doesn't
matter if you don't get there because in
the chase of it will in any case have
gone miles beyond where we are today
what's more important transforming the
status quo or achieving some numbers for
the sake of them because in any case the
organization movement is far more then
it where would I be otherwise a lot of
the examples I have shared with you
those people never actually achieve
those numbers but in the chase I feel
like they shifted the industry reference
points forever so this is about how does
one so innovation needs ideation is the
other myth not really I'd urge you to if
there is one thing I'd like you to keep
in your mind at the end of the days when
you set on a big innovation journey the
start point is not brainstorming and
generating ideas if you want to break
through the start point is mapping the
mental models of the current way of
thinking in that place in fact I will be
when we start on any of our missions the
first point is map mental model
boundaries that's it
believe me seeing those mental models
will make us see the blind spots in no
time it to stop this urge of rushing
into ideation take on a big challenge
just map boundaries and it's how many
blind spots will come through and each
blind spot is an opportunity that the
team will see in no time
I will have it in fact I'm just coming
to that due to gate let's trade that for
you so for just to give you an example
we started out with Unilever some years
ago the way their challenge was create
the next game-changer in laundry for
example now they say you know around the
world actually we've done lots of
ideation we have more than four thousand
ideas I doubt if there could be anything
new but let's try so what we said well
excited to share your ideas with us and
we mapped them essentially what we
started to see was those ideas what are
the underlying frames and what are the
underlying mental models the months the
mental models started to emerge the
blind spots are very visible think about
it laundry equals removing right in your
mind laundry as a process equals really
moving the bag away so all of the ideas
most of the ideas on how to remove
faster better with less water more
efficient etc etc but the fascinating
thing was the mental model boundary was
removed but that is post dirt right the
moment is a post dirt immediately you
think of an alternative isn't it how
about pre dirt
how about preventing dirt how about
living with it and making the process of
removal a lot more infrequent those
questions started coming up when we
started questioning the once they
started questioning the mental model we
even have to do it once they see the
mental model the blind spots are very
visible but that was that was one the
other thing was it's about removing what
about adding now you might say but they
would want to add dirt for sure of
course not but that those are the points
where unusual things begin to happen and
the question really was about adding
what about adding health but that's not
laundry think about the head but that's
not laundry right that's the immediate
reaction the trouble is that metaphor of
laundry is a mental model by now it is
stuck
so the so what are the mental models
I'll give you a couple of more examples
around this to get to the underlying why
how and what mental models there are
mental models rounding the why the
what and the house at all points of time
which are invisible usually in the
indoor in the in the water industry the
whole by if the first one was you notice
that they the the whole industry here
had gotten trapped into a process a
sequence first so purification is about
what filter at the source then package
then drink so filter act the source
where the water comes into a house it
has to be filtered at that point then
package then trunk now the whole
industry is busy in the same mental
model so therefore everybody is making
it faster better cheaper with more
features you notice now what's happened
the mental model is stuck to tail till
one company in Switzerland with a
challenge it very beautifully Viper if I
at the source
how about purifying it as you drink so
the LifeStraw you can pay a drink from
anywhere and it purifies it you notice
that photographs of people drinking from
a lake there yeah it costs a fraction
okay and again canned free you do about
thousand little liters in a year can you
imagine how many lives this will save or
people who could never possibly have
afforded that and also how liberating it
can be and we this company is not even
to water purification they were into
fabric so really didn't take a new
technology it take it took the
application of existing technologies in
new ways that's another myth then the
next big technology will make the Beggs
leave happen I'd urge you to think
that's an escape route the new ways of
using existing even older technologies
have so much power waiting there for
them this really is not that the the
next big leap will come from the next
big technology it applications of new
applications of existing technologies
and combinations will create leaps
creative combinations as they did in
this case so this is the now now let's
talk about the why right
Appa int into diabetes or all these
companies into diabetes you know over a
period of time found that one company
was question what are we appeal pushers
various selling pills how about helping
the patient manages disease
and we've been diabetes happened to you
it starts ruling your life so we reframe
it how about helping you manage the
disease and that led to the Novo pen the
pen like device with one click which can
deliver a dosage now for it for people
who get to a high level of diabetes
social life becomes tough becomes
embarrassing life's rhythms will get
disrupted and so something which can be
carried almost like a la lifestyle
statement where we open it with one
click delivers you know if what happened
was people for the first time felt in
how I control diabetes doesn't control
me but can you imagine this organization
breaking through this boundary because
all their life they are thinking
thinking or Indies about the next drug
it's not about a drug delivery device
that was actually they thought some
marketing gimmick they didn't even
patented however this has been a
game-changer in that world but it let
what is the mental model boundaries of
why whoa what have we into and is there
completely different way of thinking
maybe the low-cost airlines also started
like this what is the purpose of the
airline is it the comfort or is it
getting from point to point at the
lowest cost you notice somebody
questioned it fundamentally those over a
period of time everybody is adding value
without asking hoo-ha value for what
people become great at adding value and
over-engineering anything anything gets
over-engineered out of shape over a
period because everybody's contribution
is a value add and not and not a
transform so I what I've tried to
illustrate to you is what does it take
to make this happen I'm just going to
jump a few slides because we have a time
issue to deal with the other is
innovation equals insulated invention
getting the blind spot was the mental
model boundary but if you want to do it
deliberately it's not sitting in the
room and generating ideas and
experimenting challenge to join dots
across domains and across industries in
fact to do it deliberately that we found
always works it opens up you know
searching for the mental model boundary
is the search for the next question it's
not the search for the answer for the
new question the
find the new question we'll find the
answer the trouble is finding the
question in itself so it's not really
the search for ideas but the search for
new questions then how do you do that
know by joining new dots deliberately in
fact what what we get teams to look at
is for any business they are in is most
fascinating there are six horizons who
were joined dots with first look at the
AG customers in our field not the usual
ones the AG ones and what can we learn
from them the new open idea came from
there incidentally that insight one girl
that there the one of their customers
they found had done something very
unusual she'd actually developed a
syringe got in a local clinic to develop
it and prepackaged it for the day you
know that's interesting how can we
develop it into a product now a pin
shape thing which is preloaded for the
day or for a week actually
but that's where did it start from one
edgy customer that one edgy inside and
so the challenge is not the usual the
edgy customers will challenge the mental
model boundaries the boundaries will get
challenged when you engage with them but
searching for them engaging with them is
one horizon second no not just edgy
customers ecosystem we were working with
the team which work we were just
creating a breakthrough in security data
security so they did they made edgy
customers first then ecosystem well
who's in the ecosystem of course in the
edgy customers were the usual security
suppliers in companies etcetera etcetera
the ecosystem it also had hackers lots
of insights came talking talking from to
hackers you know how do you engage with
security perhaps they'd be more insights
there but but the most fascinating thing
was going even further market
intersections time edge knowledge
intersections who else deals with
security but is not a part of data
security in a different world altogether
the doctor deals with body security
talking to a doctor about with body
security opened up new questions and
they found very fascinating lis that for
them security with the mental model of
security was like a fort you have to
prevent something from coming in versus
the body which is about self immunizing
well
with that broken bomb one of the mental
models for them there could be a
different way of thinking here and to
talk to an entomologist how ants deal
with security you notice each of these
is joining new dots but those dots don't
join me we can't go around shopping for
ideas here to do them deliberately and
this team on laundry they join new dots
with the with the with the scientist who
was involved in studying barnacles if
you like why did they meet him because
the removing is not physical dirt is
also biological dirt so let's meet
somebody who deals with bacteria so this
guy said you know after some time you're
talking about all bacteria is bad all
bacteria is bad kill it kill it no some
bacteria is good for example barnacles
you know they they they sit on the body
of the animal inside the seat actually
through that taxi dermal routes itself
then take in nourishment that relate to
the idea well what about doing the same
thing to clothes take in health put
something we don't accidentally now that
opened a new question right now suddenly
new dots joined then that's what opened
up what about adding else there could be
a different way of thinking but if we
ready to start talking to these people
engage away the way these conversations
don't happen over a piece of paper on
reports these are live engagement
dialogues these are what we call insight
dialogues then you open up inside
dialogues is fascinating how many new
new dot start to join and all these do
then become possible these are six
horizons and taking the team actually to
engage with these it's fascinating how
many new dots join and very quickly it
takes a matter of weeks actually none
not even months well what happens
accidentally over ethers can happen in a
week or two weeks by deliberately
setting up these joining dot
conversations of course deciding this
first for we were were you know and
another company set out on the challenge
and they were they were talking to us
about reducing water usage in all the
personal care products personal care
products bathing etcetera is all water
intensive and water is becoming a
challenge worldwide how do we reduce it
was their question so they said you know
how do we optimize it limited reduce in
the shampoo etcetera
a lot of conversation happened like this
and what I was you know if we start like
this how to reduce water will end up
with an optimizing answer it's not an
orbit shifting challenge what would be
an orbit shifting challenge how about a
range of personal care with zero water
now that is orbit shifting as a
challenge right with substitutes 100%
now we have no answer we only have the
question now then we set out on this
journey and who did we meet here in the
AIG customers yeah be a army officers
who had been on glaciers they have no
access people who have no access to
water what do they do so new insight
started from there we even met a
prisoner in Fe in a cell they have a
little access to water what do they do
somebody would keeping himself up well
so it was meeting exceptional edgy
customers no nurses who handle bedridden
patients you notice each conversation
was a new link called together in the
mind happening and in terms of knowledge
intersections completely needed new new
people who have done away with in any
kind of dependencies when these dots
started to join all these new
possibilities opened up and they have a
range of at least three came changes in
the pipeline now and finally big ideas
don't get killed they just get diluted
even let's say we've come up with a big
idea what will happen to it now now
you'll find that suddenly the rest of
the organizations needed to execute it
just few guys came up with it
everybody has to be involved in
executing it what appears like a Snow
White in a boardroom becomes a pig by
the time it reaches the market because
everybody takes away a little bit from
it how many batteries will you fight how
many silo battles because what's the
exciting opportunity fuel the problem
for the other guy it's a headache right
as if I don't have enough work so you
know what happens at this stage people
engage with the new with the old comfort
zones is a triangle manager he's handed
triangles 10 years of his life and now
you're giving him a circle so what will
he do he'll fit it to the circle to the
triangle and say what he can do and what
he can't do yeah if you want to do that
then you have to wait five years then so
forget it man
let's compromise let's do at least do
80% what you can do first compromise
this is the way compromises happen I am
sure you you have lived through these
compromises in a lot of stage-gate
reviews this is exactly what happens we
start fitting in the new to our existing
way of working and the compromise is one
small touch at a time it reduces over a
period and then when it doesn't work we
say the idea was bad actually the way we
executed was the problem the idea was
okay it was taken out of shape by the
time it finished so really top
management must mandate doesn't work
finally the biggest challenge for
innovators is to enroll cross-functional
people and to make it into a shared
dream now that is by far the lowest
skill and which is the toughest
challenge usually to excite and enroll
peers into contributing into it with the
same excitement that they feel now and
finally the big idea is enough not
really a product with a breakthrough
product will need a breakthrough
marketing innovation perhaps sometimes a
new idea goes into the old pipe in the
last mile it is sold in the old way it
is taken to market in the old way and it
gets reduced to nothing so the very
often the last mile go to market is an
even bigger challenge and this some some
of the bigger like m-pesa for example it
started didn't start out like a b2c in
good model even it started out as b2b if
you like they started out that
microfinance company will be our
customers for two years they tried that
out till they discovered the bigger
opportunity both with b2c but they had
the patience to see it through in a year
and a half of experimenting in a small
small way in one market till they
figured out by the time it finished it
was b2c a even bigger opportunity had
emerge they didn't start with that
insight they finished with it but can we
have a way of doing it that by design
why is there any reason why more ideas
from succeed we are assuming the
original shape of it will be the final
shape it won't be in the market the
dynamics will change it and we have to
be open to seeing it not just open do it
by design if
it's in market versioning not product
versioning in market versioning building
in tier 2 in market success model not
seeing it works we say let's see if it
works there is no if it's only how to
make it work
the first way we try may not work the
second way not well the third will work
so these are the six differentiator that
I've tried to pull out for you today you
know of all our learnings seeing it I
hope I try to share with you from the
starting from how you initiate it to
build it to grow it to take it to market
what does it take to make it happen
I think we've run out of time but
questions are left to you yes please
hey anything you like to add let me see
if I understood your question at two
levels one is to just to demystify that
orbit shifting can happen across all the
levels in an organization yes the
examples are given you a
larger-than-life kind of examples for
example at a functional level we've even
worked with companies right on the shop
floor so we're the guys at the shop
floor have made leaps happen which I
created new reference points for the
industry worldwide but in their space
it's an orbit shifting innovation in his
space it need not be a game changer at
an industry level but for it's a
functional orbit ship shall we say it
could be a functional orbit shift it
could be an organization orbit shift or
an industry orbit shift the thing is
there is space for every one of us in
fact even for talent for HR product
innovation is HR right talent market the
product we have is perhaps in the
Industrial Age there's so much
opportunity
so I would the only thing is to shift
focus to creating a quantum leap in my
space that would be an orbit shift but
to lift it so that we notice oom the
processes are given in incremental
innovation we assume the processes okay
you need to tweak it but in the process
it was orders but I just find that sort
of tough satisfying in large
organizations there are main
stakeholders yes I would think at
various stages the challenge is to
engage them in a co-creating manner
rather than in a presenting and
defending manner the present and defend
is the real issue and also I'd urge you
to think that when a stakeholder starts
saying no the challenge is how do you
engage with that what appears to be an
unconditional no could be a conditional
yes if the the challenge is to get to
that why and therefore use it as an
opportunity rather than backtrack
immediately because nobody really has a
mal-intent
or at least 95% people don't have it
they get misunderstood more often than
not and we found that when we actually
engage you'll find what started out as a
no very often is a conditional yes but
actually discovering that has
strengthened the idea and when that
person finds his call his thinking has
got an understood and it's contributed
he starts owning it you notice as an
illustration so really share with them
in a work-in-progress stage as we say
sharing with them things which are
littered all over in the
work-in-progress stage is inclusive a
fully prepared deck is excused excluding
actually but preparing them for that is
the question yes you've answered most of
these already but I was wondering I deal
with a lot of organizations that pride
themselves on having a narrow scope
uh-huh by design how do you find is the
best way to
that to change them to see that wider
scope would be better for the
organization discuss like they are so
proud of only doing one specific piece
of of the picture I'm just wondering it
Campanile or what so maybe basically how
do you provoke them to think beyond it
is it you notice it would really begin
with first some person reaching a stage
of positive restlessness with the
current stage now the question is where
is that restlessness sitting is to
uncover that and leverage that to move
them because very often when the heart
first and the mind will follow is the
principle that we found works usually in
fact I'd urge you to think when the
heart first and the mind will follow
rather than the other way around
especially with them wherever there is
positive restlessness is to uncover
those and leverage those points to move
them please Minister Modi reached out to
your organization to have you be a
consultant for his name we're like they
all I can say is there is so much
opportunity I would think at least our
vision for emerging economy especially
India is how do we leverage innovation
to leapfrog growth and development of
the nation and not merely catch-up quite
like what's happened in the mobile space
you know it's fascinating there in a
short span of a decade the way it has
leapfrogged
it's not merely caught up it's like
following the usual model would have
taken decades what has happened in a few
years can the same thing happen in other
spaces and there is an example which I
was going to share with you in literacy
where the same thing is happening what I
shared with you in Mongolia that is the
power of innovation which can deal with
the fundamental questions differently
but not to follow but to question
crash however India today just to share
with you this national innovation
Council in every state has a state
innovation Council and we are now off
late been getting these requests for
state innovation roadmap with proposals
so starting is there it's at the start
but I'm hopeful but then I'm a hopeless
optimist it's going through a lot of
changes and what I find is when we ask
questions people are very receptive and
listening to the question but when one
starts answering one of those questions
that's when things go awry so my
question is well people are always I are
always welcoming when you start asking
questions but when you stop the question
put the steak on the floor and start
answering or doing something that's when
devil gets loose so what is your one key
point that I can take so that when you
move from the transition between
questioning still answering how do you
control that part do actually you notice
what happens at the moment you start
answering now snakes get involved right
intellectual discussion is easy it's
nice to have a very fascinating
discussion as long as there is nothing
to be done at the end of it well then if
there is something to be done which I
have to do oh my god so the ears the so
where does it begin why are we
questioning if we have an out of the box
challenge first then questioning is
normal it is natural you have to
question them the first question is to
have that challenge sitting up there
which mu doing more of the same cannot
do now people are engaged in questioning
there is no in fact there's every reason
to question now but the starting point
is there somebody has to put steak on
the ground there I mean the work
companies likes questions like solicited
questions and and asks every company is
out our goal is to make money so we like
to make money we like to ask questions
but we don't know when but when you
start thinking of doing certain certain
things to make money that's when things
go bad so my question is again my
question is what sort of questions and
what sort of mindset should we take with
us so then the question
it's become answers we can do the art
with shipping we've a wave often found
that money is a consequence impact is
the question that finally how do we want
game-changing impact we want to create
on the market therefore money will come
but what is that for example the MPA
idea it didn't start by an idea they
actually looked at what are the
Millennium Development Goals of the UN
and how can we contribute to those and
financial access was one you noticing it
started there the big insight the
opportunity I'd urge you to think where
are those big opportunities sitting out
there where impact is needed because
people sign on to an impact they want to
change lives then it stops being
pressure it becomes inspiration
otherwise it seems like pressure money
targets are pressurizing but changing
lives it's inspiring there's a reason to
do them something after all you need
that extraordinary motivation yes
we're I mean we're at an inflection
point we have a new CEO who is making a
very mindful effort to change culture
more innovation and now Eddie so how do
you common is culture in all of this and
how do you do it in it and it kind
we have 100 or now hundred twenty-five
thousand boys I would think I would
think the start point would be
uncovering the gravity and confronting
it directly but in a constructive way
the objective is not to pull down people
is to actually construct a really but
attack mindset gravity fundamentally and
question that and but openly do it and
the most constructive manner possible in
fact this is a great to present the
current situation not as a threat but as
the greatest opportunity of her lifetime
that when reinvention happens very
rarely do you are you a part of
reinvention doing the same thing every
day we all do but here is an opportunity
to create absolutely to reinvent it if
we do it with that intent we will
suggest that mindset gravity has to be
done with a view to creating the next
orbit and not with reference to cool to
we're evaluating today when it is done
with that since it is positive it
unleashes it doesn't poopoo pull it down
but it has to be done directly
deflecting it around won't make a
difference means you have companies on
standing you know very successful that
me which actually made it may be
successful companies that made the orbit
shift happen I mean one well-known
example Israel eg the interesting thing
what I have seen is there pioneered for
example the the guy in India and the
emerging markets he you know he
referenced himself that we are not here
I don't want to be known as the best MNC
in India but the most admired Indian
company therefore make a difference to
these people here is my real purpose and
that has led them to so many
breakthroughs like the GE Mac 400 which
is the portable ECG portable ECG machine
at one-fifth the price which is now
breakthrough for the world but they
started out with questioning that and
they had the space to do it
the so the even one company had the
capacity to reinvent internally so there
there are examples there however I must
say they are lesser in comparison to
others which are far more standing in
the sense that is where gravity takes
over right but there are more the phone
and m-pesa is one very successful the
same model everywhere this the first
time they did anything the first time
but they what was the I think the big
we're learning there is 2d risk it to do
it in one market the challenge is not to
avoid risk but would be risk the
out-of-the-box challenge and to try it
out fully in one market and let it play
out rather than putting in center stage
and declaring it worldwide then
everybody gets concerned tomorrow
is not working the challenge is to let
it play out
give it space to play to work to grow in
a in a side market it doesn't have to be
a global rollout on day one global
rollout happens when you have built it
into a success model rather than being a
hurry to roll it out so that helps
building that capacity in market
versioning literally and not technical
but in market so the business model gets
version literally last question okay
thank you very much guys all the very
