right thanks very much Rob can you all
hear me the microphone is working great
so welcome to Cambridge welcome to MSR
Cambridge I thought what I'm going to do
for you is give you a general overview
of of Microsoft Research of Microsoft
Research Cambridge let you know you know
who we are what we do and then give you
an example of a few projects across
across the lab before I turn it over to
my colleague Chris so I'm Rob showed you
a nice picture of our shiny new building
if you wanna get an idea where that is
it's in the middle of the world of
course it's in Cambridge so this slide
shows you the the entirety of the
Microsoft Research Organization so there
are there are seven sort of core labs
and the first lab was in redmond where
the headquarters are of course Cambridge
was the first lab outside of Redmond and
the first lab outside of the US and
we've been here for 16 years now so it's
a it's a it's a it's a it's a sort of
venerable institution Microsoft Research
it's the lab and Redman was founded in
nineteen ninety-one so it's something
you know we've we've been around a long
time soon after we were founded there
were labs set up in Beijing and
Bangalore and then more recently labs in
other parts of the US most notably in
the other Cambridge which they had to
call themselves MSR New England because
we were MSR Cambridge and there's a
there's a small bit a small outpost in
New York that wisdom part of part of the
Yahoo acquisition and there's a small
lab in Silicon Valley as well and then
there we also have three advanced
technology labs which are sort of
halfway between a product organization
and the basic research lab that MSR
represents which you'll hear more about
and then in redmond there are also a few
allied organizations to MSR that are
kind of like the 80s the extreme
computing group fuse labs and station q
station q is our group that is looking
at quantum computing so which is about
you know sort of as far out as you'll
get there gives you an idea
of the of the of this of the scope of
the activities that we ever taken in ms
are so as I said MSR has been around
since 1991 we have had the same mission
statement for all of that time and it's
a three-part mission statement our
number one goal in MSR is to advance the
state of the art in computer science and
that's computer science taken very
generally so in fact these days that
includes a wide range of fields sort of
outside of computer science but on which
computer science has an impact or or
which has an impact on computer science
so we also have psychologists and
sociologists and biologists and
ecologists as well as computer
scientists so that's a very general
that's computer science at its most
general but the the advancing the state
of the art is is in the sense of in the
same way that academics advanced the
stave down so it is important to
understand that that MSR at its core is
an academic institution you know we
measure our people largely on their
academic output on their quality
peer-reviewed peer-reviewed publications
in top journals and conferences just as
if we were academics now if that was the
the entirety of the story you probably
be wondering well why is Microsoft
paying for this we do have two other
parts of our mission statement the
second which of which is to transfer
technology into Microsoft businesses but
this is its kind of secondary is the
wrong word but it is a second goal our
number one goal is that advancing the
state of the art in this academic
fashion but as sort of equal but second
goal is to transfer ideas that we come
up with into Microsoft businesses and we
do that all the time and in fact one of
the journalists that I spoke to
yesterday said he wanted to know what
fraction of the projects that we do in
MSR make it into Microsoft products and
I thought for a moment I thought well
that's not the that's not the really
interesting number the other number is
interesting and virtually every product
that Microsoft cells has had some impact
from microsoft research and I think I
think that's the more important answer
there and so and as well as that sort of
mainline transfer of ideas into the
business a couple of examples which I'll
give you we also have one or two other
ways that we
can can transfer technology and I'll
come to those later the third part of
the mission is one that we we talk about
leadership leading Microsoft into the
future and this is really the idea that
a basic research lab like ours that has
this freedom to do sort of research and
do anything that we want to has an
obligation to look further forward than
the microsoft business groups can do to
see well what's coming next what should
we be gaining expertise in so that when
when this new thing comes what when
there comes a time when those new things
can be taken to market that we're ready
to do so so that's that that's the third
part of our mission these sort of eyes
into the future and and so overall that
makes this a very interesting place to
work this is you know if you're somebody
who otherwise would have been an
academic in one of the fields that we do
researching this is a great place to
work because we you know if you walk
around here it will feel like the
university department people and people
are hired because they're good at what
they do not because we want them to fit
into a certain area we hire them and we
let them do what they want to do we let
them research the areas that they want
to research and we just sort of assumed
that good things will happen from that
and generally they do so that's the sort
of culture of the place it's very open
there's no another good example of this
is that there's no formal process
anybody here has to go through to
publish a paper they have an idea they
work with their collaborators inside and
outside and they choose to publish the
paper now of course will you know the
people are generally sensible and
they'll probably talk to our patent
lawyers and patent a few things before
they publish if they think this is going
to be valuable to the company but but
that's up to them there's no there's
there's no formal process that obligates
time to to do that in and again that
just fits with this idea of having
having the ideas bubble from the bottom
up you know I think something that we
often say here is it m google was famous
for saying that you know you had your
sort of twenty percent time when you can
do anything you want and when we're
interviewing candidates and we're trying
to say no you don't want to go to go to
Google you want to come to ms are we say
because five days a week a hundred
percent of your time you can do what you
want to do which is which is which it
true
so this slide is the research areas that
that cover what goes on in this lab so
this is the are the five major areas
that that Cambridge covers I'm not going
to talk about these in any great detail
because you'll be hearing you'll be
hearing from people sort of across these
areas later in the day I guess the
really the thing to see is that there's
a very wide range of stuff from sort of
core computer science like programming
programming with programming principles
to more sort of wider rings and things
like network economics human-computer
interaction and includes sociology
biology and ecology as I said so there's
there's a very wide range of stuff we do
and again it isn't like somebody said
Cambridge you shall do these five areas
these have just grown up over the years
because of the people that we've hired
and as happens in academic departments
the hiring process you graduate sort of
a creep areas of expertise and that's
what's happened here but it wasn't any
any sort of top-down process and which
also means that you saw that there are
many other microsoft research labs you
know we often do have groups doing
similar things sort of across the labs
and that you know that works out okay we
collaborate a lot of the time where it
makes sense occasionally you get a bit
of healthy competition which is which is
good too so there's really no no sort of
orchestration the reason that these
three sort of product group logos are
across the bottom there is something
that we've done more of in the last
couple of years is we've had what we
call embedded product groups with us and
all that really means is people from
various Microsoft product coops living
with us in this building and that has
proven to be a very good thing for them
and for us because it means that they
have sort of immediate access to ideas
from ms are words that can take back to
their sort of management say look this
is something cool I think we should be
using and it also means for us being
5,000 miles away from the sort of you
know the kind of heartbeat of Redmond it
gives us a sort of easier access to
getting our ideas in there as well so
it's it's a two-way street and that has
worked very well and I guess on top of
that with some recent acquisitions we
acquired skype a couple years ago and
they're mainly in London so that's very
advantageous for
especially with our new our new location
and another point is that we we pay a
lot of attention to the pipeline of
people that we might hire and this
actually goes all the way down to
education so we have a very you know we
engage very strongly with academia you
know I said that we behave like
academics but we also work with academic
extensively so our researchers you know
you know very very commonly work with
with academics from universities all
over Europe and all over the world way
but we also have a couple of formal
programs one of which is our PhD program
so we fund about a hundred PhD students
at at any one time over there so the
three or four years of their PhD and we
do this by targeting supervisor so
academics that we know are good and they
apply with a project in mind and if they
get one of these fellowships then they
then identify a student and but key to
this is that we we tend not only to
grant these where there is somebody in
this building who is going to be co
supervising that PhD so it gives us this
very tight engagement with you know
young vibrant PhD students and their
ideas but also it lets us identify early
people we think that we should maybe get
as interns then postdocs and then hire
them so we have a very you know it
people are our most important asset so
the way that we that we recruit them is
important then that starts with our with
our academic engagement not even at the
PhD funding level right a little change
of pace you know so I'm now moving on to
the sort of second and possibly third
part of our mission statements and a
couple of the example projects that I'll
show you later will give you an example
of the more what I would call the
typical tech transfer that we do because
most of what we do when we do technology
transfer is we take ideas that we have
and we get them into Microsoft products
and there's lots of examples of that but
occasionally we do something that isn't
either ready for a Microsoft Project
which it doesn't fit our you know our
product offerings at the time and in
that case we're able to do to license
things out to other things and that's
what happened here I'll just give you a
little bit of back
so and this also goes to show how the
long-term aspect of MSR is an important
thing because this this thing which I'm
wearing one of which is called
autographer goes back to a project we
had here that was called sense counter
and it goes at that started in 2004 so
this is a long time ago and it was
really one of these sort of curiosity
driven things where one of our
researchers was building a sort of what
she called a black box for human beings
if it's just a box that had a bunch of
sensors on it accelerometers and light
sensors and temperature sensors and the
idea there was to just monitor the
environment that you're in all the time
then if you were in an accident or
something you could see how about you
were moving where you were sort of what
was happening to you at the time and
then she just had the idea I wonder what
would happen if I bolted a camera onto
this thing so she did and she used the
sensors to trigger when the thing takes
pictures so the idea here was that so
there's all these sensors on board and
so if you move suddenly it would take a
picture if the temperature changes so
maybe you've gone from inside to outside
it takes a picture the light that will
change is suddenly it takes a picture
somebody walks in front of you it takes
a picture and so and so it tries to take
pictures at these interesting times and
then another sort of happenstance thing
is that the head of the neuropsychology
department at adam brooks hospital here
in Cambridge saw this thing and thought
that would be a good memory aid from my
memory impaired patients and so that
started a whole theme of work and I'm
not going to talk about that in detail
because you may have you may have seen
it before if you if you monitor anything
we do but that led to a whole theme of
research around the world not just here
but neurologists and neuropsychologists
and biologists around the world were
were looking at why this the the types
of images that this camera took had such
a profound effect on people's memory so
it actually we ran you know we here we
ran with adam brooks formal clinical
trials of early Alzheimer's patients
people that have lost the remedy to
strokes and reviewing the images that
came out of this camera just had a
profound effect on a profound
therapeutic effect on their memory and
they're still ongoing research in this
area I just had an email from
she's to Oxford who's done a PhD using
sense come for this purpose it has just
had his vibe but so all that is to say
that this was this ongoing ongoing
research and at the same time we also
all of a sort of medical research was
going on we we noticed that this was
just fun the sort of image sequences
that this thing took were fun to kind of
replay with your family and so we we
initially went to the Microsoft hardwood
guys and said you know look this is cool
idea you want to build this and we had a
long sort of exchange with them and it
just turned up that at the time this
didn't fit there you know they're sort
of road maps so they decided not to
builded which gave me leeway to try and
licensure which I did and so I license
at first to this company OMG in Oxford
we license it to them just for use in
the medical domain and they built an
insulting for that and then they came
back to us and said you know we would
really like to build this for a general
consumer launch and they set up a little
separate company called OMG life that
has launched this now under the brand
name autographer they completely sort of
redid it i'm i'm wearing one now they
just launched it this year so you can
actually buy these things now and so i
think that you know that's an
interesting sort of path from a very
sort of serendipitous research project
to a shipping product and it's a
technology transfer that is not the
usual type of one but it's something
that we that we do every now and again
so just a little sort of a story there
also will pitch for the photographer cuz
I'm so now I thought I would turn to a
couple of research projects that have
gone on either and also another tech
transfer story or two under the general
guise of how how is the way that we
interact with computers will change and
I think you'll all agree that it is and
how might it change further in the
future so here is an obvious example is
that going to play do I have to click it
a short video but most of you publish
seamless
I'm not sure how this is I want them I
won't dwell on that because you've all
probably seen this so Microsoft Kinect a
new way of interacting with your gaming
console and without having to use any
sort of a controller you've seen that
now the I want to also tell a little
tech transfer story about this because
this the success of kinect has been a
really positive thing for this lab we we
had a lot to do with this and the tech
transfer story here is is is again a
slightly different one than normal is it
the product group came to us so we were
the Xbox sighs we're kind of building
this themselves in doing a very good job
of it and they just ran into a roadblock
of not being able to make the skeletal
tracking run in real time and they knew
that the Cambridge lab and actually i
think the a July was well both had
strong computer vision groups and they
came to us and they said can you help us
with this and so we sent our guys away
for you know six months and they did so
they that and that which has led to the
to the product that you saw but and the
real sort of guts of this is an area
called machine learning which chris is
going to tell you a lot more about after
my talk Chris's is 0 is the world expert
in this area but the sort of essence of
what that means is learning by example
and so this trizzy this is a number of
different body poses with the different
parts of the body labeled in different
colors and you can see that there are
lots and lots and lots of these because
that's if you want to do machine
learning you need to lots and lots of
examples to learn from and interestingly
here and i think this chris can probably
tell me well i think one of the
innovations is that these were
synthetically generated examples so we
didn't get people to you know dance and
hold them hold their arms up in all
these different positions we generated
those synthetically and use those to
train to classify which then was able to
to work at which wich way that you were
standing so you can see here this is
just a very quick outline of how it
works and i guess the the key is the
sort of hardware innovation was an
inexpensive depth camera which is a sort
of camera which gives you
information as to how far every pixel in
the image is from the from the camera so
that's what that first image is the
darker the pixel the closer it is to the
camera and taking that information you
can then infer which part of the body
each pixel is sort of assigned to and
then you can use that information to to
further sort of postulate where the
joints are and what they're doing this
is the so-called skeletal tracking again
Chris may tell you more about that but
the real key here too one of the things
that I think we contributed is this no
tracking or smoothing this is all done
frame by frame there's no frame to frame
information being used and that's
important to make the thing sort of work
consistently in a way that that
consumers will accept because if you if
you use tracking and the tracking goes
wrong it'll go badly wrong and so we had
to make it work this well with no track
that's one of the things we did but
there's more to be done so as you if
you've used this or if you have read
about it you'll know that we can track
the human skeleton very well and that
includes your hands we know where your
hands are but we don't really know what
your hands are doing and there would be
there will be more interesting things we
could do if we knew what your hands were
doing and so that's a problem that we're
looking at now so we're doing more of
that kind of data collection of hand
poses and we're training our classifiers
on on on that data so that we can have
more information about what your hands
are doing and not just where they are
and that's work that's going on in
largely in this lab also in in other
labs I think and and this has led us to
look at other applications if we can
tell what your hands are doing then
maybe we can use it not just in front of
the games console but in front of your
pc and this is this is a research
project that's going on here that Abby
will tell you a lot more about later on
but you can see that my colleague Chris
here is interacting with his pc using
the mouse and keyboard like normal but
he's also able to use his hands to do
various kinds of gestures I don't know
whether we missed the searcher bc he's
just sort of swiping on the outskirts of
the keyboard to do those sort of swiping
type moves
I think he'll do a search gesture here
in Melissa this is there's a sort of
narrative to this video that I've that
I've turned off but the idea here is
that we identify regions above the
keyboard on the keyboard and around the
keyboard where we can sense where your
hands are and what they're doing using
the technology that I that I just
mentioned we can use that to implement
various types of gestures that you can
use and the key here and as a bee will
make clear later these are gestures that
are used alongside the most in keep or
not instead of so you may have seen the
leap motion can control and that's much
more of a kind of Minority Report sort
of thing where most of what you're doing
is in the air and that's not such a good
idea and that gets to my next slide is
that a lot of the work on this project
has gone into thinking carefully about
if we can tell what your hands are doing
what gestures should we look for that we
could use in anger in there in real work
over a long period of time and there's a
number of design principles that that
Abby will go into later to that we try
to to adhere to make these low effort at
organ on and ones that you really could
use and use in conjunction with with the
input modalities that you that you
already have and this these are a few of
the gestures that we have one of them
that you'll see later and I think
probably the most compelling one is this
one that we call the peak gesture which
is turning your hand over like that to
look at the sort of the document that
you were just previously working with
the idea there is as you're typing it's
very natural and easy to just flip your
hand over look at that previous document
flip it back and go back to your typing
and that sends it away and they you'll
you'll you'll see that later that's one
example of these sort of integrated
organ armik gestures that this project
looks at yeah I won't tell you any more
about that because Abby is going to I'm
going to move on to something else down
this in in the spirit of one microsoft
i'm going to show you another idea about
how interaction in the future my work
that came from one of our other lines
this is from i call Danny Wilson in MSR
Redmond and his group let me just play
this quick video for your mental explain
to you
it's called illumiroom
at box go big
watch what the funny now yeah that
little bit at the end I think is the
coolest thing I've you know I saw I i
sat in this room at that we have this
annual sort of research trade fair that
we call tech fest and I saw this there
and it's really amazing and you know
what he's done here is he's used a
camera and a def camera in fact and a a
projector to base as you saw to
basically expand the field of what your
interactive it to be your entire room
there's a lot of clever stuff going on
to make the mapping onto the furniture
in your room be as as well done as it
was and that's because the depth camera
scans the whole room gets a 3d model of
the room and can can sort of adapt the
way that the images are showing so that
fits onto your furniture but you saw all
sorts of effects like when you I think
when he shot a gun or something the
whole room vibrated and it's it's it's
just an amazing effective I think the
thing is this in terms of where
interaction is going it's these two
sides tides of things it's new input
modes like gesture as we saw and Abby's
going to talk later about other ones
because gays and voice and even em and
and even brain interfaces these are all
coming these are things that we're
looking at you know how we would use
them when they are commercially viable
but then there's also the the the output
side of things large displays are
getting a lot cheaper and other
technologies like this are going to make
it possible for almost every surface
that we see to be part of your
computer's display and I think this is
an example of what that might what that
might lead to how am i doing for time up
five minutes okay well that's maybe time
to quickly tell you kind of change seems
so that was all about user interaction
you've I've kind of hinted it some
things to come and you'll see some more
of that later in the day I thought I
would just give you a quick flavor about
some of the other research that goes on
in the lab because it's a I mean it's
actually my group does a lot of use the
user interaction stuff so I you know I
don't I don't want to be seem to be
biased that way and we have a lot of
other cool stuff going on as well so
this project is one from our systems and
networking group which I suppose was
arguably the first group i got i guess
ml p.m. so the best number where the
sort of early groups but here the idea
is to make make cloud performance
and we can only do that with cpu so you
can get a dedicated vm from a from a
cloud provider like a sure but the the
problem is that network traffic and
storage bandwidth are also key to how
fast your job is going to finish and at
the moment we have no way to guarantee
performance levels on those two fronts
and so this is what the systems guys
were looking at so the idea here is that
if i have my own my own sort of
enterprise server setup and i have a
MapReduce job or John has a MapReduce
job he wants to run it he knows exactly
what he can offer in terms of network
end with them and storage bandwidth and
cpu time so he knows that'll take four
hours on his on his enterprise system if
he says hmm I don't want my own system
anymore I want to run this in the cloud
all of a sudden he doesn't get those
same kind of guarantees because the
cloud is all about you know time on VMS
so you have the sort of cpu time that
you know but but you don't know what's
going to happen with the network traffic
or the storage traffic and so the time
it may take longer than the four hours
that we take in me in the ideal
situation on one that's when it's your
own network and that will also vary the
cost because you get charged to Anna by
the hour on most of these ecosystems and
so they were thinking well what can we
do about that and so what the idea here
is to have a set of two sided thing to
allow tenants to say what their
constraints are say I want this job to
finish in three hours and i wanted to
cost less than four hundred four hundred
dollars and it also lets the providers
work out how how much it will take for
how many VMS and what network bandwidth
and what storage ban but they'll need in
order to finish the job in less than
three hours in them and then they can
decide whether that's worth 400 olive 0
and and really this sort of innovation
here and i won't go into the details
because I don't really know them and be
because it would take too long that they
have come up with ways of working those
things out and it's important to say to
that this in general for general
computational problems is essentially an
impossible problem it's one of these
np-hard problems but they have it they
have worked out a way that enables this
to be done for MapReduce like
applications which covers a wide range
of things that people need to do in
cloud so that's for interesting work and
that set so that that is enabling this
job centric pricing where you can say
you know I will do this job in three
hours for three hundred dollars in I
guarantee that it will be finished and
lastly I'm going to move on to some work
that's been done in another of our
groups our computational science group
and this is the group that has the
biologists and ecologists zone you're
going to hear from from Lucas later I
think from that group talking about some
of this work this is work that Lucas is
not going to talk about which is done by
some of our computational biologists and
what this is this is the only slide I
have and I don't expect you to really
understand it but this is is a tool for
biologists to reason about biological
systems like cells what's interesting
here what's actually really interesting
is that this actually crosses three of
our groups in the lab because what they
have done here is they have taken the
formal mathematical methods that our
programming principles group uses to
analyze computer programs and they've
applied that to biological systems so
they can prove things like the stability
of the chemical pathways in a Cell
corresponding to the to whether a a
piece of software will do what it's what
it's been being specified to do or not
they use those same techniques for that
and then some of the social scientists
in my group have gone to see how
biologists actually behave when they're
doing this work and I've tried to build
this tool to mirror the way that
biologists work so we've taken
mathematical techniques from computer
science to model biological systems and
sort of ekta graphically derived some
practicing practicing biologists
practices and merge those into this tool
that is down being used by biologists to
do to do cell biology so I think that's
so that's that that's my last slide and
I think with that I'm going to turn it
over to my colleague Chris who's going
to give you some more details about them
dealing with uncertainty thank you very
much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
