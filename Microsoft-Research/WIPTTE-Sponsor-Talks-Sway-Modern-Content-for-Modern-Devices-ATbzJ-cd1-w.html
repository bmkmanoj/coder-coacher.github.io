hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
okay our next speaker Chris Pratt Lee
really needs no introduction to this
audience because Chris Pratt Lee was the
inventor of OneNote many years ago and
which is well known to everyone in the
room and he's here to tell us about what
he's working on now great well it's an
honor to be here I think you guys
represent sort of the pinnacle of people
who understand the topic of you know pen
touch education so on so I'm deeply
intimidated by being in front of you so
but anyway I'd love this to be
interactive i'm going to show you sway
if you think of you know one note is
relatively new product for compared for
a lot of people but i think of it as
it's gone off to college it's a 18 year
old right now sway still wearing diapers
it's this little 12 month old nothing
it's crawling around the floor so we're
getting it's growing up quickly though
so i wanted to sort of take a brief
quick tour over what's way is first want
to ask though who here is seen sway
ready and who's created their own sway
and who's created lots of sways oh right
this is pretty great crowd okay so i'm
just going to show you a little bit of
the product and then we'll sort of go
into a discussion okay so so obviously
sway is a brand new member of the office
family and it's a a sort of appear to
word and excel and powerpoint and
onenote a lot of people asked me today
like okay sure it's a peer but what does
it make I mean word we know makes all
sorts of document types you know reports
and so on statements of work powerpoint
we all know does presentations and all
sorts of other you know diagramming type
things suede what does it do well it's
an interesting question because what it
does is it makes a new thing and we call
it a sway that's not because it's got a
file format of sway or something like
that it makes a interactive adaptable
responsive to devices
digital document it's digitally
authentic in the sense that it doesn't
have like a print based representation
the way really Word and PowerPoint
started way back being print and 35
millimeter slides and that's where the
inspiration came from and in fact the
whole way you create documents and slide
decks is fundamentally about positioning
things on the paper or slide and then
since then we've obviously made those
products better for digital work and all
the things that we do and obviously mix
is a great example of taking power point
to a whole new level but with sway what
we did was we said let's start from
blank and say if you're going to create
a new content creation sharing
expression service tool whatever it
might be in the 21st century second
decade of the 21st century what would
you do and the idea of course you start
thinking well what are the constraints
around the that we have to meet now what
are the expectations one expectation is
you can no longer count on everybody
having an eight and a half by eleven
viewing surface or a four or whatever it
might be everyone uses phones there's
bones from four inches 6 inches there's
phablets there's tablets there's laptops
there's really big screens what we did
in the before the mobile revolution
everybody kind of said well I can just
kind of zoom my fixed layout on
different sizes you know you get that
PDF file it kind of works on your 27
inch monitor kind of works on your 11
inch laptop but you can't really screw
around like that anymore in a lope on a
mobile world because it just isn't
working if you try to look at a
PowerPoint PDF i should say on your
phone it's really a pinch zoom nightmare
right of trying to span across the whole
thing and of course now we're talking
about watches and even smaller things it
starts to become more ridiculous that
you could take this essentially
paper-based type of output that we've
made before and you see this in the web
people are trying to make responsive
websites but you really have to have
kind of a coding team in order to make a
responsive website it's not a thing an
ordinary person could make and what
we're trying to do is sway is will say
first one got to be able to create
something that works across all devices
and I don't have to worry about it I
want to have to go verify that it works
okay it should just work without me
thinking about it that's the number one
thing next thing is if you're really
going to create things especially on
devices that don't have keyboards or
that are very small you don't you can't
create
by forcing people to drag things around
and flying font sizes and all the kind
of Nick in Italy picky stuff that you
have to do to make great looking content
in the traditional tools so we really
wanted to invert the model for creating
content and sway and I'm going to show
you a bit of that if I get to the demo
part but the idea is we always start you
off with a completely finished product
and at any point you can say i'm done i
like this it's good you can't have an
inconsistent lee formatted sway because
we guarantee consistency we also built
in their own designer algorithms
essentially we work with our own design
team to kind of encode the rules of
design and put them into this way so
that although you may not like the
particular aesthetic of a single sway
you can always find one you do like and
it's a matter of just browsing the
variety rather than having to manually
adjust which is the traditional way so
ways make sways are like it says here a
dynamic interactive canvas very clever
but really there's and this is just
showing that you know we can host videos
I'm not going to play that right now
here's a comparison interactable we have
a library that's growing of these kind
of interactive elements here's an
animated jiff here's a live tweet that i
could if i hover over you can see that
the thing the buttons actually work on
it can play this video inside the tweet
that i embedded if i want to this one is
not working right now let me retry it oh
there we go so this is like an
interactive photo gallery where i have
selected in this case to show thumbnails
along the bottom but there's lots of
these sort of interactive components
here's an embedded powerpoint that i can
just browse through and of course this
is running the powerpoint web app much
like mix does when you're viewing a
powerpoint in a mix and it's just
embedded right here now a lot of this is
some of these things are plain old
internet embeds so in some ways nothing
fancy but if you think about it what
sort of easy-to-use end-user tool is
there that lets you gather this stuff
and arrange it in the way you'd like and
some of these things are not like that
some of these like this this film strip
thing are native sway interactable 'he's
and we have a growing library like i
mentioned um
so I talked about how it works across
all these different device types and why
did we make it well there's so much
media going on so another reason we
wanted to build sway is we we could see
that people's expectations for what good
looking content looked like engaging
valuable content looked like have been
climbing if you think about all the
mobile apps that you run or the websites
you visit increasingly they're just
fancier and better looking and they're
more interactive and if you think back
to some of us remember the desktop
publishing revolution where he went from
you couldn't really make something that
nice look nice like the printed stuff
you would get from professional
publishing services and then all of a
sudden you had a laser printer you got
you know pagemaker and fonts and you
could pretend to be a desktop publisher
and actually make something nice and it
was kind of interesting because it felt
like you were catching up with the pros
well the pros have left us all in the
dust recently you try to use I mean our
own tools word or PowerPoint it's hard
to make something looks amazing and it's
not like somebody else has a better
option most of the other competitors to
office are actually less capable of
making something good and it's just
frustrating to try to make something
good and I'm for me one of the reasons
it gets me excited about building
software is I like to think about how
people feel while they're using it and I
personally have this feeling of like
inadequacy when i'm using authoring
tools today and I have this tension that
rises over time of the more time I put
into this it's going to get
incrementally better but it's a
diminishing returns and it's probably
not gonna look amazing at the end and
I'm gonna feel like I wasted all that
time so I'm not gonna actually put any
effort into it because I'm just gonna go
with the default because too much work
that's not a great feeling I'd rather
have a different feeling I was like this
is pretty amazing can I make it more
amazing and that's what we're trying to
do with suede starts out pretty good and
so and it's going to get better from
that point onward so gathering media is
really hard thing to do today I'll show
you how we do that in zwei just making
sure it's stuff looks good media audio
video and so on sir those feeds and
there's lots of stuff going on let me
just move on here been so here's sort of
the you know what we do in zwei and one
thing I really like super basic behavior
but any sort of picture you see here you
can tap and make it the focus of the
discussion so it's
automatically built in to sway that you
can sort of drill in for a little bit
more information or take a moment to set
things apart and talk about them so here
you know creating something new easily
add content and effortless design it's
kind of our value proposition just going
to pop back out of that and keep going
and you notice I'm using touch to
navigate we intentionally designed sway
to be great for touch for consumption
and for creation like I mentioned if
you're going to create something on a
phone and you want to look good at least
complex complex in a good way like there
is a lot of work and craft put into it
then you're not going to be futzing with
positioning of stuff you're going to
have to get some assists and so the idea
of sway as we start you out well
actually here's some samples maybe I'll
show you this in a second I'll show you
that how we start in a second here's a
great sway that I like someone made for
teaching basically quadratic functions
and it's actually a built-in sway I've
been better to sway with in its way some
people call this way ception but fold
the universe on top of itself but you
can embed sways with its ways when its
way is until your machine melts
basically but so what this is is this
way that and of course I can full screen
it if that makes it easier to see so
this is a somebody took a geogebra which
is a mess online tool for making graphs
and interactive experiences and one of
the nice things about oh there we go
oops sorry one of the nice things about
sway as I mentioned is that we don't
have to do all the fancy graphing
functions we just let you put in
geogebra and so this teacher decided to
make it interactive sway for doing a
lecture in their middle school class and
one of the things I like about this you
see their clipping ink cards I would
have probably OneNote actually s as an
aside for this group one of the ideas
were thinking about is just making it
easy to dash off hand written cards that
go into sway like this so you can sort
of build up a sort of set of note cards
or just annotations like that but here's
a so here's an actual embed of the
geogebra site and so you can say show
the graph and it's kind of fun feature
you can say give me a new
equation and you can ask the class what
do you think that's going to look like
whereas the turning point going to be
where's the axis of symmetry okay and so
on so all that it's not a sway feature
but the fact you can incorporate it in
your in your document or your
presentation or whatever its way is this
is one of the value props of sway so pop
out of that again here's another one
that I like a lot this is actually
showing a prototype of a future sway
type that we can make just right when
showing you now I'm showing you a
horizontally scrolling sway and then
when I just showed you as a vertically
scrolling sway and those are the two
that you can make today there's actually
many more types because the way sway
stores information is actually structure
we keep track of the order and the
relative importance of different items
and what you grouped together and so
that gives us if you know much about
information presentation it's sort of
the dream of people who do information
visualization that you get structured
data because now we can do stuff with it
so here's a different visualization
entirely where we've grouped pictures
with a group of information text and
images and I can now tap on any one of
these and flip it around and get the
text and images and so I can have now
random access to any of these objects
and you can certainly imagine something
more interesting than state flags of all
things but but you know now I can jump
right in and that sews ways are linear
they're partially nonlinear they're
fully nonlinear there's no limit to our
visualization capabilities just we have
to go build them they take a few
developers a few months to really polish
up each one we're going to come up with
a one more this summer there'll be one
more this fall possibly this one
actually but if you go to our website
we've actually got a sort of 3d
fly-through one maybe I'll even show you
that I think it might be here because
that one is pretty cool but the point is
that there's a once you have this
flexibility you don't have to go here
this here okay so let me show you this
red panda this is on our website if you
want to play with it these you can't
make today because there we just liked
them so much we're keeping them to
ourselves no there there
they're not fully baked they were done
as a sort of hackathon and so the thing
I'm about to show you was done in three
days built on top of the sway engine
it's not complete so it doesn't handle
all the navigation edge cases but this
is a you know a 3d version of a sway and
I can now go across the chapters of my
paper this is a 7th grade paper on red
pandas and I can drill in I'm just
tapping let me focus on that red panda
photo and it go behind and you know
sways taking care of the layout and the
animations the person who built this
didn't do anything with layout and
animations except approve try some
others approve they don't have to
manually do this now notice that's a
pretty different model than how pretty
much every other authoring tool out
there works and we're doing an
experiment with suede where we're trying
to figure out our hypothesis is that
most people Oh Andy our fathers is that
most people don't have a fixed idea in
their mind of what the output is but
they know good stuff when they see it
they have taste they don't have design
skills and what the current tools do is
they all force us to have as I skills
and then you have that emotional
experience that I talked about earlier
of just feeling inadequate who here
thinks they use more than ten percent of
the features of word or PowerPoint yes
sir you get a prize okay I mean you just
feel overwhelmed I mean I love those
products but they're so powerful in the
way they have devolved was that somebody
wanted this feature so it got put in
there and so everybody uses a different
slice of the product but you always feel
like there's so much control it's both
power which I guess means value but i
but I it's a different feelings of the
feeling I want to have I want to have
the feeling of competence and success so
let's go back to this for a second so
you'll see actually yours a this is
actually an academic oh that's a an
academic paper I don't have time to do
all that so i'm going to show you can go
look at these ways online some of them
so i'm going to show you a bit about how
you build a sway and i'm gonna go to my
sways think i am here we go
so it's actually my personal sway
account there's a whole bunch of stuff
going on here I'm going to make a new
one for us you can also start from a
PowerPoint a word or even a PDF for word
and powerpoint will actually extract the
objects the pictures the text blocks and
so on and will convert them into sway
for PDF we run our magical PDF to word
converter and then we pull that into
sway so you can actually unpack a fixed
format PDF and turn it into a dynamic
interactive sway so I'm going to create
one and show you a bit about how this
works so we actually have I mentioned
sways like a toddler I don't have time
to tell you all the dreams we have for
what's way could be but I'm going to
show you a little bit of what it does
today and just have to bear with me so
what you're seeing right here is on the
in the middle as the storyline and the
storyline is kind of the raw version of
your sway in fact some people say it's
the thing that lets them focus on their
content what they're trying to say it's
just text and media and the order and
the grouping it's all the structure of
it you don't worry about formatting at
this stage you just put things in here
so let's say I want to write about Tesla
that's pretty cool and I'd like to add a
picture to sway here well you have over
this side is a open I have network here
might take a second well there we go so
what we've done is we've analyzed what
you're writing about and we're trying to
figure out what do you what are you
doing Tesla what are tight what is Tesla
could be Nikola Tesla famous Serbian
could be Tesla Motors it could be things
related to Tesla Tesla coils maybe Elon
Musk you know there's different concepts
and ideas we use a lot of bing
technology for this to try to give you
stuff that's probably related to what
you're writing about let's say and
you'll notice by the way if I go over
here and type Tesla Motors what will
happen is in a second it'll say oh
you've disambiguated that for me now I
know you're actually writing about the
car company and you'll get information
so here I get elon musk which is
actually kind of cool because I want to
talk about the founder or what
further than mean I mean guys so I'm
just going to drag that in and what you
notice is behind if I dismiss this
storyline I'm starting to construct this
way now I didn't actually do anything to
control this formatting okay but I
really don't need to worry about what
it's looking like right now I'm going to
go back over to the storyline and I'm
going to go ad a piece of content i
might add some text here this is my sway
now one thing about the text editor is
you might say well okay where's the font
and size and bold and italic and
underline and subscript and superscript
and colored underline and strike through
and double strike through small caps who
wants to deal with that stuff so what
instead what you do in sway is you say
this word is important so I'm going to
emphasize it may be Tesla Motors I'll
emphasize that one just to show you what
that's like and I'll take the word this
here and I'm going to accent it so what
I've done now you see in storyline we
represent that as bold and italic but in
this way itself you see what's happening
is it's just picking up and saying well
you've told us that text should stand
out so what we're going to do is we're
going to make it stand out according to
the rules of the design of this way that
you're using right now if I don't like
those I can just hit the remix button
and what you'll see is a different way
to treat that now you might say oh just
style sheets that's easy yeah a little
bit like style sheets but there's
actually more going on behind this we're
able to and this is this feature will
actually gets smarter over time right
now it's fairly rudimentary it does use
our design rules engine but it's um it
will eventually examine the stroke what
you've got in your sway and say you have
a lot of photos we're going to pick a
layout that really works well with
photos or you've got a ton of texts in a
little bit of photos so we're going to
try a different layout for that for now
though it's mostly a browser or the
capabilities of the app and they see
here now it's chosen to use I don't have
enough content but it's a sideways
layout and still the emphasized text is
picking up the colors so let me put in a
couple more things and you can sort of
get a sense of how this looks oh so it's
suggesting stuff about test
the motors so videos from YouTube
pictures from the internet tweets and so
on there's going to be more and more
stuff flickers going to show up here
shortly Wikipedia is going to show up
here shortly so some people go ooh
you're just basically plagiarizing
everything that could be a reaction you
have to be a reasonable reaction so
however we're also doing like if you
think about if you're outside of
academia that's what everybody does all
the time because you try to get the work
done they don't really care about the
originality of the work and so we're
just accelerating what people naturally
do yeah I hear you so the the other
thing that's interesting though is when
I grabbed this once Wikipedia shows up
for example it comes automatically with
its citation so you don't have to it's
hard to rip off the internet using sway
it's not as hard as it is going to the
browser and copying will always keep the
source of the images or text buried in
the emitted eight and actually it will
show up if I keep going with this demo
you just have to go say examine this
object and it'll say this is taken from
this article or whatever so eventually
will actually generate the endnotes
bibliographies citation set
automatically for this way as well let's
just grab a bunch of pictures for a
moment and i'm going to add those as a
group and i'm going to actually choose
this button here which says how do you
want to view this group of pictures
actually before i do that i'll show you
what happened so it gave a pretty
interesting layout of these images
according to the particular style i'm
using right now now if i go back and
select that group of save change the
group type i could choose to view them
as a stack and that's how easy it is to
get an interactive pile of pictures
right okay that's kind of neat change
the group type again i like to have that
as a grid so you're really dealing with
these sort of more like how you want to
interact constructs rather than imagine
like dragging everything in the right
place and then thinking about how it's
going to work on a phone and just blow
your mind right so we'll take care of
this in fact I didn't show you that i'm
going to show you what this might look
like on a phone
and you'll see we've actually already
formatted it for the different layout of
the phone everything's been resized re
stacked the grid is not some fixed you
know to buy to whatever we did a 1 by 4
because it fits the space better in fact
we can go even farther into that and say
i give this no space back here so let's
say too many pictures of Elon Musk here
but anyway so um I like this is
interesting picture but I don't maybe
like the way it's cropped so much so I'm
going to go in here and i'm going to
show you now really the essence of house
way works yes we could probably do a
manual crop but how are you going to
deal with that way in the different
layout orientations that's kind of a
old-school way of thinking about
cropping images the new way to think
about it is what's important in this
image in fact you get some examples at
the bottom you know when we do a long
flat crop for style reasons it's going
to look like that on a phone it might
look like that now i'm just going to tap
this guy's face and he's going to become
the center of the photo he's the thing
that matters but maybe I also want to I
don't know the back of this chair here
down in the corner you notice what this
cropping engine is going to try to do
now is it's going to try to fit in the
parts that you said were important and
in every layout that this way will end
up in its going to do its best to keep
the parts that you really care about in
view and we do that instead of a hard
crop because that's just not going to
work in so many cases so you kind of get
the sense of what we're trying to do in
sway here is we call this the
intentional interface I also call it
what you get is what you want instead of
what you see is what you get what you
get is what you want means i'm getting
the things that I tell it I want I'm
saying keep these things together I'm
saying emphasize this object I mean I
don't want to have to decide all the
pieces of formatting order to get that
output so I could keep going but I think
I'm gonna run out of time and I want to
take some questions so are there any
thoughts about sway or questions you
have for me about anything yeah Oh
um yes here oh yeah of course I didn't
actually show one quick thing i'll show
you then i didn't show you the whole
feature you can do insert from your
local machine one drive one note youtube
anywhere you like there's a whole bunch
of services and it's growing your own
pictures from from online services or
your hard drive yes for sure yes in the
very back in the search function can you
constrain it to search for example for
only creative commons or copyright free
or images that are able to be modified
without permission you probably can't
read this search results are images
tagged with Creative Commons licenses
click here to clear that if you really
want to take your own risks that's okay
yes you can filter to Creative Commons
and then sorry what the second part was
able to be modified without permission
right there's a depending on the source
we do or don't have to do that so some
sources or images are available and
we're actually working right now to
figure out can we get access to large
libraries that are just free and clear
and you don't have to do anything with
it in the meantime the shortcut we took
is this is a Creative Commons tag so
yeah yes one of the things I've noticed
recently I've done a few presentations
playing with this um I think of my
presentations differently in PowerPoint
I always felt like I had to go through
every single part of it but when im
using sway i can put more content than I
need and for the audience I'm working
with or the students that you're working
with you can really just choose what you
want to without feeling like you're
skipping over things yeah exactly yes
actually it's that non-linearity and
freedom is part of what we're trying to
make pop out of this and I showed you
that red panda thing right that's just
one of many typologies of information we
could use some of them a lot of stories
and presentations need a strong
linearity but what they like is the
ability to temporarily divert and come
back on to it so we want to enable that
pure linear and random access and
everything in between
yes this automatically save it is
automatically saved to the cloud and
every sway has its own URL okay I know
if I'm doing this my class my students
gonna say well it didn't automatically
say you know it does automatically save
and from any sway you can share it it
defaults in the consumer version it
defaults to saying if you've got the
link you can see this way you can lock
it down to just yourself if you really
want to keep it private or you can
actually make it submit to search
engines which with this top option when
we enable it for office 365 which is our
institutional offering then you'll be
able to lock it down to your institution
as well hey after over here yeah okay
yes what about offline access what about
offline um coming real soon we actually
have an iphone app right now i should
say we're gonna have native apps for
Windows Windows Phone Android someday
iphone ipad we have iphone already with
when we get a chance to do it which is
very soon we'll start to have offline
using the native apps but not glue web
browser yes here first row or second
round does it support a peer
collaborative editing it's going to be
perfect for peer discussion and great
presentation proposed in classroom yeah
so we support co-authoring currently up
to 10 authors at the same time in the
same session we can we'll raise that
number probably over time but you can
just click this and you get an edit link
and you send that to other people and
then they they'll have access to that
sway and they can author without any
problem that part is not super developed
right now you can see that somebody is
typing here and you get their initials
but we don't currently do the full like
record everything in color code who
wrote what it's just so you can see that
mike is here and her oh she's over here
just so you know what's going on but
it's it's pretty basic but it works for
all the normal scenarios we're still we
still 10
a preview so I use that as an excuse for
why everything isn't finished yet hi um
I just wanted to know if there's another
any other way to integrate this with
blackboard other than copying the URL
and posting it directly and the same
thing with mix in terms of trying to
take advantage of the LMS systems that
many of us have yeah so we're currently
looking into that we need to go
understand what all the different hookup
systems are and we're really looking for
the magical like connector that we just
connect to and then everybody works with
us rather than having to do one off for
everything but we're sort of in progress
right now but yes it'll come yeah okay
