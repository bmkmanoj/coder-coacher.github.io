you
alright so I sent people out to purchase
gifts lily is apparently evaluating
their quality now and we had some people
who took the approach of getting a
lovely item that any of us might like to
receive and then and then there were
some other approaches um that I'm not
sure I completely understand right so so
here's what I'm going to suggest i'm
going to make Lily sit down and I am
going to put the microphone down right
by all these gifts and people can come
up I am NOT going to call on you you're
going to have to push or shove people
out of the way if necessary you can pick
one or a combination of things and
identify who it is you want to give it
to and why it is you want to give that
gift to them give the gift and then put
the microphone back down and let
somebody else take a turn at it and I am
now going to get out of the way so I
want my understanding is that these are
gifts and thanks it's that right okay so
so let's see if I get this right but I
wanted to thank Millicent because I have
been extremely skeptical about language
about the pier economy I have often
approached this instead of thought that
this is basically a lot of arm waving to
cover a very venture capital rich space
but I was persuaded that there actually
is some common ground between movements
I really care about like the labor
movement and the housing movement and
this movement and so to thank you for
persuading me of this I wanted to give
you a thick stack of Benjamin's in the
hope that you can bring them to work
it's wonderful to meet you thanks for
being here with us
I think that none of us could ever
imagine how much work it took to put all
this together and for her unbelievable
support and hard work I think we need to
give her some support so this is the
helping hands bra that we want to give
tool is for your for your unending
support
I i would like to thank Steve because
firstly he he really reminded us that
being friendly was important and the
quote that i think i'm going to put the
bottom of my signature is um i was able
to reverse a national trend just by
being friendly and i think that that
really is what this whole group is about
as well not being competitive but being
friendly and for you I think so I want
to thank some of it for something that
didn't happen today when I was 15 years
old I didn't want to study chemistry I
was home educated I said to my mom I'm
not going to study chemistry I want to
do more computing she hauled me into the
local universities computer science
department and got their chair to say if
you care about being a good programmer
you should study other topics because
computing teaches us about the rest of
the world and it lets us explore the
rest of the world and then he handed me
a copy of Steven Livi's hackers and I
want to thank you for that
so my thank you goes to clys for talking
at the back of oh maybe I need the mic
ok so my whoa my thank you goes to Clive
for performing last night and I really
love these moments when people who I
value tremendously as professionals in
one field show that they can be really
super awesome and other creative
pursuits that are their side hustles so
I thought it was great and thank you for
doing that so I want to thank Andres for
helping me identify my community after
last night apparently i also am a asrm
ER ASMR I put Alan Watson tick no hun on
every night to make me fall asleep where
I can barely hear them not for naught
because I get off on it it's to relax so
I know there's one of the presents ya
know Elmo I think this one's to be more
appropriate is a journal called my
dysfunctions a journal for chronicling
my immeasurably fascinating to sanctions
nurses and emotions
no no what's on here or should they come
and look or should I hold him up they
should all just come here look okay so I
wanted to thank Sylvia both for today
she was an awesome co-presenter because
i'm currently in a headspace where I'm
only thinking about the details of my
project and I really needed her to make
sense out of the stuff that I'm doing
the scene that I'm in participating in
but actually i also really want to thank
her for something she did much earlier
which was that I think in April last
year we were at this maker carnival in
Beijing and she was like oh hey man I
heard of this program in shen jen that
might be a really cool thing for you to
participate in and is actually the
reason that I applied to high
accelerator and the original reason why
there's like any reason to invite me to
this in the first place so I feel like
Sylvia needs this uh bunny mask
I see something fuzzy here and we all
know who likes fuzzy stuff fuzzy hat and
this gift is for Dana Dana I want to
thank her for inviting me to the first
version of this symposium and more
broadly for opening a lot of
opportunities for me in the past years
since I met her and being a mentor for
the past year so thank you Lena I'm just
counting from here there's at least
seven wonderful gifts coming up and I
think there's at least seven grateful
people in this audience so let's see
some gratitude
where did you go Trisha so I wanna give
this to Trisha because this represents
in part what bunny was talking about
today always looking for new and
creative ways that people are playing
with in very unexpected corners of this
world and this is what Fisher represents
for me this is what she's always been
doing together with me during our tours
in China or elsewhere in California and
we were on desperate search today to
find the skull that bonnie was holding
up in the shape of her shangela phone
and Trisha was actually the first one
who also introduced me to Shanghai
phones before I began to think about
them as a form of innovation in China
and I want to thank her for that
so I'll be doing this guy here so I was
very excited this is my first time
coming to the this symposium I want to
thank everyone for the invitation but I
was I was expecting this would be very
much centered around social computing
and as I can see myself as that but a
lot of our conversations here around
meals and so on we're very much not
about sort of computing or computing
systems or things like that but we had
some very sort of engaging talks around
food and it was it was a surprising and
sort of exciting for me to sort of be
able to break out of my sort of mike
closeted identity is like a social
historian and be able to engage in some
of these conversations around other
things in this society around us that
are important and I especially like
Brian the other Brian with the beards
talk about the chickens and the social
history of recipes and things like that
and so it was very illuminating to me
that you were able to sort of bridge
these sorts of different things and
provided sort of very convincing thing
so I want you can have this chicken so I
went and yay I went and dragged George
Agudelo out of his office because I want
to give a gift to him I I think very few
people know how much work George does to
make this happen work before we get here
work while we're here and
every time somebody says to me you did
such an amazing job of organizing it
it's almost always because of something
wonderful that George or the tech people
or the MSR admins have done and I want
them to know how much they appreciated
there's somebody want to thank you
already got a gift and then somebody
else andreas for and writing me I they
first heard about the symposium like
other people have said it was like I
don't know anything about computers this
is going to be weird ah but and this
community has been incredibly warm and
inviting and open and really inspiring
but my first friend that I made when I
came here was actually Lizzie who with
her warmth and just welcoming and saying
hey it's okay I did it and it was great
and this is a really wonderful community
really helped inspire me to open myself
up more so the whole community has
really helped me take a good drink of
water and be feel refreshed but it was
really nice to meet you so thanks
so I'd like to thank eaten for something
he's done two years ago when I met him
and I think he's introduced me to the
Civic space and to thinking about impact
beyond the computer science and the
tools that I was thinking about and he's
been an inspiration for me and I wanted
to thank you for that
I once met in a very random way a guy
from bosnia and he said I have a Mexican
friend called David sasaki and then I
made an Argentinean guy in a random bar
in Buenos Aires and he said I have a
Mexican friend called David sasaki and
the same thing has happened in chile in
colombia and everywhere everybody
everywhere I go so to the best and most
famous Mexican for more gifts including
a totally awesome set of butterfly wings
so there's someone in this room who
needs a set of butterfly wings this is
your opportunity to come up with
something
so last year I was here and I'm I try to
make it every year here because this is
a fantastic conference and Liz and Lily
and every one day and everyone who does
it and you know Georgia hosting us does
a terrific job we can't thank him enough
I overheard last year you know Ethan
talking you know and he was talking
about something expounding and he just
said well you know algorithm is really
are a kind of politics and then actually
square with something that i was like
thinking was going to write night you
know included luggage like the thing
I've excited in things like that and
it's just like one example of all the
fantastic things you here and connect
with here and you know Ethan my budding
Berkshire friend you know you get the
butterfly wings I will have you know
there's a four year old that has had his
eye on these butterfly wings he's not
here in the room but I know that he
wants awesome and there's still some
luck sorry I'm plotting while I look for
the appropriate gift well anyway I'll
keep it simple I think I'm I'm gonna
give one gift to one person but there's
actually a larger group of people that
this gift could apply to some of whom
are in this room and that is that there
are a lot of you in particular among the
faces I can see now I can think of Ethan
and Elizabeth and Dana and Brian and
Kareem who you know as a young academic
I've n Gina as well actually now I see
your face um as a young academic it's
kind of a fun filled because you often
get you meet people first through their
ideas and only later on do you get to
know them face to face an in person and
to develop relationships with them and
it's this wonderful thing where as
academics you get to sort of meet your
heroes or the people who have inspired
you with their thinking and giving you
tools to sort of understand the world in
a deeper way another person who's been
here during this meeting is
part of that group for me is clay but
he's gone he's on a plane somewhere
probably and so the story that
encapsulates this and the person I'll
give the gift to is the first it was the
first thing that somebody said to me
when I got here which was I walked out
of a room and somebody got off the
elevator and they said finally and I had
to hello who are you you know and it was
it was Korean actually and this is in
part because we've been sort of having a
conversation through our research for
about five years now or I you know it
started off with me reading some of her
work and citing it and it's just really
wonderful to be able to make those
conversations take them off of pages and
bring them into real life and so thank
you korean for continuing that process
as part of this event so so instead of
instead of paying you in the usual
academic currency of citations i will
also give you a fat stack of Benjamin's
for your
I don't you and yo hire both stronger
and larger men than I why is one of them
gifts hello my name is douchebag I'm not
going to give that gift I'm actually
going to give a gift to someone who
might not know that I know who that
person is but in 2009 I was in Zagreb
Croatia which is a really cool City I
didn't know as a cool city and I was
there for an event but then there was a
separate set of talks and rarely do I go
to a separate set of talks because my
life is kind of attending conferences
and talks and I listen to dozens maybe
hundreds of them a year and maybe five
percent of those talks kind of stay with
me and make me think about things this
talk has stayed with me ever since it
was kind of a journey towards self
actualization there was a level of
personal transparency in the talk that
just really made me think about my life
and where I'm going and why I am the
certain type of way and it was Makos
talk in in Zagreb I was there in the
audience I didn't ask any questions or
anything like that it was I think was a
revealing errors talk it was a very very
personal talk but but it was really
inspirational to me so thank you
I was a resident here in 2010 four years
ago when the social computing supposing
was happening so I kind of peeked into
all the sessions one of the little perks
but I wasn't really a part of it so it
feels really really nice to be here as
part of the symposium it's a wonderful
feeling so I want to really thank Amanda
for inviting me without even knowing
that I went to Japan that I was a
resident but also okay well that works
but also for like being a part of
something incredible like this like soft
diplomacy that's happening through
something like accelerator it's been a
pleasure just watching like all these
projects come through in such like
wonderful like they all come through and
like this like wonderful way of just
saying yeah we make stuff in China it's
all local anywhere it's so thank you
very much oh and it's a wallet that says
happy girls are the prettiest
I'm maybe I really didn't bother giving
anyone I think because there are too
many people that I'm grateful to in here
and it kind of felt like I was excluding
all the others and I'm Todd would stop
being an idiot always that effect so I
think it's always gonna get a stack of
cash um yeah this there's I find events
like this that part of it is about that
what I get from it is defining my tribe
and finding people how I go I want to be
like you I have I was told if you feel
about this I have a column in tweetdeck
that's just headed it's a list and it
just had it when I grow up and it's the
people that I want to be like and so I
come to these things and I hear people
say things and use words in ways that I
want to use words like that i want to
say things like that and so so these
could easily have gone I mean Kate's
talk did that and and all of Gina's
interventions did that and and an has a
way of summing up things at the end of
the end of almost every session we had
the chap SAT there and it would could of
like okay she's made it into it but
there were five minutes at the beginning
of the first breakout session when Evan
just summarized where where that talk
was going and I SAT that open mouth and
like connect that recording that cuz I
want to learn that word for word so for
words that helped me to understand the
world
there there is a lovely pink geek cup
there is hello my name is douchebag and
there are the eat mints I would
actually like to point out that both of
these are made by a fine company called
blue cue headquartered in my hometown at
Pittsfield Massachusetts there are not a
lot of companies headquartered in
Pittsfield Massachusetts these are
lovely gifts that you can give to your
friends particularly if you want them to
be pissed off at you so there are three
left so I'm going to leave these up here
and we will figure out where they go
later but i think we are running out of
energy for the day and people need some
recharging time between now and dinner
so I want to say as usual thank you too
Lily because this wouldn't happen if it
weren't for Lily
and and to the tech guys both the both
Rob from NYU who made sure that all of
our stuff worked and our guys from MSR
who have been recording all of this so
that it can be shared after the event
it's a lot of work to keep track of all
of our technology and all of our moving
around and so so thank you to all of
them for for all of the work that they
did thank you to all of the people who
helped to organize sessions because you
know as wonderful as you all are you're
really hard to manage all of you and and
and the only way this happens is by my
having this group of people who worked
to make it all come together somebody
said to me on the first night you know
how nice it was that every year we bring
this tribe together and I said you know
that's actually not what we're doing
because remember when when we first got
here and I said how many of you are here
for the first time and about half the
hands went up hey this is not bringing
the tribe together that already exists
this is expanding the tribe this is
finding new members and and bringing
them in and helping people discover
connections so I hope that everybody
here had a chance to make a connection
with somebody they didn't know was part
of their tribe while they were here and
and I am delighted that you were all a
part of this this is the hardest and the
most rewarding thing that I do every
year and I am so grateful for all of you
I can't give you all a gift other than
than to say thank you and I am looking
forward to seeing many of you at dinner
at seven one other thing many of you
have not yet picked up your fleece from
from the desk it would be lovely if you
did that so that the admins don't have
to carry them all back with them so if
you didn't get yours if you could pick
it up that would be great and I will see
a lot of you at dinner and thank you so
much
