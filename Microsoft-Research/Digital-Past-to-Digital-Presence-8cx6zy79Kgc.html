Research in cambridge and I can manage
the social additional systems group
we're interested in exploring new
experiences with digital content and
currently here we're exploring I can
export digital content and new playful
ways as well as ways that let you go
into the past so here this is an
application that allows you to play with
photos and new ways and these buttons or
icons waltz pips and you can search for
pictures because they're green or
because they're red or because they're
both or you might search them because of
their face like if you want to create a
new button you can drag an object out
and make that the Select criteria we
have a device called wave which is about
messaging from the kitchen between
families getting kids involved in a bit
more playful than normal messaging it
allows you to send scolding notes where
you can say okay and be more evocative
and emotional you can send that it also
allows you to take photographs one of
the things we found when we trial this
and did some research was the kids and
parents really like to be able to use
photographs and do this they make
annotations and say things like this on
the message and that message is actually
what sent and received me sent as an
email can't do it here because we're
inside the building and that's what I
arrived as an HTML object so it's very
playful and emotional here's an example
the kinds of things that kids do with it
and they really enjoy using this more
evocative emotional way one of the
problems have also been addressing is
how to get people involved in the
digital world who don't really want to
get involved like grandparents so advice
a thing called cell frame which is
basically a kind of mobile phone us at
smartphone device which allows members
of a family like my family to post
content to my grandmother and we do that
we're having our own home book is
recording at home which lucky on family
web book and when you post content to it
if you wish you can select content and
you can drag it to this icon and it sent
automatically to the grandmother and
this might sit on her mantel piece if
she wants to comment back she can touch
this and create a responding message or
she can scroll through the messages and
that's the last of the demos we wanted
to show here in this sweet techfest a
representative some of the work we're
doing the sochi additional systems group</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
