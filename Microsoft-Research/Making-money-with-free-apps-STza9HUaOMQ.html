hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
so evening everyone my name is Jeff
Karev and I'm part of the subphase creo
handling the speakers and tonight's
topic is the ads I'm sure all of you
that have developed ads here for at
least considered the the ad-supported
version of those apps car would tonight
speaker will talk about the ads he has
about 20 or so apps published in the
marketplace free or paid and he's going
to share the experience that he has
without food or Joe karwa hi thanks
everyone for showing up this pretty big
crowd so I'm excited um see everyone
here I guess people want to make some
money so that's that's good um the way
I'm going to do it is sort of tell my
story over the past year or so as a
windows phone 7 developer on the highs
and the lows and along the way if you
have questions about certain things um
feel free to interrupt me wait wave your
hands whatever it takes and I'll try to
answer them on so I'll just uh get
started so originally when I started
developing apps I would I person oops
sorry about that I personally was just
felt ads were really distracting I
didn't want to junk up my apps with ads
and I thought they just took up way too
much screen real estate on such a little
device and you know overall they just
suck but my dilemma was I was making
some apps that you know we're fun for me
to get familiar with the phone learn how
to use the accelerometer in like for me
I was like well who's actually gonna
spend a dollar for this so I'll put it
out there for free and you know just
give away my code and maybe I'll put it
out there for a dollar as well and you
know someone will accidentally buy it it
turns out people did buy it which was
the biggest surprise for me but you know
not many so
um why I changed my mind i think it was
december like right after the windows
phones released I heard Angry Birds was
making over a million a month on
advertisement so that just really
shocked me and I heard now it's probably
more like 20 million and it seems the
work for that company Google they give
away home the stall their stuff for free
and use ads so I figured what the heck I
added a little ad at the bottom of this
you didn't really take away too much
from this exciting app but you know I
figured I'd give it a try first made
like a couple cents a day and then next
day ten cents twenty cents and went home
one day from work was like what the heck
I've made a dollar on ads like how many
people are viewing this it was just
really confusing to me um like they just
sit there for hours like shaking the
phone up and down or uh uh okay but hey
whatever on but I really started to
think like what would a good app
actually make like what could I do if I
you know spent more than a few hours
making an app to actually engage someone
on so a month later I kicked out a bunch
of other free apps so have a fortune
cookie app where you could shake your
phone it gives you a fortune and the
dice same thing i was really liking the
playing with accelerometer and actually
the one that really sort of got me
excited was my shotgun app that one was
actually fun for for me to play with and
we would use it at scrum and you know
she whose turn it is to talk and shoot
each other and um you know every one of
my teams running around shooting each
other so it was a fun app for me um in
you know sirens and things that probably
drive their parents crazy when you hear
the kids running around the house with a
loud annoying siren um so everything was
good you know I was actually starting to
make you know some money it was exciting
and a fun journey on the common question
everyone was asking me is you know what
should i do should I give a free app or
a paid
um you know what is the right thing to
do and I didn't know myself so i figured
i would have a test release the same
exact app with a different name
different icon and you know see which
one makes more money so for me it was
guns and guns pro in free one by a huge
factor um and it still continues to this
day just blow away the paid version on
and maybe that's not fair comparison
because you know why pay for something
if you get free hold on one second i
need to share the content i guess i got
kicked off the link and lied presenter
well there's this link that someone just
shared so if you're online you might be
able to get to it sorry about that
so free winsome but yeah when you say it
won by free by a huge amount was that
the number of installs or oh no no
that's that's revenue um so I currently
I probably make more each day than I do
in a month of people buying the apps and
that's sort of across the board it but
you know it's it may not be the best
test because it it actually is I mean
people may realize there's a free and a
pro and they are the same thing I don't
know um but for me it's it's definitely
worth giving it away because I think of
myself to which apps do i put on my
phone which apps do i download and I
epicly by that or goodbye i download the
free ones a lot more than I would go out
and buy a bunch of paid apps and that's
going to vary for the type of your app
probably not all apps should be free but
anyways it wasn't all good so before I
get into the details here the one thing
with ads is ecpm so if you're not
familiar with it the easiest way to
explain it is how much you get paid for
a thousand impressions on that's a
thousand people just viewing that they
don't have to click on it it's just
views um it's very volatile so this is
one day on and for whatever reason it I
call it a roller coaster and some days
it's really low in some days it's really
high in every once in a while it just
drops off and this was back in March
last year it dropped from make like
eight dollars per thousand views down to
ten cents for a thousand views so it was
really crushing at first when this
happened though is just you know
devastated to see like oh now no longer
making money set by some higher up
somewhere
was just fun so this was just my appt
the ecpm that I was getting and it
varies by app I could have the same
exact apps with two different add
controls and I no one really knows the
the details of how it works but people
will bid on to put an ad space in so
sometimes the bids are high sometimes
it's low so for this one it could be
that you know groupon or whoever's
buying ad space at that time says I
don't want to advertise it all in
between two and three a.m. in the
morning and six and seven and night I I
don't know why it's so fluctuates like
that but it does so you got to be
prepared for it on and and this was one
that got a lot of people in uproar
because this wasn't just me this was
pretty much everyone across the board
who was using ads at the time so for me
I said now what do I just give up there
on the towel or I figured I'd try
giggles AdMob because there are
competitors so you know it's good to
check that out and see what's there so
for me I figured I'd try with one app
and what I needed to do was download
their software and like all Google
software when it comes out its beta
upgrade my apps on submit the app store
certification wait a couple days require
all my users to go and download and
cross my fingers that Google's eCPM was
higher so this was you know bed I had no
idea if it would work in sweet I'm
making money again it might eCPM slowly
rose to two dollars and four cents which
I was happy with but it was still a pain
for me to do this and what happens if
Microsoft started to pay four dollars
and I had to have all my users download
the app and upgrade again um but the one
thing I did learn from Google's is they
have some very nice reports and one of
the columns they had was fill rate what
I learned is ads don't always fill so
for a lot of times people reviewing my
apps
that control says go get the next ad and
it returns and says there's nothing um
so for for Google as low as sixty four
percent so I was thinking wow that's
that's a waste like you know I was
actually getting less impressions than I
could so what could I fill in that space
with and for me the common thing that
you know I wanted to do was advertised
my other apps people always say well you
know how do I get noticed or how do
people find my app in the App Store well
I was lucky enough to already have some
apps being viewed a lot of times each
day so I wanted to advertise my new app
in my existing apps don't so I just
stopped for a moment and there was a
problem I wanted to solve I needed
something that I could switch my ad from
google to microsoft on the fly without
needing to update on my apps go through
that work and require my users to update
I also wanted to have the ability to say
fifty percent of the time show people
advertisements for my brand new app that
I just put out there or to you know some
of my existence my existing paid apps
well it's very common for me and my free
version to put an ad to say by the paid
version or by you know my expensive 999
app and I wanted to just be able to do
all this on the fly and that was the key
thing to me so this is all I implemented
it people can implement it in different
ways I wrote my own ad control so this
is the Silverlight zamel and what people
you just have to do is you have all your
different IDs that the ad companies give
you and you just enter them in there in
my web page takes care of everything
else so the way it works the app loads
and it uses what I have is the default
add provider it calls up to my server in
asynchronously gets the data about what
the settings should be in the few
your times people load the app and then
it stores that on the phone and isolated
storage so the next time they load it it
says it's anything and storage if so use
those settings and make a request out
and see if anything has changed since
last time my phone home basically and
his dresser um so I originally just did
this really fast on on a weekend so I
did the easiest thing I knew how which
was godaddy because I had existing
websites there I since got an azure
account and I'm want to move it over to
Azure I haven't yet but for me I think
it probably gets like 60 thousand hits a
day so it's probably peaks and valleys
there but it seems to do fine and it was
also really important for me when I was
developing this to make it good enough
that even if there was no network
connection or things fell apart I didn't
want my control to be causing my apps to
crash so that's really where I spent
most of my time um but it eventually I
plan to move it over onto my Azure
instance and I could use the CDN to cash
and have better performance there so
i'll actually switch over to a demo if
the demo gods allowed on so these are
what I call the house ads so I could
create one this is just text of for my
app and I just have some basic
information so the number of impressions
for the ad and the clicks so this is
actually people they see the ad and they
click on it the most impressive thing
here to me was the click-through rates
that I have are remarkable so in my guns
app I will advertise the guns pro which
is the same thing and I've a
click-through rate of fifteen percent
almost which is great I don't know how
many of those people will actually buy
it once they see it's the same thing the
idea was eventually that really
will be a pro version with you know all
the great features that I never have
time to implement on and if I click on
my ads I can to show you an existing one
so I have my quote of the day and I
could say in the United States use
Google's or I could switch it to pub
center and in other countries use pub
center and I can adjust my percentage of
how much time or how many what
percentage of the time to show my ads so
if I come out with a brand new app and I
want people to find it I'll just crank
all these up to a hundred percent and
you know everyone will see my next big
app that comes out but as I do this I
realize well then I'm not going to get
paid that day so it's the decision you
have to make what's more important to
you so put screenshots in here just in
case that didn't work so now I just have
some like general tips so I tell
everyone to read reviews because they
really are your friend on there's a
little asterisks down there sometimes
you'll read a review and you'll get
really upset you know don't worry about
it I've got plenty of those but what you
can find in there is a lot of great
feedback and most importantly don't just
use your reviews use your competitors
reviews so I was making a news app for
the Drudge Report and what I did was
before I even started I looked at all
the reviews for all the iphone apps that
do the same thing and I saw what people
like what people don't like people were
very opinionated in what I got out of
that was there was actually a lot of
user saying why doesn't this person
offer a paid version I'd gladly pay a
dollar to remove that and I was just
like great yeah I could I could
definitely do that and you'll get a lot
out of that but don't get discouraged
when you get a few people saying nasty
things um the other thing I do is I put
I normally give all my apps a trial mode
which is basically the free
with ads inside of it so this is the
example in that Drudge Report app I have
a button to remove advertisements
because sure enough I had a lot of
people complaining I hate ads I hate ads
and so I was like well you hate him
enough give me 99 cents and you know
shut up so I don't know how many people
will actually they go through and they
pay it but there's a decent amount every
month of people that are actually buying
it so I don't know why or out which way
they get there but it happens so for me
that's that's good I I think so um I've
I've gotten enough people buying it to
say that it makes sense and for me if it
was an app that I used multiple times a
day to get that real estate back is may
be worth 99 cents and I think if you can
make an app that is worth 99 cents
that's a good way to sort of T someone
in like oh you like it you like it pay
me um number 99 cents why not were you
to any night um I've tried a bunch of
different prices but I find that a lot
of people are just really cheap
like I had big plans for my golf app I
spent countless hours on it working day
and night all summer before for Windows
Phone came out and someone came out with
14 199 I'm like it's going to charge ten
dollars from mine but that was an
interesting app for me because I
realized I tried different price ranges
and there's a lot of studies online
you'll find more for iPhone and Android
and Windows Phone but the study showed
that ninety-nine cents has a percentage
of people that will buy it somewhere
from 99 cents and above to three dollars
people view it as the same it's not a
99-cent app and above five dollars was
the same up until ten dollars and if
you're going to price it above ten
dollars you might as well make it thirty
because those are the people that just
really don't care um so you could play
around with all of it on the fly now
which is nice you Steph thi think update
your apps so you can go to the website
and try it expectations of support or
any demands being made from your day
users um a lot of my apps I'll have a
link for support where people can email
me um definitely choose a non email
address that you want to actually use
because I get probably 50 emails a day
that just say sent from Windows Phone in
every different language we have it's
it's pretty cool to see but then other
people will attach photos of their kids
for some reason send me those I get the
default backgrounds for the phone I
think people get into the email app and
they don't know what to do and they just
start clicking on buttons and eventually
they send me mail yeah everything of
your reviews
been about not liking hats and also
how's your experience with a headset um
the like the admob or Microsoft's um so
for me I will almost entirely use
Microsoft pub center I find that they
pay a lot better price than Google's
does I don't know I guess I want to ask
other people here because I want to get
this information for my missus myself
I've had a lot of attempts and often
I'll get zero or like Max twenty cents
eCPM whereas I'm Microsoft under a
dollar I've used bad personally um you
know I three four boxes is what I hope
for so I know some other people have
used these like what kind of ecpm is
people seeing and what did they view is
good if you don't want to share that's
fine yeah taking which categories of AD
you yeah I'll get into that does anyone
want to share their ecpm I just wonder
how much 11 dollar yeah I went mine for
like three days it's a
yeah and especially at first the eCPM
will be relatively low until you sort of
have a reputation you build up I think
this is what they told us at a talk they
gave before once they have history on a
nap then people will bid higher so if I
have a higher click rate more people
want to advertise in my app for whatever
reason and then they'll bid higher to be
in my particular app or me as a
publisher versus another publisher you
seeing what the accent used to be
continuously yeah so you said it's the
same I had repeated over and over and I
I see that as well yeah 223 yeah that's
pretty good that's what I hope for in
most of mine if I'm lucky it's for but
and it fluctuates daily yeah that's it's
an interesting line like um dad but it's
really like do you want to have a great
app or do you want to have it like if
you annoy people too much they're going
to stop using your app and then you're
not going to get any impressions yeah so
it is like I realized for some of mine
people probably accidentally clicking on
the ads because you know they're shaking
my phone and doing funny things with it
and that could be why some of them are
higher the ad team gave a presentation
on before and they talked about some of
this and if companies realize that
they're benefiting from your ads or your
app they will continue to invest in it
but if they see that they spent a
thousand dollars and they got nothing in
return then they'll stop bidding on you
as a publisher but it I mean a lot of my
apps have the buttons close and you know
eventually I gave up on that
find it made too much of a difference
for me if you think of it from the
advertiser in which anybody can
is that they will pay say for your
nonsense have happened for Alan you want
to see how many sales you get that from
and putting an ad next to London people
clicking and press back the advertiser
quickly realized that the organ half is
not bringing themselves and they will
bid much less so I mean it may increase
or CPM momentarily for a week or two
banana world
go down yeah and and up I'll get into in
a little bit i have a slide on input for
me like my shotgun a poor my guns app i
said what kind of ads would people want
to see for that you know i could show
them ads for flowers or she's shopping
are you know i'm not sure what other
funny examples i could have there but
for me i picked military hunting in my
eCPM was the highest it ever ever was
and it continued to grow and I think you
know from for me it was actually
interesting to click on this and go and
navigate this guy's website who was
paying all this money on he was selling
gun accessories and things so he was
probably seeing a benefit of advertising
on my app so therefore he continued to
invest I mean try to put yourself in
people's shoes I've tried to advertise
on various sites and if I found that it
wasn't worth my investment I stopped and
eventually the military start
advertising in my apps for a while and
they paid really high too so you know
sort of a circle of money coming to me
and back and but they stopped in my ecp
CPM just drop like I could tell that one
day I add the government advertising in
my app in the next day I didn't and it
dropped in half yeah
yeah so google pays i think more on
clicks if i remember correctly and
microsoft does pay on impression on but
i think it's the same same argument is
people will stop paying for the ads if
they're not finding benefit so people
are clicking on it and doing quick fraud
and stuff like that you know in the end
you may not continue to make money
depends on the category of that
like yeah I wish there was a good
science to to picking these categories
and what happens for me is I won't pay
attention for a while and I log back in
and realize how I eCPM fells at some
point I didn't even realize it then the
only thing I have to do is try a
different one in the case where the
military stopped advertising and I think
it was under careers / military was the
category I was picking no one else was
advertising there so i removed that
because it was a waste of a category for
me yeah probably
I so he was asking about how does the
the different locales and geography the
matter for your ads and I don't really
have any answers there eventually I my
plan was to change my ad control to
actually pass up the locale and see
which places are filling and which ones
aren't so I know you know potentially in
China we don't have any ads I have no
idea I think we just started you know
having apps for sale there so I don't
know if we have an ad presence there you
can actually very low severity very
important Oh create an ad unit report
you can check a market checkbox and then
you can see how many impressions what
seek after getting more market okay
let's say I didn't realize that we're
going I've heard that impressions are
really just a number
ok
let's get them out the lass
 you can see your scene camps and a
lot of markets are
yeah probably that probably means
there's no ads store click out it's also
why CPM skip move up and down or the day
or one reason when you're getting more
international traffic sand can
physically lower
yeah anymore us piranha capacity
is there a way to know that you're not
getting a nap so that you could just put
your house at it um yeah so the way I do
it is all the controls they report an
error when they don't feel so my control
I mean there's not much logic there I'm
like on that event I just fill in my own
ad and that that could fail because no
network connection and then I I'll still
throw out my house ad there in if people
try to go to the marketplace it may or
may not work depending on if they get
network connection or not um but yeah
it's it's easy to sort of hook up to
that event yeah well first of all my you
see cameras around two dollars to dollar
ISA cameras but my experience i'm
wondering to experience the to where my
actual seems to show a star irrelevant
to chemical
yeah so he said his ads are not really
what he's picking in in his categories
and I I've seen that too I think a
groupon for a while was appearing in all
my ads and I think they said any add
category show groupon I don't know maybe
they got a ton of money I viewing or
something just throwing it out there
yeah I guess it depends on who what they
want to advertise for but they're
probably picking the just advertised
everywhere so they're trying to say
so
could advertise
thank you
and do very well
so I'll try to move along these these
are great discussions that I want to
have but I also want to keep in mind
that if people aren't linked they may
not be able to hear our discussion we're
having here and that sort of stinks for
them when this is recorded you're able
to hear that because they have the room
microphone up and they turn up the
volume when people are talking so if
you're in the link call like you can
hear these discussions later we'll try
to keep some more towards the end
because this is actually beneficial to
me to hear what everyone else is saying
so hopefully that continues um so for
trials I I show the ads and trials this
is the code snippet that I used to do
that um this allows me to test the trial
mode which is important obviously in
what I do is I store this on when the
app loads and then my my view model of
my app binds to that so if it if trial
is set to true then i set the visibility
of my ads to true and the button to buy
or to go from trial to purchase I make
that but invisible so we talked a little
Hut about this that's good you guys sort
of float right into this I just didn't
keep up the other thing to think about
is to understand when people are using
your apps i found this particular one
interesting i did i just grabbed this
from TechCrunch there's a bunch of other
studies and charts of companies putting
out this data what's really interesting
to me was to see but after I saw it it
made sense people use their computers
when they're at work and when they get
home phones and tablets are just
starting to dominate so for my for my
particular apps I see a lot of them have
high use Friday and Saturday night I
think it's the bar crowd out there with
their friends you know and having fun
with my apps so if I could choose maybe
I would choose you know Budweiser to
advertise in my app so I try to think
about this um I probably wouldn't want
to advertise starbucks coffee for people
using my apt and then
the night but my news app I realized
people are probably waking up in the
morning like I do in reading the news so
that might help me choose my category um
so I got this question just earlier
today how do you manage having two
versions of the app and originally I was
doing a lot of file copying around and
commenting things out and remembering to
remove comments when I submit the
different version which was a pain for
me and actually error-prone I've before
I have submitted paid apps with
advertisements in them and quickly had
to revert that and then I started to use
git which is a free foul or source
control management system it's very
popular out there if you haven't used it
it's pretty easy to use in I create two
branches in my code one branch has the
free parts of the app I'm sorry was it
linked failed again
I'm not sure what can be done for that
sure that's out there you go great oh
come on
or close to the end so don't worry so I
have two branches one for the free one
for the one for the paid-in it just
allows me to quickly switch in between
the two so all the codes the same except
for like ten lines in my app and if I'm
about to submit for free I actually even
that it comes with a visual studio
add-in well it's an extra add-on you can
download forget and I just in my
drop-down change from free to pro in it
on the fly just switches all the code
and then I can submit just recompiled
submit so that's actually very useful
for to me for me it took me forever to
bite the bullet and learn how to use get
but after a few hours i was i was loving
it um so the summary that what i have is
i realized maybe ads don't suck and in
fact I've grown to love them and
sometimes they're creepy when my phone
was showing me an advertisement for
asp.net controls and I'm like how do
they know I right web pages but it was
you know they're good for you if your
developer and try not to hate him too
much handle the case when your ads don't
fill because that could be the best way
to promote your other apps work if
you're nice your friends apps or your
web page or whatever you want to send
them to for me I'm thinking about other
things I could possibly do with my
impressions so from I have a friend who
has a clothing company and he has some
t-shirts that have you know guns on them
and thinks I'm like maybe we could
partner together I could get him traffic
on his website and he could pay me so I
handle those cases and prepare yourself
for the good and bad days I for month to
month the amount Microsoft deposits in
my bank account can be no exact numbers
but three times as much as the month
before and then it could drop back down
so and for me it's always like this
going to be the last month where I have
you know a nice big paycheck
at the end of the month or Z you know
it's going to end and upsell your your
your paid apps or your free apps to paid
apps because like I said there's people
that are clicking on that for me it's
surprising every time I see it and I
think that's all so if anyone has any
questions the one thing I did want to
mention that website I that the way that
I do this my original plan was to just
make it available to everyone because
for me it was a quality gate I make it
good enough to ship to the world and
then it would be good enough for mine I
don't want to do that until I switch it
over to my Azure instance and can scale
up and down if if love gets really high
but if you are interested in helping me
work on that like I'd gladly share the
code with whoever and try to make it
useful for more than myself and the good
news about it like this is going to be
useful for me in win8 when I make apps
for 18 because it's the same concepts
across the board iphone android you
these are problems that you should be
thinking about how you're going to solve
them so if you are interested talk to me
afterwards and maybe we can you know
partner up and do something so is there
other things questions people wanted to
talk about and gladly continue yeah you
have two copies of your apps where you
have the 13 and 18 with the trial it's
because you said you put a buzzing in
your apps to direct people to purchase
the app but I'm thinking that people are
more likely to download a free app that
I paid up with trial mode yeah God is
help you I I always tried to make my
appt appear in as many places as
possible so that's if it's I wanted to
appear as free because a lot of people
only look at free I wanted to appear
under the paid column as well and the
trial ones appear under there so they
both wound up on I submit both of them
and that's where I was used before
copying around a bunch of files they
were almost the same I had two folders
and I was trying to manage this and
that's where
using the get really helped me out yeah
it's about the 3 vs pain the could you
not conditionally come file from just
one source piece you need to have to you
can um I saw a really nice uh so the
question was can you conditionally
compile the code as an alternative and
that's an option to one of the Microsoft
developers can't remember his name I
could i'll link to it when i whenever we
send out the recording he found a way to
you can forget out of this we're in your
app where you have debug and ship or
debug and release he added free and pro
in there as well and what that did is he
had some pre and post commands that
copied files around for him which made
it a little easier but because zamel
can't be conditionally compiled was was
the issue there so you could handle them
with all code behind instead as an
alternative any other question yeah so
you in your craft you said you know at
certain time today you're going to get
different users and like fry hundred
ninety
is there a way to have your categories
change based on d i'm not sure i know
that the Google AdMob has in an API you
could use I don't know what it's for I
had never had time I just see at the
bottom that there's an API I've thought
about ways to take to use that to my
advantage on one of the other things I
was thinking about is could I put on my
other hat and be a fake publisher and
try to bid on things just to see where
the highest values were and then I would
know where to put my my my categories so
the idea there was i can make dynamic
categories so my construct my server
would just send down today use clothing
tomorrow use whatever is the highest
paying thing and just switch that on the
fly I don't know if Microsoft has an API
that we can use for that though yep each
other go for that hold on is there any
ratings you tell you are doing a new
skater hat and after some time you're so
funny news is gone yeah so what do you
do with that so he was asking what the
um what your support is required to your
users over a period of time and there
may be some guidance on this somewhere I
don't know what it is I try not to make
things that are going to be a huge pain
for me to maintain I have a few that
have a server back-end like I have a
connected golfers app that stores all
your golf stats on and my cloud and
every year I have to spend money to
maintain those servers so I've learned
that the stupid silly apps make more
money so that's where I started to focus
it's important to realize your customers
any other questions here oh great talk
and on top center to add units and
they're different sizes if you play with
either the sizes or even blending the
odd control into your page to make it
not so lowly and then my other question
was around ad units for feature tracking
so I was thinking of having a different
idea of her feature my app it'll be away
for me to tell what parts of my office
blocker to figure out yeah so it's
enough yeah I'll try to work backwards
if i don't answer them all and ask ask
me again so yes tiff if i can if if you
can or should use different ads on maybe
different pages you can only have one
per page by their policy I've tried that
and i found my ecpm across the board was
lower not just big well I was getting
less impressions per the same
impressions total but each each added
unit was getting lower impressions and
for whatever reason maybe they appeared
as less popular to the publisher my eCPM
was lower on all of them so I eventually
split it less so I still have to add
units instead of 6i think I had in ecpm
rose and the total impression stays the
same I've already forgotten other
questions that what were their ad unit
size I've only played with the with the
big one I it fits nicely in my apps and
I haven't really had a reason to switch
has anyone had experience with different
sized apps or ads phase note the small
ones with money engine this smaller one
gets very low
okay so you said the small app gets low
fill rate oh yeah that's smaller keep
saying a pat pat any other experience
with that you had another question so I
blend like well it didn't like the black
one of my blue so I'm Glen me then you
know just changed it we styled it's not
allowed actually there's a few things
you're allowed to do um so my news
reader app has white background so I I
can force it to always basically do the
invert Oh or I force it to always be
white so it blends a little nicer
because otherwise I'd find on who would
it whatever theme you're working on
sometimes it looks good sometimes it
doesn't so you can override those styles
but I don't know what more you're
allowed to do without breaking some sort
of rules so I haven't really played
around that too much yeah impressions
and um I I want to give away too much
details here because you're all smart
enough to do math but I in october i
passed half a million I half a million
downloads I don't know how many of those
are active users most apps have short
short life span I don't know how many
I'm at now I haven't really been paying
attention i'm hoping that the nokia
phone causes that number to sort of do
the hockey care of growth aw impressions
is is good you know I at first I had had
doubts like I didn't want to come up
here and do this but and give this talk
because it's like oh I don't give away
too many secrets you know I don't want
my co-workers to realize I'm making you
know money on the side and but for me
the the Zap fest community is sort of
where I got my start because I
originally start going to the meetings
because I was interested in the phones
and making apps i've never done that
before and I was always coming to see
you all the new phone and try it out on
my foot
the developer devices that they let us
use and I sort of feel like I should
give back to the community if any
knowledge I have but for me it's also
nice to to hear what everyone else is
getting too now I know to be happy when
I have you know above two dollar you see
p.m. because it's a little higher than
everyone else in this room whereas
before you know I just sat at home and
scratch my head should I be happy if
it's 125 or should I be sad and what
eventually you you just have to stop
caring about that or you'll you know
there used to be days when I was
starting at you know a couple times a
day I'd log in and check how much my
making today and um it just got
exhausting so I had to had to stop um
yeah how do you swap in your house has
you do Cyclops the
um so the way that works is on when my
ad loads it reads from the isolated
storage and says what's your current
settings if it's google load the google
control in to the the space if it's
Microsoft uses Microsoft otherwise use
your third and I mean I may expand this
to try out other ad platforms there's a
few out there now but it's it's there's
just you know and if the block really in
there that it chooses which one to draw
and I do it from code behind yeah are
you still gonna do that though cuz I
thought I heard you saying that the
Microsoft born was making you money yeah
uh Microsoft one normally makes more
money um but earlier this week I had one
of those situations where i logged on
and i went from making two dollars a day
down to thirty cents a day no idea why
so first thing i did was i switched my
add categories got back up to eighty
cents and I said hey what the heck I'll
try google again in Google's head after
three days ecpm was a high 23 cents per
thousand views which was crap so I just
switched it back and back to Microsoft
for that app so different apps I try
different things just to see because
there was a time I was getting for
dollar ecpm with Google's AdMob it has
been a while de yeah why do you wait for
the next launch of the title
what was that what you said you waited
until they mixed launched it after after
they downloaded settings to change that
by yeah so why wait to the next time the
uploads to show the ad for me every
second counts for impressions I didn't
want to wait for my server to respond
and tell me which ad to use I wanted it
to be you know the same speed as normal
realizing that there's only so long
someone's going to be using a shotgun
app so show them the ad as fast as
possible and that allows the same exact
speed as with without using this system
yeah so how do you control the
percentage that playback controls first
you said you put it isolated storage and
they're me for my students don't but how
do you have any clothes that you get and
I calculate the percentage to see oh
yeah sure she was asking how I how each
app knows when to show the house ad
versus the paid ad in on that it's just
for me a basic random and a percentage
so if it's one of ten now I'll show it
and I just do a little bit of math there
to choose the percentage so guys just
periodically check the server and a big
any other questions from New doing the
doorman on the load of the app I make an
asynchronous requests out but if it
comes back I'll wait to the next load um
mainly because I've already did the work
of loading the assembly into memory and
I didn't want to you know keep switching
and granted that probably wouldn't
happen too often because I don't not
actively everyday switching them but I I
try to keep in mind these are phones
with limited resources so I just wait to
the next time they use it next question
so what they was it but distributional
fuses geography cookies and mostly
and the second one is besides using ads
within your apps if you do anything else
to market your absence to
but um so I only have the reports that
Microsoft gives on up sorry I had to
repeat the question um he was asking
geographically where am I seeing the
impressions and google has a lot better
reporting than Microsoft on this so if
the pub center guys are listening better
reporting would be awesome and it varies
I have more downloads in the u.s. than
other countries that would be
interesting for us to sort of all
compile some data and see where our
downloads are happening Europe has a
high amount us for my golf app
Australians love to golf they download
my app more than you know some colder
areas and that sort of makes sense to me
so that depends yeah what was your other
question again marketing like so he was
asking other ways i market my apps um
the one thing I tried was linkedin gave
me a free add credit to use and it was
actually fun for me because I said show
my ad to Microsoft employees of age 20
to 50 and um it got like seventeen
thousand impressions the first day so I
don't know what all Microsoft police are
doing on linkedin but it it was a like a
fifty-dollar free credit they gave and I
think that's because I put my company on
on the LinkedIn site so they realized I
might have something to advertise I
didn't realize that when I said fifty
dollars max that that was fifty dollars
per day so i logged in a few days later
I'm like ah crap um so it actually got a
pretty high click-through rate they you
know sent me an email congratulating me
that it had such a high quick rate but I
knew you know my market is Microsoft
employees because high percentage of the
being a phone is there another another
question back there laughs ID across all
your apps and the same time you new
ideas so he asked if I use the same ad
ID on all my apps I I'd do a different
ad ID on different apps then in the one
case I put in the in the details page I
put a different ad than in the normal
page and for me that was nice to see
where people are going I was sort of
using them for analytics but ad units
you saying that use across aight i use
different ad units across different apps
i try to match what they are so i'm not
going to show hunting and fishing
advertisements to my fortune cookie
users I know those are different than I
try to try to do an attempt at matching
that yeah uses location ETA
I here setting location API is good for
eCPM that's what the pub center team
told us when they gave a talk a while
ago I don't use it um because I'm very
cautious of draining people's batteries
spitting up the GPS for you know just
choose the better ad but Microsoft's
does a good job at finding your location
anyways even if you don't set that using
their anonymous live ID special stuff
they have so you may see it on your
phone's you get advertisements for you
know a pizza place in redmond or they
find information about you so they can
get better ads yeah your apps take on
more users I've done anything to make
sure that your app shows up in search
results from the marketplace my app you
know I search for the name of my happen
it may not care of the top or I search
for something that's very relevant above
my app and it doesn't even appear
so he was asking how do you get people
to find your app and I get with keywords
is it one thing you get to pick I tried
to make them match as much as possible
but it was definitely an issue for me
that I saw and the one trick i had was
one of my apps wasn't getting downloaded
at all i changed the name Reese touted a
bit resubmitted and that app took off
was the first one sort of never got
noticed so there may be some luck there
two of what time did you appear under
the top of the new app section so if you
were unlucky maybe you were way down
scroll and no one got to you and if
you're at the top people start
downloading you then you appear higher
in the ranks and stuff so you can't get
discouraged and you know try again the
hard part is writing the code it's easy
to submit again under a different name
any other questions yea crash since
you're already hitting the web server
usage tracking is is something that's on
my to-do list for a long time I I really
want to do that I bet I would find it
very interesting I've heard people of
using google analytics for all their
their tracking and stats and reporting
and I think that's as easy as putting an
image on your page that's invisible they
give you like a 1 x 1 pixel and then it
just makes calls the server but try to
be a good developer and not use up too
much battery you have to realize every
time you spin up a 3g connection there's
a lot of overhead on the user's phone
for that calling yes so so for me I was
I was planning on throwing up a little
bit more information but um it's just a
matter of a finding time to do stuff is
is uh is always hard
let's not use other antiques frameworks
like PMP will vary so yes have I thought
about other analytics there's the
preemptive one that I don't know what
the current status is for that they they
had a free usage for X number of months
I never put it in my apps because um
they were doing things that I didn't
think we're okay which was making a web
request every time an event fired on so
like 3g connections are very expensive
on the battery so any time it got to a
counter it would make a call to the web
service when really I thought if I would
implement it I'd save all the stats and
then unload send a group of data so I
don't I've got some being too nice of a
developer but I didn't like that their
solution they may have changed it by now
I don't know on any other questions so
if someone has anyone done analytics on
on their app or put anything in there to
figure out usage stats because that
would be an interesting talk if anyone
has done this I'd love to hear what
people are doing because we do we do
look for what people have questions
about and then we'll try to get someone
to come in here and talk about it like
you have a for a while the free offers
fired doesn't seem like they are really
different ways
service
so how much is pre-emptive has the base
catalytic yeah get some basic analytics
out of pads on center engines
I mean having that data would be useful
for for me because I haven't localized
any of my apps and if I was getting
interesting data I might spend on to
localize my ops better but other than
that I haven't thought too much about
what I would do with that data if I had
it and Microsoft on msdn site they have
general usage downloads bye-bye area
yeah we have any more questions thanks
everyone for sort of giving me your
information is useful thanks for coming
