I want to welcome you to the second
biannual NW NLP workshop we actually
made it this year two years from now I'm
not sure where we'll be but I have I
think we have a trend happening now so
it looks like a very good turnout I'm
will Lewis I helped kind of facilitate
the setup here at MSR but I certainly
didn't organize this Gina and Luke did
the bulk of the work with organizing the
workshop so I think most of you have
been around here you kind of know where
everything is it's you need wireless
there's a password up on the wall there
as beverages and stuff like that it's
clear where everything is so I don't
want to belabor more my introduction
here I'd like to turn it over to the
real introduction Gina and Luke if you
could take over at this point oh one
other thing is shafiq here okay so we
really really it's really nice to see
the great turnout for this and you know
really the goal for today is just to be
really informal and have nice
interactions for everybody to get to
know each other so we have a program
with you know about seven talks and
almost everyone in posters and you know
our goal was just to give a sampling of
the different kinds of work so we
balanced across geography in a cross
area across a research area for the
different sessions and I hope we have a
pretty exciting program to look at so
what we really want to do in especially
with this big turnout that we have you
know is just thank Microsoft first of
all for having us
and thank I'll thank everybody for
coming and then what we want to do is
somehow get this microphone working I
guess and we want to go around and do
what we're going to call the lightning
blitz of introductions right so this is
the opportunity where you can listen two
names and then you can go and find the
person right afterwards that you
actually want to be talking to right and
I hope to be able to meet everybody here
so I am luke said um we're on computer
science department at the University of
Washington and I do research in natural
language understanding and it would be
great if people could say roughly that
amount of information about themselves
because we're going to try to get every
single person to talk and if you have
something slightly funny to say that's
fine too but not necessary and I don't
do yoga ok so I'm Gina lavo and I'm the
person responsible for much of the email
barrage recently I'm at the university
of washington in the Linguistics
Department and particularly in the
computational linguistics masters
program and i work on primarily prosody
in speech understanding and I get to

something like that so I the languages
many is my maybe new you just hi I'm
sang one song at u-dub or linguistic
department and Miley such topics or
multilingual empty and information
structure I'm Ryan Georgie University of
Washington work with faiza and will
Louis and specialize in kind of
multilingualism and adapting kind of

Michael Goodman um I'm a PhD student and
computational linguistics at u-dub
working with the Emily bender I do work
with the grammage engineering resource
creation computational morphology and
occasionally
machine translation I'm Prescott class
and I'm a PhD student at u-dub and i'm
interested in text summarization and
domain adaptation I'm Emily bender and
linguistics University of Washington i'm
the director of the famous clms program
and my research interests are in
multiple grammar engineering with
applications including language
documentation I'm Christian Monson uh I
am well two years ago I headed up this
workshop and now it's great to see
everyone here and two years ago I was
working with brian at ohsu in Portland
and now i am here in seattle working at
nuance communications doing language
modeling for speech recognition and
we're hiring so any of you graduating
PhD or masters level people please come
talk to me I want to talk to you hi I'm
Ethan Selfridge I'm at the Center for
spoken language understanding at ohsu
and I work on spoken dialogue systems
I'm Eric morally i'm also at spoke
center for spoken language understanding
and i do a natural language processing
and text-to-speech i'm erin dama also it
Hsu and I work mostly an efficient
constituent person I'm Anthony stock and
I also work at ohsu i'm working on
speech processing and acoustic modeling
I'm Andrew Fowler I ba'd and I work on
language models for assistive technology
I'm well Lois I'm I in the machine
translation team here at MSR i also have
worked closely with faye for a number of
years on the odin database and building
resources for under-resourced languages
so now we all have a challenge right and
so the challenge is to go introduce
yourself to someone from some you know
geographic location that's not your own
and start talking with them and if you
really successful this challenge next
time we all come and sit down we will no
longer be clustered by groups
right and that's the ultimate goal here
the ultimate goal is to start mingling
and to start interacting with people any
anything else so I guess basically what
we're going to do now is start that
mingling process let me just do a few
quick announcements so the schedules are
all around on the walls so if you want
to check any of the schedules please do
that we'll start again at eleven with
the talks if you're in the first poster
session feel free to start putting up
your posters along the walls you may as
well do that during the break now maybe
people will see them and come and find
you and talk to you and that'll be
exciting I one additional thing too for
lunch we're going to all walk in mass to
the commons which is I call it the
Microsoft mall there are tons of food
places there the problem is you have to
be with someone who has a badge to let
you in to that complex since you all
have guest passes you're fine that's one
of the reasons we have you create these
name tags so could I have a show of hand
of hands of the Microsoft ease in this
room who would like to go to the commons
with a small group as a host if you
could raise your hands okay I up my
hands up to I'm planning on going to
Indian flute by the way but I can't take
50 people so so a subset of you are
welcome to glom on to me and we can walk
over but will kind of walk together in
clusters so I just want to death so look
raise your hands again the Microsoft is
okay those are the people you want to
dip the glom onto ok ok I think the last
thing is just you know thanks again to
Microsoft and also to all the people on
the pc that helped with all the
reviewing and organization everything so
i hope we can have a really nice day in
a lot of interaction so enjoy the coffee
and we'll meet again at eleven
