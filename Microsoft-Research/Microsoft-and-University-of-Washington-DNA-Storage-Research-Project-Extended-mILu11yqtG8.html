perfect Randall party bro we're working
on the problem of storing large volumes
of digital data the issue we're dealing
with is that we're producing a lot of
data and current storage technologies
cannot keep up with it we are using DNA
as a storage medium for digital data we
are using synthetic DNA for data storage
so that means that we store in zeros and
ones into DNA molecules and the zeros
and ones can be images video anything
any data you want and the reason we're
doing that is because DNA is very dense
you can put a lot of data in a small
volume to give you an idea the whole
accessible internet is estimated to be
about 700 exabytes and that would fit in
the size of a shoebox the other reason
is DNA is very durable in the right
conditions DNA can last for thousands of
years compared to other storage
technologies the last in the order of
decades and finally DNA does not get
obsolete DNA will always be relevant we
always going to have reasons to read DNA
DNA is made up of various sequences of
four types of molecules a C G and T the
first step in the process is to turn the
data we want to store into sequences of
those four molecules along with the
markers that identify where data belongs
in the original sequence these sequences
are then synthesized into actual DNA
when we receive the DNA many files may
come together in a single pool they make
a number of checks and then use a
process called polymerase chain reaction
or PCR to select only the sequences of
the files we want to read the PCR
process will multiply only the sequences
of those files the last step is to read
those sequences and turn them back into
data
so last year we stored hundreds of
kilobytes of data in DNA and fully
recovered that this year we're working
with hundreds of megabytes of data which
means a thousand times more DNA in
building the world record we've worked
with twist bioscience to synthesize 200
megabytes of data which is well beyond
anything that's been synthesized today
along with the collaboration with
University of Washington we've
demonstrated that we're able to recover
data built out of 1.5 billion
nucleotides the growth that we're
experiencing in our global data centers
is truly astounding it's a challenge not
only in creating new technologies to
deal with it but in actually inventing
the new science to form a foundation for
the future DNA storage gives us that new
foundation and this is exactly the kind
of problem that Microsoft Research was
built to solve</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
