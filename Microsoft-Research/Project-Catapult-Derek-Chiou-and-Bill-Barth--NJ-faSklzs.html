you
good morning I like to welcome all of
you to this workshop today we are going
to be talking about catapult and I
promise you this would be a fun filled
day there's a lot of fun things we will
talk about and when you go out in the
afternoon today I'm sure you know more
about catapult but also you will know
more about what we are planning to do
and how you can contribute to it so
before we start with the way the talks I
like to just go over the plan for today
there we go the plan for today you have
it in front of you I believe in paper
form of course we I'll introduce that
way shortly but then Derek would come
and talk about some of our deployments
that we are doing which would be
interesting to you we have Bill here as
well from tak who will be talking about
tax contribution to this project we have
to research talks by Eric and you young
and they'll be interesting applications
of what you can do with catapult and
then we will move on to the afternoon
session and this is a time when many of
you would be talking and this is an
ever-increasing list which is good we
are really happy right now we have 11
people here if you're not here that
doesn't mean you cannot if you are
you're feeling moved to actually talk
about your research and your plans for
reducing catapult you're most welcome
send me an email with the slides we want
to put all the slides here so that the
switchover is quick this is just five
minutes 27 minutes so just send me your
slides if you haven't and if you're in
this list if you're not in this list
even then if you want to talk about your
project in plans send me a slide or two
and I'll put them in the lineup also
when you come in there are these release
forms you need to sign so during lunch
or after that just sign these so that we
can actually record these
videos and then put them on the site for
other people who are not here to see so
that's our plan will be done around
three ish 3 p.m. and then if you want to
stick around talk to us talk amongst
yourself we can do that as well now
Miriam actually asked me a very
important question early morning she
said are you associated with fpg for
long and I said no you don't know me yes
the community is very close you know you
know each other a lot but of course I'm
not my role is being a program manager
for this project for outreach and
essentially which means I interact with
you I talked to you see if you are all
happy if you need anything i come back
and push Doug indirect a lot so but
that's me but one person and the rest of
the research team you know very well the
part of the community who's one of the
mainstays of this project and he's going
to talk about how you are and larger
economic woman he can use derek is a
principal architect at microsoft he
works at bay and of course his interests
are in fpga and data center applications
he's also a professor at UT austin and
we're happy and lucky that she's right
here with us before going to UT Austin
he was a system architect and lead for
performance modeling at a win see is
that reach a yes system which is a
manufacturer of Arabic core routers he
received his PhD SM and SP degrees in
electrical engineering in
science from MIT dead thank you or Iman
alright so this academic program is
actually joint between alterra and
Microsoft altera's actually donated a
significantly 250f pjs of this project
which I discovered are worth one point
eight million dollars when we tried to
ship them to China so there it's quite a
quite a substantial donation yeah Doug
and are Germans actually been really the
one who's been driving all of the all of
the hard work within this academic
program so thanks a lot there so all
right let's see so thanks Arjumand for
all of that good alright so high level
goals of the academic program impart to
provide access to fpga and enable
platforms at scale beyond what's
normally available to academics it's
also to kick-start catechol the catapult
ecosystem windows + fpga research so I
want to do hardware IP infrastructure
and software we want all of these
components not just you know an IP core
to accelerate Smith Watterson right we
want to reduce startup costs to maximize
research so one of the problems we all
have when we first start doing fpga
research is how do you get the tools how
do you set up the tools how do you
figure out the licenses how do you get
the machines how do you program the
machine is the first time I mean it's
for everyone who started up in this we
do the same things over and over again
and actually we see this for every new
student that comes right they have to
you know essentially figure out how to
do all of this we also want to establish
research relationships with Microsoft
right so the goal long-term goal is that
people who are working in these
platforms we can work Microsoft can work
with them and potentially use their
their work to influence the actual
product lines so an overview of the
project is is this jointly funded by
altering Microsoft and in some system
ministration tool servers are funded by
NSF under this project called fabric
which I'll give you a brief introduction
to the next slide I'm going to provide
access to catapult card systems and
infrastructure and we want to build a
nice outreaching community around all of
us so fairly straightforward so fabric
is as NSF funded project basically it's
to put high-end FPGA systems and the
rules and the servers into tach which is
our supercomputer center at University
of Texas I'm the p.i but actually a lot
of help from Arvin James Joel Emmer
Sheila and John Wars neck so it's open
to all including industry this is kind
of the weird thing most programs are not
available to industry where industry can
actually come and log in and actually
use the the tools and the infrastructure
the reason why we like this is because a
lot of academics do work so for instance
we've done work at UT where we want to
share it with industry but then they
need a blue speck license and the blue
speck license will cost them an ungodly
amount they don't want to pay that
amount to just kick the tires right so
this allows them to actually run in the
same machines that you run on use the
st. you work both the server's the tools
as well as the actual hardware all right
so this gives them a nice way to play
it's professionally managed by tax staff
we have built here who will talk a
little bit about that the cost to you
this is the way we prevent people coming
doing real commercial development is all
the work has to be open source and when
you actually start using the our tools
and actually running on the FPGAs it's
you we consider that to be distributed
to us it means we can look at your code
we can publish it what we do is we do
agree not to publish for one year after
you submit to us because you may be
writing a paper if you want to negotiate
a little longer time that's fine but we
can look at it immediately all right and
so see open fabric out or for
instructions on how to get access huh we
are basically the P is the tav attack
administrators and the people who own
the CAD tools so it turns out the people
like alterra they want to be able to see
what you're doing but that's effectively
Doug
I am not wearing one Microsoft had at
the moment sorry but the problem is
because we're putting this in tact and
we're using the NSF money to support
some of the system administration yeah I
had to say that so yeah yes yes yeah so
a look at the website for for more
details on that yeah so yeah this that I
was not this is not Microsoft that will
be looking at it but it's the people who
own the the cat tools mostly are the
ones who are concerned about this yeah
yeah so what we're going to provide is
you know all of a lot of the stuff that
we all have trouble doing right so pcie
device driver how many of us have messed
around with those right turns out we
have a one that's going to be deployed
you know for real production use so it's
going to be compiled encrypted and also
our shell which Doug describe briefly
which basically provides an abstraction
to all of that fpga hardware that all of
the interfaces to the outside world so
the drm controller the PCIe controller
and the the links to the outside we are
across the torus network these are
initially going to be compiled encrypted
we're discussing source code ask access
under NDA with lawyers and hopefully
over the long term we can make it open
source but this is something that you
know Microsoft considers to be somewhat
secret so we're going to have to learn
have to work with lawyers on that will
provide some hello world programs as
well to get you started alterra tools
including open sea open sea el service
to run them on so alterra we are working
on Altair is working on and we're
working with them to get open seal up on
these boards probably with there's
there's some barriers to that but Dave
and I and Scott have been working on
this so I mean actually need to get you
these boards right so remote access to
clusters of servers and all of these are
accessible with a one-page proposal to
catapult at microsoft com all right so
that's what we're looking for some
funding will be available this is it's
to be limited but will also be funding
some research grants as well this is not
under yes this is now so sorry I should
have yeah we really i'm only microsoft
the the UT is that so that's a legacy
award that's still running but does
provide you know pays for some of the
tax support so yeah yeah i I've actually
thought about that I do need to buy a
Microsoft edge so but i'm wearing my
Microsoft shirt I'm not going to change
shirts oh ok so in terms of numbers as I
said I'll tear has been very kind to
donate 250 FPGAs those are being put on
boards right now so basically those
one-page proposals we get you kind of
onesies twosies / professor if you
happen to be at an institution that's
got more professors perhaps you could
get together and propose more right for
some from you know some joint research
so the big installation is going to be
four racks of 96 catapult equipped
servers each all right so this is almost
400 servers this is going into tach so
if you go to tak they actually have
space for this this is something that if
we were to give a rack to any individual
professor you would have a lot of
problems these are big they're very
noisy they take a lot of power it's it's
expensive and difficult to maintain
these so tack is their real experts at
this because they have the number seven
supercomputer in the world along with
many other computers in the facility
fpgas in each half rack of 48 server is
going to be connected by the 2d tourists
that Doug spoke very briefly about so
that's going to be 42 x 6.25 gig
transceiver links and we'll have all
that cabling that he showed to connect
them together as well resource
allocation inherited adapted from to the
supercomputing world so what will happen
is you'll sign up for an account you'll
be given time on a machine you'll be
running on that machine and when you're
done you will leave the machine and the
next person can run on it the nice thing
about this is we all knows professors is
you know will apply for a piece of
equipment we may get you know $50,000
hundred-thousand-dollar piece of
quitting we use it for six months and
after that it gathers dust
so by having this in one central
facility lots of people can go and
access it we're also going and putting
some of the servers into into EPFL and
TE th the issue with that is they are
not going to be open so I'm not really
talking about those right now alright so
the outreach community well they're
going to be workshops that are going to
be held this is the first of the
workshops obviously there's going to be
community wiki repository email list
right now we're starting with the
research that microsoft com / catapult
to start there'll be instructions there
on how to sign up for the email list and
then we'll have the wiki set up in the
very near future there's going to be
contest that'll be run i'm hoping to
start the first contest in the fall
where you know james actually brought up
a good point that this could be his
project for his class that he wouldn't
even have to grade them we will have
hopefully will gather members of the
community to help to help judge the
contest but fundamentally that the goal
is to run a contest you know fairly
often perhaps once a semester which will
then provide incentive for students and
and frankly anyone to try to develop on
these fpga platforms what else should we
be doing please give us suggestions on
what else you might want to what you
think we should be doing within the the
outreach and the community building
alright so the hopeful future of all
this is a full fpga ecosystem that
drastically lowers the barrier to entry
for fpga research teaching and even
eventually commercial activity right so
full system not just at PG accelerators
in isolation an active community using
that ecosystem right so shared IP
documentation course where we've all
done research we've all done great you
know IP blocks or infrastructure but
it's very rare that we see them share
and so we're hoping that we can we can
encourage all of that we want research
impact on Microsoft in the cloud
industry right this is something that a
lot of academics have trouble doing is
actually bridging an industry that's not
always true bonds had a lot of impact on
industry but among others but this is
something in Jason of course too but
this is something which you know maybe
by because FPGAs are so quick we can you
know adapt IP blocks very quickly that
we could potentially bring things in and
upgrades to future systems over time the
hope over the time we don't have
commitment
microsoft on this but you know maybe we
can get some of those next generation
systems and in a year or two write
something on that order all right any
questions no okay it will be one system
I'm sorry the version one it'll be the
version one system that's distributed
that's right so the approval for all
this funding got we've got approval for
the funding before people started
talking about the second generation and
so in fact what we're doing is those
four hundred machines we actually
purchase from bing those are the four
hundred came from the 1632 pilot
machines and are being shipped attack
quickly week after if I'm soon but
they're actually taking them out of a
data a big data center physically right
and
the rocket action so I think it's not be
to Microsoft public would revise a lot
of value so about Tara's customers gage
actually sent an email today two months
after we give them everything they were
having trouble but my guess is probably
it's Caroline yep parallax is in Kerala
as well but the intention
so there
thank you thank you thank you very so we
have heard a lot of about cat really
this is up there are partners in time in
addition to an era so we have bill with
us today he is the director of high
performance computing it tak he's going
to talk about what attack and Microsoft
catapult well he spent many years at at
UT Austin he has a PhD from UT Austin in
aerospace in anything I actually didn't
know that yeah I'm not a CS person or
computing person by the HBC hook there
so that's interesting and so he'll be
talking about actually attack and how
you and DAC would be back yeah my my
talk has blossomed I was complaining a
little this morning from stand up and
say three things about tack you know
starting at the thing over that you holy
exhibit to 15 minutes on the agenda so I
didn't really have a chance to prepare
any slides but I'll say a few things
about tack and sort of some of my goals
at this workshop and meeting folks so if
you don't know who we are we're an
organized research unit of the
University of Texas at Austin we're a
standalone research computing
organization we don't report up through
I TS or anything like that we're a world
leader in research computing we have the
number 7 system on the top 500 list you
can say what you like about that
benchmark but it says we have a big
computer and we kind of know how to run
them not Microsoft Azure Bing scale
computing right we're on millions of
servers but we have about ten or twelve
thousand systems under management in one
cluster or another biggest ones got 6400
nodes we're a hub for large-scale
computation at UT but also within the
University of Texas System within the
state of Texas and we're primarily
funded by the National Science
Foundation so our big systems come
through in SF money and we offer open
compute research platforms to people all
over the united states and their
collaborators all over the world so we
have more than 40 petabytes of data
under management which is again small
for Microsoft and Google scale
but it's pretty big for research scale
computing we try to have
state-of-the-art facilities and expert
staff so I just have a few notes here
instead of slides we've been running as
Derek mentioned some FPGA systems and
the fabric project for Derek for a long
time we have some other interesting
systems coming in recently from a
different vendor from IBM that will
include power 8 and fpga and so we've
been doing this kind of stuff under
Derek's funding for quite some time and
we hope to continue that independently
of the catapult work as well as Derek
mentioned Microsoft is going to ship us
almost 400 of these Bing servers so
they'll be identical to what because
they are what was run in bing and
they'll be shipping soon Microsoft is
going to sort of manage the allocation
of time on them will have some sort of
website or something that will get spun
up shortly to help figure out who to
give the time to and then we'll run that
through tack it's a windows-based
environment so that'll be new and
interesting for us as well we've
primarily run all of these systems on on
Linux so we'll we'll work together with
the community to figure out how to make
it accessible and usable to folks as
time goes on I guess the other thing
that I want to show you guys I've get
some sort of questions that I'd like to
answer while I'm here so you know what
what's the best way to run this program
is the allocation model work do you know
just telling you that you have so much
time how to record that that'll be a
thing that we have to integrate with
Microsoft and the community to make sure
that the system is approachable and
usable you know what does the community
want as part of the resource you know it
there is the catapult shell and the
things that that entails but there's
also just an FPGA sitting on a Windows
Server that's accessible to you and so
would having bear access to the FPGA be
something we wanted to do under the
project do not well what does it mean to
have a remote access to fpga instead of
it sitting death side those are kind of
questions that we're going to need to
work together to figure out how to
manage and model do we need some sort of
early user program we do this a lot in
super
shooting where we get some people who
are friendly and willing to tell us the
problems that they have running on the
system before they go to the press and
say you know microsoft attack are
terrible and they did all this horrible
stuff on the system it doesn't work and
all that kind of stuff and so we usually
start a few weeks or months in advance
of putting the system in production with
a handful of people who are willing to
kick the tires try it out dedicate a
little time to it but also tell us tell
Microsoft attack the problems first in
order that we can sort of sort sort
through them work them out make sure
that everything is good for the rest of
the community when everybody comes
online this can be a little painful but
I think it's also fruitful you get early
access to the system and benefit of
having early time to work on it those
are the basic things that I wanted to
say I'm sure there are a lot of
questions about how this program is
going to run and to be perfectly frank
we don't all quite know yet so I think
there'll be some opportunities to figure
out you know how is Microsoft been
working with Bing resources and how does
that translate into a program that
academic community can can use so that's
really all I had to say I'm happy to
take any questions or we can have an
early break yeah
def that's what kind of devices I'm
sorry yeah well I don't know so that's a
doug and Derek question because yeah
it's a great question yeah I i I'm happy
it you know there's a node it runs
windows you're going to be able to have
a remote connection to that box so you
will be able to you know type away and
access the resources from the cpu side I
don't know what the connectivity
typically is for fpgas sitting on a pci
express bus so what is the caterpillar
I'll do Derek
we just haven't done it and so I you
know we believe that I think it's
possible to talk ssds so you guys push
that through some driver now you push
data from the SSD through the cpu
through a driver into the fpga but
that's part of the driver essentially
now on the windows side well think of
the storage tacked on hard disk and SSD
and fpga is completely separate yeah if
you want to do something more
interesting than we have to write right
but if you wanna do something less
interesting if you just want to get data
off the disk and ship it to the fpga you
have a way to do that memory buffer and
then you should go okay
and that says eight media team a
mysterious candles it should run at five
doesn't want to kill to that other board
same issues yeah they say don't use
Jennifer had we not gone the person to
respond this board
I think we're both are all just touch of
bearish that we're shipping our borders</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
