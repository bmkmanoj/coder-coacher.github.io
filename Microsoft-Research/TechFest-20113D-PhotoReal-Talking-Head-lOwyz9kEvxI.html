researcher at maxim researchers Redmond
here in Washington I'm going to show you
a demo of a photorealistic talking head
which can be controlled freely with head
motion and the fish expression and this
is a joint work with lead gen 1 Franklin
Chang ho at the max of research Asia
they usually they're two approaches the
first approach is to have a 2d talking
head like you public see on some
websites it can be high pointing
photorealistic but it's very hard to
control the head gesture the second
approach is a 3d avatar it gives us a
lot of flexibility to control its
behavior however to make it a
photorealistic such as the wrinkles
tongue tease we need to build a very
complex mesh model so our approach is to
leverage the best of the towards so what
we do we generate a 2d photolytic video
and paste it on a 3d mesh model which
can be built from a connect or webcam
and then we obtain a very nice photo
lustica Taj ahead author of the danger
trail phillips deals etc
so now let's take a look at the demo so
here we can enter the text we want to
the Avatar talk so you can input
whatever you want and once you send us
the information to the putter head and
plug in the wheel talk zhengzhou Zen is
demonstrating a new approach toward
making a photorealistic avatar using a
regular 2d video of someone as a
reference and a simple 3d model that can
be created with kinect the research team
synthesized a 3d avatar that can be
animated in real time this process of
pasting on the 3d video reduces the
computation required for photo realism
in real time as a 3d talking head i have
many useful applications such as voice
agents telepresence gaming and
speech-to-speech translation so what you
saw is the first step toward a more
advanced to talking head with the mall
human qualities imagine sir avatar will
recognize your emotion and the ACT
potpourri how is that cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
