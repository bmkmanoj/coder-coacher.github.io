hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
right so let's get started with the the
first talk before before I do that how
many of you have used Google now Cortana
CD and every day fair number of wow
that's quite a few have you used the
speech feature on any of these any of
these programs you can say okay google
or hey Cortana or something right so the
fundamentals of speech recognition in
all of these things that you guys have
been using their daily lives traces
directly back to our next speaker so
professor rod ready he pioneered
deconstruction of systems for
recognizing continuous speech he
received the Turing award which is the
Nobel Prize for computer science in four
for the design of design and
construction of large scale AI
artificial intelligence systems
demonstrating the practical importance
and potential of commercial impact for
for some of these systems that you can
see the impact of the research right in
your hands right now he's been a faculty
member at Stanford for the last 40 years
which is longer than I've been around on
this world he even found it the robotics
Institute and many of the new cool
things that you hear about spa starting
from you know drones to sell driving
cars again trace their origins back to
the robotics Institute and through that
to our next speaker so with that let me
let me welcome professor ready to to the
state I'm going to begin with a true
story unfortunately many of you who are
20-somethings may not know about this
story so this may come as a new surprise
those of you in the front already know
it but you'll do you'll forgive me for
repeating what you know in 1997 July
Apple computer was bankrupt almost
bankrupt its value was 1.7 billion
dollars which was less than its original
IPO market value in 1980 so it was kind
of essentially had a little blip and
then kept going down in November 2014 17
years later the market value of Apple
computer was 700 billion the highest
valuation of any US company ever what
was the magic how did they get there
when Steve Jobs took over Apple in 1997
he had to request his old friend Bill
Gates to invest 150 million dollars in
apple and entered into a strategic
partnership they needed the crutch know
so that they can survive okay 97 if
Microsoft had kept that stock without
selling it off a few years later that
would be worth 40 billion dollars today
they didn't they don't need 40 billion
dollars Microsoft has a lot of money in
the bank that's not the issue Microsoft
market valuation at the hood at 1997 was
hundred times that of Apple and today
it's about half so talk about the
reversal of fortunes what happened I
think that that's what we need to kind
of all of you going forward to pay
attention to saying what was the secret
what do I did it happen
steve jobs more than the most understood
human limitations and their strengths
and they have needs and they have egos
right and had the dictatorial authority
he was a one-man thing he could out roll
anybody and say you are going to do this
or you're fired or whatever and almost
no other company has that kind of
authority including Microsoft at this
point especially Microsoft and most
other organizations most other computer
science departments paid scant attention
because kind of thing that was the last
on the list of things to do of cognitive
science principles that have been known
for over 40 years and many even now
still don't fully appreciate the
centrality of human centered design that
is there should be a group at the top
saying this product will not be released
because it has the stupid dialog box
keep popping up it does nothing and
until you remove it it will not be
released nobody seems to have that
authority in the systems my hope is to
convince all of you are some of you to
emulate and emerged as the Steve Jobs of
21st century by paying attention to
human strengths and limitations instead
of just functionality and features
you know and my talk today is to restate
the obvious point that computers are
used by people and we need to be meeting
me you know mindful of human strengths
and limitations and you know
specifically i'll talk about
computational limits to human thinking
in a society where we have too much
information and too little time i was
lucky enough to have started using
computers with vacuum tubes to have been
around it's not necessarily lucky but i
was there but with vacuum tubes and
mercury delay lines they're probably
only one or two people in the audience
that have had to do the same thing and
in every decade since then we have seen
disruptive exponential change with
unpredictable consequences the question
is what is next what is the next big
thing and so if you can kind of quickly
go through in 1960s we had mainframes
where one computer and hundreds of users
that even thousands of users then we
went to 1970s we had minis which
essentially took away the dominance of
IBM and went to a digital equipment
corporation and so on and there you have
one computer time sharing tens of users
monitoring and instrumentation type
thing in 1980s we saw emergence of PCs
and workstations and one computer one
user in 1990s we saw the emergence of
networked computers where you could
access globally shared information in
2000's we have smartphones and tablets
and apps and so on and we are now
struggling to figure out what the 2010s
are going to be about you know variable
computers and things like that we
already had a couple of
them one of them is already crashed and
burned the google glass will not survive
nobody wants to go around with a glass
with something projecting out because
it's not too intrusive the same is true
Google all the watches will also die
they will not survive I guarantee you if
any of you want to take a bet i'll come
after the talk I'll behave I'm good at
taking bets where I lose all the time
that's a different story darker and
everything so the next big thing from my
point of view will be a device that can
be used by everybody on the planet that
means we have to pay attention to the
language divide and literacy divide if
somebody cannot bleed anything how do
they work what does it open so I will
kind won't go through the rest of it
here but so there are I want to talk
about human limitations we make errors
we forget we are impatient we don't want
to work too hard if something can be
done faster we want to do it that way so
let's see if we can actually go through
each of those the first one is to err is
human many of us have done something
wrong and we lost a lot of data and this
happens all the time and I used to ask
even 15 20 years ago why don't we have
unlimited undo technically it is
possible is being possible forever but
somehow people thought was not important
I submit it's very important we ought to
pay attention to that if Microsoft
Research is not working on unlimited
undo this should be a small group that
says we know how to build it because now
we have unlimited memory so you can keep
everything I did for the last week or
last month and then let me go back and
you know can't reverse it a second we
have we forget and so sometimes you know
there's a helpful comment you know
there's help systems Microsoft Halpern
all help systems have not changed since
their invention they're simply
txt files please every time I need help
these days I go to youtube and look at a
tutorial on video why can't you know
Microsoft produce video help it's easy
enough to do so we you know basically
this we forget we need help of all kinds
and what this forgetting is caused this
is why you need to understand
fundamental cognitive science why do we
forget it's called the loss of indexing
structure in the brain and why how do
you recover it you have to keep
repeating it repeating it but if I only
use word once a week or once a month and
you give me six different ribbons I
can't remember where the future is so
people have to think how a human being
would use these features that you are
going putting in as a designer okay so
there are lots of other things that we
can talk about to be impatient is human
we can't keep on waiting we know for
example in the old days when I want to
start up a start and stop the thing it
would take a minute and in 1997 I made a
comment which appeared in Wall Street
Journal that got lots of people in
Microsoft upset with me I said we spend
like at least two minutes a day about
half a billion people simply waiting for
the thing to boot up by boot down that
translates to about 500,000 man years of
effort wasted and that translates to
depending on whether you and USA are
here between five billion 250 billion
dollars of wasted effort if you were a
designer and i said i will give you ten
percent of that money that you'll save
you wouldn't be able to figure out how
to make the start up and start down to
be one second or two hundred millisecond
that is the great thing about what
google did at the beginning they've lost
their where recently but namely they
said the response time must be 200
milliseconds or less no matter what i'm
going to do if it takes more is
not acceptable same thing should be
applied to everything we do in in
systems design and finally we are lazy
tend to be usually lazy if this is
easier way of doing it we do that and so
there is a whole thing i'll come back to
your name plate run so it turns out you
know this software we use especially
Word and Excel and PowerPoint you think
have become bloated everybody wants to
feature they added overall you know they
become so big that so unmanageable and
most of us only use like five ten
percent of the features that are there
so I'm kind of I was very happy to see
Microsoft is going towards part and
browsers I think we should begin to look
at Spartan word and squadron PowerPoint
and Spartan everything but whatever it
is so the issue i think is there are
certain things we can do that to me the
most exciting thing that happened is
autocomplete you know that's the
non-intrusive it kind of shows up if i
don't want it i don't have to use it
it's not like a dialog box saying do you
want to do this sort of like old paper
clip and various other things it kind of
scares in your face and won't go away
and that's what I don't want anything
any intrusive stuff so anyway they're
all of these things and limitations we
have also a lot of strengths that
computers don't try to use we learn from
experience show me one program that
continuously learns as I do things and
can adapt to my needs it's B's been
possible for a one time but we don't pay
attention to it it's not that important
for the designers for some reason we we
make you know ambiguous uncertain error
for statements and if I say go get me
something that my assistant doesn't come
and say did you mean this or do you mean
that there's something else they figure
out they do it and so we can't they have
the computers deal with
error full statements and we have we use
a lot of knowledge that we accumulate
over lifetime and we communicate with
each other always only using speech and
language occasionally we might need a
display occasionally we might need you
know to write a read but most of the
time in amador daily interaction with
speech and language when are we going to
see systems of that kind so I'd like to
illustrate this from a point of view
have a 20 year old video which we still
cannot do
morning right here good morning Kate
it's April first nineteen ninety seven
at the time is 630 am Kate news
selection reports new trade agreements
between Japan and France effects Paris
spring collections plus 24 other items
of interest here to browse not well well
only male surf here 43 items including
26 unopened for three days 12 unopened
for two days cancel list alright alright
I've been busy canceling were there
further instructions yes did my snap
catalog arrive I understood catalog snap
checking Oh enthusiasm detected here to
view large screen you won't did that
mean yes yes switch to large screen
incoming vid phone call George Smith
from snap headquarters Priority One you
wish to preview mr. Smith darn you've
used that before you care to define it
no I'm old called preview collar hell
now I smell trouble yeah okay vidphone
open and connection Kate are you there
I'd rather sink sorry George not exactly
dressed for success this morning seen
the customer version of our spring
catalog yet yeah I just got it in a
million cuts don't exactly waste time
you did one heck of a job Kate whatever
job better yep I love that history of
the of the t-shirt segment wonderful
sales are it cut to the chase George you
didn't stay up all night to call and
Compline at me good Kate you are the
best interactive designer in the
businessman I mean that from the bottom
of my heart but hey I got a little
emergency here you know that blue jeans
spectacular that you're working on did
you know that blue jeans were invented
during the gold rush a major moment in
American culture look I know that your
due date was next week but then I move
it up talk to this George I needed by
today 5 p.m. we're going to production
tonight tonight orders from the top I
mean Iraq competition is breaking early
they're doing in jeans retrospect in 20
we got to be better we got to be first
the future of snap depends on you Kate
and there's there's something else
you're changing the concept on me George
mm-hmm we got to take the history of our
blue jeans story into the future and
your segment where the forecast of the
jeans the future and no one can predict
fashion George if anybody can you can
what was something yep vidphone get me
Sam Gallagher try every number James

alternate suggestions uh yeah let's see
image search circa nineteen fifty-nine
blue jeans male sex appeal searching
nexus access other data banks um you're
perfect a fashion source and alter image
you has to be reminded search on Homer
image data bank is very expensive and
likely to exceed your monthly online
budget cost is for 85 per thousand image
scan just do it I'll fight that one
later searching did not understand last
command do it do it do it understood
okay still unable to reach Sam Gallagher
however the teleconferencing call you
requested is ready have snap corporate
Los Angeles and Paris office both online
who you wish to be seen preview as
originating of the conference call you
wish to choose resolution on live video
whatever default settings confirmed you
have to be reminded full video from
Paris is expensive at 355 per minute the
call of less than a minute will exceed
your budget got it top resolution on
George face only under the be understood
conference call open you might think I
showed this video to entertain you that
was not my intention every sentence
there has implications for fundamental
research in computer science that has
not been done yet and I'll take you
through one set of them and there's a
whole talk if you want about this whole
area of what should be done this video
assumes we have silky interfaces we can
talk to computers and human beings
interchangeably all the time using
speech language very vision whatever and
it kind of goes away from the old wimpy
information windows I can't miles and so
on there is no mousing there anywhere it
is all speech interaction and and it
uses language and it assumes that you
will tolerate error and ambiguity you
say you bet and if you didn't know
understand it you ask a clarification
dialogue saying do you mean yes or no
whatever that's what we do as people you
know it doesn't have to be everything
and learn from experience incremental
non-intrusive knowledge acquisition you
say darn saying would you care to define
it and it says no I don't want to find
it now we all figure it out there is
implication saying if I did define it
how would i define it however what does
it mean for a system to learn language
on the fly right there's a whole set of
things that need to be done
intelligent health advice and tutoring
enthusiasm detected would you want to
see a large screen that means it knows
there is a large screen in the room
there's context of Airness and it kind
of knows that people probably want to
see a larger screen or a smaller screen
in another part of the thing it says
it's going to cost you ten times more do
you want to spend the money all of those
implications have implications for us in
computer science system design until we
begin to think alike that we are going
to deal with computers like we deal with
people we'll never get there okay and
that is the fundamental part of this
thing and then there's assumption there
are a large number of intelligent agents
at your beck and call that look at your
email and tell you how many messages you
have forgotten and what you've read and
what you're not done or something
somebody saying get me this person try
every number doesn't mean they're going
to call all numbers in Los Angeles it
understands language it says is this guy
and there's a phone number you maybe
have three or four and it does it and
you don't spend the time doing it right
so those are the kinds of things that
are implied when you talk about human
centric design in the future the problem
is we have been so starved with
computational resources in the past
every time these things came up we said
that's too expensive eek an do it and
then you threw it where we have no such
excuse anymore for all practical
purposes we have unlimited computation
unlimited memory and unlimited bandwidth
if you are in a world where everything
is unlimited you don't have any excuse
by saying I can't do it because I don't
have enough computing power okay that's
to deal with the human things the the
biggest elephant on the in the room in
the Indian AMA files big elephant the
elephant in the room is we are entering
we have been in a world
where we have a lot of information and
we don't have enough time and it's
getting worse every day and it will get
even more worse because with unlimited
memories computers can store all kinds
of staff and you need to know some of it
and you don't need to know most of it
fortunately this is another problem
where people have paid attention to and
looked at it for many years I don't know
how many of you know about named Herbert
Simon he is the only Nobel Prize winner
in computer scientist he was the founder
of the field of artificial intelligence
but it's also done other things in
economics and political science and
cognitive science and so on and he is
famous for two things one he said when
people all don't always make rational
decisions when you overload them with
information they simply give up and do
the best they can they find good enough
solutions and the second thing he said
was when you have too much information
you have to figure out what you need to
know the need to know principal and he
gave this talk in 1969 okay and I want
to kind of tell you about these and you
know basically this belt and he used to
use the phrase wealth of information and
scarcity of attention I thought that was
too complex a phrase i changed it to too
much information in too little time it
means the same thing so what he said was
think of yourself as the president of
United States there are so many things
you need to know and you don't have
enough time to deal with all of those
and therefore you need an organization
he was also a organizational theory
expert so he wasn't thinking about it
from a human organization point of view
but later on he kind of continued to
stress the point through the
through the last 30 40 years where he
kind of went back and said the same
thing applies to you know computer
science also so what he said is if
you're the president of United States
and you have this problem of too much
information what do you do you create an
organization with a thousand assistance
there's a chief of staff then there is
various other experts in different areas
and they have staff and they have staff
so might show now they're about in the
executive office building and white
house they're about thousand people more
or more everybody has a very narrow
responsibility and then they filter it
up and then the next level boss says
this is not important i'm not going to
pass it up to the chief of staff so
there is a whole set of ideas around
what is called overview zoom filter and
details-on-demand when the president
gets it he gets an overview that's been
filtered up the chain and then you say
oh I wanted to see more about this you
can zoom in on it and then you say I
wanted this information to be
reorganized filter it in this way throw
away all these other unnecessary
information and then you know you I want
to see more about this article that
appeared in in Jerusalem or India or
something you can click on it this
hyperlink it get you can read the whole
article so the president has information
at his fingertips that is being
structured and organized by an army of
assistance I want one of those you want
one of those but we can't afford a
thousand people were not the president
united state but in this day of
unlimited computation memory and
bandwidth we can all have such things
these are called intelligent agents so
we need to begin to build a little agent
that only deal with my paying of my
bills another agent that only deals with
something else so there's probably a
thousand such startup businesses that
you can create each one creating
cognition amplifier or a summarization a
hyperlink and so on Simon was a strange
person I remember arguing with him about
the following fact he believed in this
too much information principal Newton or
principal so vehemently passionately
that he said I never read newspapers I
never watch TV news I said you can't be
serious you know you everybody reads
newspapers we either he said if you'd
read newspapers because it's
entertainment that's okay but if you say
it you need to know there's no need to
know what is in the newspaper anytime
anywhere there is no absolutely no need
to know if something is important to you
somebody will tell it to you you know
otherwise you know if you want to say
that's entertainment you look at
facebook I'm not a member I don't have
an account on Facebook because I said I
don't need a Facebook account under any
conditions my grandson says no no I want
this dinner I said no if you have
something important call me and I'm
always there so the issue here is if we
are going to be in a world with too much
information we need to kind of develop
strategies and techniques of surviving
in this data glut and that's what the
whole idea here how do you do that right
so how quickly go through some of these
and then come back and kind of summarize
so the key principles of information
overload the first one is the one he got
the Nobel Prize for saying when faced
with information overload people settle
for good enough solutions in preference
to optimal solutions when a human being
human thinking capabilities are
overloaded people use strategies and
tactics of optimal least computation in
computer science terms
I usually have this problem when when i
was using computers in 1960 right 59 we
didn't have enough memory so what did we
do we did some computation printed out
bunch of cards and then fed it back and
so you know so whenever you have
limitations on your memory or bandwidth
or computation time and I say give me an
algorithm for that you can simply say
this my I can't tell you how long this
is my algorithm will take it will take
whatever length of time you better stay
escaped with it and that is the problem
I was mentioning earlier you know we are
impatient i get this progress bar when
i'm downloading something it doesn't
tell me anything about how long it's
going to take it'll go boom boom boom
boom and then they'll stop for a long
time nothing is happening I have looked
at the progress bars and said any simple
learning system would could have figured
out how much time it's going to take and
at least given me an approximate in a
progress bar that's proportional to the
time and they don't do it and the same
thing about hourglass I don't have a
clue how long this hourglass is going to
go and these things happen because
people are dismissive of average users
use of the computers they think they're
not important only my me I'm the
designer I know what the right thing to
do is I'm going to do it my way tough
luck and this is what the mindset we
have to get how tough we have to get out
of this mindset and so the issue here is
what are the approximate algorithms we
that would produce good enough solutions
we don't teach NF of these algorithms
and you know in fact there you know
people have gotten prizes and for this
kind of thing already approximate
algorithms is a well-developed field in
computer science but not across the
whole spectrum of algorithms we deal
with and we need to begin to do research
in this area
and the second is wealth of information
and scarcity of attention we need to use
the net need to know principle by
creating first thing is we need
summarization tools I give you a book or
oftentimes I get a message that maybe
three male three pages long I cannot
read them I that simply says I'll look
at it later I never look at it in about
nineteen ninety-three we had a student
called fuzzy Malden I said in a fuzzy
was very good in language I said fuzzy
can you look at this mail and tell me
what action i have to do create read it
understand it summarize it but only tell
me what I have to do I have to show up
at this place for this meeting I'll do
that or this man is asking for a job I
don't have a job whatever it is and
that's all it is right the best of the
three pages I don't need to know he did
something it was useful but then he got
sucked into another project which became
like hose which created the first search
engine and you know internet brightener
browsing search engine and so this
project never went anywhere but it's
still an important area assign an agent
that can read your email and essentially
this miss eighty percent of them as
family relevant and among the rest of
them kind of saying what are the
different things some of them are
informational some of them are something
else and others require your answer just
show me those with a specific policy
decision that's what president gets when
they give them a particular thing and
saying here are the policy options you
have you can do this this that this and
then he just says I want to do this he
gets the final answer to say the final
thing but he doesn't look through all of
the junk right and so we need
information structuring tools that don't
exist right now I believe they are there
for example CIA is using them and NSA is
use them because they're swamped with
this kind of data they have to
understand and structure them but you
and I an average person doesn't
have it we should yeah they because we
also need the same thing with swallows
kind of browning in information so the
most important thing for me are the last
to autocomplete is the best thing
invented I don't want just autocomplete
of text strings I want autocomplete of
the tasks if I go to the bank account
saying oh you I've already paid your
bills do you want something else no
something like that or if I'm you know
essentially you look at everything you
do and say what would it mean if I had
an assistant who says my like my
assistant does in the office somebody
called I set up an appointment end of
story and so that kind of thing ought to
be there for all of us and autocomplete
of actions rather than just strings
might be a good thing to start with non
intrusive notifications this is the most
important sacred cow that we have to be
able in system teaching every designer
you cannot have dialog boxes it cannot
have things if you are doing your in
designing ads you cannot have things
that kind of come and in my face because
I never look at them I am only looking
for the way the close loss windows is
you know unfortunately people don't
understand it if they want me to pay
attention the Google guys had it right
in the beginning but they've lost their
their way also it could be just either
passively on the right of the bottom and
you should be there for no more than
about 30 seconds and it should disappear
because then you are respecting my time
and if you respect my time I might even
look at what you're asking me to look at
right now I don't even see any of those
banner ads and every website every
newspaper anything simply kind of
blocked what you want to do and insist
that you look at this this thing and
ninety percent of the time they're not
relevant they're all trying to sell me a
flat in bangalore I don't want to buy
one and unlike to buy one ever if I had
you know some
that can do better that that would be
good so anyway I've been working on this
problem personally as as one of the
things there are two families of
intelligent agents which might be
interesting to look at one of them i
call cognition amplifiers the other one
I call guardian angels cognition
amplifier simply look at whatever you
are trying to do and see if they can
help you to do it faster better cheaper
and this is mainly learning kind of
constantly monitoring what you do and if
they're different for each person
they're my cognition amplifier not yours
and so you have to kind of designed it
is possible to design them so they will
be useful for things like buying and
selling email filtering and experiment
responding to actionable male news I may
need to know some news that's going to
impact me not necessarily all the other
things and banking and travel there's
lots of things we do every one of us do
if I had in my own agent right now what
I do is I go tell my you know assistant
saying buy me this book from amazon and
that's it it takes me one second and
then she might spend five minutes or so
so you're saving all that time if I have
to do it myself go there and log in and
all this takes time it's only a few
minutes and when I said that about
booting in and turning off I got a angry
mail from one of the system designers
from Microsoft saying you are so
important you cannot wait a minute so
that I can clean up your mess you know I
am you know I don't want to wait you
should have done it in the background I
don't want to wait a minute and
ultimately if we add up all the minutes
of everybody turns out to be hundreds of
man years of effort you're wasting so a
guardian angel is a very different kind
of intelligent agent most of us have no
time to look at all the things that are
happening there may be as typhoon in
philippines it's not important to you
there's a tsunami that happened ten
years ago and that killed in 150,000
people in south india and the coast
and it would be good would have been
good if we could have been a week it
were it was known that was going to come
within an hour and 15 minutes or
something if there was some way to
notify all the people that are going to
be impacted including the officials and
so on so that those deaths could have
been avoided that was not the case we
now have technology that can monitor
everything all over the world and then
filter zoom whatever you need to do to
make sure that things that impact you
they are brought to your attention when
they brought to my attention there are
two kinds of attention things that are
not immediately important they can go
into a notification rather than things
that staring me in the face saying like
a dialog box and there are things that
are so important you better you know a
tornado is going to hit your house even
if your phone is turned off it must be
turned back on automatically so that you
can be in a toll go into the basement
immediately so there will be all kinds
of things of that kind I call them a
family of guardian angel apps okay and
these can be designed and they're
interesting to look at as a research
problem and they have all kinds of
interesting issues you know basically
there we assume their mass customized
everybody has their own angels they are
not they're different for each person
they are non intrusive autonomic it's
not as though they're on your smartphone
and you click on it to start something
they're always on in the cloud and it's
like your heart beating where because
you want it or not and then they're
device-independent where I'm using in a
smartphone or tablet or laptop doesn't
matter they work they're always on
always present always working and always
learning so they're also enduring that
means once you get them started they're
there for life you can change them or
delete them explicitly but they're
enduring so these things monitor and
analyze and learn from experience not
only learn from
your own experience but learn from
experience of others and that implies as
you go to the third bullet you know you
need to understand by looking at all
this data use a similarity amazon does
that other people do it already for
other kinds of things but you need that
kind of access to other data which is
anonymized and privacy protecting at the
same time if I have a flu and somebody
else also want to have flu perhaps we
can all be told what is the right thing
to do use a similarity and tax
similarity there are lots of ways of
learning things like for example I would
like every every system that everybody
bills look at what I type you know if
you look at my use of word I probably
use maybe 10 features nothing else I
don't need all the other blood where
that is there if there's some way I can
get rid of it that would be good i don't
need to get rid of it because computers
are getting faster and faster but i was
very happy to see that Microsoft is
about to release a Spartan browser
finally they got the message that you
don't have to have all those features
you know that because you know sometimes
you know they've been built in and
they're there for 20 years and so so the
there's a set of architectural issues i
just gave you kind of inkling of the
kind of thing i'm thinking about and so
I'd like to finalize with my conclusions
i only have only four minutes or so but
my friend lazara said take another 10
minutes if you want because he has no
time to give me so I was kind of go
through i may not take me more than four
minutes but the main important thing is
i have three lessons i want you to go
away with from a cognitive science point
of view that you should always pay
attention more than anything else you do
any other features in the system you
know all kinds of other things that are
so important they are holy grail are
below this this important from my point
of view but i am not desired like Steve
Jobs
a bill gate so I can only suggest okay
never never under any conditions be
intrusive any system that you have today
that has dialog boxes and all kinds of
things that float pop up and insist that
you do something you should immediately
remove them and convert them into
notification service in the background
or something and not there that means
add should be not unanimity it should be
passive on the left side of the bottom
nothing else and I should not have any
dialog boxes I hate live tiles because
I'm trying to do something this damn
thing keeps flashing I don't want the
distraction I'm sorry to say it and i'm
sure some of you are responsible for
approving such designs live tiles you
know so replace it with this
unpronounceable acronym which is like
visi big right when I want to be
disturbed I will click on it okay and
and it's like busy big right with it so
glasses and watches make them invisible
I'm not going to lift up my hand in a
white hand all the time and look at my
notifications and other things the watch
when i when i use the purely as a watch
when I want to know the time I'm a look
at it otherwise isn't there I am NOT you
are assuming that somehow human beings
are constantly interested in your
notifications and the problem with the
notification is a great idea when it was
designed in smartphones now every app
decides they want to take over my
notifications and I am filled with junk
of notifications which I don't want to
read so I want to be able to control
personalize my notifications two things
I want to know right so these are the
kinds of things that intrusive designs
impact in individual lives and you may
not think my life is important
because there are half a billion of us
who will be using it or maybe six
billion of us will be using it in a few
years for them it is important if you
don't do it they'll go somewhere else
and so that's very important the second
important lesson is scarcity of
attention employees we need to begin to
think about tools that will do things
for us like intelligence agents you know
auto completion of tasks and predict
help with unpredictable events and the
my biggest problem and thing is
Microsoft seems to get shoot themselves
in the foot all the time they released a
new windows 8 I would have told them it
won't work on day one and they had to
release it and discover and then they
really is 8.1 little incremental things
anytime you design a new system you must
always provide a classic version I only
want to see my classic version if I get
any value out of the new system i will
use it otherwise don't bother me with it
but that doesn't mean you shouldn't make
improvements like autocomplete is a
great improvement give me those that is
that are you know and and make them non
intrusive and and I believe you know so
the same thing you know that's why most
people including me I'd still live on
Windows 7 I don't want to go anywhere
near the windows 8 because it's kind of
got all kinds of things hidden people
show it to me but I forget saying oh you
want to do this you know in order to
turn off the power you go there and you
know swipe one to the right then the
power button comes on it used to be
there all the time I just could simply
turn it off now I have to do some
remember things and if I if I use it all
the time that's fine but I don't and
somebody decided there has to be a
single operating system for whether it's
a smart phone or at
tablet or a laptop or a desktop there's
no such thing it's like saying cars and
aeroplanes should have the same
interface it's silly and so basically
some people should be using them my
brain and deciding so I have a simple
rule for every designer you say if if I
was Bill Gates or such as somebody i
would say he is a ten-dollar drool every
time you want to change the look and
feel of the whole system you have to
assume we are going to pay ten dollars
for every user to make them pay
attention to my new design so the every
time you do that if there are billion
users of Windows you're talking about 10
billion dollars is this worth ten
billion dollars if it is not don't do it
you can always introduce new features
you introduce new system but don't make
me say you have to use my design or the
old one is gone that's stupid and so
somehow you're not paying attention to
the fact I don't want to read manuals I
don't want to read anything it should be
intuitive it should work all the time
and if I have systems where you insist
on my doing something that I don't want
to do I will not use it and as simple as
that and I'll go away from you know this
particular system to something else
that's simpler for me so the this idea
that one size fits all but we must go
away from it there is no need nothing
that says everybody has to have exactly
the same operating system same in a word
same thing you can think of a million
different word configuration and just
like cars when you go to car showroom
there's the basic version and a luxury
version all kinds of in between give me
a hundred different versions of word and
I'll pick the one I want and if I try to
use some feature that's not there you
say oh I think you need the next model
I'll download it for you so it's easy
enough to do but it requires a lot more
time and effort and attention on the
part of the system
designers to the pay attention to the
people needs wants strengths and
limitations thank
