you
alright so we will will continue from
yesterday yesterday we looked at two
examples of going from Miami which is
some basic thing I kind of present it in
slightly different light went to a
multi-user setup I present one new
result to give an indication of there is
still interesting theory research to do
and in that case it was actually
inspired by a practical constraints
which is true for every system but has
not been absorbed in theory leading to
some new interesting theory so today we
will actually continue the journey from
the other direction again we will start
with antennas which are far away so I
take the same topology i use yesterday
and then walk backwards to something
which is more current yeah they are yeah
pretty much conceptually in information
theory they're all identical because
they follow exactly in the same model
and they've been different techniques
then become different names so that the
abstraction in theory leads to same
techniques being used for them yeah so
the reason i have chosen cooperatives
that's where how it became popular in
90's then virtual my mom came was
labeled by somebody else and so on so
forth okay so actually the first part on
cooperating mama will be short it's
mostly to give an idea of what's done
but i would spend more time in the full
duplex but not worry about self
interference with it because you already
heard about it how to get rid of it i'm
going to look ahead and talk about once
if you actually move puts full duplex
everywhere then what what are you going
to do with a network actually the
network design problem is really
difficult at that point okay so so again
we will start a journey from the far end
in a case where the cooperative coding i
will talk about the main idea and then
talk about two simple scheme this will
all take 15 minutes or so today all
right so we know that the wireless is a
broadcast medium and yesterday when we
started it apology which was a multiple
user be i did not draw these lines I
said there is one receiver two
transmitters they are trying to share
the medium okay however actually when
you are strong radiating an energy from
an antenna you are radiating
all directions may not be equal in all
directions but you are radiating in all
directions and so the other transmitters
are technically also getting a part of
that energy ok so it is there is a
potential for nodes to hear each other's
transmissions and overhearing somebody
else's signal means that I know
something about what you are sending ok
so then the the interesting question to
ask is right now I we totally ignore it
but it is it a way to harness it after
all your radiated energy energy transfer
is information transport as we saw
yesterday it is completely you know
operationalized in the Shannons formula
so can I take this energy transfer and
turn it into information transfer
information booths so we will simplify
the problem a typical theory designed
you actually go down to the smallest
non-trivial problem you need to solve
and in this case it's the real a problem
there is only one flow in the network
and instead of treating it as a
transmitter out become your relay there
are tons of operational issues here but
let's just see whether there is any gain
in doing so before you worry about
whether anybody would want to do so ok
so the overall overhearing node will
become a relay so this same thing and
then switch over the rows can switch
over if I have traffic the other guy can
become a relay and that both can happen
the same time ok but in this case we
assume there is a single flow you have
transmitter sending some information and
then this node will decide to use this
antenna and its resources to actually
boost my informations all the way to the
receiver ok so what's the option one was
the first thing one could do is
essentially store-and-forward reeling
that's multihop relaying but different
names in time slot one i will send
something in this case only reliable
decode and time slot to the relay will
transmit and this may be a lousy scheme
in many scenarios when some scenarios
actually it is a good idea do you want
to guess what scenario it might be a
good idea
there is no together here but yet we
will do that very soon but yeah so it
generally statistically is a good idea
when something like this happens that
this signal is weak on the average so
that this packet is lost most of the
time however and then the realtor
receiver is closer thats how is a
multi-hop system ad hoc networks and all
this were built on this idea that you
may have somebody else closer to your
destination in between you and the
destination so let me send it to this
and other guy will forward it long ok
now the it is a good idea it's been
specially very well studied but there
are cases as it was mentioned as it was
also drawn here that we are wasting the
first reception ok this as I said there
was energy transmitted energy received
we haven't actually utilized it if we
ignored it and in addition the
transmitter is silent in the second time
slot so so is it possible that we can
think we have studied my mo is possible
to think of the other relay as a second
end now which is just not at your node
it is somewhere else and turns out that
you can you can actually leverage all
the diversity concepts we have studied
so far so in time slot 1 here is one
another one is option number two we
would leverage some diversity concept
that the two antennas are receiving over
independent fading channels we studied
how that helps yesterday and then the
relay decodes the packet in this case
but the receiver does not it waits it
just stores the signal the raw waveform
it gets ok in the second time slot now
that since the relay after decoding
packet also knows the same information
now it has become a to transmit one
receive antenna my McKay's just so
happen that that antennas little bit
further away from you all right so you
could apply distributed beamforming
which we also quickly looked at
yesterday or if you don't know this
channel coefficient you can still do
something called allamuchy scheme but a
distributed version of it ok and then
once this happens both transmissions are
sent
the receiver now combines things if you
received in the first time slot because
it stored that signal and in second time
slot and then decodes everything
together it just delays its decoding of
the packet you can imagine now it has a
higher reliability because it is getting
multiple copies of this signal from
different places is such Lee the same
basic idea when you hear people talk
about distributed antennas right or you
do macro diversity it's the same basic
idea being used that you're sending the
signals from different directions more
copies can be leveraged to get more
games okay absolutely yeah absolutely
yeah so one way is you can offset a
little bit by saying you actually pump
it at a higher rate remember when we
studied outage capacity so if you have a
higher reliability that means it allows
you to pump it at a higher rate too okay
so there are actually what I am
presenting is like the most basic
version the most smart versions actually
ignore don't actually ask for second
time slot transmission if you decode it
in the first time slot so there is
actually ways of not losing spectral
efficiency in this case okay all right
so this is a scheme which is called
decode and forward there is a name for
it which is essentially your decoding in
the first time slot and forwarding in
the second time slot you can imagine
since the relays objective is actually
not to receive the packet it doesn't
really care what the extra bits are it's
only helping the information pass
through so you are actually not required
to decode at the relay so there is an
alternate scheme which is amplifying
forward where you actually just both
receiver and relay just store the signal
and then the second time slot the relay
just takes this signal itself doesn't
try to decode anything and just
amplifies with its own power and send it
long it's just pure amplification again
you can actually get at the receiver
receive all these different signals
combine them get a better diversity
system okay so one more slide on this
before we move on is just comparison of
these schemes actually this has been
I heavily studied tons on literature
audience there is a book on it so I
won't even bother to you know more
details but I will my objective is just
to set it up so that we can go to the
next topic and of course you can use
your going to do some exercises today to
actually explore this idea in the
afternoon so the two protocols are
completely different on basically on the
relay processing what the relay is doing
otherwise everything else is the same in
the product of something being
transmitted in the first time slot then
and the reader does something but there
is a decoding at the site at the end of
second time clock all right so the the
received signal at the relay in both
cases the same thing is some coefficient
channel coefficient and some function of
the data signal which is a signal
decoding you are actually transmitted
converting this relay received signal
into actual data if you actually
extracting the signal loud so this is
equivalent of noise removal which is
done in all multi-hop systems in a sense
internet which forwards packet actually
does essentially this is decoding
forward Network this actually boost
decodes and packet and then send it
forward so it's exactly same idea
actually so you're essentially doing
noise removal that is why you can send
signals at such large distances if you
think about it by a multihop coding in
this case the current decoding means
whenever you can do a credit decoding
you actually get an equivalent of two by
one system here so you get a diversity
benefit actually amplifying forward is
very similar there is no noise removal
you essentially take the same signal and
just amplify with your own power unit
because the signal would have weakened
after transmission you just boost it up
and then send it long the receiver gets
a little bit more complicated signal
from this path which is your coefficient
from the transmitter to to the AP but
also the coefficient which was there
between the two the channel between
those two but it still actually ends up
looking like a multi-antenna system just
slightly different yes
yes yeah so they are both good in
certain regimes then neither of them is
actually an optimal protocol so there
when the co in decon power when they
realize i click closer to the receiver
it is a good system because decoding
happens with high probability but when
this is further away you cannot decode
very well then amplifying forward
becomes a better system and you are
still passing some information along at
the receivers you have to wait it
because you know that one pass is
potentially more noisy so when you
combine them you don't give them equal
weight yes no actually you know it just
amplifies it all just full power it is
really the simplest version of things to
be there when actually we built both of
them there is a paper which I'll side
and then so they're both completely
practically you can build them account
for all the issues there you do not need
to know the channels in either case
actually receiver you do but here but
that you would measure any when a
multi-antenna system good
so I see the version we have built in
the dot 11 variant yesterday I pointed
out that you know what actually has a
physical layer real-time physical layer
which is open source we're actually
these two protocol actually variant of
these two protocol is implemented so the
way synchronization happen is actually
through control packet which are already
there in dot 11 so if i send something
and I don't get something back then
actually we both listening at the same
time because they are short distances
the transmission delay is actually not
an issue in this system if you talk
about very long distances then it
becomes an issue so in a Wi-Fi setting
actually if we built it use it and it's
virtually is we in fact this nearly
dot11 compliant version be built okay
all right so so the relays were assumed
to be half duplex in this whole setting
we'd actually you know either they were
transmitting or receiving but not
simultaneously so it's a common
constraint constraint we impose on all
network design and then you heard such
and talk about it other people talked
about it to that what if you could make
everybody in band full duplex and that's
why we have to going to go next yeah in
the co-operative systems or sometimes
finding the capacity region of a
broadcast channel was kind of a problem
right so actually information theory if
you just talk of information theory only
few problems are solved it's only you
can count the number of channels for
which we know capacity the number is not
more than this it's over with and now
for the recent trend we break through
information theory was instead of going
for exact capacity we now know how to
quantify base
approximate capacity within a certain
number of bits we can tell what the
capacities that class of networks for
which PHP is much larger than for which
we know exact capacity but the
approximate is actually quite good
because it tells you a lot of things
however beyond that we still actually
don't know many practical things what
the capacity of system is then moment
introduced feedback becomes really
difficult there is a fundamentally open
problem information theory which is very
very practically relevant is accounting
for protocol overhead so a lot of
Venice's synchronization messaging who
how do we do it we actually have no
fundamental theory of how much that
overhead should be or how small that
overhead can be so there are you know
isolated examples over the last 60 years
which people have tried to address this
but there is no you know big hammer
answer which has appeared which can
apply so if you talk about the open
problems these are some of them but
unlike matt like there is his famous
lecture by Hilbert who gave a lecture in
the nineteen hundred where he listed the
open problems yeah we don't do that for
you know many of our Theory literature's
we should do it actually I think we
because some of these problems are well
agreed upon in the community but yeah
good point yeah all right so let's go to
full duplex so as I as you all of you
heard talk I want to talk about why the
full ductless problem is hard i will go
actually quick to a quick review to put
out some salient points out it's just
kind of a refresher from it you know it
it differently but for large part of the
rest of the time i want to talk about
full do place networks that if what if
you made every node full duplex then
what happens you know that is actually
the problems that were design problem
becomes quite complex and also there is
a jtag special issue which is coming out
later this year so look for some papers
in that issue too alright so the in-band
full duplex exactly not new so in fact
there is a long history of ID
used in different systems and radars
were the first ones which have been
using it for decades now they called
continuous wave radars this is actually
a book picture I got from a book radar
book where and this is out of necessity
they had to be full duplex when you're
looking for a target which is close by
and the way you look for target is by
sending some energy and you listen for
the pings because you are close by the
round table term time is very small you
don't have time to switch from transmit
to receive so you have to be on the
continuous receive mode okay so turns
out that the techniques which the radar
community actually developed almost
mirror what we have been just recently
developed their single antenna version
multi and new version doing different
types of cancellation analog translation
digital cancellation so we kind of
rediscovering it in my opinion and then
the we didn't call it they didn't call
itself interference they call it
transmitted leakage so if you search for
transmitter leakage you'll find tons of
papers all right so with that the
question is why now you know I mean we
will known this for a while other people
have tried it if you go to Qualcomm and
talk about they already built full
duplex relays actually is a product they
sell so they don't talk about because
not a big revenue generator it's like
something they have to do for providing
coverage in remote areas so they
actually know about all the issues there
and I think the opportunity perhaps
might be because if the talks you have
heard this you know small cells that the
cell size is shrinking and that's
actually where full duplex at least so
far has been shown to be feasible in
fact the tests we did add rice we've
gone up 220 meters because that's the
longest cable we could buy we can
actually get full duplex gains in
hundreds of meters okay so if you
extrapolate our results doing 3 400
meter infrastructure full duplex should
be possible okay and then one thing to
remember between what I the gains in by
you know systems community does or you
know these experimental is that these
are gains at finite as an hour unlike
the gains I'm going to talk about next
they happen at some infinite snr so okay
so there's a the theory has some gap
between how it predicts games good the
transmitted power is I but if you're in
long-range you're actually the decay has
happened so much at the difference
between your power and is even larger so
the problem becomes even harder to
actually that you are even more
susceptible to errors in self
interference cancellation because that
raises your noise floor and all the full
duplex demonstration you have to kind of
like you know the next light these are
some early ones which came about you
know some we did Stanford had two very
nice papers Princeton guys wrote a paper
round there and since then there have
been lot of work so I it's no longer not
an exhaustive list of things they're all
what I call more like a discrete
component large versions of things
something you cannot put in a shrink
right now to a cell smartphones form
factor so so just the demonstrations are
all there they are all correct perhaps
and then impressive but they're not
shrinkable that challenge is huge the RF
challenge interference challenge is huge
nobody has done it yet so again if you
go at witnessing unless you do it I
don't believe it so and in RF community
nobody would actually believe you by
saying yeah eventually it will become
shrinkable you have to still build it
show it and demonstrate it that
demonstration hasn't happened yet at
least none which is public maybe
somebody has done it in a industrial lab
but we don't know about it okay so let's
quickly as I said I promise there is a
five minute review of what you guys
heard on Monday but it's slightly
different simplified over simplified
version of it why is it full duplex
challenging is because of self
interference so if you just conceptually
think of a transmit antenna different
formulas event now you're getting a huge
self interference okay that could be
huge depending on which system you are
and Wi-Fi that could be 50 to 60 DB
larger than your signal ancillary that
would be hundred and ten or even more
db's larger the bottleneck in full do
pleasure has always been actually analog
to digital conversion okay so it's
actually many bottlenecks are
but if analog-to-digital conversion was
not there if it was Infinite bit ADC
they can still be actually solved in
nicely why is that the bottleneck if you
think of a large signal which is the sip
blue signal which is yourself
interference is small black signal which
is a signal coming from far away what
you receive at the antenna is the sum of
the two signal which is a red curve here
if what you quantize is that red curve
ok so you will be getting red curve this
is what you will quantize at your ADC
even if you knew the self interference
perfectly and if you removed it in
digital you will be left with your
signal of interest which will have very
few bits of quantization your
quantization noise will be huge ok so
for cellular system that is any
reasonable thing you need to have at
least six bits and your baseband often
actually more that means the maximum you
can a already is around 35 DB of
difference between your signal tone
signal strength and the interference
chance somebody had a question
no no this is only for demonstration I
mean we just never send this single
sinusoid yeah yeah thanks this is just
completely for to show the idea so that
we don't get okay so in the end you end
up that somehow if you want to use
current ADC technology we have to reduce
this self interference before we hit the
ADC and that's where a lot of these
papers have been written to address that
wait I will talk about it so you can say
that's the next slide the why don't we
just use better adc's right so i see i
did this slide inhabit them but you
should to get the top ADC numbers today
what you can get there actually there is
a trade-off how the sampling rate and
your quantization accuracy in betrayed
it you can get more bits but you have to
sample slower or you can get less bits
by stamp and you can sample faster so
throughput just the number of bits
throughput of an ADC is more or less
bounded for commercial a disease things
that there is no moon it's not governed
by Moore's Law is because it's limited
by your thermal noise nobody knows what
is the consensus but actually this is 23
beautiful papers which have you know
looked at ADC technologies for last two
decades two and a half decades and
plotted the improvement in a DC and the
figure of Merit in a DC is effective
number of bits this is affected number
of noises bits and every a DC will
report that turns out that for a DC is
have only improved one bit per decade in
their effective number of bits ok so we
are only gaining one noiseless bit every
decade based on what you've seen and
that trend there is no reason that it
will go away so there is no because
first of all is not governed by Moore's
law in fact there are two papers which
you can read where they actually have
tried to see how bets you can make ad to
see what is the fundamental limit it
turns out it is limited by Heisenberg
uncertainty principle even actually
nicely formulate the problem and I think
the original Walden paper had a
different derivation I think it was kind
of nice a derivation in the Crone and
fetes paper which talked about that what
could be the fundamental limit here ok
but we actually very far away from
fundamental limit but our current trend
is where
very slow so we really cannot wait for a
dcs to become better if you want to
solve it so something has to be done
today so that's what they're the tons of
methods of doing managing yourself
interference and not design is actually
very viable technology you actually
design you ain't no such that especially
if you're on laptop you can design your
antennas which could be receiving on one
and transmitting on the other side and
leverage the design ish freedom you
could have you of course have analog
cancellation digital cancellation and
and so I have a separate talk i gave
about that you know in how this problem
with the experimental results lead to
some nice theory but i will give a sneak
peek of that here but what turns out
that all if you do all this even then
you cannot cancel self interference
completely
right i will show a plot actually so
doubling a raid is also an asymptotic
thing it does not happen at finite snr
again is the doubling is I will show a
plot yeah yeah I will show a plot you
could do that or you can do partially
different things so there are multiple
architectures they would have all have a
sweet spot that means for certain set of
SNR and I nrz would actually work really
well now you should build them more and
more capable you increase that sweet the
zone which they will work ok so so this
is actually one area where experiments
had to come first it because the
rotation mindset is all build some
elegant theory and then you will confirm
it that's like the most boring research
in my opinion if you kind of already
know that is there there's no reason to
confirm it at least on the research
pointed start building seems interesting
research is actually the reason to do
experiments suggest we don't know
whether what I did is correct or not
there may be a fundamental flaw in the
way I model things so you should have
some reason to do experiments and in
this case it was very good there was
unless you show something in actually
working experiments had to come first
then you can start to do interesting
theory so I think for me after doing
many years of what this was the golden
example I was waiting for whether I had
to use experiments first so we actually
built a system this was very early on
our first paper where we could do 85 DB
of suppression now we have gone further
9500 DV of suppression so but we built a
whole system using warp as our baseline
we had to 20 megahertz OFDM
implementation we had bunch we have
implemented all the schemes I talked
about and then in fact we built a five
note testbed which actually had links
where they were either direct line of
sight when they went through one wall or
two was the three walls to emulate what
happens in Wi-Fi bunch of different
physical layers then random month-long
trial in an office environment and then
I will just show one plot from that
whole exercise is kind of busy plot this
is how a real data looks like so the
point you will actually have to look at
is these linear fits between signal to
noise ratio which is measured and the
ergodic rate which is the expected value
of log formula okay so the two points do
just to answer a question there is a
half-duplex two by two which is a how
you would do which is this this line and
then this is the full duplex to buy one
that means that we used using two
antennas but then it's actually getting
also getting a multiplexing gain or two
by doing diversity on both directions
Reimer taneously okay so turns out you
actually beat out the half duplex system
for half the Wi-Fi range is even with
this very poor cancellation which is the
only 85 DB of suppression so if you do
95 DB of separation like what we can get
or 100 DB this intersection point moves
further and further down to left so it
turns out the full duplex the reason is
that actually the half duplex the this
whole idea that you get a multiplexing
gain of two is an asymptotic notion it
is not finite as a not achievable okay
in fact this full spatial multiplexing
you actually received for very short
distances you have to have very high as
in ours however yeah yeah good point so
actually either yeah i can actually i
have exact numbers so in this 85 DB
number which is i remember correctly
actually 60 DB or 65 DB comes from
passive design you design an antenna
carefully it's a wideband yeah they're
all 20 megahertz numbers okay and then
other 20 25 DB comes from all these
cancellation techniques so actually the
workhorse is good antenna design in this
cases okay did I answer a question yeah
and there is a reason so there is
actually our results are not so this two
by two line with confirmed there is
another nice paper written by somebody
else would he was not doing full duplex
work they actually went ahead and look
at the actual mayor statistics then net
we derived a model the model is not
really in indore actually completely
conforms with our reading so it was a
good sanity check for us that we are not
getting some random results and the
reason is that with very high
probability you don't get ranked two
channels as a result you can't support
spatial multiplexing
that often okay so the so I'm not going
to actually you know talk more about
this but I wanted to actually give a
little sense of how do for us doing
everything in one lab theory and
experiment actually plays very nicely
okay so and the thing which theory is
very good at is answering the question
why I related to a research why this is
happening it actually becomes in muffin
meal at least is hard for experiments
only to answer that question so here is
the same Ford schemes now I am labeled
them with the numbers they reported in
their papers they all reported that for
analog cancellation they get different
amount of suppression 34d be 30 DB 45 DB
45 DB okay but all no paper actually
explains why these numbers what's
stopping them from being 50 or 55 or 60
100 what is stopping them conceptually
what they're doing should cancel the
self interference why do the number stop
here okay and there was a very curious
result which we had noticed that we
actually built this system I said you
will actually have an analog canceller
before a DC and actually do some digital
cancellation afterwards so in fact we
had observed that if you just operate
one canceller at a time you get some 30
35 or 40 DB of cancellation from analog
some 30 from the de cannes digital when
you put both of them together the
performance is not additive okay so
actually went to call calm san diego and
i said this thing is a of course so and
then of course you know they agreed with
me because they had actually gone
through this exercise long before they
of court never published it but the
interesting thing is that people were
reporting these results where they are
not edit eventually many first set of
experiments people only did analog
separately reported number 30 andrew
digital separate 30 and then this
conjecture they should add up but when
the f it did the experiment they don't
add up okay so the question is why is it
a problem with the experiments is a
problem how you're interpreting data
okay
so so in fact v is v is given a conjurer
you know when we saw this result our
first experimental paper we sort this
must be the reason and we wrote this in
the paper turns out that's not the
reason that's incorrect conjecture so we
actually went back we decided we are
going to sit in the lab and isolate the
dominant bottlenecks in our design so we
we took all the things in radio we know
about which could cause an error the one
by one looked at whether they are the
dominant things eventually we isolated
our dominant thing which was a phase
transmitted phase noise so we had then
we had a model to to capture our
bottleneck and in fact the beauty the
the most interesting part for me is that
once you actually have the right model
capture dominant the analysis actually
explained out the experimental results
really well 34-35 DB numbers 45 DB
numbers we can we can be a very close
like few percent away from explaining
them predicting them in theory that's
the one paper which is published and
then second one which we actually
observed some interesting thing which
happened because of antenna design
causes some interesting interaction with
cancellation in the next paper we
actually explain those why that happens
okay so that's why I think the nice
interaction happens experimentally you
observe results but then you have to
build models and stuff to explain the
why behind it that's what SP Theory
becomes actually you know though it's a
tool to actually explain things is
nothing there is no conflict between the
two as I said alright so so with that
hopefully you know give me a sense of
how we put things together in our lab or
how we think about it no it's a
transmitter phase noise now there is a
Princeton talk which I gave and is
recorded so no shipment and where I
explain why that happens but today I'm
going to talk about something else so
today I'm going to take you guys on a
really very theory journey afterwards
some things you but if that's okay
otherwise i can switch and talk about
transmitter phase noise no
not all all up-converter mixers have a
phase noise is unavoidable so you know
when we do up conversion is e to the
power J Omega T is how we model them but
actually it's not e to power J Omega T
there is a random phase their fee of tea
it's called phase noise every everything
you would buy a radio chip will actually
give the number there okay that phase
noise actually turns out to be the
bottleneck for all our implementation
now it still is noise so that means you
could not have done you can build things
with the better phase noise by using a
higher quality components which pushes
your cost but eventually you still have
some noise even your test equipment has
some phase noise but just lower phase
noise is random yeah so no it's not it's
not always white but there is some color
to it yeah deployed it depends on your
bandwidth yeah and depend on your design
yeah yeah as we can actually because we
have analytical model yeah we actually
have analytical model so and then we
have measured exact data points based on
different you know actual components so
like test equipments are very low phase
noise so you can actually use the test
equipment to do a very high cancellation
using exactly the same architecture so
how low it should be I think it depends
what your target or cancellation is how
much you're getting from your antennas
and how much you want to get final
circuits so if your antenna design can
account for most of it that's great
because then your circuit design becomes
cheaper and easier to do
yeah so see these numbers so the reason
we can actually explain some of the
other result this is like the Stanford
results and the reason is because they
are using what board so we have to know
the specs of the radio so that's why we
can actually but this is a different
architecture so by doing this analysis
realize that that architectural II of
what we were doing and what they were
doing a different and this number they
have should be larger than ours this is
our so this should be actually larger
than our so we can explain the
difference also why that happens and
that the post mixer this is what you
call be post mixer cancelled it is a
better architecture than what we had
done for sure
right right personally I think the
non-linearity so actually I we can
analytically prove that so all our
results for linear systems if you
operate in linear and those are your
best bound so nonlinear will only make
it worse so if your cancellation is 45
DB you can't do better by having
non-linearity in there you can only do
words so the phase noise problem does
not go away non-linearity what makes it
more complicated ya when ya all these
implementations here all these
implemented yeah yeah they have known
indeed our analyses there is no nanya in
fact most of these results were in
linear regime of the amplifier they were
at 0 DBM they actually did not hit then
for a 20 DBM radio they had not hit the
nonlinear part of the system definitely
but I think the the noise loss of
quantization is for in this case is 84
DB is which is already way below what
they are we are facing here with phase
noise way way below
okay so so looks like there is a lot of
interest in that maybe I can talk about
it later on maybe they people have some
stamina left or after exercise we can I
didn't give a 30 minute version of the
phase noise talk but today I say I
wanted to take people on what
essentially what we are doing what I am
doing these days on full duplex actually
I'm no longer no longer running the
Olympics of self interference
cancellation because actually that's
beyond the scope of what we can do this
now i think is in the domain of circuits
people so that systems shows some
capabilities eventually now it has to be
optimized we are not geared up to
further optimization and personally i
find the the interesting thing is
Goodwin the network design so we
actually have a large and a safe project
which we started last year multi
University which is focusing on network
design principles now so what is our
roadmap so far we started with my a
multi-user my mod this was a topology I
talked about then we talked about
multiple access then we talk about
cooperative access okay and we actually
studied them separately and there is a
kind of historically reason why we in
theory also we studied separately
because these typologies are called kind
of separately in cellular systems so you
know they assume half duplex nodes so
either you're talking about downlink or
uplink in a cellular setting or Wi-Fi
setting so but most of these typologies
actually born out of fdd cellular if you
think that's why they were studied so
much in theory also now if every node
was full duplex actually there is no
reason to distinguish between these
typologies if you can do uplink and
downlink at the same time in the same
frequency then you don't actually have
to say something is downloading
something is up playing topology
everything is happening same time so
you'll end up in some network like this
where traffic can flow in all direction
all nodes can hear each other
potentially or some interference pattern
and so you end up in this complicated
multi-user uplink downloading channel
okay good
so the earlier on the difference between
anything there was a spectrometer
sitting in my life courses let's say
what was designed in the widest land
learn more about noise suppression so
you can get a lot more bitch going to
make sure
right i mean is 95 was not single person
talking so the cdma is not single person
talks to change we do not know yet I
think the network design has not been
answered that's why I think is enough
yeah it is not slam dunk yeah Mia yeah
and the other thing is that you know so
there is this a kind of people whenever
there is a new physical layer ID or
somehow the idea comes around the
immediate tendons thinking is that now
it will replace everything else we do
but that should thats not it happens you
only get a new mode in the system which
is useful in certain SNR or location or
interference scenarios you know if you
look at Wi-Fi it has some I don't know
NN had 126 different modes you know
multiplexing diversity code rates
modulation rates all optimized for some
specific point in the system right
that's how I would think that if full
duplex does make it to any other system
it will be more that if it is not a good
idea you operate in the legacy half mode
half duplex mode but if it is a good
idea than you below it and that has to
be your traffic conditions have to be
righted usnr conditions have to be right
interfere and so on so forth so good
right right right right that's Oh next
to you yeah well that's that problem
exists today anyway that's inter-cell
interference right now but on the
downlink if I am sending that's what the
intercell interferences yes yeah so
that's exactly the problem yes
absolutely yeah yeah it is a problem I
totally agree that is why it the focus
isn't it yeah it is a bigger problem so
the thing is that is so the opportunity
in full loop places you can turn on more
links at the same time this way that way
right but that's exactly the challenge
to the moment you turn on more links you
create more interference so I said the
challenges in network designed and that
the jury is still out this is just
started thinking about it I would say so
in fact what I am presenting is more
like two conference paper results rather
than any substantial body of work you're
done
multiple essentially clients right just
cooperate in my mo
then you're actually use because again
you cancel yourself actually I didn't
see that that logic of that you can't
again that based on just some gut
feeling not an actual result yes yeah I
totally agree I am NOT denying the
problem but the bad that because the
problem exists hence the answer is going
to be negative that's not oh absolutely
you should yeah that's exactly the point
I am addressing we don't know whether
the capacity scaling is there or not
okay now if it is everybody on board
with this discussion perhaps maybe not
ok then hopefully that's the point of I
think we argue but hopefully you guys
learned that this argument is actually
important part of a scientific
discussion alright so so we have this a
nasty channel now you know we have
studied its different parts before and
that's part of the real I had actually
designed this flow to come to this point
if you I started with multi-user my
mouth then I did up think then I do
cooperative the point was actually I
wanted to come to this channel so now
you can see how different pieces have
been studied but you have simultaneous
uplink and downlink you have traffic
flows from into the infrastructure so
these are not flows they're just
interfering links these are where all
the traffic is flowing and the
interference pattern is comfy so we like
what I'm going to do is today at Liam I
talked about some very nice to results
heavily using new techniques which have
been direct information theory but I
will actually give these intuitive
proofs through pictures today okay and
these are very how should I say it's
schemes which will make you
uncomfortable okay that should because
it has to be very very very theoretical
schemes but you will see and I hopefully
you will see something at the end of it
okay so so this is what our channel
would be we will have L antennas at the
infrastructure so we will allow
infrastructure to have more and now we
will assume that although mobile have
only one antenna they will as for now
assume that everybody can do perfect
full loop like interference self
interferences or not not issue somebody
has solved it the we can focus on
internode interference which is exactly
the point victor n and then NJ is making
that that's where the big problem lies
and we were going to just study that ok
now we will have 2k flows each node has
an uplink flow and a downlink flow ok so
we'll really saturate the netbook
sending traffic in all directions and
then see what what can we do ok so I'm
going to introduce a metric of
evaluation which I hinted yesterday but
I didn't talk about it and that's the
metric of degrees of freedom ok and this
is defined very simply after the
definition very simple you say we did
study the rate R which was the rate of
information transfer and say if I look
at a certain rate from any node to any
node / log P remember log of power comes
into play but I divide in log P and then
I will study this ratio as P goes to
infinity essentially I don't want to
study the impact of noise I want to
study the impact of other things
interfering signals fading and so on so
forth so I was 30 degrees of freedom ok
so is also called a highest in our
analysis so and then I will define what
are my uplink degrees of freedom how
many degrees of freedom I can get on up
link by adding up all the individual
links from base station and some
downloading degrees of freedom from base
station to I what I want to find is the
largest possible degrees of freedom
region for uplink and downlink okay now
since I didn't talk about degrees of
freedom just as a point of reference
many of you are probably familiar with
this this formula that multiple if you
have multiple antennas at the
transmitter multiple and on the receiver
we can do spatial multiplexing and
support minimum of MN flows ok actually
this is degrees of freedom and that's
actually an asymptotic major this is
exactly this formula which
shows that at high ascend are you have
minimum of em in channels where you can
send data add at finite I said now you
do not see this effect also i hinted at
this formula yesterday saying that if
you have el antennas you have single and
nerd users on the downlink you can have
degrees of freedom is a minimum of again
antennas and two ends l here and a total
of k here ok so these are actually they
all related to the rank of the matrices
random matrices which come out so that
is not very difficult to arrive at these
results ok any questions on so far
because i'm actually going really fast
and coming sure so yes right this is
some degrees of freedom yeah ok so many
rapid slider introduced metric i gave
you an example and i'm going to give you
the result of that network and i'm going
to try to show later on why that
happened so here is the answer to the
question what is the maximum degrees of
freedom one could get the region so just
to remind l is the number of antennas at
the infrastructure in this very complex
full duplex topology k is a number of
users all single antenna if your number
of users is larger than antennas but
less than two times the total number of
antennas and the base station you get a
pentagon degrees of freedom and the
reference point is this is the time
sharing degrees of freedom if you just
time sharing between uplink and downlink
between uplink and downlink which is
what current systems do either through
fdd or TDD then you can beat that by
actually operating all of them
simultaneously doing uplink and downlink
simultaneously so that's what this is
all it says as you can do better than
current system if you are in this regime
that means you actually number of users
are larger than your antennas very
content beauty regime as explained why
okay and in fact this continues if you
actually have number of users which is
larger than twice a number of antennas
you can get the square region okay so
and so if you just look at both these
results as long as K number of users is
larger than number of antennas you full
duplex provides you degrees of freedom
gain okay and the conditions are
actually very to theoretical you can't
build an actual system out of it and so
first of all you need to perfect
instantaneous challenge state
information from all nodes everywhere
okay plus then you need or guarding
fading so this is what is it in area in
theory where you assume everything is
kind of known about the network what's
the best I can do if you cannot get any
gain in this idealized scenario there is
actually no reason to study this problem
further because when you make the
problem more realistic the games will
let should not be there but if you see
massive gains coming in this idealized
version then just slowly back off from
one assumption at a time come closer and
closer to reality okay oh yeah so how
does this happen I will actually show
how to achieve a point like this okay so
is everybody on board I must be moving
quite fast everybody understands what's
going on je n'ai yeah okay good all
right so so here is an example where l
is equal to or 2 l is equal to K so l is
number of antennas to and i will call it
an AP and then k is the number of users
which are for all single antennas okay
so we have to devise a scheme so that
somehow we can support to uplink flows
and to downlink slow that simultaneously
that's the 2 comma 2 means in ok ok so I
have drawn this thing twice just to show
that we are actually going to leverage
time variation over you know of the
channel over time so here is one
instance of the network when channels
may look like these these are weighted
channels that means this may have some
coefficient this may have some
coefficient and at some other time
instant fading good have I made some
other links happen with different
strengths ok so the internode links are
actually have time varying interference
pattern you're going to leverage that
all right so what we will do is we will
find two time slots
yeah I mean this is just epic very toy
so yeah you can say it's a very weak
link or below noise floor length if you
want to show it that way but actually
for me what matters is actual H here
that matters not just being a presence
of a link but the strength of the link
ok so what we will do is and citizen
ergodic version of thing so there is no
delay in when I decode the packets I
mean I don't care about the delay there
is a long long delay so if I'm allowed
that freedom what can I do so what we
will do is we will wait for let's say
this is one instance my current instance
how the network looks like in turn
ordinate interference look like I will
actually want to wait for another
instance in future where it looks
exactly the same all coefficients are
identical ok it may happen very very
very far in future but hopefully because
our garlic fading it will happen at some
point okay but i would like exactly the
same things and then what the clients
will do whatever signal they are sending
XA XB XC XD they will actually say the
same thing they would repeat it over two
time slots but the time slots are chosen
with this one condition that these
things have to be identical between the
nodes okay that's really impractical
what I am saying but let's see let's
continue this human me and let's
continue where does this take us okay
now this is what the clients are doing
remember we want to send uplink traffic
and downloaded traffic at the same time
so I told you how clients are going to
send uplink traffic they're going to
somehow magic find these two time slots
where everything looks the same send the
same signals I haven't told how it is
will decoded or anything like that yet
let me decide let's also design how the
base station is going to send it signals
or eight is going to send it signal same
for two time slots t1 and t2 in
somewhere in future so when this of
course has to align with other one we
will find that AP will has to now some
of scent has to send four messages but
it will use two x large to send it
however if you just use only one time
slot it cannot do it right it only has
two antennas it cannot its degrees of
freedom is actually two so it can only
send at least two flows
I want to send information to all four
flows I cannot do it in one time slot is
everybody get that because if I only had
two antennas and here are four antennas
so the minimum of 2 and 4 is 2 that
means I can only support two
simultaneous flow in the degrees of
freedom sense if I want to support for
simultaneous loads I had to have to look
for another time slot and then
essentially beam form or zero forcing or
the two time slots the way you do it is
by stacking this matrix with another
matrix which is at some other time just
a negation of it and then if you look at
this matrix and send it you can now beam
for not just in space but also in time
ok ok so what are our transmissions
again I want to emphasize even though I
showed them bits and pieces all our
transmissions are simultaneous so we are
sending these things over to time slot
beam forming on the downlink the smoke
clients are repeating their thing on the
uplink and then now we talk about
decoding we have decide how we send it
we need to show that you can actually
decode them reliably otherwise not
capacity I mean it's not not interesting
right so let's look at just first
decoding at the clients less this
isolate this guy we will get some signal
which is coming from the AP right what
is it sieving and then there is an
interference coming from this guy just
two incoming signals we have already
lived in self interference is 0 we've
removed it so the only thing we're
worried about is our signal we want to
decode and something which is coming
from other guy which is causing the into
it exactly the interference which was
being mentioned right now be as the
clients will have seen two instances we
will see something here which we call y
of T 1 and then we will see something
here at another time instant Y of T 2 ok
so we're going to combine these two
singles and decode them together how we
will do it will actually just subtract
them you think we paid a new signal why
take this minus this this will look like
that at the end of it which has no entry
Klein interference
because the chose this time slot so
carefully we said repeat the same thing
repeat the same thing when the channels
are identical subtracted that is exactly
the choice we had made so it
automatically cancels out all this
client interference but you have
preserved your own in fact we chose
these matrices to be full rack there so
we chose them so we can actually decode
our own signal okay although at the AP
is decoding is actually quite easy so if
you notice something whenever I write
this why is I asked me not putting
noisier so for all our signal models y
is equal to h times something plus noise
this is exactly what degrees of freedom
allows you i am studying something at
largest not i just dropped the noise
okay so now you have what is happening
is you have a for you have four signals
coming at you and is getting multiplied
by this four by two matrix for four
inputs to outputs so you have two
equations in four variables here you
have two equations in four variables
from this time slot there are different
time slots now you get totally four
equations in four times four variables
you can then solve them get your answer
okay so what does this scheme do
actually effectively makes a network
looks like this is this is called
interference alignment is well known
techniques not something we invented and
what it does it it allows you to double
the antennas effectively double the
antenna that the base station and then
eliminate all internode interference and
essentially you send now for downloading
messages for uplink messages in two time
slots so you get to uplink to Downing in
one time slot and that is your 2 comma 2
point good
that's enough yeah but there is no
notion of SNR because you there is no
noise irritations are very careful we
create these things that's why it's 13
degrees of freedom ya go
this important that we actually you can
shrink this time waiting time because it
is all single carrier design right so if
there was a way to actually leverage
another frequency band do this you could
actually do that in a shorter time
period without having to wait something
longer you're right okay but in its
current form this is the the number of
assumptions I had which I only hinted
quickly are actually quite problematic
you cannot build actual systems of these
assumptions but you can prove a very
elegant results which show you you know
in if I knew everything what is the
potential so you can have first of all
we have to perhaps wait for long delays
right to find this another time slot
which has an identical thing you may not
take long time people actually have
studied that it does not of course fail
well with number of and another client
because you know so much information
everywhere just not possible actually
you don't need an integral you need
within a certain ball and then that will
happen for sure and then the ball size
can go to zero so the proofs are all
epsilon delta proves you can actually
make it work yeah okay so but at least
it shows that if in super idealized case
you can get again so unless there is a
reason to study slightly more realistic
model and I will study that for next and
we will actually have even studying
model where the infant's information
about channel is now delayed actually
I'm get going to get something channel
would have occurred i will get to know
it in the neck next time slot so if i am
getting stale channel straight
information and then I will have no
internet channel information at the AP
also like this knowing what all the
links look like I won't need that either
okay so I've already backed off
significantly and so I look at a simpler
case here so here is an AP with two
antenna then I look at only two nodes so
now remember in this case actually when
you know everything there was no full
duplex gain full duplin was when the
number of nodes is larger than number of
and when it is equal this is the
instantaneous knowing all channels and
information full duplex the same as hard
duplex okay in this model
there is no gain from having lots of
information however if you had delayed
information turns out that the half
duplex already loses something this is
actually well known result that you can
get better than 1 degrees of freedom for
by 3d on the downlink and I will show
that scheme how that happens but there
is a loss because you do not know
something and then if you impose full
duplex now in this network you can show
that we delayed csic the channel state
information pull do place again recovers
the part of this curve now check disk a
channels have to change I need to hear
right in this case whatever your
coherence time is whatever you look you
you know you will send something there
but you don't know during that currents
time but the channel is you get to learn
about it the next time in strength so
the model is just T seconds of
governance but I'll net run-rate along
ok so it's kind of interesting that if I
knew everything full duplex is hard to
play same however if I know something
worse actually spool dupla seems to have
some benefit of doing having it over
half duplex now in the poorer
assumptions ok we are almost there just
10 more minutes one more scheme i will
show in pictures alright so the point
often all information theory will try to
prove these coordinate points ok and
once you show corner points you can show
everything else all the lynyrd straight
connections between different points so
we want to store the achievability of
this 2 by 3 4 by 3 points this 2 by 3 4
by 3 point and we will use is something
called retrospective interference
alignment and then a very simple full
duplex message exchange ok all right
here is the same is very simple ok again
we working in the degrees of freedom
setting we work over multiple time slots
and in this case we won't have to wait
for things to align we won't wait for
long future we just send one after
another ok so we have
in this from the AP point of view the
time I would access I will draw going
this way from nodes point of your
draw-tite max is going the other way
okay so in the first time slot I will
want to I have two antennas I would like
to send two messages to the node a so i
will send some message from one antenna
another message for another antenna what
the node a gets is some h1 x this
message plus h2 time this message it
gets an addition that's what I am
showing with this box it's some addition
of these two messages now in fact this
some other addition of these two this
another H times this message plus this
time this message is also being received
a linear combination is also being
received at node B this is happening on
its own I mean even though I'm wanting
it to hear this is also receiving
something in second time slot I will
have two messages but only targeted for
B now and I will get some linear
combinations which may look different on
the two nodes okay it's fairly simple
two messages for you in first time slot
two messages for you in second time slot
both nodes get some linear combinations
in each time clock in the third time
slot ap will go quite ok nothing is one
cent nothing that's what there is
nothing no sense and then now a and B
because they can do full duplex exchange
we have assumed it's perfect they can
actually will exchange the linear
equation they got to each other I will
send you my linear equation you will
send me your linear equation and then
now I will have two equations in two
variables and this guy will have two
equations two variables they can both
get their messages ok so the downlink is
actually done is the question
yeah it's called retrospective alignment
yeah okay because actually if you look
at it the AP does not know any CSI so
the delayed CSI in this case actually is
not being used by AP at all yeah in this
case is the right yeah it does actually
use it alright so the now we have to
design for a plane because remember we
are doing full duplex so there is
downloading the uplink we have to do it
simultaneously so i'm going to say what
the downloading nodes are doing so this
is what it is receiving these square
packets for uplink i will draw them as
circle packets just so that we can
easily distinguish apologize i chose a
same color but this was only the packet
a is trying to send to the AP ok so in
first time slot it will send a packet ok
and it is going to be received over both
the antennas and this this one this link
also exists so at the end of time slot
one both of them have some notion of
this packet ok then in the second time
slot B is sending so b is sending
something and it gets received hold on
this yeah that'd be some yeah it gets
received in second time slot at the AP
and also at the other node ok so I hear
something you have something from me
that's just because of how the links are
now because they are all sending time
division manner I send it when you
acquired you sended I avoid the decoding
is very mean ap decoding is
straightforward is just getting in noise
leslie essentially no interference right
remember there was a full duplex
exchange at the end of the time slot
when AP was quiet now the full duplex
exchange actually not just it has Lee
has to have a sum of these packets is
going to send even though I showed this
without it but the actual exchange would
include this sum and then this sum
because all these transmissions are
happening simultaneously so this guy
will send me this this guy wilson
that but this is where I will use the
fact that what i sent i knew about it so
i can cancel this out because this blue
packet was sent here and what i had sent
I knew about it I can cancel this air
again i get to same linear equations
which i had talked about okay all right
so decoding is easy to client decoding
essentially has these two linear
combinations here these two linear
combinations here what I have achieved
is now I have sent for message
downloading messages remember there are
for downloading messages to targeted to
a to target to be sent over three times
plot in third times where I was quiet so
I have a degrees of freedom of four
messages in threes time slot so i get 4
x 34 message is three times not four by
three degrees of freedom very easy to
calculate and then to uplink messages in
three time slots to uplink message in
three times dots i get 2 by 3 that's
exactly the point which we wanted to see
two by three four batteries okay so ah
whether this is practical or not we
won't actually touch that part we can
discuss it but it shows that again in
there is a regime where full loop list
is actually useful in a network setting
but it's not a doubling of capacity
scenario but actually you are already
reaching a point which is best you could
do if you in this 22 sunette work
scenario okay there are this because you
this is the best you can do with
instantaneous information okay so i'm
almost done some concluding thoughts as
i said this whole idea of how do you use
it in network we are only beginning to
ask and right now all our answers are
preliminary so often all information
theory work starts assuming everything I
know everything what can I do if that
shows gain then I say okay I will take
away some assumptions then what can I do
and just essentially as the communities
type of a assumption after assumption
and reaching a point hopefully which is
close to where you can actually start to
design practical seems okay again it
exposes you to as some very interesting
ideas so this is actually this
interference alignment is actually very
powerful proof technique which was
invented because most of the information
theory proves use randomized coding
ideas
this was the first time where we has
disturbed away from randomized causing
the structured Cody and so they actually
provided us a completely new toolkit
which was thought to be was not sure
whether we actually ever need structured
codes or not okay so with that I would
like to stop and and we will go to the
lab exercise part of the talk we will
actually you're going to do some simple
exercises they won't be doing any of
these advanced alignment and stuff you
will study both cooperating me more and
the full duplex and then your lab
handout same format same teams have
instructions today i think nathan is not
here but a kill is going to be your TA
and then if you are interested here some
papers for each of the four parts are
addressed which could be a good starting
point for you to read and then i will
stop it thank you very much any
questions on the alignment sure
so as one of the exercises you have to
read all the papers in the next three
hours
with the understanding that it is all
half duplex right like supposing if you
look at the channel coding how it
happens speech coding and all like now
everything has to be right right I I
personally think that it's not going to
make the cellular for a long long time
but Wi-Fi is ripe for full duplex
because Wi-Fi is already a TDD system
uplink and downlink are already in the
same band Wi-Fi is also only Phi and Mac
so it is much simpler specification
overall compared to cellular which has
huge number of other constraints they
have to work with Wi-Fi doesn't have to
work with those I mean we saw in the
talk that how many dimensions of
constraints you have to work with to
actually move forward in a cellular
network so I think the first target for
this will be most likely Wi-Fi and
that's where there are already some
working groups which are considering
full duplex in Wi-Fi and it will again
in mode which will come about most
likely it will be first only in
infrastructure not mobile nodes so very
likely case which we now study a lot is
where you have infrastructure which is
full duplex because easier to do things
there you have more design freedom for
antennas but you have a simultaneous
uplink and downlink flow to two
different clients they both have duplex
that also is another interesting
scenario so you mentioned that phase
noise was forming this kind of a I mean
bottleneck in terms of how much you can
cancel and so on right so given that is
that so assuming that it's not perfect
are there some schemes that you can do
in terms of coding or something to get
this uh not really ends up being just
noise additive noise at the end of it
after you cancel you can actually see
it's very easy to derive or be done that
in the face so there are these papers
right where they cancel a lot more Royal
now I'm wondering so they collide rink
there is a repot which is missing right
now is at least for me okay so i am not
saying whether they are correct or not
but is that i think it will be good if
they can oolitic lee or some model can
explain that behavior which is what i
haven't been able to do partly because
sometimes the details are not completely
open so you know you cannot actually
build a model which you can analyze and
secondly if you don't have the hardware
you cannot do targeted test so you know
many times when we find something we we
artificially can remove some bottlenecks
by setting up an experiment to explore
one bottle neck one at a time it's not
easy but sometimes you can do it but
that gives you a lot of freedom to
understand the system so when you simply
read a paper sometime hard to say what
is really going on and analyze it till
you have a full access to it yourself
but I think it will be good if be as a
community can actually analytically back
it up that yes it can happen in here are
the conditions and here are things like
that and then we have you know we
generally feel it bit more confident
that we can continue to use it in this
way or that way yeah I have a question
about the capacity region can we somehow
mortal it in a way we can get some cut
sheet bone type of thing yeah right
right many of these are the proof
actually of proceeds that way so you
will actually generally find a bound
sometimes cut set boundaries fine
sometimes to lose so often for many of
these you have to find a slightly more
slightly tighter bound and then the once
you find the mound you then you take
look at the degrees of freedom of the
bound itself so that gives you an outer
bound on the degrees of freedom region
then you what I talked about was the
actual scheme which would get you there
if they match then you you can celebrate
and feel very happy that you found the
exact degrees of freedom region okay
right yeah yep okay actually you have
talking about a fundamental limitation I
mean if they are not need transmitter
officinalis is one of the fundamental
bottleneck of leaking oil statham is a
bottle i kyrie how fundamental but it
was one exit face today and you also
talk about the ADC this has a right
bottom hell yeah do you have any comment
on the analog and an hour cancellation
part is there any night watching the
phase noise is a bottleneck for analog
so these numbers I had actually put
their the analog
insulation numbers sorry I'm going to go
so remember these numbers I said the
3445 you know that sir so at all analog
cancellation my question is actually so
consider about the transmission clock is
perfect okay you can using nike item
clock to do this or a very very low
phase noise then when you design the
animal can summation circuit do they
have any limitation edge the
transmission flog you mean like is
cocido which has use a very good clock
nike using this is not a clock jitter
with your ear which is just showing up
this is the mixer noise is mr. nice oh
okay all right i mean if if you have to
consider the transmit release is good so
is there any other uh so yeah eventually
you hit different noise so as you did
write another paper which is show that
if you make this good enough what will
be the next bottleneck you will hit what
is make model it yeah then you the ADC
is the next but most likely both
transmitter and receiver noise play a
role but if you lower them enough then
ADC is the next big bottleneck you face
so signally this and of course there is
no lon this is actually non-linearity
you can add but non-linearity remember
is not time varying so i do not consider
the bottleneck if you long narrative air
is very slowly you know like an
amplifier how it changes behavior you
can characterize it and adjust it if
precoding is done in all systems or so
but these could be the circuit is so
compact Lee because if analog design so
they cannot precisely can show all these
parameters here that d I have to now at
this point except my ignorance of RF
circuits so basically I think I was
anything i will say beyond this will be
just i will making it up I don't know
that yeah and what happens in a chip to
be frank yeah
and no not no not you know there is
there is a like a two path model we have
done that yeah you can do that but
beyond that it's not very useful in
terms of intuition you can generalize
everything but the analysis is the or
the reservations for company in reality
it will be less than that right so
because you'll have more complex multi
path and stuff right right yeah I'm
going to yeah yeah today's experiments
are actually will take less time they're
less challenging</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
