you
next up we have our home team university
of washington with loom of storytelling
experience for your tight-knit community
we are from the university of
washington's division of design um i am
jennifer this is Charlotte Catherine
jaywon and Kendall and really excited to
share our projects with you today loom
is a tool for friends and family to
collectively we've story's a bit about
how we got here and we're really
interested in the social experiences of
older adults and an area that is far
less and just explored or designed for
then for example the medical aspects of
a jade to better understand this space
we reached out to the Wallingford
community Senior Center and were able to
spend some time there we serve lunch and
visited a few times and were able to
spend time with people at the center to
better understand the social context of
older adults and we did this through
observation and simply sitting down and
having conversations with them one thing
we noticed was the popularity of
tabletop games like dominoes or bridge
and the director of the center should a
really valuable insight with us that
activities that people think of as more
sedentary or passive actually serve a
very important purpose to keep people
connected in for cognitive simulation
when particularly particularly moving
example of this at the Senior Center is
the knitting circle that has been around
for 40 years I'm getting people to just
sit down engage in conversation and we
ran with this metaphor of the knitting
circle as we wanted as we designed a
physical prompt for storytelling so loom
is a tool to just get people sitting and
talking I'm until we've conversations
and memories so when people talk about a
family photo they usually start with one
story and then branch off into many
different stories related to that one's
story loom actually captures the
connections between these memories in
addition to the memories themselves and
once we have this idea we want to try
and explore and expand it with yoga and
eg a great couple we met at the senior
enter and so we quickly developed our
prototype and then ask them to share
their family stories with us and our
videos a documentation of the experience
they had next month would be 58 years
he's 92 and I made in five he likes to
look at old pictures nice memories will
come back them no he enjoys that every
time he gets a chance he would love to
tell the stories but the story's
countless my father went after my
grenade you know Andy
and I think it's good for our family our
children and grandchildren to know how
can that I he had a hardship he overcame
and he never gave up my father went up
to my Creator you know and he made it up
here lots of friends although most
people passed away that's that's looking
at the old pictures you know it and the
he likes to think about people he met
altered his life oh this must be the
fact that my father caught up there so I
think 80 story comes on I you know
it's true to them nice I'm glad I
know all about it I know
so spending time with eg we saw how
excited he was to use loom to share
stories and recount his family history
but we also learned a little bit about
how to further develop our concept so in
the video and we use prototypes made out
of old iPhones and realize that the size
was actually a little bit small actually
just to imagine that the Loom system
could actually be applied across a whole
variety of larger devices this also
means that even old devices could be up
cycled by simply adding a wooden frame
to give it more warmth and a friendlier
feeling we also realized that we take
the complexity of touch interactions for
granted so for each II distinguishing
between tap and tap and hold wasn't
really possible so we decided to
minimize the touch interface and instead
focus more on voice direction to create
a more accessible multi-input experience
so the way the system works when he
tells the stories loom records them and
attaches them to a specific photo in
this content lives in the cloud and
photos can come from existing photo
sharing services such as Facebook or
Instagram that loom could build on top
of or people could choose to upload
individual photos and because this
content is in the cloud Ichi can not
only access his photos when he's at home
but also when he's in the Senior Center
when he's visiting family and friends
and having multiple devices allows for
the same type of collaborative activity
that prompts storytelling that the
knitting circle does that we've
discovered in the Senior Center and
because you can use any number of
devices the system's really flexible and
allowing you to tell a great variety of
stories so as you saw in our video we
toyed with this idea of arrangements but
we did what we discovered was that the
placement of the devices isn't really
what matters what's more important is
that loom captures the individual
threads that connect these stories
together for example in this photo when
Yoko and H you were telling the story
together their story is linked to the
gestures that they make on the
photograph visualizing the experience of
that conversation like who told which
part of the story and what what area of
the photograph
they pointed to this narrative context
adds a deeper layer of meaning to the
photos and these can be played back and
shared with family and friends so that
they can get details that are not
immediately apparent in that photograph
shared across generations these memories
come alive and we think that the
potential of bloom offers the ability to
apply to other contexts such as schools
the workplace or museums really any
other number of social contexts where a
physical object can prompt conversation
one of the most touching experiences
that we had throughout this process is
that moment captured in the video where
mary says you talk I know that you talk
now and it's because you had never
really heard him speak this is because
'he has some loss of hearing and that
sometimes prevents him from being able
to engage in conversation but we really
saw him sort of come alive and open up
and tell these amazing stories with
those family photos in front of him to
the point where we basically couldn't
get him to stop talking and this really
speaks to the potential transformative
value of loom like an actual loom this
is a tool that you weave with and the
outcome of this is continuously growing
fabric composed of the narrative threads
from the most important people in your
life thank you
Thank You University of Washington who
would like to go first so where are you
guys now in the product development
phase I mean is this something that's
out and people can download it as a nap
or or where is it still at the
conceptual level alright cool to explore
this idea yeah that that's really that's
really great I really find this to be
very meaningful and I really like it I
always debate you know there's there's
um what you're introducing is
essentially a microphone with a photo
right so the technology is actually very
very simple but what you're providing is
the context for this to occur and and
that's some and that's an area that can
work work or sometimes doesn't work it
really depends on the the thing here I
think it really can work I think there's
a lot of potential to the idea because
you know a while and network like matter
no facebook and add a functionality to
record you know sound over a photo and
that would be a feature for facebook the
contextual nature of having an app that
gives you kind of that closeness to your
family is actually the only place where
you really kind of want that kind of
depth for most photos I think or where
you'd really consume that experience so
so that's really exciting I really like
the brand I think he has a really nailed
that the word is just so good for it I
just really like it and and i think the
the simplicity really really helps
especially with the demographic that
you're working with there so you know i
encourage you to look at I haven't done
this research but any any networks that
pertain to family that already exists
you know could be threatening to you or
you might want to become that network
quite directly as a thought but but i
think the brand would work for both
right so so it's very promising and you
know happy to talk to you guys on their
time if it helped
yet very nicely presented and put
together on projects are very very
engaging video I did have to you know as
I open Barisan if I cry um that was
lovely and you did you know the video
was was was really well done and you
know a little bit saucy but that was
okay and you know and in fact that you
had you you thought about the
inclusiveness of your video and included
subtitles into those kind of a good
touch I kept thinking about almost like
the literal out of box here you know in
thinking you you kind of fudge this a
little bit about well the photos can
come from anywhere but i think really
thinking about how you move from a sort
of online repository of photos to how
many of these things do you actually
have and how does that picture get on it
and what what that's like um I you know
I feel like that would be incredibly
central to that experience of upsetting
it up I think that thought that would
feel really important and I think it's
worth spending time on that much like
you had about okie all I can't do all
that swiping and stuff we knew you'd
have a very simple interaction so how do
you make that whole setup experience
simple I think would be vehicle but
really nice project yeah I am I commend
you guys on the video storytelling and
there's this little detail which
probably everybody noticed but I you
know on viewing it a second time noticed
again which is the fact that the wife of
the participant central participant is
actually narrating the story which you
you sort of forget the storytelling
elegance of that as a you know it's not
you guys telling the story it's it's
actually you know somebody who's been
affected by the concept and seen the
transformative effect it had on on on
their honor so that that video is really
quite masterful congratulations on that
I feel like the concept I feel very
similar like there's a lot of
just because it's such a simple idea of
tying so the narrow the storytelling to
the to the picture and having that
recording and the sharing and the sort
of longevity of that idea those ideas
and stories for a family it's such a
simple thing that but there's so many
kind of horrible barriers for getting
you know even those photographs
digitized and where to put them in the
setup experience and again I feel like
it said you definitely skipped over a
lot of that detail and maybe it's all
done and you know I don't know the
extent of which you've explored this but
it feels like um many of those many of
the the power of this idea would come to
life in those moments and the fact that
it would be a very successful service
and i'm sure would have actual real
commercial value if you could if you
could get those experiences nailed and
really really think about that kind of
you know that long long user experience
from from first touch to several years
later a relative stumbling upon and
hearing the story for the first time so
there's some great work here i encourage
you to keep going it's really really
solid
any questions from the audience richard
banks this is great really enjoyed it I
really like that idea particularly of
giving old devices a second life that
kind of renewal I think one question for
you is actually about the future as much
about the system as it is currently
because what you're doing to some extent
is building a system of legacy so
there's a question now what happens to
all this content and what happens to all
the artifacts when these people
unfortunately have kind of passed away
and I wonder what impact that has on how
you think about the service is there a
commitment you can make to these kinds
of services and systems that maybe last
30 40 50 years as these objects become
an important central part of her
family's to to reminisce about people
who were you know a part of their
ancestry we thought at all about that
kind of a long term of these kinds of
systems and we thought some about that
mostly that that we saw this and as an
experience for these older people but
also really as an experience for
ourselves to like if you think about
your grandparents and the kinds of
stories that they have that you haven't
captured and they're getting older and
older so really any generation below or
you know after would benefit from that
and so yeah I guess for us it was kind
of also thinking of a different way to
archive things that people share with
you right so every time we've shared
this concept with people are even kind
of personal places we came from as oh I
have a grandparent with Alzheimer's or
oh I have a grandparent who write lived
through World War two and these are all
experiences that start vanishing even
before that person's maybe passed away
because those intricacies just aren't
really there anymore so yes yeah I don't
know if we understood your question
quite correctly but um I guess yeah we
imagine that I guess no matter where
technology or systems that would hold
this kind of content go um there does be
people who want that there because you
always will care about your own personal
family and I think even business people
who want to just like make money money
money right they
always care about their family and that
I guess was an incentive even though
they continue supporting this type of
content yeah thinking about it
practically listen on the real thank you
hold on a mic there's a question here in
the back cat homes hey um beautiful
project thanks for sharing and I was
interested to hear a little bit more
about your experience as designers the
course of this project as I do believe
that one of the most important pieces of
inclusive design is the inclusion of
people in the process that you know both
we as designers and then also the people
we work with in our designs change
through the process of creating some
kind of solution so I'm interested to
hear kind of what it was in your journey
in you know spending that amount of time
it was clear that you expect some real
dedicated time understanding and getting
to know the people you shared today so
love to hear more about that how was
that experience absolutely it was a
really humbling experience to be able to
kind of be welcomed into the center and
especially welcomed into I'm each in
Yoko's home really we had a really nice
like time doing this we started it like
have a really meaningful relationship we
like started we gave them flowers and
then we grow some of us graduated and
they gave us graduation presents and
then then we cried in the parking lot
for I kid you not 15 minutes so um that
I guess I guess add another note it was
also kind of a frustrating experience
because of how meaningful these like
short term visits and things like that
were there was frustrating that we
realized that we could only spend X
amount of time dedicating dedicated to
research and spending time with these
people and that we want to be able to
develop like longer research cycles or
like periods to this
kind of work especially with the idea of
designing for accessibility I think the
other that was sort of different about
our processes that we have this idea
that you have to go in with this
preconceived idea and then you go and
test it and see what it's like and we
went there without any idea what we were
going to see we went there with the
completely blank slate just to spend
time there and the knitting circle those
kinds of things that we observed turned
into the idea itself I don't know if I
explained that very well but yeah that
we didn't already go there with this
concept in mind I think we really grew
from that experience so along a similar
line I'm fascinated I haven't asked you
this question yet but it's it's it's
been in the back of my head so you're
probably 20-somethings who likely fall
asleep and the last thing to hit the
floor is your cell phone or your
smartphone right because like all of us
you're probably on it all the time and
weirdly the the import of photographs to
us has seemingly lost some of its
meaning I mean I think about an onion
article that said girl finishes
uploading 1 million pictures of one week
trip to Paris right like we just
constantly are flashing photographs to
the point where it loses a great deal of
meaning so when your embedded in your
ethnographic research in this in this
Senior Center not crying in the parking
lot and and you see the importance that
these photographs have to these people
as a not only as a memory but as a way
of knitting together an idea of the life
that they led how did that change your
relationship with the way that you're
using photographs on your cell phones
and the way you're taking Instagram
photos of your food I mean did it did it
change your perception of that slightly
maybe we haven't changed our perception
but thinking about the potential for
digital photographs is an interesting or
professor and kind of put it in this way
that we're able to kind of make digital
photographs
again and create artifacts out of them
even just with the photos and not with
limb system I think I mean I guess it
kind of maybe has changed our perception
or maybe this is something we knew but
kind of realized again even though yes
we are taking a million pictures here
one-week trip to Paris right there's
always that couple that stand out so
every for every 50 croissants there's
like one of me petting this dog that
reminds me of my dog that passed away or
something that kind of sticks in my mind
so I think for me personally it was kind
of even realizing we both trip together
recently to Asia and even while being
there it was like which of these photos
am I going to care about later is it the
cool lights in the elevator or seeing
the reaction of my friends to those cool
lights thank you thank you so much to
them
oh this is a wrap this is this was
really a group effort it was months of
liaisons and professors and students and
volunteers working together so it's
great to see you coming all together and
we all left inspired and hopefully
different designers and we have a
showcase tonight so all the groups are
going to be in the showcase together
with a magic up students and it's from
six to eight pm at thunder and trident
here on on building 992 and we also have
another showcase tomorrow and really
wants to say something all right so
thank you all for coming special thanks
to a few people Mike who comes here all
the time and helps us and has spent the
last couple days giving feedback Thank
You Carolyn I don't know where she is
she's probably out there with Sara but
say thanks to them on the way out and
special thanks to Melissa Melissa she's
coordinating this you're a liaison and
you did all the brand and everything and
so thank you so much which was awesome
Thank You Lily Thank You Lily for being
the sponsor and for Curtis swung to
actually starting a design Expo and for
a crit I thank you so much for critics
you guys were amazing
oh and for Steve connect Oh for having
the party on Friday so I hope you guys
can make it we hurt his got his house
looks really nice Thank You all this is
