of the conference or seminar Jeffery
Griffith who is one of the most
distinguished probable Asst from Great
Britain he's particularly well known for
his research and books in percolation
theory and other related models and he's
going to tell us why Delta or why Noblet
rather or why not thank you very much
for us did the weather I can live up to
the introductions so this lecture title
is an entry for the competition for the
shortest lecture title of course anybody
can make the lecture title shorter but
the course you have to balance content
with content if you see what I mean and
so this seems to me to be almost minimal
this lecture title also part was partly
derived from a conversation with and a
Holroyd yesterday you can perhaps work
out what the change might have been
given that I tell you there was one
change and it was not the deletion of
the - actually there were two changes
one was the lusatian - - in the interest
of brevity and and as Russ says why
nabla or why grad so the question it's
partly answered by this gentleman so
this gentleman is this is a photograph
of Arthur Canelli Arthur Kennelly was
born in 1861 and died in 1939
Arthur Canali was fortunately a member
of the National Academy and so when he
died an obituary was published the
obituary contained his photograph and
the first paragraph of the obituary said
we were talking about obituaries the
other day over lunch the first paragraph
of his obituary I think well I don't
know whether we would want such a
paragraph or whether we would not want
such a paragraph it is a very powerful
paragraph maybe it's typical at the time
or bitches at the time so few and only
to the few has been granted the
inestimable privilege of active and
close participation in almost the entire
range of development of such an enormous
and such a useful field as that of
electrical engineering comma from the
pioneer days of the Telegraph and
submarine cable through the earlier
stages of practical application of the
storage battery the electric light and
the telephone and onto the flowering of
the art as Rep
by the present status of electric power
generation transmission and utilization
and of electrical communication and a
few only has there been granted the
friendship esteem and professional
respect of so many outstanding
contemporaries in any art as are
represented by such names as Roland le
hui' Thompson Edison Steinmetz
Sprague Houston and brush in the United
States Heaviside Clarke Lord Kelvin
Fleming jenkin and priests in England
maska blundell and Febby a in France von
Helmholtz in Germany Marconi and Georgie
in Italy Nagaoka in Japan and many
others throughout the world but to
Arthur Edwin Kennelly was granted both
the privilege of such a participation in
an art and such a friendship and esteem
from the principal joint authors of its
development with his death on June the
18th 1939 harvest Harvard University and
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology lost a deeply respected
professor emeritus of electrical
engineering the profession lost one of
its early pioneers and most striking
figures and the National Academy of
Sciences lost a distinguished and valued
member so what can I tell you about
Arthur Kennelly is from this point from
the point of view of this talk is that
he discovered the star Delta the wider
the star triangle transformation for
electrical networks or as physicists
mostly put it the Y Delta transformation
for electrical networks or as we have
just recounted the Y nabla
transformation for electrical networks
the obituary actually continues to in my
regard to be a slightly disappointing
obituary it's purely scientific and it's
purely laudatory it has no criticisms I
hope when I die somebody will write an
obituary and it will have criticisms and
furthermore so far as I can tell canary
was entirely a man of his art that's to
say no women are mentioned no children
are mentioned their activities are
mentioned so you know it so his life as
a scientist was obviously a very
esteemed and all we know about him
through this obituary is his life as a
scientist I think obituaries as you see
as dress you know had he given this
lecture 100 years ago he would have been
very much better dressed than me things
have changed so he anyway here is the
the wine a bill of transformation for
Electrical networks is very well known
take a triangle somewhere in a net
summer Internet where it got this big
Network and you've got these three edges
these three resistors to form a triangle
and they have resistances and if you
replace the the triangle by the star and
you choose the resistances of the three
red edges appropriately by that formula
then what happens nobody notices the
difference okay so by nobody notices the
difference at least we can say the
following in the mother Network the
remember their whole load of other
connections and potential differences
and applied PDS and so on the same
resist there are the same resistances
between pairs of R is between pairs the
same currents will flow and the same
energy will be dissipated so nobody
notices when you make this change
because there are two other changes
which are very well-known the series and
the parallel transformations and they're
not part of this lecture though of
course they're very useful techniques
and this result is in the paper referred
to at the bottom it's very difficult to
get hold of this paper undoubtedly you
can get it in the older you know the
universities the archives of
universities which have been around a
long time in the United States you can't
get it in Cambridge University and
Google has very recently when I first
looked on the web for it
there was no there was no track of it
there was there was the occasional
volume from around 1900 which had been
which had gone to the web find its way
onto the web but not this one Google has
now scanned all the years around 1899
but unfortunately the volumes for 1899
are only available in snippet form so
that I think that means you have to pay
to get the full version whereas 1898 and
1900 are available in full form so maybe
they know you know somebody at Google
knows this result and thinks they can
make money out of it it's probably made
a great deal of money already so this
this star-delta transformation is a
little thing but this little thing turns
out to have tremendously far-reaching
consequences for a whole variety of
problems in our art that's to say
probability in statistical physics so
starting from something which is very
small what I want to show you is it how
it develops and much of that is familiar
to us anyway you know the start triangle
transformations for other systems and
then show you a recent application to
percolation and and it's very very it's
very convenient that the Jeff has
introduced percolation for each side
have to do that I wasn't intending to do
it anyway but you might find it nice
that Jeff's already talked about it and
in this lecture there are almost no
equations beyond equations at that level
this is a lecture by picture and there
is another lecture which is a lecture by
equation which I've never actually given
which would be longer and by definition
more complex so spin systems easting
models Potts models that sort of stuff
Heisenberg models there are also Y Delta
star triangle transformations for these
guys
so in these guys the the vertices are
allocated spin variables an easy model
is plus or minus Potts model it's some
integer between 1 and Q and so on these
these spins interact along edges and the
strength of interaction which is a
function of the edge so in general
different edges have different strengths
of interaction there's the J's and the 3
have some model so a model amounts to in
statistical mechanics as writing on a
partition function so you have these
spins you have these interactions you
write down the energy of any
configuration call that e you write down
e to the minus beta times e that's the
Gibbs formula that's that's the weight
of the probability distribution you sum
that overall spin configurations that's
the partition function so the partition
function is an object a function which
is defined in terms of sums over spin
configurations and it's the sum and is
something which depends upon the J's the
J's determine the individual energies of
interactions so the the general form of
the star triangle transformation which
is sometimes valid and sometimes not it
depends upon the system it and depending
on the system the may or may not be some
some formula of this sort here that
makes it work is if you take a star and
you replace it by a triangle and replace
it by a star you have to stand on your
head to see the wine a blur in this one
and as I suppose I should rewrite you
redraw all my new pictures again and
then there is sometimes some function
which tells you how the Khazar given in
terms of the J's actually this F
shouldn't depend upon I hear a word well
your can you see what I'm psychic
permutations answer yes leave it as it
is so some function which tells you the
case in terms of the J's such that if
you make this substitution
then what happens so in statistical
mechanics what happens is that the
partition function is unchanged so when
you sum over all configurations you know
something over is slightly different
it's family of configurations so that
some ands are different but when you do
the sum you get the same thing or at
least it's not usually the same thing
it's usually changed by some
multiplicative constant and then you've
put that into the normalization so you
renormalize by that multiplicative
constant so that the partition function
is unchanged and this this lack of
change of the partition function is an
indicator statistical physicist
something is going on and and then you
can do the statistical physics that
follows from this to understand
something about the process and this was
known for the easting model to Tuan saga
apparently but there are saga didn't
lecture on the subject until into the
70s and it was used by Van EA in an
early review of the EC model probably I
would guess in the forties it's it's
it's well known that such a case such as
such a such a such functions F exist for
for Potts models and for something
called the chiral Potts model and there
are various other classical quantum
models which such functions can be
constructed it's not universally the
case that whatever model you write down
you can find these things but but you
know you sit down and you you play with
things for a given system to try to find
a star triangle transformation and then
you try to use it and the name that is
most associated with using this
construction in physics is Rodney Baxter
who with his co-authors in the late 70s
and in the 80s made tremendous progress
understanding the structure of
statistical physical models in the
presence of a star triangle
transformation such was their success
and also the the observation the earlier
observation actually of Yang that the
star triangle transformation is useful
that physicists commonly call this the
Yang Baxter equation now little me
there's some difficulty talking about
the young Baxter equation it's the usual
problem we have to understand what it
means and of course it means it means it
doesn't just mean an equation what I
probably could be distilled to an
equation it means a construct it means a
vision
and and so you tried to find out what it
means so you might think that if you
read the encyclopedia of mathematical
physics you're going to learn what it
means and actually the essay thereby
Perkin or yang is not bad but Wikipedia
really in my opinion takes the biscuit I
don't know who wrote this is there is
the author of this Wikipedia page in the
room pried out it
so starts off pretty well this is the
introduction you know this is the blurb
at the top that's supposed to you know
that the bus conductors can understand
and it says the yang Baxter equation is
an equation which was first introduced
la-dee-da Yang bankster refers to a
principle in integral systems taking the
form of local equivalence
transformations that appear in a variety
of contexts and you think well electric
networks that sounds pretty good not
theory I know about that spin systems
I'll be able to understand this article
and then it moves on to the next line
and accelerates into hyperspace and
somehow you know there's a I'm I'm
somewhere here I guess and so this is
you know there's something one learns
something a little bit about Wikipedia
here this but this is but I'm wicked by
Wikipedia standards this is probably a
pretty good article for experts but if
you want to as a result of this lecture
or not you might want to think about
whether the Wikipedia article is the
right way of phrasing this because for
us the yang Baxter equation is just
massive in its a construct it involves
algebraic formulations and it's a very
interesting object a very interesting
vision in pure mathematics as well as
its applications in statistical physics
but for us it's really just the star
triangle transformation right so that's
these generalizations for percolation
even for the easting model it's useful
to see the associated algebra and
geometry in a certain way that I will
show you not the algebra but the
geometry but beyond that we don't really
need to know about unitl associative
algebras for the purpose of this talk so
so start triangle for percolation so
Jeff's talked about site percolation
remember each site is either black or
white bond percolation for each site is
either sort of there or not there two
states for each site independence
between sites bond percolation you do
the same for the bonds not the sites so
each bond is either present or absent
each bond is either present or absent
with a certain probability independent e
of all the other bombs there's some
bonds are present some bonds are absent
and you ask the question
what is the probability that there's a
very large connected cluster of bonds
you know the bombs form a subgraph what
is the chance of a very large cluster in
that subgraph if the graph is a lattice
then you might ask what's the
probability of an infinite sub graph
formed by the connected bombs the bonds
which remain present so a bond is
present with a certain probability and
these are the probabilities associated
with these three bombs and if we replace
this triangle by this star and the right
probabilities to use over here are these
probabilities so P 1 here becomes 1
minus P 1 on the corresponding edge here
and then you ask is this enough and the
answer is now you also need this through
this 3 vector to satisfy the equation
that capper is 0 where capper is this
function ok that's essentially if and
only if I guess it is a familiar so
essentially as one of those weasel words
isn't it in mathematics that's like
generally that means always if not
always but not always if you said I mean
I mean you know I like what's the best
place generally I like which means it's
true always and they wouldn't accept
when it's false so so whenever the P
satisfy this formula and so whenever the
whenever the peas a.replace satisfy this
formula then when you replace the piece
by one minus the peas in the natural way
then all the usual things happen the
local connectivity has got the same law
remember this is the triangle sitting in
some mother graph and you're interested
in what's the probability two vertices
are connected or three vertices are
connected than the fourth isn't then
when you make this change and those
vertices are off this off this picture
effect they can even include of course
the vertices of a triangle it'll be a
little bit careful because even choosing
a new vertex in this transformation you
have to keep track of that in in the
later part of this lecture then those
connect those that those those
connection probabilities are unchanged
by this transformation but since I think
it was probably observe first by Sykes
and SM when they wrote down the the
critical function of the critical
probability for the bond percolation on
site on triangular and hexagonal lattice
but it might go earlier to that earlier
than that and what you notice is that it
only works under this assumption so far
there's nothing here about criticality
this is just as
you know okay you can work this out in
ten minutes there's a ten minute
computation just to check that this is
this is correct
but there is the implication from
talking about yang Baxter for
statistical mechanics that star triangle
in some sense tells you information
about critical points and so it is the
case actually that if you take the if
you take the star triangle
transformation on one of these graphs
for example what am i get what am I
saying
take the triangular lattice here that's
the triangular blue lattice then it's
got a and think about P as a constant
for the moment each each P I is the same
then there's a critical intensity for
bond percolation and that critical
intensity is given exactly by Kappa of P
P P when all the peas are the same
equals zero so this this the validity of
the star triangle transformation in some
sense characterizes the critical point
of the of the the triangular lattice
which is formed of many of these
triangles so there is an interplay
between critical critical points
critical surfaces and the validity of
the star triangle transformation I
didn't I didn't say I didn't answer that
question is that a question well it's
slightly complex let me it's a very good
question under and let me just come back
to it later because I'll probably try
probably talk about that in a minute in
the context of random cluster models but
it is absolutely a very good question
and it's something which I think has
been well maybe some people have
explored it sufficiently but I haven't
explored that sufficiently I think
there's more to be said about that I
mean we understand the answer to the
question but the answer is sometimes yes
and sometimes no and I haven't really
understood why yes and why no I mean you
can see technically why yes and I know
but you can't really I don't haven't
understood the implications of that
so one thing now is that of course this
is just replacing one probability by
another and the laws are the same but of
course what we do in probability is so
the laws of the sames much more just
than the partition function the
partition function being the same you
have to do a lot more
to get extract information from this but
these laws are the same it's much higher
a dimensional object and furthermore a
useful thing to do is not to do this
sort an elliptically but to do it via
coupling so what you really want to do
is I could have a configuration on this
guy
and replace that by a configuration on
this guy such that the joy the pair
jointly has this property of invariance
so there is a coupling of the star
triangle transformation is very natural
very obvious what you do and that
coupling is very useful for what's going
to happen next that's what makes this
work the work I'm going to tell you
about intrinsically probabilistic rather
than statistical mechanics so this is
just a reminder that graphs in two
dimensions have duals the square lattice
is self-dual these triangular lattice is
dual to the hexagonal lattice and of
course that the the triangular lattice
has the property they define if I change
every other triangle into a star that
also changes the triangular lattice into
the hexagonal lattice so there are two
ways of getting from triangular to
hexagonal and and so you get an equation
and those two ways give you an equation
and those those equations tell you
exactly that the critical surface of the
triangular lattice is Kappa of this
should be aren't non bolded this should
be when all the pieces are saying it's
not the vector P all the peas are the
same it is exactly given by capital P
equals zero okay
now random cluster model so this is
partly in a response to Anders question
just mention this it's it's I think is
probably two transparencies it's no more
Nevin we're not going to come back to it
until the very end
this is percolation so you have a graph
you have an edge II an edge is either
open or closed black-white zero one what
if you like so and so a configuration is
a configuration Omega where each edge
gets a zero sitting on it or a one
sitting on it so you know reminiscent of
of Jeff's lecture so if if a queue were
there this would be P 2 the number of
open edges 1 minus P 2 the number of
clothes that is that's percolation now
we muck it up by putting in this red and
Nick admit near rivet of Q Q is not 1
minus P necessarily Q to the K of Omega
where K of Omega is the number of open
clusters so you look at that you look at
a graph you take a configuration throw
away the other edges that graph has a
certain number of components count
including the singletons count the
number of
opponents call it K put that up there
and then you end it with another measure
this is a very interesting measure it's
a measure it's an interesting measure
because as it was noticed by four tiny
castellane that it corresponds to the
cue state Pop's model when Q is a
positive integer so Q equals one its
percolation cubicles two corresponds in
a certain interesting slightly geometric
way to the EC model to the two-state
Potts model q equals three four five
correspond to the Q state Potts model so
this is a kind of so this is a estimate
Racal representation of Potts models in
which connections correspond to
correlations so it's a good good place
to explore the geometry of the Potts
model now this has a Y Delta star
triangle transformation and actually
it's written down explicitly here so
these what so each edge in each edge in
this picture has got a pret in this
performing there's got a parameter P but
the P could depend upon the edge so
expand expand the generality of this
each P data so this is the product over
all open edges PE a PE where P is the
parameter of the edge then the right way
of parameterizing this model is you take
the edge parameter P and you take P over
1 minus P and call that Y you can see
why because you've got a 1 minus P to
the minus Omega there that's why that
happens and then the capital wise have
to be given in terms of the little why's
by this formula and ury you require a
certain function of this vector of wise
to be 0 where this is the function so
this looks a little bit like the
triangular lattice critical point is not
quite the same because my peas have
become peas over 1 minus peas and my Q
equals 1 has become a general Q so there
is a y Delta transformation here under
this assumption but but and this
question is a very interesting one here
we have we noticed that this this is
also the critical surface in the
situation where all the Y's are constant
this is the critical surface of the of
the circuit a wall wise constant look at
the triangular lattice so tile tile the
plane in the natural way we struck with
these triangles copies of these
triangles equilateral triangles then as
a constant Y so there is a critical
point of the
in cluster model and the B Farah do
menial cop and theorem says for triangle
lattice that is the critical point this
gives the corresponding cubic in Y gives
you exactly the critical point so it
we'd strongly believe that if you tile
the playing with these triangles but you
retain y1 y2 y3 this generalized vector
of parameters then this gives you the
critical surface of that two-dimensional
random cluster model but we don't know
how to do that so the before Arduino cop
on theorem really seems to need all the
Y's to be equal and we don't know how to
get away from always being equal in fact
one of the reasons that we started this
work was to try to answer that question
but we haven't yet succeeded now in
particular this this this this works for
the Q State Ports models if QQ just had
to be a real number a positive real well
bigger than or equal to 1 if you want
the fkg inequality so you want all them
paraphernalia that predicts critical
points but Q could be an integer and a Q
is an integer this is in some sense
related to the Q state Potts model and
the key state Potts model I've already
told you has a has a star triangle
transformation or by implication here
but the funny thing is that the Q state
Potts model has a star triangle
transformation whenever Q is not 2 but
when Q is 2 I'm sorry when Q is not - it
works at the critical point when Q is
not two it works for all temperatures so
there's some magic about working in Z 2
as it was sub 2 which gives you a star
triangle transformation for all for all
parameter values but when you work away
from when you get take Q bigger then
you're you you need to work at the
critical surface you have some extra
equation and so this is even stranger in
the context of the random cluster model
so the random cluster model with Q
equals 2 has a star triangle
transformation only when this equation
whole when this equation is equal to 0
on the other hand it's a geometric
representation of the EC model which has
a star triangle transformation for all
temperatures and that is to say there is
no such equation and this I think has
not been it well it may be fully
understood by some but its implications
are not grasped by me it's some sort of
algebraic property of the of the of the
so that you're working over it's not
difficult to see why this is true what I
don't fully understand somehow is why
it's true okay now for something
completely different
this is a rhombic tiling of the plane in
this picture there are many different
types of rhombi or my rhombi are going
to have side lengths warm so of course
when you rescale and make the siding
thought I want so I'm going to refer to
one as the length of a ROM but length of
the side of a rhombus so this is a
rhombic tiling of the plane and what I'm
asking you to accept and actually I
doubt very much doubt if it can be
extended to the whole of r2 so this but
it just accepts the room this is an
image of a bit of a rhombic tiling of
the plane and rhombic tilings have very
beautiful structure one one very famous
theorem about rhombic tilings is that is
the theorem of Penrose one gets so
confused about these Penrose is Roger
Penrose
who who gate who established the
existence of a rhombic tiny of the plane
which is a periodic so a rhombic tiling
is any two types of rhombi such that
there is no rotation or translation of
the plane which which conserves the
tiling so there's a very famous tiding
it's in fact a an example of a whole
family whole continuum of tilings and
say he's his paper which was what you
might call a popular paper was followed
by three very serious papers of de Bruyn
in the early eighties published in the
Proceedings of the Royal Dutch Academy
they're very very beautiful papers that
show the connections and how to generate
sort of generalized Penrose tilings and
how to show connections between
two-dimensional tilings and slices
through five dimensional cell systems
and a variety of other rather beautiful
things one of which I'm going to show
you in a moment so think about this for
the moment is something completely
different unless you know the connection
well even if you know the connection but
you see the connection soon between this
and the star triangle transformation so
these are rhombic tilings so rhombic
tiling of the plane doesn't have to be a
periodic it's just a rhombic tiny of the
plane now they're from the rhombic tiny
of the plane there are two graphs you
can construct and it's a dual pair of
graphs so the first thing is you notice
that this rhombic tiling is bipartite
every rhombic tiling is bipartite
because every cycle has length four
because every
I call is a union modulo two of the
quadrilaterals that form the rhombic
tiling right so every cycle is length -
so it's bipartite so we can color the
vertices red and white such in such a
way that every edge joins a white vertex
to a red vertex to put a vertex or edge
anyway there we are now what I'm going
to do is join up the red vertices across
diagonals when I do that I get this red
graph that red graph has a property of I
so ready ality this is a word I believe
coined by Rick Kenyon so this red graph
concentrated on the red graph this is an
icer radial graph in the sense that if
you take any face of this graph it has a
circum circle which passes through all
the vertices of constant radius radius
one in this case proof well look this
vertex in the middle it's not in the
graph but it's distance one from each of
the vertices so if I draw a unit circle
sent to this vertex it is the
circumcircle of the triangle and since
this is true for all these phases every
face here is it has a circumcircle in
exactly the same radius and therefore
this is it qualifies for the name Eisler
radial graph so I see radiographs are
first introduced in 1968 by Duffing in a
very simple but beautiful paper Duffin
showed the relationship between rhombic
tilings and Eisler radiographs and
discrete holomorphic functions so he
asked for a theory of you know we have
holomorphic is a function of a complex
variable it has certain properties how
could we discretize this what are the
right what is the right way of having a
defining of function on the vertices of
a graph which has some property of
reminiscent closely closely can relate
it to that of the analytic functions and
this led duff into thought to draw pepto
to consider rhombic tilings are nice to
radiographs cuz I say radiograph somehow
of other right places or rhombic tilings
actually somehow the right places on
which to have these discrete discretely
holomorphic functions so very nice paper
very easy to read now of course I could
have joined the white vertices instead
of the red vertices and had I done that
I'd have obtained a pair of ISO radial
graphs which are dual one is dual to the
other is jeweled to the other
so do ality we know in in probability
two-dimensional probability in physics
is a very useful concept this is
do allottee arises in rhombic tilings
one more thing that de bruyne pointed
out which turns out to be extremely
beautiful and useful is there something
else you can do on a rhombic tiling you
can drive a train across it a railway
train and what you do is you come up
with your railway train here this is
this is one track this sorry this is one
rail this is the other rail and you
drive your railway engine across here
with your left rail and your right red
and when you get to this edge you have
to turn a corner to make that your left
edge and your right edge and you'll say
your wheels traverse these these these
tracks and you end up driving your train
along this blue line here so whenever
you cross from one rhombus you're
driving across the middle of a rhombus
whenever you get to the opposite face
you just reorient your direction to the
next rhombus you carry on in that way
and that gives you a blue track and of
course each rhombus is the meeting of
two train tracks so across each rhombus
through two train tracks you can make
their map of train tracks and there are
three of the train tracks these train
tracks are just the way a very nice way
of encoding rhombic tilings
any rhombic tining has got a set of
train tracks it's convenient to think of
train tracks in every possible way I
mean first of all is just being joining
the midpoint straight line segments
joining the midpoints or being the
actual sequence of rhombi that you
traverse as the tray as the Train moves
across it or alternatively just extract
the blue graph and allowing yourself any
homeomorphic image of that blue graph so
you didn't create any crossings just
think about it as a graph and so you can
ask about the graph of of train tracks
so we call these tracks de bruyne called
them ribbons some people all them train
tracks and there is other notation
around but these these train tracks are
really neat things so just me just just
summarizes very briefly rhombic tiling
generates a nicer radial graphing in
fact to ISIL radiographs which have the
plinth which have the primal-dual
property and in addition they generate
families of train tracks a train tracks
their rhombic tiling Seaview train
tracks rhombic tidings are pretty
difficult things to draw you know well a
Spurs are not difficult to draw that you
know you want to set off you only know
your rhombic tiling no it's a big object
and and so it's quite interesting to be
able to draw them via train tracks so
what are the characteristics of train
tracks so train tracks
the bottom here de Bruyn pointed out
that no track intersects itself
you see each track crosses a rhombus
side and all the sides across they've
got the same angle because that's the
definition of a rhombus and so because
of that property you can't self
intersect because you carry on round
you're going to get you're going to get
if something nasty is gonna happen when
you cross and that can't happen
two train tracks can cross of course
they track they cross a rhombi but they
can't cross twice because once again
you'd be contradicting the conservation
of angle so de bruyne pointed out that
those are two properties of train tracks
and Kenyon and Schlenker proved that
those are actually necessary sufficient
to generate a set of train tracks which
is comes from a rhombic tiling so that
those are two interesting properties of
train tracks now see if you're right if
you write down descriptions of trained I
mean examples of train tracks there are
as there are two examples of a set of
train tracks now I don't want you to
think of train tracks as being a rigid a
rigid embedding of a graph in a play I
just want you to think about is a graph
so you can move it around a bit I just
don't want to create any extra
intersections so this is a set of train
tracks of the square lattice the square
lattice is always it always generates
itself you know you take the dual it's
still a square lattice a set of train
tracks is still a square lattice you
know so you hard to get away from the
square lattice they're actually the
square lattice of which this is the set
of train tracks is the usual square
lattice it's the horizontal vertical one
it's just the train tracks give you some
angles they give you some they give it a
funny angles just draw it just draw it
it's easy to see but instead of taking
two of these sets of parallel lines if I
think five of these sets of parallel
lines and I adjust them a little bit I
move them around a little bit so that
you only get pairwise intersections you
don't get any three ways or four ways or
five ways intersections then this is a
set of train tracks and it's a set of
train tracks of a generalized Penrose
tiling an example of that here is a
Penrose tiling whipped from the web bit
of the Penrose tiling the original here
is the ice a radial graph that that
generates there is the ice a radiograph
there is a set of train tracks and there
you see according to the colors you see
exactly the five sets of colored not
parallel but non meeting doubly infinite
non intersecting lines of constant color
that could that come
stitute the train tracks of a pillar is
tiny now what's it got to do with
percolation so what sir you know so you
know a variety of people who worked on
systems of this sort certainly Baxter
and his and his successors and his
collaborators but not in the context I
think of Penn rate of well in a related
sort of more combinatorial context but
without explicitly realizing or
understanding or at least expressing
their understanding that what they were
doing was was connected to ISIL
radiographs or rhombic tilings so
probably I guess Rick Kenyon and and
co-authors certainly Rick were the
people to write down explicitly the
correspondence between these rhombic
Tanning's Ison radiographs and the
models of statistical physics this is
speculation so we're gonna do
percolation on icer radiograph so that
the gray the gray circles are these
circles that demonstrate this is a nice
- radial graph underlying this there's a
rhombic tiling so we got this graph here
this red graph and I want to tell you
what the right the right peas are so
here's an edge that edge has two faces
are just abutting it those two phases
have circumcircle 'z those circumcircle
z-- have centers because these are ice
array do all these black lines have got
radius warm and so this is another
rhombus and so that these angles are
equal so call that angle theta so P for
that edge the parameter of bond
percolation is given by this formula
that's the right formula if you wanted
to do the easting model then there be a
different formula for je in terms of the
angle theta if you want to do the random
cluster model there's another formula in
fact as a general formula that for which
which is got a Q in it for percolation
that is the right formula let me show
you why it's the right formula well you
know we're now going to go back to well
one thing you notice about this is that
if you go to the dual grass oat so let's
just establish some notation a nicer
radiograph G each edge has got a certain
probability of being open called P I'm
going to call that measure P sub G so
there's a canonical measure P sub G in a
nice radiograph if you go to the the
dual graph the dual I said no graph
corresponds to flipping this P of e over
1 minus P becomes 1 minus P over
that's just the geometry theta goes to
whatever it is minus pi minus theta and
so the dual graph G Star has got ISIL
got the dice the radial measure which
also comes from the ice radial formula
so this formula preserves the the
natural duality relation of percolation
measures so that's one reason why it
seems okay top part is the first test
the second thing is that it it satisfies
it gives a very harmonious explanation
of the star triangle transformation so
this is this has been understood for you
know some years this is not a part of
our work our work is to exploit this
statement so first of all let's think
what the star triangle transformation
does here's a triangle a triangle now
these because this is an icer radiograph
this each of these edges corresponds to
a rhombus so this triangle comes from
three ROM by stuck together in that way
now if I fix the outside I guess I've
heard David talk about things like this
you're going to look at me in a baffled
way but I'm sure I have David so if I
fix this external hexagon that's the
word you were missing I think SF could
you maybe smile then then the inside
they're exactly two rhombic tidings of
the inside there's this guy and this guy
one is switched one is switched from the
others in interesting move and if you
make this move then the icer radiograph
instead of having the stuck this
triangle in it it's got the star so this
switch of the this also switches the
measure so the peas here are now given
by this new ISO radiograph and those
peas are exactly those given by this
formula this is the formula under which
this this mapping is exactly the star
triangle transformation percolation so
what that means is if you're going to if
you have a sequence of graphs which ISO
radiographs you can make these star
triangle transformations either
arithmetic Li or geometrically and so
the geometrical embedding of this star
triangle transformation is a very useful
thing to be able to do because you can
think geometrically in doing this so you
can make graph theoretic changes to your
graph and you know that the that the
connection probabilities are going to
remain the same so long as these this is
the nature of the graph theoretic
changes they're basically flipping the
rhombus configuration within a hexagon
was that chitchat or was it a question
by the way I wanted to tell you you're a
really good audience to to what two
reasons you're almost all here since and
only one person has his laptop open and
it's not me for once so for once right
so now now so here's a theorem so this
is the main theorem of the lecture and
this theorem is called criticality and
universality so we have this family we
have ice the radiographs now we want to
conditions on the set of ice radiographs
and we just see what it says 515 not
much trying to go so but did I start on
time no chair five minutes late thank
you so so the two conditions are the
square grid property and the bounded
angles property the bounded angles
property says you've got these rhombi
you don't want them to be too flat at
least you don't want them to be
infinitely flat so the angles of the
rhombus have to be bounded uniformly
away from 0 and pi otherwise you could
have a lot of really flat rhombi that
could accumulate somewhere and that
would be could be very natural and it
would cause trouble with the estimates
and it might even and that fact it
changes the theorems to the theorems
cease to be completely true in the such
a situation so so this condition is
necessary bound angles property the
square grid property is that the track
system of the graph contains a square
grid now remember the track system of Z
2 was a square grid the track system of
the Penrose tiling was five sets of
parallel line searches it contains 5
choose 2 square grids so I think you see
what I mean by square grid so this this
we think is not necessary but at the
moment our proofs need this but we don't
regard it as a big assumption because in
all the graphs that you've thought about
proving this theorem for have the square
grid property and a lot more I mean if
you look at the track graph then the
track graph contains tracks then there
is a set of there is a subset of that
set of tracks each one square grid
that's se that's
so now the theorem is the theorem with
yuan mana let's see which says that for
any G in this family the following three
things hold well actually the first two
things hold in the third one it
shouldn't really be in the in the in the
beginning list so the first thing says
that these canonical measures have the
Box crossing property remembers Jeff
talked about crossings of boxes
crossings of boxes are really useful
things to have because you can bark
combine box crossings on bigger and
bigger scale to form infinite Luster's
and so the first says that the statement
that P of G has the box crossing
property basically says that the measure
PG is either critical or super critical
the statement that its dual because it
follows if every I so radiograph has
this property in a certain leaves du has
the property because its dual is
preserved by it still has these two
conditions up there then the fact that G
old has the boxing crossing property
says that the primal is either critical
or it's subcritical and the the union of
the intersection of this two statements
is critical
so after sly what critical means but in
some sense this this generic formula for
the for the you know the peas the
generic peas that come from the icer
radial embedding are the critical piece
if you take a one of these generic piece
and kind of if you increase every P a
little bit by epsilon or by a ratio 1
plus epsilon you will be super critical
if you decrease it by epsilon you'll be
subcritical second statement is so the
second statement is that that these are
the critical these are the critical
measures so this this statement includes
of course the square lattice it includes
a lot more than the homogeneous square
lattice it includes of course triangular
and hexagonal it includes what it
includes just about everything you know
except those constructions of below
brush and reordan about self-dual graphs
which don't arise in this category you
know that well you know there are
self-dual sort of hyper graph structures
based on conjectures of Ziff and Scala
which which Baylor and Oliver made
rigorous in recent years those are of a
different nature but apart from that
family this includes everything you've
thought of so far and a few others and
furthermore what it shows is that what
you're using usually improving these
things you use graph water morphisms
using variance under translations or
rotations or reflections or something
like that
but there's absolutely none of that in
this there's no gravel
morphism these isolated rafts have
generally no graph water morphisms this
works on Penrose tilings so that there's
no there's no periodicity no rotation
invariants it's that just the local it's
the local invariants with respect to the
star triangle transformation that makes
this work and furthermore this set G is
a universality class to which you will
say what is a universality class and I
will say well it's the following in this
case so here are some critical exponents
1 over Rho is the exponent that Jeff
talked about it's it's the one-armed
exponent 1 over Rho is the one-armed
exponent Delta and Etta are two other
exponents that are that are present at
criticality so there's a three exponents
present at criticality they're also the
armed exponents which which are okay
that the alternating arm exponents are
okay and the one-armed exponent is okay
we can't do the three onyx we can't do
the forearm non alternating exponents
that which are much hugs seem to be
harder to study but the alternating
exponents are the one-armed exponent
they there are exponents and those
exponents are constant across the class
script G so statement says but we have
no think we have no theorem to say they
exist anywhere in Scripture so the
theorem says assuming there exists some
G in this class for which well some
subset of this set of exponents exist I
think it's enough to assume that etter
exists but I have to check this I think
you need a and maybe the one are meta in
the forearm exponent I think I can't
quite remember now but this there's
either one or two of the exponents in
this family such that if you know that
these exponents exist for any one of
these graphs such as homogeneous
percolation on z2 bond percolation z2
then they exist for all these graphs and
they are constant across the entire
family of graphs so this is a
conditional universality statement if
they ever exist then they're constant
now these are only the exponents at
criticality all these exponents are at
criticality we can't do the exponents of
way from criticality and the reason is
because the star triangle transformation
and he works at criticality and we need
to make essentially a very large number
even an infinity of star triangle
transformations to go from one graph to
the other basically we have a mechanism
for taking one iso radiograph and
mapping it to another AC Raisa radio
but in doing so we have to perform a
certainly a large number and possibly
depending on what we do an infinity of
star triangle transformations and if
you're away from the critical point
each of these star triangle
transformations in ink introduces an
error and these errors gang up on you
and we can't control them so at the
moment we can't we don't know how to get
away from criticality but what we
believe is it will be true I mean and
they alternate yarn exponents all right
so so if me just remind you that these
things are known for site percolation on
the triangular lattice but site
percolation on the triangle lattice is
not one of these graphs bond percolation
on the triangular at its most definitely
is but not site percolation so we have
one system for which we understand as I
was as its pointed out to me the other
day it
well not quite you didn't quite say this
everything well at least almost
everything I mean almost everything that
we asked the question to more than five
years ago we now understand for site
percolation on the triangular lattice
but we've got this other enormous class
of graphs which which none of these
theorems export that they probably
should because we don't have SLE for
these things and yet for there's other
class of graphs we know how to identify
the critical surface and we know that
it's we have universality so I don't
have time to show you what's going on
but broadly speaking this is an example
of you know you've got a bit of a square
lattice that's not that that's the red
graph the red graph is a bit of a square
lattice you embed it you add another
edge to make a triangle and that edge
you can kind of propagate via a series
of star triangle transformations all the
way down the row and you do this
repeatedly and this gives you an
operation of alternative swapping tracks
so remember tracks have charismatic
angles of things that they're crossing
so each each track is labeled with an
angle and so this gives you a way of
swapping angles it gives you a way of
moving between ISIL radiographs as you
swap they're trying that their tracks
and it gives you a way of moving between
a bit of the square lattice which is
kind of semi regular in this sense to a
bit of the square lattice which is
totally irregular by swapping tracks
there's a track across here there's a
track across here I can swap them using
the sequence of star triangle
transformations and I'm doing that
repeatedly I can move the bottom section
up on the upper section down you can
swap the move areas of space around and
of course by doing it the other way I
can move this in
to the regular square lattice so you can
relate everything to the regular square
lattice for which you know box crossings
exist at P equals 1/2 so starting from
so you how this mechanism of moving
between graphs and that's the oven and
in the oven you have to put food to be
cooked and the food the input the energy
is the fact that you know quite a lot
about duality for Z to self to ality you
put that in you cook it repeatedly an
outcome these theorems for ISO
radiographs at least for ISIL radial
square lattices and then you have to
deal with ISO radial nonce you know
generalized to radiograph so here is a
here is a track system is a rather
complicated tracks track system of a of
a general I rhombic tiling and you want
to find a square lattice in it and so
what you do is through star triangle
transformations you turn it into
something that looks like a square
lattice you sort of move the tracks you
know you've got these this this square
grid you move take horizontal lines in
the square grid they're not necessarily
horizontal you kind of move them down by
making these star triangle
transformations which are which are
operations in the universe of the
rhombic rhombic tiling that gives you a
bit of square grid you've got some
information about square grids and then
you release everything back and you see
what you've got and what you've got you
have to prove to probabilistic estimates
which which is actually most of the
pages in the paper which are not showing
you what they are and out of this come
come to the theorems let me just
conclude and also give you a summary of
areas to be to be discussed in the
future
first of all this ice the radial
embedding produces critical percolation
and you have universality within this
class if the exponents exist
contrast that with site percolation for
which we know an enormous amount but is
not one of these systems so there the
the further directions are I think all
obvious ones are first of all start
triangle transformations preserve
interfaces so understand the geometry of
interfaces interfaces are of course key
to SLE so can you can you can you find
could you find a conditional exploration
process could you show for example that
if the exploration process converged for
the square foot bond percolation on the
square lattice then it converges to SLE
for all these ice a radial graphs we
think that might be possible but we
don't at the moment and
it find a connection to the good guy the
guy about which we know everything don't
have to do that
remove the square grid assumption it's
probably technical probably a bit messy
not very appealing we don't know how to
do it but nor do we will feel more
impelled to work on some of the other
problems prove the universality of the
near critical exponents again we don't
know how to do that we don't at the only
the only way of doing that at the moment
seems to be in the cast and papers of
the 80s but the cast in papers the eight
is used to get away from criticality
they use properties that they use autumn
orphism zuv the graph they use some
rotation invariants of the graph
I say radiographs don't have a rotation
invariance if you assume I wrote a ssin
invariants as well then somehow you're
defeating the purpose of the work which
is to show that it's the ISO radiology
what counts rather than the autumn
orphism so that's not something that we
wanted to do nevertheless we would
obviously like to be able to move away
from the critical point and understand
those critical exponents and the next
thing is all the or all the most of what
I've said and the probabilistic
estimates which I've not told you about
are valid for the random cluster model
so why isn't there a corresponding
theorem for the run in cluster model and
the answer is it's the usual one because
we can't control boundary conditions
with percolation you've got product
measures you don't have to worry about
boundary conditions they're irrelevant
for the random cluster measures they're
highly relevant because you don't have
fkg I'm sorry you have F kg but you
don't have independence and so that's
what we can't control at the moment
there's a be very beautiful to
understand how to do this for the random
cluster model finally I just want to
remind you that isida radiographs have
featured prominently in work of gel Keck
and Smirnoff on the ICI model and I
guess to a lesser degree on the random
cluster model and of course they're
connected because because of the
connection through two potential theory
you know to through discrete analytic
functions to potential Theory there's an
earlier paper of Chaka Khan Smirnoff
proving that random walk on ISO
radiographs have obvious functions
central limit theorems I mean you have
to prove them and so you have to
understand why they're true but morally
the functional central limit theorem is
a very natural thing to expect and of
course by the same token I would expect
that uniform spanning tree has a because
of coke
because of its correlation to Lou Perez
random walk has a very nice theory on
ice Aradia grass but so far as I'm aware
that's not being explored and that's the
end of my talk thank you very much I'm
