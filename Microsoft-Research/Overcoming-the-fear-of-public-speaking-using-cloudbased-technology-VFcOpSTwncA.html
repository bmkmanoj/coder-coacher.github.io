Norwich Louisiana and I'm not very great
at public speaking so I think this is a
great opportunity for me to try to
develop my skills hello I first want to
start out by being there my name is
Pierre I am a recent college graduate
public speaking is actually the number
one fear among Americans and the best
way to overcome these fears is to face
them to practice public speaking to go
out there and improve your skills Rock
speak uses a simple platform that is
available for everyone you don't need to
be technologically savvy all you need is
a computer with a camera and you will be
able to use this technology for your
purposes
but when users enter our application
they start out by uploading a video and
this video is then sent to the Microsoft
Azure cloud there's a lot of data that
comes from every single users upload
which includes visual features verbal
features and then word porosity and this
information is taken every frame or
every second to become a lot of data
after being on the edge of cloud were
able to distribute this easily quickly
and cheaply the nonverbal communication
is very intricate for example in our
face we have 43 muscles using 43 muscles
we can create 10,000 unique facial
expression to model nonverbal behavior
we need to get a lot of data collected
in a naturalistic environment in
traditional machine learning you have
some data set you build a model around
it and test it and then you deploy it
often it works well but when the
development environment is very
different than the deployed environment
they do not scale well the through Rock
speak were able to collect around 10,000
labelled videos NASA data is coming in
we're fitting that into the model and
continuously improving the model using
indoor machine learning and that enables
us to get better every single day as new
people are trying the framework and also
the data set is available for people so
this is a resource that we'd love to
share with other researchers I went to
this conference called Asperger
Association of New England there was
this gentleman who came up to me and
told me that I have difficulty making
eye contact with people or once I start
talking I realize that I'm monologuing I
love to get some help but I fear social
stigma if there is a way for me to try
some kind of automated technology at the
privacy of my own in my own living room
that could potentially change my life
good afternoon my name is joy and I am
from Baton Rouge Louisiana
I am a thirty year old wife and mother
and I had two beautiful children we are
currently in our fourth year of
homeschooling absolutely love it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
