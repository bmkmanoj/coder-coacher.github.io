I'm a postdoc researcher at Microsoft
Research in Redmond and today I'm going
to talk about a research project called
alumna share illumise share is a project
that enables people who are remote to do
things together naturally and seamlessly
to do this
illumise share uses a cameron of
projector combination the camera
captures the video of my surface and
sends it to the remote end to the rural
projector and the camera on the remote
side captures the video of the remote
surface and sends it to my projector so
that I can see what's going on on that
side what I have here is an alumna
shared device pointed down at my table
and it's currently illuminating an area
in front of me and this illuminated area
is shared with my friend Kean whose
video you can see in the Skype
connection in front of me now keen could
be really anywhere in the world well for
the purposes of this video he's sitting
right behind me so that we can capture
his in my side at the same time now keen
and I are going to start off by playing
a game of tic-tac-toe I'm going to draw
the board and then Keane is going to
start with his X in the middle I'm gonna
put an O it brought it below it he's
gonna go there I'll go here and we can
see that he won the game now in addition
to drawing and playing games we can also
share objects that we have any way that
we want to either just talk about or
play with so for instance if Keita and I
are playing a card game I could throw
down some cards and kiemce could do the
same he can also take some dice and roll
them and to make sure that I know that
he's not cheating he rolls them on his
shared area so I can see the dice that
he wrote we can also compare objects
such as toys so I know he has got a
Hello Kitty and there it is and I'm
gonna put my 2a next to say hello kitty
and then we can talk about them and
compare them another interesting aspect
for luma share is that it enables
children to get math or science homework
help from a tutor who is remote so for
instance Keane could be my tutor and
he's got a math homework worksheet for
me through which I'm going to work and
so I'm gonna say 1 plus 1 is 2 and 3
minus 2 is 1 and you can see as I'm
working Keane is evaluating my work and
5 minus -2 is also 3 and
that's actually wrong and so I now I
know as a child that I need to work on
my subtraction of negative numbers so
what we've seen here is a luminaire
which is an innovative device that
allows remote people to share arbitrary
physical or digital objects on any
surface it works well with existing
systems for video chat such as Skype to
provide delightful experiences through a
hardware and software combination</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
