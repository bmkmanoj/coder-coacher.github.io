hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
so I'm Christian Borges I am the deputy
managing director here and I will lead
you through the day and the first person
who will speak a few words of welcome to
you is Jennifer chase managing director
of Microsoft Research New England okay
well thank you Christian for the
introduction excuse isn't he careful
careful I don't work for a public
university ok so what it'll be tweeted
that's fine i'm sure it'll be tweeted
with all the people here so thank you so
much to all of you for coming here and
for being our partners over the last
five years I can't believe that it was
five years ago that I stood not exactly
here but at MIT for the opening
symposium of the lab it's it's just
amazing that that was a full five years
ago at that time what we said was that
we were coming here to partner with the
local community kind of greater local
community to try to help to build new
Sciences at the boundaries of at the
boundaries of computer science and some
of the other sciences and to train a new
new generation of interdisciplinary
scientists and first of all in terms of
the partnering it's just been better
than then we could have imagined MIT and
Harvard and bu and northeastern umass
brown i see here represented Yale let's
say brains I stuffed I mean everyone has
been so incredibly welcoming and has
been
you know such great partners to us so
how have we done in terms of our goals
okay so what we had said five years ago
was that we wanted to take certain
aspects of certain aspects of computer
science like theory and algorithms and
cryptography and mathematics and look at
the interface of those with the social
sciences and possibly with the
biomedical sciences and I think we've
really come a long way and we have
thriving groups in social media in
economics in theory and math and in
machine learning and an applications of
machine learning too many other
disciplines and you're going to hear
from each of those groups today social
media the growth of our social media
group has just been amazing a lot of
people tell me I mean they may just be
telling me but I don't think so because
the people who are in our social media
group a lot of people tell me it's the
best social media group in the world
certainly I think that the people who
are in our social media group are
incredible I think our visitors are
incredible our our postdocs we've had an
impact on you know studies of youth
studies of online communities in
particular in music and in other areas
in studies of marginalized populations
in studies of privacy and big data and
how they relate to one another and many
many other areas in economics we have an
empirical economics program which we
hadn't even conceived up five years ago
when we were opening the
lab Microsoft has phenomenal data
because we you know we have so many
online properties we have our search
engine we have you know our xbox live
network we have all these we have phone
networks we so much you know and and
there there is a class of i/o of i/o
economists who do amazing things with
data and many of whom any of the best
ones in the world have spent time in our
program working with our data and doing
incredible things and helping us to
learn about different approaches to big
data which is just fantastic and we'll
be hearing will be hearing from some of
them and we've also had unbelievable
postdocs and economics just incredible
postdocs in fury in math I think the
fact that we're in this lab in which
everyone is so open to talking to
talking across boundaries is a is really
wonderful I mean I think it's really
extended first of all we have still
amazing kind of hardcore theory the
unique games conjecture and you know
cryptography with leakage and things
like that so we're really pushing the
boundaries on those but also extending
out beyond conventional theory and math
to online security online economics of
course is a huge area we've done work in
cloud computing we've done work in
algorithms for you know web-scale
networks even I don't know where Matt do
is but we have looked at at
communications a lot Shannon you know so
going back to kind of communication in
you know most theoretical sense and
seen how that bridge is to communication
Ella Nancy babe you know and the way
economics information is transmitted
over network so these are the kinds of
conversations that get me really really
excited and I think maybe the the
biggest surprise worldwide
scientifically has been in the last five
years has been how important big data
has has become machine learning it
really is now I think that you know it
is incumbent on almost every area of
science to ask how can we think
computationally about this area how do
we use big data in these areas and we
are incredibly lucky to have such great
researchers postdocs visitors in this
field we've come up with whole new
classes of algorithms for big data like
the spectral algorithms we've looked at
things like crowdsourcing and and big
data which is really I mean you know the
the interaction of human beings and big
data vision I mean that was an area that
we didn't know that we were going to go
into when we started this lab and we
have a phenomenally vibrant group
envision a small group but a really
powerful group with partners from from
the local the local community and then a
computational and systems biology it's
interesting when we showed up here first
people who are knocking on our door were
the computational systems biologists
because they were like we have a lot of
data and you know what to do with data
and maybe you can help us with this data
and you know for a while I thought wow
i'm not sure if we could do this it
might be too far afield well it's it has
become one of the most exciting things
that we're doing here where
partnering with the local community this
is you know computational systems
biology biotech heaven and you know how
can you be in the middle of heaven and
not you know and I smell the roses here
so we are doing that also then in terms
of so that's kind of the science terms
of the new generation we've had about 50
postdocs and about 100 interns I you
know I looked over the list of postdocs
about 40 of them have moved on to other
places and what incredible places I mean
you know of the 46 are Stanford faculty
members 5r Columbia faculty members we
have one or more often more faculty
members at MIT Princeton Cornell
Berkeley upenn CMU nyu USC bu Georgia
Tech Caltech weitzman Tel Aviv epfl
three of them have gone to companies to
to MSR and one to IBM but mostly they're
going to universities where they help to
train the next generation which is
really really what we want many of them
have gone to schools which are different
than the kind of school in which they
were trained which I think says
something about what they've done while
they were postdocs here and even the
ones who have gone into the kind of
department in which they were trained I
hope have gone with a different view of
interdisciplinary science so you know I
just I feel so lucky this this has been
the perfect place you've been the
greatest partners and and I look forward
to hearing some of the science from our
people thank you
Thank You Jennifer the next person who
will speak a few words is Peter Lee head
of microsoft research worldwide and he
his claim to fame before coming to
Microsoft was actually at DARPA there he
spearheaded the red balloon challenge
which some of you might know about it
because MIT actually wanted Peter
probably good that people didn't hear
that anyway yeah and after hearing
Jennifer maybe it's some day I can be a
postdoc here it sounds like a great
thing so it's really of course a great
day for Microsoft Research and for
Microsoft but I think also a great day
today for computer science and all of
the related fields that Jennifer
mentioned we are of course here at
celebrate five years of Microsoft
Research New England and we're really
proud of what we've accomplished here in
just really five short years and our
role in helping to anchor a presence and
a surge of advanced technology and deep
research activity at nerd and in this
entire area of of New England I also
think that this is a time to celebrate
but I think some years from now maybe a
decade Renault will look back and view
as a golden era and computing research
in my career I have not experienced such
a surge of interest in a wide range of
directions in computing research it has
just been some of the most exciting
advances exciting activities exciting
new hope and optimism in a range of
areas and in just I don't know if it's
luck or great timing or the prescience
of of Jennifer and Christian but
typically and specifically in areas
focus for the New England lab now I just
wanted to say a few things about that of
course Jennifer mentioned quite a bit
about the intersection of computing with
the social sciences and it does now
appear completely obvious that over the
next decade we will see a transformation
of the social sciences at least as
profound as the transformation of the
physical and life sciences over the past
20 years and the drivers for that are
not only in our deeper understanding of
people and societies and connections
between people but also the potential
commercial and societal benefits that
accrue from that and I'm very very
excited to see some really great talks
on the schedule today machine learning
has been of course a very important area
of research both in computing and
foundational computer science but also
in our business at Microsoft and in the
last three or four years there has been
a real transformation in our optimism
about the ability of new paradigms of
machine learning to actually solve some
long-standing core problems in
artificial intelligence such as computer
vision and speech and that optimism to
actually now knock down some core AI
problems I think is extremely exciting
the odd thing is of course for those of
us working in the field is it's somehow
strange that we don't fully understand
why things are working and in the New
England lab here that of course is not
an adequate state of affairs and so
there is really great research really
trying to gain depth of understanding of
course we're delivering great technology
that helps power Microsoft's businesses
but also trying to achieve some deep
understanding in economics the New
England lab research here has been
directly responsible for changing the
terminology and the framework for
thinking about economics about Ed
pricing even about how we position our
products and the terminology you
that our CEO steve ballmer using have
been affected by the work here and then
in theory i think the revitalization of
theories particularly in the era of big
data has been really profound it just
really tickles me to see sometimes 50
year old algorithms and theorems have
new life and new application in the era
of big data and those applications today
are leading to hundreds of millions of
dollars of new revenues and savings for
Microsoft's cloud business and much of
that emanating right from this lab all
of that is impressive but let me now try
to embarrass Jennifer in question since
they really founded this lab really on a
shoestring budget shoestring in
Microsoft terms it's not so bad and I
would also like to acknowledge Rick
ratchets role in really fighting for the
resourcing and funding and really
providing a protective top cover for the
growth of this lab but through all of
that in growing all of this and really
masterminding and managing this vibrant
community in partnership with academia
and all of the postdoctoral students and
visitors they themselves have remained
directly involved in leading edge
research and that research has been
remarkably not just in one area to give
you just a snapshot of work in just the
past 12 months there have been
significant potentially seminal
publications in the area of theory and
statistical physics on convergent
sequences of dense graphs in social
media on the properties algorithmic
properties of information propagation
and social networks and in work in
auctions and pricing and the foundation
level any laboratory in the world would
be proud to have such researchers just
counted among their own and to have that
type of work being done by two of our
top leaders in microsoft research is
really testament to all that's been
built here and so
with that let me congratulate the
Jennifer Christian and the whole of
Microsoft Research New England and
welcome to our celebration thank you
very much because he sexually he
announced that he would make us blush so
our next few words will be by Jeanette
wing coop VP at Microsoft Research Janet
wing is known to a lot of you she
actually got essentially everything she
knows from MIT I think she has her
Bachelor her master's her PhD at MIT
where she learned a little bit more
things afterwards that took anyhow
Jeanette well thank you and welcome
everyone to this birthday party and it's
it's a real pleasure for me to be here
because as I mentioned last night I was
actually here on September 22nd 2008 at
the opening celebration which was held
at some MIT auditorium i believe and i
continue to further embarrass jennifer
the first thing I remember and I wanted
to share with you about that celebration
was her opening remarks about her vision
for this lab and she started talking
about networks and the complexity of
networks founded computer science like
communication networks social networks
biological networks and she talked about
how you know these networks are huge
they have all these interactions but we
in computer science have ways of looking
at these networks possibly trying to
understand the complexity the emergent
behavior the tipping points and so on
there must be commonality to these kinds
of network behaviors and also
differences and this lab was going to
understand networks of all kinds and the
reason I bring this up is that yeah
this lab was founded to be
interdisciplinary to support
interdisciplinary research but not just
for it willy-nilly ideas because there
was a hard problem out there to solve a
big problem and it required bringing
people from different disciplines
together from computer science from
social science from economic science
from biology to come together being the
same space and to share with each other
their perspectives on this hard problem
and that was of course just one example
and the reason i really liked and I
remembered this vision that Jennifer had
for the New England lab is I was at the
National Science Foundation at the time
and I had just created this program
called network science and engineering
and I when I heard Jennifer speakers
that's what I'm looking for so and the
other thing I was very appreciative of
is her understanding and the whole labs
understanding of how difficult it is
actually to bring people from different
disciplines to work together because um
you know you have people in different
disciplines they really have to
understand each other's value system
understand each other's culture and I
think again one thing I learned as a
computer scientist talking to social
scientists is that even even those two
very different disciplines when coming
together to try to work on the same
problem they will come from very
different value system so to me it was
this is how naive I was when I was
talking at first to social scientists I
understood that they are trained to
observe you know some behavior of some
complex system a population of culture
and so on but not perturbed just observe
and write about what they observe
whereas in computer science you know
when we observe behavior and we see
something wrong with it we want to go in
and fix it and so it's observe and
perturbed so these are completely
opposite viewpoints of how to understand
a behavior that we actually wanted to
get an unjust a scientific understanding
of and so I
very much appreciate that the challenge
basically Jennifer set up for the New
England lab and brings different
disciplines together and to work
together it's not just computer science
and social science and computer science
and economics and computer science and
biology and so on is all the different
disciplines mixed up together and
working together to create new new
Sciences so I very much remember that
and the other thing I remember of that
day was Jennifer invited the reason I
was 0 so on a panel on introduced of
planning research and there are only
luminaries like the Provost from bu the
Provost from Harvard and at the time the
Dean of engineering of MIT was subra
Suresh who then went to NSF and it was
now the president of Carnegie Mellon was
on the panel we talked about
interdisciplinary research from an
academic point of view and from a
government point of view and I think on
one I remember making a few remarks
about how an academia it is hard to
support interdisciplinary research
whereas I think again like a lab that
Microsoft can just create like that can
make it happen and in academia of course
you have these disciplinary boundaries
and I think it takes two things at least
for interdisciplinary research to work
in academia one is of course mutual
respect as I was mentioning before of
each other's culture and value systems
but I also think it takes what I call
enlightened administrators department
heads and deans and provost who will
actually encourage and support
interdisciplinary research at the time I
made a provocative statement which will
repeat here and I said if you are a
junior faculty member talking to your
department head and saying you know I
really want to do this research that on
the boundary between computer science
and economics for instance or computer
science and biology and as a department
head what would you say would you say
wait till after tenure
or would you say go for it and I think
your your response is in you kind of
shows how supportive your institution or
your department is of interdisciplinary
research whereas it is the foundation
foundational theme of this lab so I
think that's really important so then I
I wanted to just say I'm not going to
repeat what Jennifer and Peter said in
terms of how this lab in just five years
has really shined in so many areas of
research i do want to remind people that
in 2008 twitter was only two years old
and barack obama was not in office yet
so x really have changed in five years
and the the only other thing i really
wanted to highlight which i think is
quite special to the new england lab and
to jennifer and christians leadership is
how the flow of visitors and postdocs
have really made this in some sense a
small lab a big lab because of the
dynamic in and out of people and the the
post-up program specifically has been a
real charm of the lab in fact i know
that many faculty have delayed their
starts as new faculty at their
universities in order to get microsoft
research on their resume as a postdoc so
this is really a testament to jennifer
and christian and the whole lab in terms
of the environment that you they provide
so the last thing I'll say is you know
I'm not a I think we we have a great day
ahead of us I think this is really just
the beginning of what this kind of
interdisciplinary research can do for
not just computer science not just for
Microsoft but for all disciplines
because I do believe that computing does
pervade and can pervade in our thinking
of how to approach a problem solving
