hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
the way it would be great and I think
this tutorial here is particularly
exciting and gives kind of the flavor of
these things because it's it's topical
and it's it's a fascinating new area
digital currencies and we also have a
very competent speaker I've if so ha
from the Hebrew University we've
obtained his PhD from the Hebrew
University then came to microsoft
research in Silicon Valley and did a
postdoc there and has now for two years
being a faculty member back at his home
University Hebrew University he's going
to talk about Bitcoin the digital
currency which probably most of you have
heard about and he will also give a more
in-depth talk mentioning some of his own
results on incentive structures and
scalability for the Bitcoin system
tomorrow at eleven o'clock in in case
you are so fascinated by the
introduction today that you would like
to have that deeper follow on all right
so without much ado please go ahead avid
thank you it's good to be here so i'm
going to give you kind of a broad
overview of the Bitcoin system this is
going to be a very basic look so in this
talk I'll just cover what is Bitcoin and
how it basically works in the second
talk tomorrow I'll try to go deeper into
the Bitcoin ecosystem as torres said
there is a lot of very interesting stuff
there so if you're interested by what I
say today be sure to be there tomorrow
as well let me start by talking about
regular money and why we need something
to to kind of replace it or to improve
it so I'm going to start with what Dan
Kaminsky recently wrote about money and
if you think about money a little bit
you you might notice that it's gotten a
little buggy right it's not doing
everything that we'd expect it to do
anymore if you think of cash for example
then cash obtaining cash you have to go
to the ATM which is a bother you have to
go and get it this is what economists
call shoe leather costs you wear you
wear out the leather on your shoes as
you do this cash itself is not a
infinitely divisible right or it's not
easily divisible you you're always out
of exact change when when you need it
and you cannot easily send it right if
you want to send it to somebody in China
you'd have a hard time stuffing it into
an envelope and waiting for the letter
to arrive so we have these modern things
that are not so new anymore a wire
transfers for example are our only are
our I'm sorry this is this has gotten
mixed the wire transfers and the credit
cards this should be the credit cards
are only for customer to merchant
transactions they have relatively high
fees right you pay to three percent when
you do credit card transactions and
credit card numbers are easily stolen so
the the way you use credit cards in
regular life is you give you the credit
card number to someone and this is
exactly the information that he needs to
then turn around and use the credit card
somewhere else and steal your money okay
so so so this has made credit cards not
so reliable for the internet and if you
think about it credit cards are really
at technology from from the 50s wire
transfers on the other hand are very
slow they take several days if you ever
try to send money to China and I've
tried it takes 3-4 business days maybe a
week and there are extremely high fees
if you send a hundred dollars to China
you might end up paying forty dollars in
fees for example and when we think about
money money is basically just
information right money just is just a
way of remembering who owes what and who
has done something for us who's given a
service or provided us with with a
certain good and should get something in
exchange for that later then sending
information across the world is
something that we're used to doing very
fast so why can't we send money as
easily as we send an email or a text
message to somebody far away so the
point of all of this is to basically say
you know we are overdue for a revolution
in money transfer right it's it's very
easy to send information the
infrastructure is there the Internet is
there why can't we send money very
quickly so before we go into Bitcoin let
me just start with this point what is
what is actually money what gives money
value does anybody know what is the
thing that makes this worth something
I'm willing to do work for this but not
for this trust so so it's right it's a
delusion it's basically what makes this
worthwhile you know worth worth worth
anything is belief the belief that when
I accept it now i will go to somebody
else and he will give me goods for for
this piece of paper okay now why would
he do it because he believes you know
somebody at the grocery store would
accepted because he can later go to the
22 to buy gas with it and somebody there
will accept the same piece of paper from
him okay so so there's nothing backing
money there's no gold in the vault yeah
okay my taxes in one in the last yeah so
so the government is not the only
economic entity out there and there are
currencies there that the government
won't accept your taxes in but but are
still worthwhile so you can think of
ethica hours as a currency that's used
in Ithaca and it's you know it's traded
people people find it useful you have I
don't know my miles that you might be
able to trade you know freakin frequent
flyer miles that are worth something so
the government is just one more economic
entity it's it's a very large one and it
has a lot of guns and police so it's
it's very persuasive but but but it's
still just belief if if you stop
believing that the government is is any
good the value of the currency also
drops so it's all about belief in the
fact that the government is worthwhile
so so this is
just to clarify the point because a lot
of the time I give these talks and
people say well there's gold behind
money and there hasn't been gold backing
our money since I think the 70s okay so
bitcoin is also a new form of money and
it's a decentralized digital currency
and I underline decentralized because
most of our money is already digital
right we do a lot of transactions
digitally and this is really the
innovation Bitcoin was invented by
somebody called Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008
and it's been running since 2009 and we
actually don't know who Satoshi Nakamoto
is he invented the currency and worked
on development for a couple of years and
then wrote to say he's moving on to
other things and nobody knows who he is
so there are a few people in Japan that
are actually named Satoshi Nakamoto none
of them appears to have made the
currency so I think they don't even
speak English that well but Satoshi
Nakamoto is obviously well versed in
English and he's probably had some
academic training because you see him
write this paper about Bitcoin and it's
in you know it's got citations when you
write papers you know it's you know it's
he's probably done it before yeah so if
probably the NSA knows who he is but
nobody else he's correspondent with
people under this alias and when he put
up a website for Bitcoin he did it
through an anonymous service and we just
have no idea so that's one of the
mysteries of Bitcoin so Bitcoin of
course has all the advantages of digital
money um it's very easy to divide you
can just add and subtract fractions of
it it's very easy to store because it's
just bit bits on computers so you don't
have to have these large vaults built it
should have very low fees because it's
very easy to transfer you just do
computational actions instead of having
to drive it around in them I don't know
a Brinks armored car um
and and you can send it anywhere in the
world wherever whenever you have an
internet connection so I kind of
paraphrasing on the model of I guess
diem American currency in god we trust'
of the US dollar bitcoins motto has or
well some people have adopted this as
the model is very less in numerous which
basically means in Latin strength in
numbers so strength in numbers in the
sense that we trust the math we trust
the computer science but also we trust
the numbers with this is going to be a
decentralized system and the more people
that join it the stronger it will be
okay so strength in numbers and this
decentralized nature of Bitcoin gives it
a lot of other properties that are very
controversial so I i would call these
features some people think of them as
terrible terrible things for example
Bitcoin transactions are going to be
sued student pseudonymous that not
exactly anonymous you don't do them
anonymously but you can use a pseudonym
for for each new transaction you can do
it under a new identity there's going to
be a fixed amount of coins at some point
there's not going to be any more beyond
21 million bitcoins and that also
implies that there's not going to be
inflation that's triggered by somebody
printing money so you might like that
aspect of this or you might say nope no
government is going to be able to to
rescue us if we're in an economic
depression and we need to print money
right so this is a controversial feature
ah transfers are going to be
irreversible because unlike credit cards
you don't have anybody to call and say
you know my credit cards been stolen and
I need to get the money back there is a
system that's distributed it's not going
to have anybody that you could call so
every transfer is is as if you you you
gave somebody cash if you want so if you
want the money back he has to give it
back to you money cannot be seized in
Bitcoin if
you have a court order and you come to
somebody in the system and you say okay
I want you to give me this guy's money
or you need to freeze that account for
me because this is a drug dealer then
you cannot do it because there is no
centralized point where you can go and
serve that warrant it's actually a
distributed system you would have to get
a majority of the nodes so these are
also very controversial if you're if
you're interested in in I don't know
grabbing money from drug dealers that's
very bad but also if you're if you're
just a person worried about his money
then then maybe you don't want the
government to be able to seize your
funds or freezing to other aspects here
that I've mentioned escrow accounts and
joint accounts are just basically
features that can be built in that are
built into Bitcoin that allow for more
advanced transactions you can have
escrow accounts without any third-party
acting as the escrow and you can have
joint accounts where you can really need
several signatures to move money you
have a lot of features that are built
into money are built into the protocol
itself without needing anybody else to
provide them yeah questions Nadine slide
means controversial and do you mean I we
can both delay till then but some of
these properties one could challenge
that whether these properties really
hold I mean in some sense it also
depends on the belief of the people in
the Bitcoin community whether these
properties hold or not because if
everyone wants to change the rules
potentially they could change the rules
right right so so the rules of course
can be changed i'm talking about bitcoin
as it is but in some sense many of them
are due to the decentralized nature it's
going to be very hard to reverse them
without the majority's decision right in
that sense they are they are stable so
in general i'm very happy to take
questions as as as you have them i'm i
don't want to wait until the end yeah we
seized but this is the dread pirate
roberts i think he called himself from
silk road
all of his bitcoins were seized and yeah
I i think it was nice agents so I mean
so how did they do it they do all of
these confuses so basically you do have
you do have some way to move your money
right you should have some in bitcoins
case it's a private key and if you have
your private key on your computer then
and somebody gains access to that they
can take your money but if you encrypt
your private key and you could do that
very easily then nobody can you know
without cracking your password nobody
can move your money necessarily decrypt
your private key they don't need to
actually get your private key they only
need to take it away from you hbu to
lose access to one of those phones right
you lose access to it but but if you
keep copies if you you know if you if
you just remember a pass phrase that is
used to generate that key it's very hard
to take from you so it's very easy to
keep your money secure in that sense we
firstly if the US government tested this
pimp and can no longer than spend in the
US like this particular bitcoins then of
course you can go and spend them
somewhere else yeah but it may be less
available because but it's also
impossible to know what what's spent in
the US so when I send it to someone he's
using an identity that might not be
known to the US government and if he's
not registered on any database how do
they know it's him right that's a
question you don't need to know because
they can track the coins and we count
they move into the intended and the
government says well if anybody on our
soil and uses this Bitcoin when the
other how affection of this bitcoind
you're going to make them pay in dollars
and suddenly this I think the Bitcoin
will be much less valuable to anybody
who knows this so assuming it comes a
bit more humble okay don't know about
Alice right so it could be a blacklist
and a bit very easily give the any
government's ability to to devalue
individual bitcoins that's right so if
you try and track money and maybe taint
it in some in some sense and you say
this is dirty money that no matter where
it goes I will not allow it to be cashed
in two dollars on our soil that could be
done and so people are working on
improvements to the protocol
that make it completely anonymous but
basically say you can see money that has
moved from somebody to somebody you
don't know how much you don't know who
you just know that the transfer was a
legitimate and this is a paper called
zero coin and now in a new system and an
improvement of it is going to come out
called zero cash so basically these
things are also possible yeah oh she
dies which is like a gambling website
but you can use it to wash your money so
you gamble but you have a guarantee that
you get a plot back and then basically
everybody gamers at the same time and
you get a lot of mixing of the monitor
yes so there are other mixers by the way
if you go to the some of the online
wallets they will any and you say I want
to pay somebody there's a protocol
called coin join that will mix your
money with other payments a lot of
inputs come in a lot of outputs go out
nobody can say which money went where
and there is a in general a very large a
very very intense battle about about
money tainting and about how to avoid it
and a lot of discussions of this in the
Bitcoin community all right so let's
let's go on so if you want to buy
bitcoins you just do it like any other
foreign currency you go to an exchange
and you can just trade bitcoins for four
u.s. dollars or pounds or whatever you
want and these are this is an exchange
in Japan and these two are in Europe and
this is one in Israel okay so you have
lots of these all over the world down
the price of Bitcoin of course has
changed a lot it's been on the news
quite a lot a year ago it was around
twenty dollars per bitcoin today it's
around eight hundred twenty dollars per
bitcoin at least one on one of the
European exchanges and you know these
fluctuations are very bad for currencies
that does not a very good thing when
your currency changes its value so much
but this is part of the growing pains of
bitcoins so this was a bubble in April
and this is the recent bubble I think
due to the Chinese interest in in
Bitcoin
which ended pretty much when when the
Chinese government issued some
announcement saying that bitcoin is a
little too dangerous so this volatility
of course brings us a lot of tales of
you know people getting rich really fast
the first Bitcoin transaction ever was
actually somebody who bought two pizzas
for 10,000 bitcoins this is now you know
at the peak of the bubble at least this
was over 10 million dollars I'm that
those are kind of expensive pizzas and
also about this guy who threw away his
computer with his private keys on it and
he remembered after doing that that he
had had all these bitcoins there that
are now worth or at least during the
bubble I think we're worth seven and a
half million dollars so I think people
are now moving through the dump area
where where the computer was thrown away
and with metal detectors looking for
that computer and whoever finds it so
that there's a buried treasure of 7 and
a half million dollars depending on the
value of bitcoins that day so if you
wanted to spend your bitcoins you could
do it at at various places you could buy
electronics online there are some
merchants who are accepting it you could
go gamble on that website called Satoshi
dice I guess you could buy a beer in
Cambridge there's a pub here that's
supposed to accept Bitcoin but you could
also do things like donate money to
WikiLeaks which is something that the US
government and other governments in
Europe are not very happy that you do or
you could give money to charity this is
a charity that helps the homeless in
Florida that's been very well known for
accepting bitcoins so there are there is
merchant adoption there's not a lot of
it so bitcoin is not very common you
still cannot go to your local grocery
store but you could expect some global
businesses that you know mail you there
their merchandise to accept bitcoins
they immediately have a lot of customers
who will be with very happy to give them
bitcoins ok so so there are a few
businesses and of course somebody
mentioned before the
one of them more well-known businesses
that used to accept bitcoins that's the
Silk Road this is a website that is
pretty much like eBay except that the
things that you buy and sell on on the
Silk Road is was usually drugs so this
was operating I think usually in the
u.s. you would pay in bitcoins are not
anonymously or almost anonymously and
the merchant would send you the drugs by
mail and the operator of the Silk Road
would just act as an escrow service he
would take the money from from the drug
buyer hold it until the drug dealer
provides the merchandise and then set
and then release the funds and he would
take his commission along the way so
this guy ended up being busted by the
FBI he turns out he's probably this
young man called Ross Ross Ulbricht he
was known on the website as the Dread
Pirate Roberts from the princess bride
if you know the movie and this guy turns
out to be you know that just a 29 year
old guy living with roommates running
his drug empire from from his laptop
without his roommates knowing about it
and it I think more than anything it
just shows you the strength of Bitcoin
right you have somebody doing this
running this business which is very high
risk if you would try to do it without
Bitcoin right if you try to be right
moving these huge amounts of money and
doing it well and getting the trust of
drug dealers and drug buyers right it
would be very hard but this guy just did
it alone on his laptop so so it's it's a
very bad example of something maybe that
we want to want to see bought and sold
but it's also another example of a
business that handles large amounts of
money which is only possible because
money is now in digital form it has an
API you can design a program that does
whatever you want you don't need a very
large staff so now this the feds have
gotten his computer and the service that
he was running everything from and they
are trying to now liquidate their
thinking
of liquidating the bitcoins that they
seized off of off of the website this is
the 25 million that they talked about
here is not his own the this isn't his
own money but rather the money that was
held in escrow in the meantime so he
wasn't using the the sophisticated
escrow techniques that are built into
Bitcoin but his competitors and
successors are now improving things so
this website is not by not the last one
that will see and not definitely not the
only one all right so let's talk about
what bitcoin does more more specifically
so if you really go to a bank and you
and you want to move money around the
bank remembers where your money is you
know how much money everybody has so the
blue agent might have two dollars in his
account the red agent might have a
dollar and when you when you want to
move my you just tell the bank you know
change my balance here shift it shift
this one dollar from here to here okay
so so this requires trust in the bank
when you tell the bank move money you
want him you want the server to comply
you also need to trust the bank not to
erase your money and so on all these
things are possible so all of this
invites very costly regulation right
making sure that you're not laundering
money making sure that you're not
cheating customers and so on and it has
very high entry barriers if you want to
become a bank you have to have you have
to be very big generally so that means
there's relatively little competition
between banks which basically means
there are there are very high fees for
transfer transmitting money and I'm not
just talking about banks you could also
think of Visa and MasterCard and PayPal
as as players in this game so what
bitcoin aims to do is to replace this
centralized system with a peer-to-peer
network and the goal is to increase
competition and to create this open
system where everybody can join and be
part of the banking system
and that will drive down fees okay and
that also means that our Bitcoin nodes
remember all of the account balances and
Bitcoin does this very primitive leans
in some sense everything is replicated
all the data is replicated everywhere
and now we have a decentralized system
and you need to understand how how
revolutionary this thing is basically
there is no server that you can now go
to and say okay I want you to take away
the money from the blue guy because
everybody else still has copies of the
data they won't let you do this change
or at least they will start ignoring
your messages once you do this okay so
everybody's going to check up on
everybody there's no more there's no
centralized point anymore there's no
where to apply regulation and so this is
a very subversive protocol by nature it
tries to to do what BitTorrent has done
for file distribution that you can vary
it you find it very hard to stop
bittorrent users you cannot sue two
million people if they're sharing files
it's very hard to stop many many nodes
if they're if they decide not to comply
with with regulation for example okay so
this is what bitcoin aims to do so one
of the implications of having the data
structure replicated all the data
replicated everywhere is that whenever
somebody moves money you have to send a
message everywhere right so if the blue
guy is sending money to the red guy you
have to spread the message and so every
transaction is seen by everyone on the
network and the network is open so you
can go to a website for example this is
blockchain info and you can see a stream
of the transactions that are now
occurring and in particular you can go
and see the the address that got Dread
Pirate Roberts seized coins and you can
see this is the private his private
money he has a hundred forty-four
thousand bitcoins on there which are I
guess over am a hundred million dollars
at today's exchange rates and these are
his personal funds and I
I think they say that there are more
that the FBI didn't manage to grab so so
you can follow everything this is now
money belonging to the FBI this is an
address held by the FBI okay but we only
know that because somebody tagged the
the address we wouldn't otherwise know
there was an article newspaper that
saying that they seized a lot of money
so somebody goes to the block chain
blocking the info and looks for for a
large transaction and there there it is
sorry so this isn't really taint
analysis so much as yeah so much as you
know somebody just tagged this
transaction this address as belonging to
the FBI it might not be the right thing
right is it is a form of all right here
in twos yes so you can try and see where
the money has been there there are
various attempts at doing this there are
also academic papers doing this and I'll
mention them a little later okay any
questions yeah can come summary tag silk
road's address and while that people
know that I other than planned by Road
oh no just theoretically sure so can you
can you can somebody know that you've
bought off Silk Road so what Silk Road
can do is they can generate a new
address every time they accept money and
the question is how do you later when
they eventually they want to aggregate
money from these addresses so you might
be able to tell that it's the Silk Road
definitely you can go through mixers and
you can buy through silk road but you
nobody knows that you've actually sent
that money or if you're using one of the
newer protocols that are fully
anonymized then nobody will know
anything so this is the current state of
Bitcoin where you can still see the
addresses and you can track money if you
click on one of these links you actually
have all the all the information of
where it came where the money came from
which addresses and where it's going
okay so you can follow money yourself
okay so now the main problem that
bitcoin has to solve in order to keep
its decentralized data data structure
and intact it's basically assisted a
problem that's that's common to systems
that are distributed and that's the
consistency problem right somebody can
very easily create two messages that
look perfectly fine when you just look
at one of them for example I could be
the reg agent and I could say let's move
all my money to the blue guy or send all
my money to the green guy create both of
these transactions I sign them
cryptographically each one of them is
consistent with data in every node but I
send the messages to different nodes in
the network and now they have to kind of
talk to each other because we're not we
don't want to allow both of these
transactions to occur at the same time I
cannot give all of my money to one guy
and all of my money to go to somebody
else write this this would be a problem
and this is called a double spending
attack okay if I try to do something
like that I might get away with it and
be able to spend the same coin twice so
Bitcoin solves this double spin problem
using its data structure and the data
structure is known as the blockchain
okay so this is how the solution is
basically built the blockchain is in
essence just a record of all the
transactions that ever occurred
everything from the from from the
beginning of time until now so every
block in the blockchain just contains
transactions and a few other fields so
the first field that I wrote here is
just the hash of the previous block in
the chain this is basically an
identifier it's a cryptographic hash
function it just identifies what the
previous block was in a way that could
not be fudged or or forged and we'll
talk about the second field right here
in a second so as transactions are
occurring on the network we want the
block chain to
grow so we're basically adding new
blocks ok this is this proceeds as as
time goes ok so we're hearing about
transactions we're putting them into
this new block and if we get ever get
this conflicting transaction where Reds
may be paid all this money to blow and
now he wants to give the same money to
green then we're throwing it away we're
not putting it into the block ok now
we're supposed to send this block to our
neighbors tell them that there we have
this new set of transactions that we'd
like to accept and of course I didn't
solve the problem here because my
neighbor might do the same thing he
might send this a block that has
conflicting transactions specifically
the ones we threw out ok so we still
might have a conflict in terms of of the
blocks right we have the same block
pointing maybe to the same history of
transactions but it contains different
transactions so bitcoin has to kind of
get over this somehow and there are
basically two rules in the solution the
first rule says that we should make
block creation of it something that's
very hard ok why does that help if block
creation is hard we don't have many
blocks that are created at the same time
right so we don't have as many conflicts
as before so my neighbor might not
create a block and I when I send him my
blog everything will be just fine so in
order to make block creation hard we
just make we we use a computational
problem that's hard that you have to
solve in order to create a block that's
legitimate so this is where this field
called the nonce comes in basically what
you do is you take a hash you have to
the information in the block this gives
you a series of bits that looks to looks
random if it's it's a cryptographic hash
so you don't know what the bits were
will be before you actually compute it
and if this number is really really
small then the block is considered to be
valid if you didn't manage to find a
small number what you can do is you can
change the nonce field you can just put
a different strain
of bits inside it and Yuri compute the
hash and because it's a cryptographic
hash even changing one bit makes
everything randomly changed again and
you might hit the target and find a
small number so when I say a small
number I basically mean at today's
difficulty maybe around 60 of the most
significant bits have to be zero so you
have to try to to the 60 attempts to
actually manage to find one in
expectation or something like that so
this is very hard and this small number
that you have to to be under adjusts
automatically so that one block is
created in the entire Bitcoin network
only once every 10 minutes ok any
questions about this yeah automatically
changing to maintain it so basically
they they when you have the blockchain
you look at the number of blocks that
were created in the past two weeks and
if it's more than once every 10 minutes
you you you lower the number and make it
harder to to create blocks so you do
this automatically and you can you can
try and hit that target so it's it's not
exactly once every 10 minutes but it's
around that yeah so doesn't that mean it
suppose on the NSA I have a lot of
computing power at my disposal I can
essentially cause it's an old service
attack by for two weeks when all my
compute power into creating blocks of
bogus internal transactions that I have
sure right and then after that ordinary
people help the transactions anymore um
no so there is a limit on on how how
fast this can grow or go down I think
the difficulty only changes by a factor
of four at most so you could make it
harder after two weeks but you could
make it infinitely harder if even if you
had a lot of computing power okay it's
it's still as i'm going to show you why
it's still very costly even to do that
what you said create a lot of blocks in
the period of two weeks is going to be
very very hard even for the NSA i think
yes you do something like randomly pick
when you're complex sorry could you
randomly pick which one wins and then
have that I'll show you in a second what
what the second rule is and how you pick
when there are conflicts I'll show that
in a second all right any more questions
okay so the second rule of course is is
little is that they're still made there
still may be conflicts of course because
even though block creation is very hard
it might still occur twice at the same
time throughout the network somewhere
and the way we're going to handle it is
by adopting conflicting blocks only if
they make a longer chain that we have
currently okay so let me give you a
little bit of intuition as to why this
actually helps us do anything so here is
the network and here are the two rules
that we have make block creation hard
and adopt conflicting blocks only if
they make a longer chain so let's
suppose somebody creates a block right
here this node and sends it to the
neighbors to its neighbors and they're
very happy to accept this block it makes
their chain a little longer so
everything is fine but at the same time
somewhere in the network another block
is created and it's also propagated to
some nodes okay so these guys a those
who have a1 and b1 when they exchanged
blocks nobody accepts the other guys
block because it's conflicting it and it
makes up a chain of the same length and
the world continues working every we
still have transactions running through
the network we still try to create
blocks on top of our current chain and
so at some point somebody succeeds okay
so let's say this node built another
block a 2 now it can send it to its
neighbors everybody who has a 1 is happy
it extends their current chain but even
the neighbors that have b1 will accept
this new block because it makes it a
longer chain and now they replace what
their history was with this longer
version okay so now you might notice
that we have more more nodes working on
this chain on this longer chain and the
chance that this longer chain will be
the next block is even greater so once
we have a winner in terms of the race it
is very easy for further for the winning
version of history to recruit more nodes
to work on on the same problem and there
is a winner-take-all effect here so we
might have a tie this node that built be
one might also build another block on
top of it but now there's more
computational power working on this
version yeah transferring funds yes but
we also said block creation takes ten
minutes it's hard yes and there may be
some conflict resolution as well which
may be multiple rounds yes so how long
since I get some Bitcoin from someone it
looks like they do before I can go okay
I believe this to be valid okay so I'll
show the exact numbers really soon but
you are right you basically have to wait
ten minutes to get into the first block
more time to get into further blocks and
in fact you're only going to be
guaranteed that the money has been moved
and and will not be taken away after
several blocks have been built okay and
I'll show exactly why it soon but think
of the time scales as being maybe one
hour two hours to be fully accepted
within a reasonable margin of error and
and you could argue that this this is
still fast okay why because wire
transfer tape takes days and if you
think about visa moving money through
credit cards it looks like it's
instantaneous but really if you are a
merchant the transaction can be reversed
maybe a month or two after you you've
received the money okay so some people
for example have have tried withdrawing
money from ATMs at the same time in
different countries and because the ATMs
are not well synchronized they they were
able to withdraw the same the same money
basically twice so other systems look
like they give you money instantaneously
but basically they're they're not doing
this very well right they're not
coordinating between very different
locations very well and having said that
I still think that
coin can be accelerated if you want to
know exactly how and I think we can get
to maybe one second per block you should
come tomorrow to the second part you
know if we're talking about sort of the
architecture of systems one day up we
want to be architectural advantages of a
centralized system yes there are other
disadvantages one of the advantages is
you can be quicker right because
whatever i wanted-- message that's right
necessary delay when I was in Hong Kong
growing up this was you know two decades
ago the in transfer was instantaneous
right I mean right now we have a balance
machine here we have a withdraw machine
here and I've tried it and you know you
could not tell that's from that looks
get in today yes that's true that's also
true now right if you were if you go to
the US and you you you're in bank of in
the bank of america and you move money
between customers of the bank that's
fine but what happens when you try to do
this something globally so the systems
that need to interact with one another
are very old and they are very slow if
you think about wire transfers a person
has to literally look at your transfer
and make sure that it's not money lon
lon during this is not all done by
computer there is actually a person
looking at every transaction and so
there hasn't been a push to automate
this so the appearance of Bitcoin you
know might what what it might do to the
industry is it my push it to go to where
we know centralized systems can be and
that is much faster it takes a lot of
coordination between a lot of different
entities and right now they're in this
equilibrium where they have something
that works it's relatively slow there's
no needs to change it because there's no
competitor right but i think bitcoin can
be faster but you're right basically
this architecture that replicates
information everywhere and needs to keep
it consistent is very wasteful is
actually doing it it's supposed to do
worse than the centralized systems right
okay any more questions yeah and I mean
you mentioned how a longer blockchain it
is generally accepted yeah and will
prevent a combined pull or someone with
enough
like the NSA and saying that you have
effectively given me all of your points
and if they do it enough and quick
enough and hide the blocks from the rest
of what everyone else in the network and
allow their chain to get longer than
everyone else as soon as it's longer
they change replace everyone else's
network and all of your reforms would
disappear that's right but let me get to
that in a slide or two okay I'll get to
that exactly that's that's a good
question all right so let's let's try to
get to that so Satoshi Nakamoto is
guarantee for us in terms of security
what I've just showed you is right is a
node that had a certain history be one
and was replacing it with a 1 and a 2 so
the guarantee is that as long as the
attacker controls less than fifty
percent of the computing power in the
network less than fifty percent then the
probability that replacement of blocks
will occur goes down exponentially with
time so if we wait a little bit maybe
it's it's fifty percent we wait a little
bit more its twenty twenty-five percent
so going down exponentially basically
means that after a little while things
are you know the probability of
replacement becomes astronomically small
okay yeah doesn't seem that's the case
it seems like a new blocks get pretty
controls to whoever's actually engaging
in transactions as you've described it
so far and that's not average data with
it so transactions are sent out really
quickly but blocks are created once
every ten minutes which is very very
long a long waiting period right so they
can be you know as far as you want from
the person creating the transaction and
they aggregate a lot of transaction so
you may not have heard about all of them
but that's fine you put what you've
heard of into the block the rest will go
into the next block that's fine okay
yeah but in may be missing something in
your scenario were you saying you need
effectively 50 cent or more of the
computing power I think that's quite
true because if assuming I'm the rogue
agent in the network I can keep
accepting your blocks as you create them
correctly it only takes that that small
probability of me creating a block ahead
of you to create a freight transaction
and I only need to do that once meet
right buddy
once once that once one of my
transactions is is deep inside the chain
in order to replace that specific
trainers transaction you have to replace
the whole tale of the chain so you have
to build a longer chain than that one
and cause that to be thrown out so i'm
not talking about replacing the latest
transaction but some transaction in the
network that is already buried inside
the chain okay i'll give you more
intuition about that in a second let me
just say one thing about the incentives
here this is really important so
whenever block is created we want when
we want to basically incentivize block
creation and make want people to work on
on this thing so what we do is we paid
we pay everybody who closes a block who
creates a block and payment comes from
two sources one source is a small fee
that comes out of every transaction
transactions offer a fee to whoever
closes them and the second is money
that's created out of thin air so money
has to be created at some point and the
creation event is basically every time a
block is created that guy who created
the block gets the money what this means
is that a lot of people will want to do
this work okay so regarding the money
creation I told you that no more money
is going to be no more than 21 million
coins are going to be created at some
point and this is because the rate of
money creation goes down and it
converges the amount of money converges
to this 21 million at first we were
creating 50 bitcoins per block at every
four years this rate is have so a 2013
Bitcoin switch to creating 25
transaction 25 bitcoins per block and
this will get halved again four years
later so of course this amount of money
25 transit 25 bitcoins per block means
around 25 thousand dollars at the height
of the bubble or a little less now but
that's a lot of money and so the hash
rate of the network has grown quite
substantially and people have started
creating you know these racks of
computers that are you just used to to
mine bitcoins and at some point they
started creating
custom chips that do hashes very fast
and are able to create blocks very fast
and now these are these compact the
packaged in in Nice boxes with a lot of
cooling and basically the hash rate has
gone up through the roof so this is just
to give numbers i think maybe last year
they surpassed the top 100 super
computers in the world combines in terms
of hashes per second this is now 20
petta hashes so you can think of what
that means I think my computer does a
few mega hashes per second nothing more
very quickly I think this new hardware
puts us way way over what you could do
with normal computers yeah yes there is
a limit on the block size the block size
is currently limited one megabyte to
kind of avoid the denial of service
attacks by somebody creating very large
blocks but the limit has not been
reached yet so there aren't one megabyte
of transactions occurring every
transaction is really usually very small
it's half a kilobyte and there aren't as
many transactions in the network as it
would take to fill out the blocks ok
let's go on so I want to show you what
the attack looks like in Bitcoin so this
is the double spend attack we kind of
talked about this before so let's say
there somebody has a transaction in
inside the chain and he wants to reverse
that transaction so what you can do is
he can create it an alternative history
of blocks and if we find something
that's longer right then he can make
this maybe this transaction go away it's
not in the alternative one right so this
is going to be harder and harder the
more blocks are here because it's it's
very hard to create every block we have
to work a lot we need more computational
power and as we work this block chain is
continuing to grow right then the
network is still adding blocks on top
here
and we have to be faster than that so if
you want to really analyze the attack
mathematically what you basically do is
you look at at the difference in the
length of chains so if these states are
basically encode the difference in in
length right the honest change length
minus the attackers then whenever the
network creates a block we add one to
the difference and this is bad for the
attacker and whenever the attacker
creates a block we just move back in the
other direction and of course if we ever
reach the state where the attackers
chain is longer the attacker is one this
event occurs with some probability 1
minus Q and this with probability Q
given that the attacker has some
fraction Q of the computational power
okay so this is basically a random walk
that is biased if the Q is smaller than
one-half it's biased towards higher
numbers so there is some probability
that we never get here okay and the
farther away we start the less likely it
is that we ever end up here okay so of
course we don't exactly know what the
attackers chain length is so we cannot
put a state here but given that we
accept the transaction only after end
blocks have been built on top of it we
have some probability distribution over
where the attacker is and we can do this
the math and find everything out and
what you get is this very ugly-looking
formula that's taking from a paper by
many runs and felt he's corrected the
analysis that Satoshi Nakamoto is done
originally which was a little faulty and
this this is not very readable but what
you can do is you can look at this in
tabular form and if somebody for example
can controls let's say ten percent of
the computational power of the network
and you wait for one block then you have
I don't know is that twenty percent
chance of ever switching the transaction
and goes down very very fast so usually
things are thought to be very safe after
maybe six transact six blocks have been
created this very small chance that you
ever managed to replace a transaction
and of course what you have to remember
that because the Bitcoin network is so
large this is very very costly right if
you need ten percent of the Bitcoin
network that's going to cost you in the
millions so if all I'm doing is selling
a cup of coffee you know I might take
the risk that somebody has ten percent
of the computational power and is trying
to cheat me out of that payment for the
cup of coffee on the other hand if I'm
selling a car I might want to wait
longer make sure the money's actually
been transferred and longer would just
mean maybe just wait another hour to
make sure the funds have cleared so it's
very reasonable if you're moving a
hundred million dollars to wait an extra
hour to just to make sure but if you're
selling coffee you might even decide to
give coffee without any confirmations in
a sense of you just see the transaction
in the network you don't even wait for
it to be included in a block so we were
talking about the speed of transactions
you might take that risk and in fact
when you think about the website Satoshi
dice they're a gambling website what
they do is they take that risk they see
the transaction and they immediately
send you the payment the winnings if
you've won or just a small payment in
case you've lost just to show you that
you've lost and somebody might try and
defraud them somebody might try and
replace the history might might do that
but they take the risk because the
payments are very very small and in fact
they haven't seen that happen right it
takes a lot of technical skill to do to
pull off something like that yes ten
minutes is that a limit of this system
because it sounds like if any you know
any significant number of financial
transactions like everything in the
world salt was put through the system we
far exceed one megabyte in 10 minutes am
I getting the numbers so the very short
answer is come to the talk tomorrow the
longer answer that I will give a hint is
that in terms of bandwidth this is not a
very hard this is not a very hard limit
transaction sizes are about half a
kilobyte so if you wanted to do
something like two thousand transactions
per second you could do it very easily
you need one megabyte per second of
bandwidth for that
transactions per second is what visa
does globally today okay it's something
on around that order of magnitude so
bitcoin can very easily grow to be visa
size in terms of bandwidth but there are
other limitations that make the
transaction rates actually that you can
actually achieve much lower and for that
you're going to have to show up tomorrow
okay so in terms of bandwidth isn't
really no problem yeah so let me kind of
try and wrap up I'm glad to have had all
these questions one more thing that I
want to say is that about the fifty
percent attack if you look at that table
before you can see that if you have
fifty percent of the computational power
there is always one hundred percent
chance that you will be able to replace
chains because your alternative change
goes grows faster than that of the
network and this could be very bad and
one of the mining pools was recently
very close to getting fifty percent and
everybody on reddit freaked out but
usually this doesn't happen okay so one
more thing satoshi nakamoto could have
created a lot of blocks when he set up
the system and he might not have told us
about it so to make sure that he didn't
do it the first block that's ever
created also encodes a message inside it
containing the headline of the paper
from that day from the day that started
he started the system so you can see
Chancellor and brink of second bailout
for banks that was the headline of the
times at on january of 2009 and if you
look at the block chaining in ASCII
format you can actually see the message
inside there you can do it yourself if
you want you can download the client in
check so I will skip these things on the
interest of time ah either that yes or
he just read the paper but actually
there there have been other safe
safeguards put in place that will not
allow Satoshi to release blocks even if
he's the editor of the times and he said
he set the headline of that day you
cannot replace certain block that are
very early and so
he has no advantage over everybody else
so I just want to mention several I
wanted to mention several challenges
that bitcoin is going to face I'm going
to do it more at length at the second
talk you know things that are unrelated
to computer scientists like regulation
and adoption volatility of the currency
of course are very very problematic we
can also talk about things like the pull
of the system towards centralization
there's definitely advantages to being
larger in the system you can gain more
money than others so the system becomes
more centralized slowly there are issues
about scalability which worried you
before and I will definitely definitely
talk about them tomorrow more because
this is part of what I've been doing in
my research and also incentives the
protocol isn't exactly incentive
compatible and we already know of
several places where it needs to be
improved and I will skip more details on
these what I will just say to conclude
is that we don't know what the future
will hold whether Bitcoin really wins
out in the end and survives or whether
it crashes we are definitely seeing a
social experiment on a scale that we've
never seen before there's isn't that
there hasn't been an innovation in money
on this scale since credit cards in the
50s whatever happens it's definitely
going to be more very interesting so
with that I'd like to thank you and
again I i'll give you another small
teaser for part two if you want to show
up tomorrow I will tell you how to find
both love and ben bernanke hidden in the
Bitcoin blockchain okay thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
