hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading

technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
so we're delighted to have a heart
attack here today and I'm very
disappointed by all of our colleagues
for not being here but we're still
thrilled of probably were also even more
excited to have him as a CR every friday
this year so today is going to be sorry
braga is basically the leader among
young economists in the field of market
design which is very important to many
people here and he's a recent winner of
the social choice in welfare prize and
soon-to-be winner of the john base clock
was my prediction yeah well pressure is
on today's going to just give us a bit
of an overview of a big agenda he's been
developing in a very multi method and in
some ways interdisciplinary way around
improving urban public schools great
thank you so much Glenn I'm really
excited to be here I'm going to be
talking about some things that may not
be on the central part of Microsoft
Research is agenda but I hope you'll
find it interesting nonetheless as Glenn
mentioned I'm a professor of economics
at MIT and together with two of my
colleagues I direct the school
effectiveness and inequality initiative
sei I we call it and this is a group of
economists and graduate students and
research assistants that study issues
related to the income distribution in
the US and other role of Education and
the income distribution and the part
that I've spent a lot of time focusing
on is understanding the productivity of
K through 12 public education in the
United States and that's what I want to
tell you a little bit about so today's
talk I'm going to briefly touch on a
bunch of studies so you should stop me
at any time and I'm happy to have this
be be a conversation so let me set the
stage a little bit with some early
debates about urban school reform
and one of the most important kind of
landmark events when people thought
about schools in America was a report
issued in 1966 by james coleman so for
those of you who don't know james
coleman is a sociologist who taught at
the university of chicago and is seen by
many as one of the first sociologists to
embrace quantitative methods okay and he
was commissioned by the Department of
Education in the wake of Brown versus
Board of Education to actually serve a
high schools throughout the US and try
to understand whether or not they were
being faithful to desegregation decrees
and he issued this report a pretty
landmark report in social science
actually called the Equality of
educational opportunity and that report
is widely seen as making the following
argument that argument is student
background and socioeconomic status are
a much more important determinant of
educational outcomes than measure
differences in schools that is when we
think about what determines achievement
of children in later life outcomes their
parents in their neighborhoods matter a
lot more than schools so this was a
pretty provocative a point of view and
as kind of shaped research studying
school effectiveness in the decades
since nineteen sixty six but immediately
after Coleman's report came out there
was a reaction so one kind of type of
reaction came from this code i have here
from martin luther king so two years
later he said stated the following he
said whatever pathology may exist in
Negro families is far exceeded by the
social pathology in the school system
that refuses to accept a responsibility
that no one else can bear and then
scapegoats Negro families for failing to
do the job the job of the school is to
teach so well that family background is
no longer an issue so dr. King here is
rejecting their kind of implication of a
Coleman report that schools cannot do
much to change the dial
and student achievement and so if we
look at what's happened since the 1960's
at various measures of achievement
differences we see pretty strong
evidence that black and Hispanic
students still score substantially lower
than whites in all grades okay there's
evidence that these differences emerge
by age two so there are studies that try
to test measures of cognitive ability at
age two so those aren't very
sophisticated tests but by the time you
get to kindergarten black students and
nationally representative surveys are
about two-thirds of a standard deviation
behind in math and about point four
standard deviations behind in reading
these differences grow as we get older
so by the time we get to high school the
black/white achievement gap is about
point eight or one standard deviation
depending on the survey and there's been
almost no progress on these gaps in the
last 40 years black students in white
families know so the gap is tends to be
smaller it's basically what you expect
so this is an unconditional statement
black versus white if you look at rural
areas for instance the gap tends to be a
little bit smaller another thing people
often look at is in cut the income
gradient and there's some discussion
that the gap between rich and poor is a
much more salient division than the gaps
between races nowadays whereas it wasn't
like that in that in the early period so
that's that's kind of an ongoing debate
and so when we look at these gaps we see
that you know public schools still
struggle to close these gaps and the
question that motivates a lot of our
agenda and the lab is the bat of whether
schools alone can ever close achievement
gaps okay is Coleman right or is there a
role for schools to push the dial here
so what we'd like to do is know what
makes a good school now everyone has
views on this
I is if the teachers is it the
principles and governance the human
capital policies is a school a good
school because there are talented peers
or is it that it has small class sizes
or computers in the classroom or is it
the types of educational philosophies
what do they teach and so there are many
things that go into what we call the
education production function and what
we try to do at our lab is to try to
quantify school effectiveness before we
can try to think about what would change
or increase the effectiveness of schools
now this may seem like an easy problem
figuring out what makes a school
effective or what is in effect of school
but in practice this is a very
challenging problem and it's a problem
that has confounded policymakers in a
number of settings one of my favorite
examples of this comes from New York
City so in New York City in 2002 there
was a landmark change in the governance
of the public school so the blue mayor
at the time was Mike Bloomberg and he
appointed Joel Klein to be the
Chancellor of schools so Joel Klein at
that time noon very little about public
schools he was actually most famous as
the Department of Justice attorney
general who busted up Microsoft and what
Joel did is he brought in a lot of
upstarts upstarts McKinsey graduates MBA
types into the public schools and he
started a big push toward centralizing
control in the public schools and that's
actually the time that I got involved in
some work with in New York City Public
Schools um that was 2003 a couple years
later the client administration put out
this big initiative to rate high schools
actually not just high schools but
elementary and middle schools using
these new data systems that they had
developed and so they put out these
report cards for schools in the 2007-8
school year okay so every school was
rated ABC uh
and D or failing and the idea was if a
school was rated failing then they would
have to do something about it okay and
this is part of a nationwide movement
sometimes associated with the No Child
Left Behind Act to start rating and
holding schools accountable for their
performance so now that we have tests
maybe we have the opportunity to do this
so let's take a look at the distribution
of report cards in the New York City
progress report system in the first year
and in the second year yep yeah what
makes a good school seems a little bit
of an ill-posed questions you might ask
what makes a good school for whom right
and so I'm sure you thought about this
yes a natural sense of matching maybe
yeah so that's I mean that's kind of the
second step of the question so what
makes a good school for whom in what
context yes so I'm going to show you
something on that specifically today so
we I think we have some evidence of
schools that seem to be successful for
certain types of students that probably
are not going to be successful for other
types of students okay let me come to
that okay let me continue to tell you
the story of New York City because this
is a fun story so they develop this
formula to raid schools and so here's
our distribution of grades in the first
year that's the blue line so you can see
forty five percent of schools are rated
a about thirty five percent are rated be
the red line is the what happened in the
second year okay and miraculously that
happens to be an election year the
number of schools that are rated a goes
from 45 to nearly ninety percent okay so
what happened in New York is they change
the formula I think perhaps cynical for
me to say is it cynical to worry about
grade inflation or perhaps the Klein
Bloomberg reforms were so successful
that all these schools improved and you
know there's this old law of Don
Campbell for the famous sociologists
that people call Campbell's law says the
more any quantitative social indicator
is used for social decision-making the
more subject it will be to corruption
pressures and the more apt it will be to
distort and corrupt the social processes
that it's intended to measure and I
think be york city's report card episode
is an example of that so what we try to
do instead of coming up with these
report card type formulas come up with
methods that allow for objective
assessment of school effectiveness okay
and so our research program has done a
lot of work studying the Charter sector
and other types of school models so I'm
going to talk a lot about charter
schools and then touch a little bit on
exam schools in the time that I have
okay so yeah question yeah it's suppose
that your methods were to come to be the
standard way of evaluating schools yeah
do you think there's any way that you
could manipulate these
quasi-experimental measures by screwing
around with the scores in such a way
that you can make your school look
better by putting people on sides of
this continuity no really I do think
there are ways I think we haven't gotten
to that point but a very obvious thing
that I worry about is we tend to find
this result that weaker kids benefit
more from going to charter schools and
so that's based on the lottery so we say
once you apply let's compare those who
won and who lost so its objective in the
sense that we can do is we say starting
at the application point what's the
effect of the school if I'm a very
sophisticated school leader and I want
to look better in the rankings and I can
go out and try to target the kids who
seem to be benefiting the most from my
school now there's a question of whether
that's good or bad so if it's indeed the
case that these are the kids we benefit
the most maybe that's an investment we
want to encourage I haven't seen any
direct evidence of that kind of thing
happening when reason areas that it has
a lot of people here are interesting
questions of like adversarial inference
where you're trying to like in for some
statistical process but like you're not
playing against nature you're playing
against someone who's like deliberately
trying to screw with it and so it seems
yeah so let me tell you a bit about
charter schools or charter schools are
maybe the most significant education
reform in the United States right now so
about in the last four year there's
there's been over a thousand new charter
schools that have been authorized in the
United States more than five percent of
kids currently in the US go to charter
schools okay so what's the idea so it
turns out the idea actually originates
with Al shanken who used to be a leader
of the aft the major teachers union in
the United States his idea was well
let's try to experiment with in the
public schooling sector and let's let
anyone who wants to start a school be
able to run a school it's going to take
public funds but it's going to be held
accountable ok so a charter school is
basically a privately managed public
school so it's a school that's privately
managed in the sense that they have
autonomy in terms of how they can hire
and fire staff they have autonomy in
terms of what they teach but they are
subject to some regulations like
students have to take standardized tests
if public if a charter schools not seen
to be achieving what they set out in
their charter they can be closed ok so
the regimes that charter schools face
differ by state so let me tell you a bit
about Massachusetts so in Massachusetts
there are no for-profit charter schools
so anyone including you know Microsoft
for instance could propose a charter we
would apply to the state we would say
these are our goals this is how we're
going to staff ourselves this is what
our budgets going to be and typically if
the Charter is approved by the state you
would get a five-year contract okay and
then after five years would be
reauthorized so in Massachusetts 9 out
of 75 charters that were granted through
2011 have actually been lost ok so
sometimes that's because of financial
misdeeds at this school so that happened
at a Springfield charter school other
times it's because of poor poor
moments and occasionally that's been due
to just lack of demand no one wants to
go to the school okay the reason why I
charter schools are very controversial
one reason is that they typically
operate outside of local collective
bargaining agreements okay so the
teachers who work at a charter school
are most frequently not part of the
Union so charter schools can therefore
hire fire and behave very much like
private schools in terms of managing
their teachers staff now just a bit more
context about Massachusetts so you might
have seen in the governor's race some
discussion of the charter debate here
Massachusetts there's a cap so no more
than thirty five percent of children in
urban areas of the city are allowed to
attend a charter school so that
restricts entry of charter schools and
there is a very heated debate I mean
every other day in the globe you'll see
an article about the Charter cap where
proponents of charter schools and their
expansion want to change the Charter cap
ok so the governor came out last week
saying we should eliminate the charter
cap and encourage more schools now the
concern against that is if you have a
district that's majority charter what's
going to happen to the host public
schools will they be able to achieve
economies of scale and who will the kids
be who are left over okay so one of the
interesting things about charter schools
is the way they admit children so in
Massachusetts by law a charter school
must run a fair lottery when there are
more applicants and seats okay now
there's actually no provisions in this
lottery it's a fair lottery so you might
have seen movies like Waiting for
Superman where children are waiting to
get their chance to go to one of these
charter schools and that's what happens
here it's decentralized they're
literally drawing numbers out of a hat
or some schools have a little bit more
sophisticated randomizing devices and so
what's nice about this from the research
angle is that this lends itself to you
know very rigorous comparison among
those who apply we want to say what's
the effect of going to a charter school
we simply compare
those who are offered a seat to those
who are not offer a seat because a
lottery number is only manipulating your
opportunity to attend a school and it's
unrelated to things like your family
background your motivation just a random
number draw once we look at the set of
applicants we can attribute differences
in achievement between winners and
losers to the opportunity to attend a
charter school okay so this is something
that's made research on charter schools
expand significantly it's like we have a
clinical randomized trial in medicine
and so let me just tell you a little bit
how this works in one of our studies and
this is a the first study of a Kip
school so you may have heard of Kip Kip
stands for the knowledge is power
program this is the largest charter
management network in the United States
so they operate more than 200 schools
they were originally founded in Houston
but now they are throughout the nation
and until three years ago there was only
one Kip school in New England ok and
that wasn't Lynn ok so Lynn for those of
you has anyone been to Lynn
Massachusetts Lin Wu yes yes so I learn
is famous for biking trails but it's
also famous for this old Diddy Lynn Lynn
city of sin that's a city that used to
be an old kind of manufacturing town
that's seen better days I think it's
fair to say so what did we do in this
study so we went to Kip Lynn and got
their admissions records ok and we
wanted to reconstruct what happened on
lottery night now in principle this is a
really simple thing to do ok in practice
it's incredibly difficult ok because
there's no little or no oversight on
lottery record-keeping at these schools
and the typical strategy we would do is
we would get the records from the
schools often these are in Excel
spreadsheets with different colors
there's the person who ran the lottery
is no longer there so we have to do our
best to try to convince ourselves that
we have actually reconstructed what
happened on lottery night so at Kipp
Lynn we had 629 applicants from two
thousand five to two thousand eight and
so we process these files by removing
guaranteed applicants or repeat
applicants or applicants that we cannot
match to state records so one thing we
have access to is records on everyone in
the state so we end up focusing on
children who are first-time applicants
that have baseline information so that's
information on their race and their
gender and so what happened at this
school is of those 446 applicants 303
were offered a seat and 143 were not
offered a seat now the next thing that
happens when you look at those who are
offered is not everyone who's offered
goes to the school okay so this is the
idea of partial compliance okay so in
fact at this school seventy-three
percent of those who are offered
actually attended Kip and on the other
end here 143 of those who are not
offered five of them somehow found their
way into the Kip school okay so we
actually have non-compliance on both
sides okay not everyone who's offered
goes and not everyone who's not offered
does not go okay so what do we do how do
we handle this well what we do is the
technique of instrumental variables okay
so this is a something that I think some
of you are familiar with probably all of
you are familiar with but the idea is to
adjust for partial compliance okay so
the the way this works is we take our
numerator here we say of those offer to
see the 227 what's the average score of
those kids now remember not everyone
offered to see it actually goes to the
school okay so we find that their
average score is minus 0 to 8 how can
you have a minus score we've
standardized scores to have mean 0
standard deviation 1 what about those
who are not offered with the average
score there is minus point 381 okay so
if our question is what's the effective
and off for a week it's just one year
yeah yeah so these are kids who will
ought to read in fourth grade and they
take em cast test and at the end of
after one year exactly yeah yeah so our
score here is the state of Massachusetts
has a standardized testicle em pass and
this is after 11 year okay
alright so yeah so if our question was
what's the effective and offer we can
just look at the numerator if instead we
want to ask what's the effect of
attending or enrolling in Kip we have to
divide by the difference in take up
between the two groups okay so this is
the wold estimator this is instrumental
variables this is local average
treatment effect it's all the same thing
so here the difference in this example
is point 8 15 for those who got an offer
and as I mentioned some of those who
didn't get an offer actually enrolled in
the school so that's how we've adjusted
for partial compliance and in the end
the numerator divided by the denominator
gives us the effect of for this cohort
of enrolling and Kip a point for six
standard deviations that's right yeah
it's really important that you just
because if you look at this it's huge I
mean they're different questions if you
want to say right so P biologists would
call this intent to treat or the reduced
form right yeah yeah you have to deal
with partial compliance yeah not
everyone takes their offer at these
schools in fact actually at this school
yard the take-up receive typically
higher than what we see in another
setting so yeah I mean you probably
expect there to be a difference in me
it's not random of course I like like
the ones who get in and don't go
probably are like have less you know
their parents care a little yeah but I
mean it turns out this solves this
problem exactly because we get the score
so of these offered many of them don't
go but we still get their score exactly
yeah so they go back to Lynn public
schools some of them move to a different
district so that that turns out to be
somewhat significant and that's why you
need state records to be able to follow
kits in other districts are you just
based on actual
attendance yeah do you find that through
is significant selection bias nutrition
or not uh so if I look at who yet there
there isn't no not know most of these
kids are not opting for private schools
so we can get scores for all these kids
it's a very disadvantaged population so
I think that's a big part of it here so
so this is how this works for you know
one set of applicants for one grade we
have a couple of years of data from this
school we have many tests outcome so we
can pull all of us together to get an
average effect and when we do that we
find that Kip Lin produces a cheap and
effects of about a third of a standard
deviation per year okay in math now is
that a large effect or not so I already
mentioned that the black/white
achievement gap in Massachusetts for
middle school is about point eight
standard deviation so our per year
effective Kip Lin is enormous in fact if
we were to extrapolate this per year
effect for two to three years that would
be enough to close the black-white
achievement gap okay I'm sorry no nope
so kiplyn is uh mostly black and
Hispanic yeah yeah it's about eighty
percent black and Hispanic yeah question
huh perception by the parents that there
are greater expectations by the students
and the principles I mean by the
teachers and the school here I mean it's
crazy I would never want to teach you
one of these schools so we've gone to
school many times the the teachers at
the school are on call till 11pm every
weekday so any child has having any
issue they have to be available by their
phone okay and so strange because the
students I talked to he lost it like
Charleston chest dorchester Roxbury they
suffer from extreme extraordinary
boredom because of Isaiah charter
schools are at school yeah because
they're like they're dying I mean
there's starving for some intellectual
stimulation yeah
I mean it's unscientific but I hear that
consistently that the incredible low
expectations with students yeah a lot to
a lot of them dropping out just from
boredom yeah I think that's part of the
story I wouldn't be surprised if Lynn
public also had some of that going on at
Kipp is known and its iconic because
people call these no excuses charter
schools or some people call them
paternalistic charter schools their
schools that basically keep you there a
lot so your school year is much longer
your school day is much longer you come
in on weekends you wear uniforms it's
kind of a boot camp he found all these
factors that are highly correlated yeah
it's cool improvement so you're saying
this school implements that this I mean
this this is emblematic of that actually
yeah yeah I so come and Kip invented
this is what I'm saying actually yeah
yeah uh so uh uh uh yeah go ahead that's
assumes like you know perhaps we can
extrapolate short yeah this is a per
year effect and in these studies that's
right we tend to see that the first year
effects larger than second and third
year effects although in general I mean
we're getting this dose-response
relationship so it's hard to actually do
this extrapolation without some more
assumptions I'll show you another thing
that'll blow your mind in just a second
okay yeah this few slides back it wasn't
there a data point that said the average
student stayed enrolled for 1.2 5 years
um where was this okay so that this is
just an example of this so the final
estimate is different yeah yeah if i
take this group yeah yeah that that's a
great question actually so sometimes
people worried that going to one of
these schools it's so kind of much of a
boot camp why would I stick around at
these schools so i can say a couple of
things about that the first thing is
this method is not compromised that by
that because even if you leave after two
years we would get your score from the
state database and we would attribute
you to being at getting an offer right
so you would be on the you know you'd be
in this cell right here but the other
thing is in terms of interpretation
right so maybe these schools are doing
so well because it's very easy to
educate once we've kicked out all the
trouble makers and what happens at Kipp
actually and and in Boston sample is
many more schools that you're actually
no more likely to switch out of school
if you got an offer at a charter school
versus another traditional school so
this this fax of people point to this
you know people are switching schools
they would say Kip you know thirty
percent of Kip's incoming class is not
there in year two our point on that is
you need to benchmark that against
another traditional public school and it
turns out that another traditional
public school the movement rates are
similar and the fact is this is just a
really highly mobile population so
usually those facts are not quoted in
context so when we look at the causal
effect of getting an offer on school
switching we see almost no evidence that
you're less likely to bet you're more
likely to switch because you've been
kicked out of the school yeah yeah okay
so this is for fourth grade kids okay so
I have to drill down and do this for a
given set of applicants so when I when I
report this point 35 this is a weighted
average over all of these possible
fourth grade applicants fifth grade
applicants fourth grade applicants that
I get a fifth grade score for a sixth
grade score for a seventh grade score
for and that's where we get this per
year effect from okay so does that help
Josh yeah okay uh yes okay so let me
show you another thing okay so we have
some work looking at this larger set of
charter schools in boston ok and so
Boston really kind of is ground zero for
the debate about the Charter cap happen
right now and so this is some
descriptive information from one of our
studies where what we're doing is
plotting the test score distribution of
Boston area middle school charter
applicants before they apply so this is
in the baseline year and then we're
going to follow winners vs losers in
year one year two and your three okay
and so now what we have here in the top
are those who lost the lottery and what
we have on the bottom of those who won
the lottery and I'm showing you two
different distributions blue represents
black students white represents a red
represents white student so if we have a
fair lottery should be the case that
these two distributions look very
similar the winners vs the losers before
you participate in the lottery ok this
is the baseline year if a coin flip
determines your assignment there should
be no difference between the blue line
here and the blue line here in the red
line here in the red line here and
indeed when you do the statistical test
there's no difference so let's now
follow these cohort forward where we
know that bottom panel wins the lottery
in the top panel does not win the
lottery I'll make one comment that's
quite important is most of our
applicants that these schools are
actually black students in Boston okay
so what happens after year one so the
bottom two distributions between black
and white students get much closer to
one another okay whereas the students
who lost the lottery still there's this
divergence between black and white
students let's look at year too so this
is now seventh grade we continue to see
the divergence among the students who
lost the lottery and we have further
convergence for those who won the
lottery and finally when we get to the
last year that we can study for these
kids we see what I just alleged okay is
that winning the lottery for this sample
narrows the black white and it's it's
gone all right whereas for the lottery
losers we still have this divergence
this is driven by a couple of things one
thing that's very important is these
schools in Boston are
usually effective for black students
okay so white students tend to come into
these schools with higher baseline
scores we saw that I mean this is the
baseline year so the white distribution
is all the way to the right compared to
two black students so so black students
are catching up to white students here
in this sample now it's basically a zero
for the white students yeah yeah okay so
what is it about these charter schools
in Boston that are producing kind of
these dramatic effects so that's a work
that we've looked at in other studies so
in a paper and 2013 in the American
economic journal we collected a lot a
largest set of lottery records of any
study to date from the state of
Massachusetts so there we took records
from lotteries just like in the Kip case
we went to all schools in boston we went
to schools it throughout the state that
conducted lotteries and repeated our
study design okay and the kind of bottom
line of that investigation is here so
I'm plotting lottery based estimates for
three different categories okay so on
the x-axis here i have math effects on
the y-axis i have english language arts
effects and what i want to point out
here is a couple of things so the first
thing is not all schools are actually
creating positive effects okay so this
is the zero zero point we have a cluster
of schools in the bottom quadrant these
are all charter schools okay so it's
definitely not the case that all
charters are affected okay the
heterogeneity is incredibly important
here so in the bottom quadrant we have
exactly yes so what stands out regular
schools are already pretty good so you
can screw it up there's a fantastic
question actually right so as jennifer
pointed out there's something different
about the colors in this bottom quadrant
than in the upper right quadrant right
so the upper right quadrant are mostly
urban schools and mostly schools that we
call no excuses schools based on surveys
of school practices so standards and
it's think of Kip I mean out of your
homework you can't wiggle out of your
homework I mean they actually suspend
students at a much higher rate so that's
something that the state has actually
clamped down on there because of
concerns so the non-urban so there's a
couple of things that are stunning here
right so the non urban's are here I mean
remember these are lottery studies so
that means all of these schools are
oversubscribed so even though at this
school here ok I can't tell you what
school that is this had just a lottery
for three consecutive years so children
parents are queuing to get their kid
into the school yet their achievement is
going down both in math and English ok
now why is this so that's the topic of
that paper in there in the AAA and
there's a couple of candidate hypothesis
so one hypothesis is that the students
who are attending these schools are
different in terms of their
characteristics so we tend to see it non
urban schools the types of pupils to go
to a non urban charter school actually
are reflective of non urban districts ok
so that means they're much more likely
to be white they're much less likely to
get a free and reduced-price lunch and
they tend to have a higher baseline
score than this state so it could be
that charter schools are just not
effective for students like that ok he's
positively selected students another
candidate hypothesis is the fallback
option so I lottery into a charter
school if I don't get into that school i
typically go to the traditional house
district school so in Boston if I don't
win a lottery and Boston then I go to
one of the schools that may not be a
good fit for me whereas in the suburbs I
go to a maybe a halfway decent suburban
public school ok and then the final kind
of a hypothesis is no excuses hypothesis
that it's really the practices at the
school ok so here yes they're all
they're all non no excuses in fact they
actively uh you know they these are the
groups that hates standardized tests for
instance ok so it you know there's a bit
of a story of a kind of horizontal
differentiation yeah exactly right so I
mean I think what's going on at
non-urban charter schools something bad
happened to you at your you know
suburban high school or middle school so
you kind of you're upset about the
teacher or you're having some personal
problems with some students so you opt
out for the non ribbon schools and these
guys are not kind of no excuses but by
any means right so so when you actually
when you do the entire kind of
accounting of these three factors
students are different the outside
option is different and the school
practices are different our paper argues
that most of it's coming from the school
practices actually ok so um and so that
that kind of led to this hypothesis that
you know we have in rowland has been
also pushing about no excuses being at
the heart of a success of these charter
schools ok let me not get into the
details of how we did that accounting
because i want to show you some other
stuff so one thing that people often say
is well maybe urban Massachusetts
schools are special ok and indeed there
are nationwide reports put up by groups
that have other methods they're not
lottery based methods that are often
quoted in the media so the standard
quote is every for every good charter
school there's a bad charter school ok
so the Credo report this group at
stanford is very well known for saying
this that uh you know on average chicago
he's only done it in New York in Houston
yeah yeah so in in New York he has a
paper that's kind of actually they were
published back to back in the same issue
of the journal on this so he has the
Houston thing is that i'll come to that
actually
it's kind of related to this so what
what happened in Houston is Roland went
and took five schools and he ran those
schools okay and the idea was let's let
me try to introduce some of these no
excuses practices it turns out they're
actually doing this without Roland's
involvement anywhere and this is
happening throughout the country okay so
this is what's called a charter school
takeover so the federal government Arne
Duncan was famous for doing this in
Chicago he's the Secretary of Education
he he came in and he authorized federal
funds to go to whole school turnarounds
okay this is where you take a
traditional public school that's
struggling and you have authorised you
have organizations bid for the right to
take over and operate that school what's
interesting about this is if you look at
New Orleans ok and New Orleans most of
the charter schools there are actually
takeovers they're not brand new startup
schools so Kip for instance does not
engage in takeovers they only do startup
schools they say we want to build the
schools up grade by grade it's too hard
to take over a school because we have to
take on all the problems that those
schools come with so what what's
happened in New Orleans now in 2014 New
Orleans became the first District in the
United States that's a hundred percent
charter so every single public school in
New Orleans is a charter school ok now
that Washington DC is the next District
that's about sixty percent of schools
there are charter schools okay in Boston
we have a cap so thirty-five percent of
enrollment is at charter schools and so
in other work we've tried to study the
effects of being grandfathered into a
charter school through a takeover okay
so this is interesting because takeovers
are happening moreover the types of
students who are grandfathered in there
passively enrolled they're not the kid
who's got the parent who figured out
when lottery night is how you apply what
the deadlines are so and you see that I
mean in terms of their attributes
they're really negatively selected so
their scores tend to be much lower
coming in so on and so forth so we can
do the same kind of analysis as I
showed you for the lottery study uh with
the following assumption that we look at
the set of schools that were potentially
going to be taken over the students at
those schools look similar to schools
that were not taken over once we
conditioned on the appropriate strata
okay so that's the idea of our study and
let me just show you one quick thing
about New Orleans so here is the growth
of charters in New Orleans okay so at
the recovery school district the solid
line are all takeovers okay so this is
the schools that are taken over by 2014
more than 20 charter schools are these
takeovers okay and there are outfits
that specialize in takeovers like
renewed Crescent City first line each of
those operate five or six schools now
okay a Kip also operates in New Orleans
and it's an example of a startup school
so initially in the early part you know
of two thousand post-katrina most of the
charters were actually the startups but
that's become unfashionable okay because
it's so much it's like they have an
easier lift okay when you're a startup
so what's the effect size in New Orleans
okay so we can look at this and here's a
figure from that paper so in New Orleans
we have on the left here we've plotted
your math score for children who are
eligible for grandfathering so that's
this dark black line and children who
are ineligible this is this gray line
okay this is our matched sample and we
do the matching as of your minus one
okay in year zero you're at the school
that then gets announced to be taken
over and then we can see your
achievement not only in your zero but in
year one and year two and that's on the
Left we have math on the right we have
english a couple of things to point out
here is if i look at the baseline year
when we do the match we have a
remarkable parallelism for the kids that
we compared those so it seems like we
have something approximating a lottery
ok the other thing to point out is by
the time we get to the end two years out
the achievement levels of the students
who were eligible for grand following
their school was taken over a far
surpassed those that are ineligible for
grandfathering okay and so the paper
goes on to turn this into a prettier
estimate the last thing i want to point
out and this is quite interesting and
this is why this requires a fair amount
of work is let's look at the legacy year
the last
cheer that you're there you see there's
actually a divergence in the opposite
direction ok and so think about what's
happened you're at the school it's
December they announce your school is
going to be shut down it's going to be
taken over ok it's not surprising that
the children who are at that school the
grandfathering eligible kids there are
treatment is actually lower in that
closure year than children who are their
match twin ok yeah it's pretty much all
the teachers go when this happens why
are they gonna why are they going to
encourage the student yeah yeah so
there's a potential direct effect of a
takeover announcement that we have to
adjust for in this work and another
thing that we have to address from this
work is the fact that I said by the end
of 2014 every charter every school in
New Orleans is a charter school so we
want to say what's the effect of a
charter are Connor factual is changing
over time so when we go through all the
kind of econometrics of that we find
charter effects of point three five
standard deviations for math and put 15
for a for english and i think this is
valuable because it shows that the
massachusetts results are not unique so
we have another site Massachusetts New
Orleans another site is Denver actually
so this is what I talked about in our
lunch a couple of weeks ago so Denver is
a very unique site because it's the
first District to actually unify
admissions to charters and traditional
public's under one application okay so
that by the way that's an ongoing
discussion in Boston right now so there
are efforts to try to have a single
application where you just ranked
schools and they go through a
centralized matching algorithm so in
Denver what happened starting in two
thousand twelve students could rank up
to five choices and they would receive
priority based on various criteria like
where they live in their income
eligibility and they use a centralized
matching algorithm gellan chap was
deferred acceptance algorithm okay that
many of us have studied here including
when Nicole and I were grad students and
so what's cool about this is there's
some randomness embedded in the match
okay and the randomness can happen at
first too
versus at second choices at lower
choices so the question is how do you
extract the randomness in the most
efficient way to actually approximate
what I just showed you from Kipp ok so
we solved that problem so let me skip
over that and just show you the result
before getting to the very last topic
when we solve that problem if we look at
math effects here so let's just focus on
column one in Denver the math effect of
winning a seat at a charter is point
five standard deviation so this is even
larger than in Boston and New Orleans so
I think it's fair to say there is this
consistent picture emerging that urban
charter schools Denver is mostly a
no-excuses districts there's actually a
bunch of Kipp schools here are changing
the dial for these kids at least on
short-run assessments we've done work
looking at medium term assessments like
college going and s80 performance in
Boston the kids are now old enough that
we can see that more kids are going to
four-year colleges and you're getting
about a hundred points boost on your
SATs scores okay yeah there's this
gradient that weaker could send a
benefit more so that's actually perfect
segue to talk a bit about another
project so what if instead of focusing
on children at the lower tail of the
baseline score distribution we think
about kids at the higher tail okay and
so that's what exam schools are geared
for okay so what is an exam school an
exam school is a selective public school
where you take a competitive admissions
test to get into so the most famous exam
school is Stuyvesant High School that's
in New York City Bronx Science is
probably the second most famous when I
was a kid there was a TV show about
Bronx Science you know I grew up in
upstate New York's I used to dream about
going to these schools in Boston we have
the Boston Latin School oldest high
school in America has anyone here gone
to an exam school I know one person went
to Brooklyn Tech right ok so the
yeah I have tons of MIT students right
yeah Richard Feynman right is the famous
Stuyvesant grad no Mel keys I mean the
list is an impressive list so our
question in this project is to try to
understand whether the spectacular
achievement for kids at these schools is
due to the selection process I always do
to actual value added at this school ok
and it's a question that I face every
day teaching at MIT MI I have some very
bright students am i adding any value to
them or not and the way we're going to
do this is we're going to exploit the
admissions process ok and so the idea of
our study is a regression discontinuity
so we're going to compare the last kid
to qualify for one of these schools to
the first kid not to qualify and say you
know they basically got the same score
on the admissions test but one got to go
to the better school and one did not so
let me show you how that plays out and
that was a little bit more complicated
and a simple discontinuity because we
have multiple schools but here we have
Boston okay and I'm plotting whether or
not you got an offer at a Boston exam
school at this recut off so the O'Brien
school is here latin academy is here and
the latin school is there on the right
okay and let's see how much time do I
have luxury I don't have much much more
time so let me skip to the second one
here okay so okay so the y axis is
whether or not you got an offer so the
fraction of kids who have a test score
of you know just above the kutta who got
an offer okay so I skip to the next plot
here because there's a couple of things
going on here so the dark line here
indicates offer at that particular exam
school in the plot here so at the
O'Brien school if i'm to the left I
don't get an offer right I didn't
qualify if I'm to the right nearly all
of us get an offer okay it's almost a
hundred percent ah and as I go further
and further to the right this number
goes down because kids who go further to
the right are now qualifying at the next
high
or school okay so that's what this is
intended to show if i look at the dotted
line offer at another exam school you
see these kids are now getting offers at
the next best school same kind of thing
is going on here at latin academy when I
look at did I qualify latin academy I
don't qualify from below the cutoff but
if I'm to the right I see that most of
these kids are getting offers now why is
this not a hundred percent it's because
some of these kids actually said I'd
rather go to O'Brien okay and then as we
go to the right this share goes down and
we see more kids getting offers at lat
at the Latin School okay so thinking
about what we're actually measuring here
is somewhat subtle and so limit let me
show you the same thing as going on to
New York City okay so here is Brooklyn
Tech I clear the cutoff do I get an
offer I only don't get an offer if I've
ranked another school ahead of Brooklyn
Tech same thing at Bronx Science and
same thing at Stuyvesant how do we make
sense of this I we think the best way to
kind of put this into some perspective
is to parametrize these schools in terms
of peers okay so what's the average
characteristic what's the average
achievement level of your peers at these
schools so that's what we have here from
New York City so we've taken New York
City score distribution and said if you
didn't call if you didn't clear the
cutoff at Brooklyn Tech you're going to
go to a high school where your typical
classmate has point five standard
deviation achievement okay this is their
achievement before high school whereas
when I clear the cutoff here my
achievement level of my peer goes up by
more than half a standard deviation the
same thing is happening at Bronx Science
it's not quite a half a standard
deviation a little bit smaller but there
is a jump okay and then by the time we
get to Stuyvesant we're back to roughly
half a standard deviation so you might
say how can we actually tease out stuy
vs bronx science versus Brooklyn
Technical these are all great schools
but this shows you that there's still a
pretty sharp gradient that people who
get into Stuyvesant typically want to go
there over the other schools so they get
the most highly qualified kids now let
me make one other comment so we're
looking at this in Boston we're looking
at this in New York New York's exam
schools
on a whole nother level than Boston's in
terms of selectivity okay so the average
s80 score at Stuyvesant on the 1600
scale the last time I looked this up was
14 20 okay the average SCT scored MIT
was like fourteen eighty that year okay
when you go to a Bronx Science it was
about thirteen thirty when you go to
Brooklyn Technical was about 1250 12
fifties ruffa very good i mean the
nationwide median is supposed to be a
thousand twelve 50s roughly where Boston
Latin is okay when i go from latin to
latin academy i go from about 12 50 to
about 1100 when i go from latin academy
20 bryant remember this is a selective
school in Boston were you taking a
competitive admissions exam to get into
the average s80 scored O'Brien is 950
okay that's below the nationwide median
just for reference the average sht score
Lexington High School was about 1300
Newton's about twelve twelve eighty
Brookline is about you know 1300 as well
acting I think is the highest but it
fluctuates a little bit okay I'm sorry
they are no it's a it's massively over
subscribe yeah okay so if we really
believe in pure effects if we really
believe in selective education our hope
is when I look across the threshold here
we see a difference in achievement okay
so let's take a look at the graphical
evidence and then we'd kind of go
through the details in the paper so our
first outcome here is advanced math
regents so um for those of you in the
New York system this is typically taken
in 11th grade but if you're a stockade
you're probably doing this in 10th grade
trigonometry and you can see there's no
difference across the threshold what
about in Boston here are grade 10 math
scores no difference across the
threshold who cares about these
standardized tests you could tell me so
why don't we look at s80 scores there's
no difference in s80 scores this may
seem like a difference but this is an
optical illusion when you do the
econometrics it's not statistically
significant and then let's see so I
didn't add the college results here but
you're not likely to go to a better
college you're not more likely go to any
college there's no effect across
comes we can track into college ok so
the title of this paper is called the
elite illusion okay because there are
these students that exam schools are
doing well but it's not because of a
school at least at these cut-offs okay
we've also done some recent work on
Chicago's exam schools yes it's also a
boondoggle to teach at one of these
schools at Stuyvesant just like it's a
boondoggle to teach at MIT so I think
that's a really deep point I should wrap
up here that the ability for families to
accurately assess value added I think is
not very strong and unfortunately that
dictates many choices that we make in
life yeah so yeah so let me wrap up here
thanks very much thanks a lot Glen great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
