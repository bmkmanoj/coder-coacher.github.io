Microsoft Research India let me present
a demo call Stratus cloud support for
efficient mobile communication this will
be presented by dr. vishal nada who is a
member of our mobility networks and
systems research group this group works
on topics such as mobile computing
network systems and cloud computing hi
I'm Vishnu nada a researcher in the
mobility network systems group at
microsoft research India today I will be
demonstrating a technology that we
developed here called Stratus so at a
high level Stratus uh is basically
designed to deliver smart energy
efficient connectivity to mobile devices
such as smartphones and tablets by
leveraging resources in the cloud so
before I begin talking about Stratus let
me just give a brief description about
the problem setting so here I have
energy characteristics of a mobile
device which is equipped with a 3g
cellular interface so I have a plot of
power consumed over time and in this
particular experiment the mobile device
started communicating for a short period
of time at the beginning of the
experiment and if you notice in the
start when the raid the device was idle
the power consumed was as low as 200
millivolts now as I start communicating
the radio interface turns on and goes to
a high-power active state and the power
consumption is almost thousand 100
milliwatts so this is almost five times
as high as the base energy consumption
the second problem that you see is the
communication over it so these
interfaces don't turn on and turn off
instantaneously notice that even after
the communication ended the radio
remains in a high-power active state for
a long duration of time so this is the
communication over it for every
communication that you do now for
example if you have an application which
is doing sporadic communications then
will remain in a high-power active state
for a long time thus draining energy the
third problem that we find out is the
impact of signal strength so it turns
out that if you are operating in a poor
signal condition the energy consumption
is much higher I have a plot of energy
per bit for various signal strength
values the leftmost bar corresponds to
poor signal conditions and the rightmost
corresponds to good signal conditions
and you can notice that the energy
differences SI has 7 x so given these
insights about energy consumption of a
cellular interface we went on to design
Stratis the key idea is to sort of shape
your network traffic in order to match
it better with the energy
characteristics of a cellular interface
in status we leverage a proxy in the
network which interim which is acting as
an intermediary between the phone and
the Internet all traffic that is being
sent and received by the phone is
mediated by this proxy now we employ
several optimizations on the link
between the proxy and the phone wherein
we get all the energy savings as well as
byte savings so let me talk about these
optimizations so we employ a compression
in order to reduce the number of bytes
transferred on this link as a result we
are able to reduce the time the radio is
going to be active and doing
communication as a result we saw we sort
of address the problem one now the
decompression on the form is designed to
be very efficient so that bandwidth
saving translate to energy savings the
second optimization we have is
aggregation the key idea here is to sort
of batch together sporadic communication
and send it in one shot I as a result we
sort of save on the second problem which
is the energy overhead for each
communication right so by patching
together you sort of pay far fewer
communication overheads the third
problem is basically about the signal
strength so what we
here is an optimal scheduling strategy
which looks at signal strengths so the
key idea is we sort of look at signal
profiles for your frequent routes how
the signal varies over your say home to
office route the next time a user goes
along the same route we use the profile
to predict when the signal is going to
be good and scheduled in those periods
and get energy savings now let me show
you a demonstration of these
optimizations on the phone so this phone
has a client which basically connects to
the proxy in our as your deployment now
what I have here is I'll basically go
about showing you a browsing session and
show you how much energy and compression
savings we get so for example let me
open a browser session so I am just
going to a certain page this is a very
light page and you can see that the IP
address here is basically an IP address
of a cloud hosting let me do a few more
sites here so I am loading a page here
and what is happening here underneath is
the requests are being sent all the way
to the proxy in the in the cloud and the
proxy basically does two things
compression and aggregation and sends
back the results to the phone and the
phone is basically loading the page
right now let's just see how much
savings we got for this simple session
here the total bytes that were actually
received by the phone I mean the
decompressed size is 900 but we already
saved around four hundred and 80
kilobytes in this simple session and the
compression is like 53 / % here if I do
few more apps you'll notice the same
thing and apps requests are being
basically sent to our proxy so it's just
loading the data so now the bytes
transferred is increased and we still
see are seeing quite high compression
savings here how about the energy
consumption so let me quickly go over to
another monitor here
which shows the energy savings for this
transaction so what I have here is power
measurement of the the phone so notice
that as soon as I start loading the page
the the power consumption increases and
once the radio is done with
communication it should go down so the
scenario one is showing you energy
consumption when you are going directly
to the site and not using Stratus now
the total time to load the page was 25
seconds and the energy consumption was
2,000 micro ampere ours now if I were to
do this with Stratus notice that it
loads much faster so the radio on time
is much shorter and in terms of energy
we just take half the time to load the
page and we consume half the energy now
let me go to the second demo which is
basically signal aware scheduling so
what we have is an actual drive where we
had a phone which was playing audio
stream something like a Pandora audio
stream and I am basically showing at
real time what is happening during the
drive now on the the rightmost bottom
part is the actual location of the car
top is basically a front view camera of
the drive right here i am showing the
instantaneous signal qualities there are
two curves here one corresponds to the
actual signal strength and the second
curve corresponds to the the predicted
signal strength and I am also showing
the playout buffer state which is
basically how much data i already
received from the network right now
notice that I am comparing two things
here one is a naive approach where I am
just going directly and fetching
irrespective of the signal quality and
the second one is if i were to download
only chunks of data at the right times
so the green bars here corresponds to
the periods of time where i download
data and these corresponds to periods
where the signal is good and notice that
the energy consumption is much lower
compared
naive approach which just downloads
irrespective of how the signal quality
varies another constraint we take into
account is the state of the playout
buffer I should make sure that there are
no disruptions when I am listening to
the radio stream and that's all I have
with this demonstration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
