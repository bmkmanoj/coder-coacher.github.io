in a computer at all it's the human
brain shaped by millions of years of
evolution our brains are finished
booting up just a few years after birth
we recognize subtle differences in the
things we see we understand spoken
language we speak our minds and we read
and write this is possible because of
the immense neural network in our brains
the vast interconnected system of
neurons that processes our thoughts
across trillions of connections deep
learning draws inspiration from how the
brain learns to train software to
perform human activities using massive
amounts of training data and loads of
computing power deep learning is able to
recognize speech interpret and classify
images and read documents some of the
first steps towards true artificial
intelligence project Adam is a new deep
learning system developed by Microsoft
researchers that exhibits world-class
results in performance scaling and
accuracy for visual recognition tasks so
what does that mean with project Adam we
created the world's best photograph
classifier for example a photo of a dog
would be easily recognized by a deep
learning system as a Corgi but Adam is
so powerful that it even knows the
difference between a Pembroke Welsh
Corgi and a cardigan Welsh Corgi to do
this we took the largest data set we
could find and trained a massive neural
network with over two billion
connections using 30 times fewer
machines and developed an image
classifier that produces double the
accuracy of other systems in the
industry the results are mind-blowing
that's 50 times better than the current
state of the art system
this is game-changing technology
imagine if you could photograph the food
you're eating and could instantly
receive accurate nutrition information
to make smarter choices imagine if we
could identify a serious disease well
before it spreads based on a photo and
some basic lab results project atom
represents the first step towards
systems delivering more accurate and
more intuitive assistance all enabled by
deep learning there certainly will be
challenges getting to the next level but
we're optimistic that we will eventually
be able to train brain scale neural
networks power the applications of
tomorrow inspired by the brains of today
