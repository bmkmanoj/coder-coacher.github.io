you
well it's my pleasure to introduce
chang-dong who comes to us from Indiana
University he's a PhD candidate at
school of informatics and computing at
Indiana University and he's a lab
manager for ethos which is the ethical
technology for in the homes of seniors
and today is going to talk about some of
the cool research they're doing there
jangle over to you thank you I feel
we're honored to be here representing
the ethos group at Indiana University
and I'm talking about several
technologies we have developed for the
homes of seniors our key observation
here is that the best technology is not
necessarily the right technology I'll
start my talk with a situation of the
aging demographic and a brief
introduction of the ethos projects after
reviewing some of the challenges that
are faced by the seniors I'm going to go
ahead and introduce some of the
technologies our lab has developed to as
solutions to address these challenges
according to the 2010 statistics
conducted by the administration on Aging
which is part of the US Department of
Health and Human Services about 39
points sorry thirty nine point six
million Americans were above the age of
65 representing thirteen percent of the
US population the number of older adults
will reach 70 2.1 million by 2030
representing one fifth of the US
population among or
non-institutionalized older dells around
one third lived alone which is about 11
million people by stating
non-institutionalized who refer to
people who live in their own homes
instead of institutionalized
organizations such as nursing houses
another large number come from older
adults who reported to have some type of
disabilities for example difficulty in
hearing vision cognition ambulation
self-care or independent living was
reported by thirty-seven percent
in 2010 ethos stand for the ethical
technology in the homes of seniors the
ethos team develops and also evaluates
new technology to keep seniors safe in
their homes and connect to their
caregivers while giving special
attention to issues of ethics and
privacy with the projects primarily
located at Indiana University
Bloomington campus our team consists of
faculty members graduates and undergrad
students from school of informatics and
computing School of Public Health and
pervasive technology institute the
interdisciplinary nature of our team
enables us to develop technologies for
to support the personal privacy for the
seniors and also care for their house
and personal security current prototypes
being evaluated at Indiana University
it's been is about encouraging the
healthy behaviors decrease isolation and
also support independent leaving for
faculty members affiliated with the
ethos projects professor Jean Kemp
specializes in human centered security
and privacy from technical design to
public policy professor Cate Connelly
focuses on pervasive technologies
development of Technology applications
and devices that is related to user
privacy professor lisa huber research
his generala g and issues related to the
aging process and professor Capanna
Schenker of studies issues of technology
and informatics from the social science
perspective as the lab manager of the
ethos projects I'd like to introduce you
our living lab the ethos lab is located
in the center of Indiana University's
Bloomington campus and the house is
equipped to facilitate the prototype
development implementation of prototype
in a real living space and also
researched with individuals and groups
we also have spaces for interviews with
our focus groups
so specifically we have converted part
of the house into a simulated apartment
we have a very small living room a
kitchen a bathroom and a bathroom that
represent what a small efficiency
apartment or a living condition might be
for a senior the purpose of the lab is
to study the technologies that are going
to end up into people's homes in the
near future as we develop the
technologies in our leaving lab we're
getting ready to test the possibility of
placing our prototypes in a real outer
community meadowood is a retirement
community located in bloomington indiana
we invited 60 people from metal wood and
also some other community residents
toward to our alert to our leaving lab
we true then around and show them about
our technologies they were divided into
groups and had our conversations with
our researchers and developers we
recorded their responses and also our
researchers have spent a fairly amount
of time analyzing their data yes this
what
so you talked about ethical ecology
right could you elaborate a little
right so we are when when we're
developing the technologies we are
always incorporating the feedbacks from
the seniors which is our focus group and
in some of the experiment right we could
some of the experiment could be
conducted in certain way that might have
an ethical concern with OLX play of I
will actually explain in a minute it's
in one of our experiments with the
browsing record processing so there
might be some ethical concern in
conducting the research right search you
have to get IRB approval yes yes cheers
and they just beyond that you have more
concerns we people may have more
concerns but we every of users studies
have been approved by the IRB there at
Indiana University but there are certain
designs that you that are actually
beyond the requirements of IRB we're
really care about the real feelings of
the individuals that are actually
participating in the experiment
participants are seniors or it's because
that you are instrument in their house
uh actually a house is a the seniors
house is a good example because we're
communicating with seniors who do not
actually have a lot of experience with
the technologies something that may look
normal to us as you know a from the
population aged between 18 to 36 for
example we're pretty familiar with data
sharing within the social network for
example but the seniors may not be
comfortable with sharing you know
information with another people you know
some of the browsing information for
example but do you consider that to be
ethical or not because we're not trying
to release that to a malicious third
party but we're excuse me we're
respecting the seniors on opinion
towards certain technologies so in the
next few slides our x-ray
explain some of the technologies we
thought it was a cool idea but these
seniors actually do not consider it in
the same way and rejected our design
hope that as for in question okay this
is I think maybe would I like to
understand what Jane is trying to
understand to like what's the difference
between something in gattaca than what
something being approved by RB so
preferably your RB also arms and I r we
will not approve things that
participants are not agreeing to bro so
what what you're running into is an
anchor and ethical issue I guess this is
a different from the agreed to because
we're not talking just talking about a
study that the participants are are
agreed to agree to be joined I mean
we're placing an object in a senior's
homes of forage for long period of time
we're designing a products that they
would accept and they were used every
day so it's different front if they are
agreeing on participate in a study and
we are I'm tailoring our design to their
knees so that they feel comfortable of
using these products without you know
they might say oh okay I i agree of
participating in this study but I won't
use it in my everyday life so we really
want to design some you know assisted
living technology for the seniors and
help them to communicate and you know
stay stay connected excuse me okay um so
after the demonstration of our
technologies in the lab we are we have
recruited eight senior households to
participate in the Institute testing of
our research prototypes specifically we
have placed our design technologies in
four of the houses and consider that to
be our test group and for the rest for
houses we do not place any of our
technologies in visa any houses and
consider that as our control group after
two men
that the the outcome of these Institute
testing have extremely changed our
initial design of many of technologies
and you know a lot of our technologies
are were actually originated from the
journey logical theories and some of the
things have been changed a lot at ethos
building the innovative prototypes with
the app to date technology is not the
ultimate goal for our researchers
instead we strictly follow the iterative
design tech methodology of prototyping
and keeps on integrating the feedbacks
from a series of in-situ testing in our
designs we always understand that we're
designing for a special population a
population that may not have a positive
attitude towards you know new
technologies and is also demographically
different from our developers and after
several rounds of revision and in-situ
testing many of our prototypes have
changed in terms of in the physical
forms for example from our initial
design we sometimes need to reduce the
number of functionalities so that the
seniors would accept and another finding
we had was that the seniors were really
concerned about their personal privacy
of in use of these technologies when we
had we even had a prototype that was
rejected by the seniors even either
during the conversation with our focus
group or after the in-situ testing so
here is an example of a rejected
prototype that which our developers
thought it was a cool technology
recorded a mirror motive so installing
in the living room of these seniors the
mirror motive actually works like you
know a touch screen of a big tablets the
functionality of the mirror motive
includes responding to you know event
invitations and also observe the active
level of involvement in the community
activities for example and real really a
real-time videos can also be streamed to
the mirror motive
if there is an activity happening in the
community room yes so this is in their
living room or this is in the community
room this is an in this seniors living
room we're we're transmitting there
there should be a camera and the top but
but I i guess the picture just didn't
the camera and a display yes living room
right and it's recording and um it's not
always on uh it's not always on
recording solution and i believe the the
primary functionality for the mirror
motive is you can actually touch the
magic mirror to respond to an invitation
to events and like for example if i'm
organizing an activity in the community
room and i can invite the community
members and the event invitation will
appear in the mirror motive so there is
a monitor that live in a community yes
like an apartment you know uh yeah for
example in an and then a senior living
community right and and they could have
one of these in there right loga room
and i'd say hey get together for cards
right exactly and never come back okay
yeah and some real-time video will be
streamed to to this from the from the
community room yes um so the seniors
actually doesn't they they actually
don't like the idea of having you know a
magic mirror with touch screen endure in
their houses and therefore rejected our
prototype in the next few slides out go
through several challenges our
researchers have identified that the
seniors might experience when living
alone and also our proposed solutions to
these challenges the first set of
challenge include the severe risk of
angering that come with the onset of
dementia and other cognitive
disabilities in outers an outer
suffering from these problems may leave
their houses without proper closing or
at an unusual time and vendor this
and risk is social exploitation outers
are known to be a wonderful population
as NS such are targeted by various kind
of scams right both by external agents
and maybe by some unscrupulous family
members finally there should be a system
that protect the house against a certain
threat that is not specific to the
outers with a buddys always associate
wisdom which is robbery and our
conversations with our focus group
showed that the seniors are sometimes
exploited by unscrupulous individuals as
well you know but from some of their
family members instead of from the
external criminals there are however a
large number of existing monitoring
solutions designed for houses which
traditional always on solutions there
are often two options once proposed
option is that the caregiver could come
over to the houses of the seniors at a
regular interval for example once a day
right and upon discovering that the
seniors missing from the house and
determine that the absence is
inappropriate then the seat of the
caregivers could go ahead and review the
tapes the problem with this approach is
potentially the long response time the
van ring behavior may go undetected
until it's too late alternatively the
caregiver could observe a real-time
video at overtimes however the
continuous recording system involves the
capture and storage of large amount of
sensitive information in a centralized
location as a solution to this problem
we built the portal monitor and event
triggered a monitoring system that is
installed in houses of the seniors we
installed three cameras near the front
door of the ethos house and these
cameras could be triggered by different
kind of sensors and the cameras are
communicated with a control panel which
is normally a tablet placing inside the
house of the seniors
and what makes our portal monitor really
different from existing solutions on the
market is that our system does not rely
on a stable internet connection so
specifically when the cameras are
triggered a series of images are sent
from the control panel to this
caregivers cell phone through the
cellular network as multimedia message
by using no permanent local storage our
system eliminates the risk of being
compromised that existing many in the
number of centralized data out when a
message is received the interface of
most of the cell phones presents a
one-click deletion actually the nature
of these cell phones motivates the user
to remove the extraneous information
such as the images sent by our portal
monitor and also to protect the outers
privacy the system can be deactivated
with a cognitively challenging switch so
we could actually ask the senior to
serve a very simple capture or to answer
a very simple question to deactivate our
assistant in a very short amount of time
and the seniors might want to do that if
she is expecting a large number of
visitors and do not want to flood the
cell phone of the caregiver this second
type of the challenge that these seniors
really cared about was falling in their
homes study shows that the estimated
incidence of Falls for the outers above
the age of 75 was at least thirty
percent each year in 2003 more than
7,000 us seniors actually died because
of falling in their homes existing
solutions include variable objects such
as a necklace which can be attached to
the seniors and panic buttons in the
personal emergency response system can
also be used in case an accident and
curse sinners of course could also call
911 or the caregiver if she's conscious
and be able to pick up the phone
and alternatively there could be an
always-on indoor monitoring solution for
the senior however this solution is a
clear violation to the seniors privacy
according to the discussion with our
focus group turning the light on in the
middle of the night is a hassle for most
of the seniors and falling at night
could also become undetected for seniors
who really rely on a necklace because
many of them will remove the necklace
for better sleep we designed the beacon
strip which is assisted living
technology that would use the pressure
the pressure paths to help the seniors
navigate in the dark so specifically it
provides illuminated pathway between the
back and the bathroom when a person gets
out of the bat during the night the
pathway would activate and as an aid of
navigation the prototype was constructed
using the heavy metal carpet pressure
sensors to detect the footsteps and two
rows of LEDs to create a lighted path
and unlike many other new no existing
solutions our mechanism is designed for
falling prevention instead of detection
and does not require a device to be
attached to a person the pressure sensor
in the bed was actually a very cool
technology that we thought because the
the pressure sensor can can be placed
you know under the mattress in the bed
to detect the quality of the sleep right
however the seniors actually do not like
the design they thought it was a
violation to their privacy because it
sounds weird to have a sensor in the bed
and with the industrial support from
Microsoft Research we're considering
removing the the sensors inside the bed
and attaching Kinect sensors on the wall
to detect the of the falling in their
homes and also we're considering using
the homo ass in our design
for the new for the new following
detection system yes your conclusion
seems like Ashley the opposite to me
like a pressure sensor is a it sound
like a no information sensor and it's
sensing like exactly what you want to
sense like writing necked will have a
lot of collateral information right but
actually we're placing the sensors in
different places the bathroom is
considered to be a very private private
location right you're replacing things
inside your bed which is different from
placing something in on the way to the
bathroom which is we're attaching the
kinect sensor on the wall on the way to
the to the bathroom but hiya yeah it's
interesting it's an interesting thing
was the problem that you didn't want to
light the lid carpet up every time they
step on it because no the fee of the
because trooper will will still be there
and as an aid of navigation right but in
addition to that because right now we
don't know if the if the senior have
falls or has fallen or not on the floor
so we were need to have a have it
another sensor to see if they have
actually fallen on the floor and we
don't want to use the sensors on the bed
because they consider that to be you
know privacy violating because it's
weird to have something like in my
application right one is about I want to
light things up when it started right
that's great yeah you could imagine that
completely encapsulated in your carpet
right the lights up it's nighttime the
lights are off they stuff on it it comes
on right right is very close to what you
built modulo the
then it sounds like oh that that's
prevention and then there's a separate
problem of detection does that mean yeah
and then in detection you need more
sensors to know if they are if they're
phone but actually we could actually use
the same sensors of that field in the
beacon strip and bute on more you know
logic to see if if they have yeah
falling on the floor yeah and I have to
say that the second part is a lean you
know it's an ongoing projects and so I
don't make in the separate slide for
that and we are we're doing this as our
first step and after that it will go
through you know conversations where is
our focus group and it will go through
the Institute testing before it actually
comes up as a solution thank you and as
many of us could imagine that social
isolation could be one of the challenges
that people have when they're leaving
alone we think that it's critical to
maintain a communication channel between
the seniors and the caregivers the
current technology enables people to
make phone calls or send text messages
however this solutions require
additional spending on the user's end
and also may involve a long learning
curve at least on the seniors end we
have a very cool idea in which we can
place a pair of devices in the houses of
the caregivers and also the seniors one
in each House the two devices can be
connected through internet or other
technologies for example cellular
network on each device we place a motion
sensor to detect if someone is around
and also we have a light to indicate
that the other side of communication is
around right now the question then
becomes what kind of objects should we
choose to build our technology on and
we'd like to build our technology on a
very common object so that it's not seem
very intrusive to the seniors
and we have started our design with
building our technology on a flower
report which is cute right we thought it
was a very good technology and it's was
a great integration of the geological
theory and awesome modern technology
however the seniors don't like it
because they were worried about the risk
of someone adding water to the fake
plant although it's actually a silk
plant they're still considering there is
a risk of you know adding water and you
know a mess up with the electronic
device so they have rejected our design
after several rounds of conversations
with our focus group we redesigned our
technology and this time yes like this
was before my muse my life do you think
you're writing too much about this
feedback uh yeah um actually we are not
worrying too much about feedback instead
we are considered this population to be
our target customer if we're meeting
this technology we really think that if
they can accept our technology then they
will buy it and then we can actually
actually sell our technology to the
targeted you know focus group right it's
not it's not like we're caring too much
because if they accept that then they're
there the potentially customers of our
products right so am not made for sign
saying that you're doing water
this plan well then it will that them in
this case we might look into civ to them
right we really want to build our
technology in an environment and on a
common project on a common object that
it seems normal to the to the
individuals do do you place a sign on a
normal you know plan in your home no
right I mean light on it right right
different uh it's yeah it's from our
understanding that that is the case but
during our conversations with the focus
group it's a different story we really
respect their suggestions and also we're
not saying that the planet is has been
you know the plan is also in the
products in our group and if you know in
the future someone likes it we will
still be developing or improving on the
plant we're not saying where they did
the project has been rejected you might
take it and I'm now doing a ton it this
is to me it says Oh different people
might come and care for objects in their
home right you know that's out of their
control so like if you were and I had a
plan and we knew that on the addressing
watered plants in our house or you and
you know like so there may be sort of a
lack of control of the store next thing
going on that's like resonating it to
that so they don't want anything that
looks like one thing that has
six now that doesn't mean like you could
redesign a plant in so many different
ways to bet even if you wanted it it
would make you like trying to tell by
the river but it may be there may be a
more subtle point underneath about that
who has who's coming into their houses
and doing things and so they don't have
to think about telling each caregiver
the water that's the fake plant or
something like that like there might be
what's going on there then David don't
know okay did they ever have fake
Christmas trees like Indian me oh I've
no idea cuz I I personally I always not
part of the user study team because we
were you know having a large projects
and a lot of teams of researchers and I
personally don't know if you're
interested I can you know point it to
the right person to answer that question
yeah so what you consider a company has
to be consistent across some fraction of
users or in one person complained and
then you back off the idea because
somebody ah Ashley we we actually
haven't back up the idea i I don't know
they the fraction of you know how is the
fraction would work for for changing our
prototype but I can tell you is that we
we're we're kind of developing these
products in many branches we're not
stopping the development of the plant we
could have you know many branches so so
that people would accept at least you
know the when we talked with the 60 of
focus of you know 60 people in the focus
group they thought that that plant was
not so so good and so that's why we have
redesigned our clocks and so that we
hope to cover as many individuals as
possible yeah so this is another
solution that I will introduce and after
several rounds of conversations with the
group we have redesigned the technology
and this time we buta ambient clock
which allows the caregivers to be aware
of the movement of these seniors while
being minimally invasive
so we still have the motion sensor on
the top of the clock and also we have
upgraded the display of the activity
indicator so this time we're not only
showing that if the other end is here
right now but we're showing the previous
activity for the past 12 hours on the
clock so the of the ambient clock should
be placed in the seniors home and is
paired with another clock in the
caregivers home whenever a senior is
around the presence clock the other
clock I mean the repaired clock would
light up to show that the senior says
around and for the caregivers clock as
well if the caregiver is around the
seniors clock will light up the
advantage of our design over other
existing solutions is that a clock is a
common objects in the home environment
and so that it's less intrusive than a
camera for example and in addition since
the activities is transmitted over the
Internet our the running of the clock
does actually does not require expanding
on the user's hand if the internet
connection is not available we also
provide an option of transmitting the
information by using text message for
example I'll spend most of my time today
focusing on the next identified
challenge which is online fraud while
seniors are known to be one of the most
vulnerable populations to both online
and offline frost people seem to be more
worried about the safety when they're
surfing online since the large portion
of the senior population may not have
received a sufficient training on even
how to visit a website we could not
expect them to distinguish a good
website from the bath website during the
interview with our focus group we found
that they're really concerned about the
possibility of visiting a malicious
website that would look exactly the same
as a legitimate website and the problem
become more severe
when you know personal information such
as their banking account or credit card
number has been included in you know a
malicious website even though many
security solutions have been proposed
and implemented according to the
anti-phishing working group we're still
facing facing the problem in which an
increasing number of fraudulent website
are reported every day however in the
real world threats and offline scams can
often be mitigated pretty easily for
example people who wanted to buy a Big
Mac will definitely choose the
McDonald's restaurant instead of the one
shown on the right hand side which has a
very similar logo how about kfj it looks
exactly the same as layout of a KFC
restaurant except for the last letter in
the logo even for people who are fooled
by the logo or the layout of the kfj
restaurant for the first time since
experiences are often shared within a
social network and the knowledge about
the kfj will soon become the group
knowledge of a bigger social network so
why can't we apply the same approach to
the virtual online space I like places
in a real world the virtual sites would
be distinguished only by the website
design the domain name and possibly the
ssl certificates we think that at least
in part the internet fraud were enabled
by a lack of reliable and trusted
sources of information we think that and
ideally there should be a website
reputation system that could provide
clear security indicator to the user and
help them to make an informed and
educated decision as an example of
attack that is enabled by a lack of
information is the phishing attack fish
phishing attack is very hard to prevent
because they praise direct directly to
the absence of resource identification
information and absent any other
information other than an email from a
self plank proclaimed bank
a user must decide whether to trust this
website that looks exactly the same as
the one he or she has visited before
without much consideration sorry so
popular web browsers usually equipped
with website blacklist when a malicious
URL is centered a warning page is
displayed before the actual content is
displayed right so there communicate the
potential risk of this web page however
there could be delay in updating the you
know the warning messages and as an
example I have randomly picked a
phishing sites from the fish tank which
is you know a source for verified
phishing websites and then I actually
entered that at exactly the same URL
into you know a popular web browser and
unfortunately that URL is still
accessible from that browser without
triggering any type of warning and you
know alert messages therefore instead of
trust some you know trusted third party
on Ilan we would like to learn from the
solutions from the to address the
offline scams and incorporate our social
network idea in this simple design so we
have Alice here who has a friend named
Bob and Alice trust Bob's opinion ok
although alex has never been to this
website before Bob's suggestion about
this website could really help Alice and
make a decision about trustworthiness of
the website in 2006 professor gene camp
at Indiana University have proposed the
net resistant to protect the browsing
security for the individual users as
shown in the figure the North Metra's
toolbar contains security indicators
from the friends and colleagues shown in
the middle the natural trust toolbar
also have on the white list from the
trusted third parties shown on the right
the design Gulf naturals is
to assist the online users to make an
informed and educated decision about a
website even when they're visiting a
website for the first time as an
important feature of net Ross is the
integration of contacts through
information showing on the left hand
side so specifically upon registration
and individual could actually create
multiple web pseudonyms to indicate
different vibe browsing contacts each
visited website is associated with one
or more of the predefined back contacts
for example youtube com may be in
someone's play contacts while a visit
maybe to turbotax com may be part of
someone's private context in net trust
the contacts are primarily utilized to
indicate different groups of browsing
history sharing so that is the
individuals are all insured their
browsing experience with a subgroup in
their social network yes um this does
some
yes but we are not expecting the these
seniors to understand our underlying
logic here I'll explain in a minute
about our integration into the browser
and how these seniors actually respond
to our design this actually I mean the
browser toolbar was liked by a lot of
younger population we had a user study
was younger population and they like the
idea of social network and you know the
the browsing contacts idea but the
seniors don't like it you're absolutely
correct so based on our previous
research the phishing website usually go
up and are identified after a short
period of time and are then taken down
in other words the phishing website do
not stay up a long period of time The
Naturalist toolbar takes advantage of
this important feature of fishing and
use its features that are not under
control by the malicious agents for
example the users social network users
browsing history and friends social
network and Friends browsing history
this feature would potentially be used
to prevent the fishing victim from
misdirecting other individuals the
network is more secure than some easy to
copy visual cues for example of some
lock images that are placed in in a in a
web page for example and are more
understandable than some online
certificate information right so in
Nashville people in the social network
could contribute in the ratings in two
ways a visit to a website by a member in
the social network is considered as an
implicit rating the lowest implicit
rating is zero meaning that a website
has never been visited before and an
initial visit will create a rating of
one consider the fact that the phishing
website often have a shorter lifetime we
have designed the delay factor so that
it really takes a few days before a
rating takes effect once the ratings are
entered into the social
social network and also the local
database it will subject to a decay
factor so if the website is not visited
again the original rating will drop to
maybe half of the original ones so that
you know phishing website could receive
a lower rating if they are if they don't
have any more visit after a short period
of time explicit rating is more
intuitive users of assistant could
explicitly rate of website using a
numeric scale between negative and
positive 5 when designing the natural
system one of the questions we had was
how large does the social network has to
be to cover the majority of the sites
that has been visited in other words
would it be possible to limit the number
of participants that you share your
browsing history Wiz but still receive
enough information to make the right
decision the map metcalf law argues that
the value of the network increases
proportionally to the square of the
number of participants so that means
okay it's always an increase if we add
more people to the collaborative network
yet in terms of security and Trust the
activities of spammers fissures and
malware distributors make the converse
case we think that a trade-off will need
to be made between the degree of sharing
browsing history and user privacy on the
one hand certain amount of browsing
information is clearly useful nearly
every collaborative network is improved
by increasing the number of participants
the more information received from the
you know other participants potentially
the more accurate the results on the
other hand more participants inherently
increased the information disclosure
regardless of the benefits to the more
in the more people whom you share your
browsing history with potentially the
larger the data the data or the
information disclosure is I
so therefore we need a balance between
the privacy and information sharing we
have examined the value of the network
and also the value of network size in
two domains according to what the vat
browsing history is useful discovery and
evaluation discovery is commonly seen a
lot of collaborative search engines for
online resources this web services allow
the expert to guide the less experienced
individuals in their web searches and
online services like collaborative
search are looking for a broader view of
the van therefore each participant's
ideally contribute some new information
to the community evaluation on the other
hand only requires certain degree of
homogeneity so that suggestions or
ratings made by one person is useful to
the others evaluation or ratings have
widely been implemented in many social
networking you know related devices or
services to help users make decisions on
the online services so for example our
naturals toolbar is certainly part of
the evaluation services we have run
experiments to to find out recommended
size for the resource sharing network
and the discovery of and evaluation
services respectively the data that is
used in the experiments was compared
used based on the internet browsing
history of over 1,000 participants who
were undergrad students living in the
same dog's rebuilding at Indiana
University Bloomington campus this is a
fairly homogeneous population and
inherently students in that dorm were
similar in age living conditions and
course loads and currents degree
objectives browsing data were compiled
front port 80 and any HTTPS traffic was
not compiled or recorded URLs were
trimmed so that you know no session
information is recorded participants
were
this distinguished by the hash of their
MAAC or mac edges and then we have
assigned the identification number of
Franz 02 1083 to preserve the anonymity
yes so this is still part of this family
kitchen interest right this is a one of
the questions we had in mind is because
in the natural system we're relying on a
social network to provide the to provide
the rating right so how Lars thank you
for which is important are you I go to
this event website right make sure that
all the other people have been to that
bank website and this is kind of busy to
my bank website and that's
right but if you get exclude HTTPS URL
then I don't even get any legitimate
bank website our visit mr. X right a lot
of I hope most of the banks there's two
things they employ a GPS so you ready to
see any of this website to visit history
for you you're talking about the
malicious website may not use HTTPS you
want to also have a web browsing history
for good bank websites right but you
will get that from your trace if we
write it I mean of the web browser may
have you know different sources of
information displayed as different
security indicators but the net was
provides the we also have external third
party list which is you know a list of
legitimate banking website that is an
important indicator that we will show
into the abuser and especially for the
senior they were no directly from the
toolbar that okay this one is a banking
website and this rating is not generated
by you know a social network it's the
third party what we're saying here is in
addition to the third party we're
relying on you know the ideas of of your
social network right the like the wisdom
of the cross like how do you get
information from other people and
generates a big picture of you know a
website even though you have never been
that before it's not necessarily that
the website is a banking website or not
hey maybe you can take it offline but I
think if you want to collect a
representative samples of websites that
people
if you exclude all HTTPS traffic stored
in your health then you're going to be a
lot of legitimate sites that people is
it not just banking that's right we
could actually talk about the web
traffic that we have we have collected
later I mean I do have the data
somewhere but we could actually talk
about it later after the talk maybe so
each browsing record is in the form of
time and the URL and user ID individuals
were given the option of not being
included in the experiment in two ways
first there is the VPN available so that
you know we're not trying to you know
compile that kind of traffic and also in
the announcement of the experiment we
have included the contact information of
our researchers so that the undergrad
students could actually contact us and
opt out and also there is a two-week
period which you know before the contact
out of our experiment so that our
researchers have time to provide a
workshop for you know tour installation
to the undergrad students and our
experimental data actually covers a
period of eight weeks from march to may
two thousand eight we use the browsing
history for over 1,000 user and to build
a simulation of the social network we
started with browsing history will of a
randomly selected user and then keeps on
adding the browsing history of other
users to you know a size of 50 and in
order to better capture the relative
value of the browsing records we
evaluate the record in three ways the
first approach is domaining in which the
urls is considered just according to the
domain name and the host is our second
approach which we consider the entire
URL up to the third forward stash the
third method is called the first level
direct
free where we consider up to the first
subdirectory in the URL this graph shows
on the results of our experiment for
evaluation web services as more people
join the pool we found a rapid increase
in the percentage of websites that
people had in common in their browsing
histories after 10 participants were
added into the pool about ninety-five
percent of the domains have already be
covered at that point however the
average value of adding each additional
participant brings very little increase
after 40 additional participants nearly
ninety nine percent of the clicks will
go to know incites the experiment shows
that with a homogeneous population
evaluation web services such as net
trust do not require a large number of
participants after consulting our focus
group we felt that we could further
improve the natural system and make it
more accessible and more easy to all to
operate we therefore design the net
rescue which is in visualization of our
security design the translucent cube is
connected to the computer through the
USB cable and the cube is equipped with
the green and red LED lights the
naturals cube risk ratings from the
current website okay by using the same
underlying code of natural system so as
we could see from the graph here the of
the lowest grade of the net rise is
negative 5 in the cube it shows purely
red and the highest grade positive I is
showing in purely green indeed in
addition to you know showing the current
rating we also an enables user to make
changes to the explicit rating so as you
can see from the left hand side of
figure we have two arrows viewed on the
two sides of the cube one up arrow and
one down arrow
the user could change the rating of the
current website by pressing one of the
arrows for most of the time the color of
the net was cube will change accordingly
however according to some conversations
with our focus group some important
external ratings such as you know the
legitimate banking website would
dominate the color of the net Roz cube
in one study participates age from 18 to
36 responded pretty positively to our
net was toolbar they particularly liked
the idea of having a social network
design and you know you could share and
rate a website you could comment on a
website and share with your friends
however when we presented the net was
toolbar and also our Naturals cube to
the senior population they seems to like
the naturist cube better they thought
the natural sku provides physical forms
that are easy to see and immediately
understandable rather than being very
small on the screen one of the
participants even express the concern
about color blind users being able to
distinguish you know a good website and
that website which actually formulate
the idea of using a pausing design or a
pausing pattern of the red LEDs in the
naturals queue we installed our natural
cube and browser toolbar in our
recruited test and control groups and we
have simulated a phishing attack by
sending a phishing email to both of the
groups the outcome was pretty you know
encouraging because none of these
seniors actually responded to the
phishing email however after the in situ
testing we have received a lot of
criticism on the web browser toolbar
because they have complained about you
know the toolbar being too complicated
and took up space on this browser and
the feedbacks we received about the
browser oh the naturals cube is actually
pretty positive to conclude we
understand the goal of our technology is
or the homes of seniors so designed for
a special population means that we
cannot simply utilize the most recent
technology or some existing technologies
that are designed for the entire general
public instead we're tearing the
technology to the senior population
right from the very beginning in the
prototype design as I explained in a
couple of prototypes we have we had in
mind both the physical forms and the
underlying algorithms have changed a lot
from our initial design and I'd like to
also point out that we're not just
applying one technology one existing
technology to another field by saying
designing for the seniors and the homes
of seniors we're looking at a completely
different world of technology needs and
at last I would like to acknowledge the
NSF grant titled auto-dials perception
of digital privacy and I've like to
thank some of my colleagues and thanks
for your attention
yes chief and how do you rate the
seniors who are actually a little bit
younger you do understand some of this
technology have you come across them and
their reactions be different um actually
for the natural system I I believe you
were talking about that we we had
because of the limitations of the the
focus group that we have so we were not
be able to distinguish you know
different ages but I believe that that a
certain amount of the senior adults will
they were like our natural tool bar as
well but we actually didn't actually
consider that you know in the paper
yes so what are the key um yeah what one
of the key inside here is the best
technology is not always the right
technology especially when they are
designing for a special population yeah
we what are the characteristics of these
elders that we need to consider when the
design um I I think that there will
always be you know several guidelines
that you were finding in our papers but
I personally think that we really could
improve our design by consulting the
focus group and you know really perform
some in situ testing I can't tell you
that you know exactly you should follow
these guidelines and them you will have
as successful products but our our
experience was we're following certain
kind of a cycle so that we're always
consulting them and invite them here to
the house because we are demographically
different we were in the different age
so a lot of perception that we had may
not be applied to a special population
like them so that's my personal opinion
about that yes going back to my point
seniors range from 60
right now those who 60 who will be very
happy with technology mm-hmm whereas
maybe the 80s knocks so you didn't get
you found to them kind of right and I
have to also mention that our system is
highly modularized so it's not
necessarily that the seniors are
actually applying or technologies in
their homes some of them might like the
ambient clock while the others might
like the trusted queue and we also have
other technologies that design for you
know perhaps the seniors beyond the age
of 90 and I have to say that as the
point is not as not applying every
technology in the seniors homes where
did we're trying to helping them and
tailoring the technology to their actual
need so you could actually if if this is
an actually a product then you can
actually choose whatever you want as
modules right maybe can try to touch on
this leg so sometime you have to make
this day very scalable right now don't
work if you have to do like market
testing for like the tenth thing you're
developing the market the effort in that
market testing is the same as the first
thing then it seems there is a problem
here with respect you like how
frequently and how many products you can
design right so you have to come learn
something such that your chances of
getting it right the fewer iterations go
higher in some of those some of the
things that you're learning
uh I actually I personally think that
this is a very good question and I don't
have the answer right now I think that
we are considering this problem right
now because we're we're having many
groups of people who are designing the
technology and regarding the questions
that you were asking I think we will do
that in the next step and I believe that
and we also have other projects that
would I mean we have faculty members we
have graduate students who will be
evaluating like the expenses of
designing the technologies and you know
as I said how is the probability of
designing these are the right technology
in two ways I'm just the two is loop one
is like having a list of common mistakes
to avoid okay which is easy to compile
maybe and then one is a list of best
current practices so what I'm hearing
from you is that you're not ready to lay
down your best current practices do you
have any sub common mistakes I know
something from the experience you'd say
I never do that again I personally am
NOT you know part of the user study or
every development team so I really don't
have the answer but I'd like to you know
discuss with you maybe after the talk if
we could you know talk about that and or
direct you to the right person to talk
to I am working on the coding and
development of the natural system and
also the ambient trust and as a lab
manager I'm also you know maintaining
the entire lab and organizing you know
demonstrations and I'm also doing the
data analysis for the experiments that I
just explained like to measure you know
how many people do you need to you
actually share your browsing history
with
but just at the lab or is that deployed
the door with the pono monitor
occurrence me we have one unit that is
stuff implemented in our ethos lab and
we're expanding the photo type and we're
hoping to install that in many of you
know real people's homes but thank you
very thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
