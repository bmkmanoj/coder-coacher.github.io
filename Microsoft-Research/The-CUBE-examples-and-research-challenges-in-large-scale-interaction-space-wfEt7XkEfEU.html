hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
so it's a pleasure to actually welcome
michael daugherty here to Microsoft
Research give a talk about the cube
which is a large display at QT and be
actually great to hear where there's
opportunities for not only microsoft
microsoft research also to collaborate
within with this great kind of technical
asset that's available so thank you
thanks for the brief intro yes oh yes my
name is Michael dr. dan from QT
Queensland University of Technology in
Brisbane Australia and we have this
amazing bit of kit for large-scale
visualization which is called cube so
what I'm going to do today is just a do
a bit of show and tell all these few
things we've got going there talk about
how we did it briefly talk about some of
the content projects we have there
already talked about where we want to go
and also end with a few what I think of
the major research questions for this
area and hopefully they'll engender some
interest so this was a project that
started some years ago our Vice
Chancellor very keen and his intention
about the show the cube to showcase
Science and Technology whole new
building the 300 million dollar mark
it's a great building to work in for
researchers but it has a very important
task which is to inspire new students to
be engaged with science and to some
extent research and that's of course a
problem worldwide is getting students
interested in science so the cube it was
called the cube because the very
earliest ideas was literally for it to
be a cube going running over to stories
and you had the four panels either side
each story and eight panels and you
could then go inside of it which wasn't
which is a common idea for an immersive
space there's a whole lot of reasons why
we didn't go ahead with that it
eventually become became two sides of
that cube so this was the the final
design that's a two-story space lots of
projectors lots of touch screens
on the other side of it is a one-story
space with again projectors and touch
screens and then above that again two
more spaces some with screens some was
just projectors and I'll show you this
was the original design that went
forward with the people that developed
it physically this also I found recently
is an old sketch of when we were having
a labret discussion some would say
argument about what we were going to do
in terms of the technology and and and I
can assure you there was a great deal of
discussion about what should be there
broadly we've got some fairly
interesting kit to do with what controls
each one of the panels and I'll go
through this in more detail later in the
talk but i just thought i'd like to show
you that that there's a lots of bits and
pieces and lots of fairly sophisticated
background processing behind it all this
was a more developed image of the final
design and it looks realistic but is in
fact a cad model of the design so the
building that was to be there was very
elaborately designed to make sure it was
going to be what we wanted this is in
the process of building it you can see
bits and pieces lots of kit lots of
frames this is the spot where all the
touch panels were placed and you can see
the brackets there so they're designed
so that we can put them in and take them
out again as needed for maintenance and
so on you can also see there's a fair
bit behind and you can walk in behind
the system and this is how it is today
this is in fact an image of the cube you
can see the project there which I'll
talk some more about which is the
virtual reef you can see the stairs you
can see someone standing at level 5 it's
a two-story space with a lot of
projection equally around the other side
the one-story space end of the project
they're called the physics player in
which I go to into more detail the other
side again another project this is
called the history wall or the data wall
and this is geo-located data placed and
in this case the first project was our
information about the flood that we had
in our city two years ago which
took out the CBD upstairs the four
panels there's usually lots more going
on there but this is where students and
other people can try out touch events
and so on there's a couple of games
running there as you can see and the
final space which has a number of
projectors which can be blended or
separately run and there's some seats on
the left and people can plug in their
computer and use that space as they wish
another important point is that this is
a public space so here's the entrance to
the science and an engineering center
and you can see the physics play space
there the the bottom level first level
of the queue and it is very much a
public space and it's very much a space
that people see as they enter and of
course we have a lot of visitors have
about twelve thousand a month back so
the other side is that the large on the
other side is the large display yes so
this is just showing that as you come in
the door you see it people walk up to it
and start touching and playing with it
and of course coming around is the reef
so we named these spaces own one two
three four five and six just out of
interest some details there it's to
story high as you can see twenty multi
touch panels 10 each side of the wedge
space large projectors high lumens their
3d capable although we didn't have a
project that uses them at the moment for
the virtual reef which is on this side
we're using a 2d or 3d game engine
called torque but we're moving over the
unity soon runs across multiple screens
and we'll explain that in a moment it
interprets touches into that and there's
also info panel content which I'll show
you the audio there is a big woofer
system behind the the wedge there are
ambient speakers hang about inside and
they're also individual projectors under
each panel so that you can have
localized sound when you touch walls
coming around you get zones three and
four this is still on the bottom level
now we've got 12 of these panels across
the bottom you can see the resolution
there
got the three projectors which blend
across the top we've got the
loudspeakers and we've got our if ID
readers which allows you to come in and
swipe your staff card and then you have
access to putting your information up on
to this display space and I'll show you
some of that USB connectors under each
panel which allows us to do anything
else you want going up the top we call
it a design 5 and zone six so zone 5 has
got the four panels to speakers blended
and the audio and the RFID and on the
other side it's the projector space so
we design specifically a range of
different types of projection and
display space to allow us to explore
things and so this upper level tends to
be where we try out things or where
students put up their projects this is
an old sketch that goes as I said that
goes way back and I just thought I'd go
through some of the tech that's around
it so essentially we've got two panels
and a projector and a CPU or a PC rather
/ two panels two CPUs to graphic cards a
lot of capability and we can run each
panel as a separate High Definition
space or a blended double space you can
see we've got a fair bit of storage
they're both in ram and SSD as well as
hard disk space so that local
applications can have a blend of what's
there and what's not there and depending
on what application we use so for
example the reef has a server dedicated
server which keeps control of the state
of the reef and it keeps track of where
everything is and then sends that
information back to the local processes
for actual visualization and rendering
the other some of the other applications
we have their do things differently they
either have a local server or a using
the the local PC as a server so as I as
that diagram suggested we've got across
those spaces 54 high-definition displays
we have the gtx 680 cards which are
fairly advanced for the
we've probably another year or so in
those and SLA across the that in order
to speed up processing we went out to
tender we with this GI Dell and HP and
SGI were very keen and did a lot to make
sure that they come up to our
specifications it's essentially a
windows box but running all of that kit
there as you can see and using some
fairly high end graphics cards one of
the reasons for doing this is again for
future proofing so we can take out the
the 690 and put in the 790 when it's
available and get all the resources we
need there so we try to keep it future
proof and over SPECT as long as we can
continue to fund that so that there's no
limitation of what you can do we have a
number of servers yes only win seven but
that seems to work we've got linux linux
server there's a back up there which
really is just really command and
control the wind seven service take care
of the states of the system and also
look after the projectors 64 cpus all up
small supercomputer and it is possible
to have all of them doing one thing at
one time if if you really wanted to do
that through the linux system the three
independent networks they're running
across so that we can have external
things brought in such as say google
maps or worldwide telescope we also have
internal stuffs which is the Qt network
and that's where we use the ability to
bring up your own information from your
own file system and we have a dedicated
server just to handle the touch events
running back and forth we were a little
concerned when we were designing this
and by the time we got it together were
able to test it and then we loaded the
system up to his maximum and the the
data was showing point 95 network use
and we start to get a little worried and
we over stressed it and it went out to
you at 1.2 and we realized it was
one-point-two percent not point nine
five of the percent of the system so
we were we have not yet got anywhere
anywhere near three percent load where
we in the network so there's plenty of
room for more data and in fact that's
what we're trying to do is use this for
very large data quickly they're
depending on the projects and I'll go
through those in a moment a bunch of kit
there of course nodejs is coming to the
fore javascript is the thing we mostly
use but there are some other tools there
extemporary is the language that wanted
our people and restaurants and wrote for
the physics play room and I'll talk
about that some more mainly in order to
allow the physics to go on seamlessly
but also the networking and I'll talk
about that when we shot another
important point to make is it's not
actually touch panels it's infrared or
computer vision those panels that you
see are not responding to pressure to
touch they're actually responding to
seeing you we can calibrate that
differently depending on the application
and you could actually use it to pick up
they can pick up a body at about 30
centimeters or just over a foot so you
could use it to know someone was
standing in front of a screen and do
other things without people actually
touching the screen we haven't done that
yet but it is possible behind each of
those panels are 32 infrared cameras the
track fingers and hands through image
processing we haven't yet got to any
limit of that the important thing about
this is that you can have multiple hands
and that was what it was about that kids
students whatever you can have two or
three people are more on the same panel
at the same time we to test the system
we had it too hammered at a hundred
touch events per second for 14 hours and
systems was still running quite well so
so now sorry
no so this these panels come from a
Finnish company called multi taxon they
have a branch here in the US we were one
of their first customs because this goes
back a few years and the version that
you've got 32 cameras is the fourth
version of the technology and the with
the ultra-thin bevel which is just under
two mils so that you can stack them
together the first version of this when
we first started playing we've had two
cameras then four then eight then they
jump to 32 the reason why you want so
many cameras is is for that blend area
as your fingers move across a spot
between cameras so that it's seamless
and accurate it also allows for this
public event because the panel's
themselves the external screens are just
plastic doesn't matter if you scratch
them other damage they are very hard and
they don't scratch at all easily but it
means you can just be replaced and put
back and you're not paying a lot of
money for that so it's not touch which
in a public space is important and
they're very accurate and you can
configure the sensitivity of where it
picks up an image so we we configure
hours to be just on that millimeter
above the surface of the of the screen
to register a touch event yeah so we've
got a we've got a one of the network's
takes all these touch events and
depending on the application so it
registers the touch events which is
essentially just an XY and depending how
what your application wants to do with
it so you get the raw data it goes to
the touch server using tu i/o protocols
and then depending on your application
will take that information do with it
what you want to do for your application
so we if you like to process that
separately so the application is not
trying to deal with all of that as well
so if you've got a lot of redundant
things or people doing things that don't
mean anything to your application
they're going to be essentially ignored
but the touch server is monitoring
everything so just talk about the
application so the first one I'll talk
about score the physics playroom so
there is this Lincoln in these slides
are available so if you have a look at
that vimeo you'll you'll see this in
action
don't have time to show you now I don't
think that's Andrew standing there you
see the scale of it what's interesting
is you've got this 3d world it's
supposed to be of a nice on scientific
laboratory this application shows the
first 13 chapters of physics university
physics textbook it's got everything
from Newtonian physics through to fluid
dynamics to the optics through audio
pulse generators and so on it's all
there there are info panels that you can
bring up across it to explain all of
that what you're seeing there is is just
gravity turned to one of the Pluto I
think so all the blocks start the float
if you choose another planet which is
simply done on a medieval ossory there
boom they all drop to the ground if you
if you make them a Satan or something
they're very heavy to move on normal
gravity you can touch one of those
blocks you can lift them up and you can
build things make block so that kids can
do that or interestingly you can flick a
block from one side to the other each
two panels there is one pc and across
the top of three projectors all run by a
separate pc so that means when you pick
up a block on the left and just lift it
and flick it across it'll will go all
the way across to the other side so you
could actually have a tennis game what
is interesting is it's running across a
number of machines seamlessly and one of
the things Andrew did was to write the
software so that could happen so the
physics would be correct but also the
networking and he does that through time
synchronization not through normal
network synchronization pulses and part
of the reason he does it is because his
earlier work was on music software live
performance live coding and so this
thing about timing was something that
he's very much involved in and that this
is what his PhD was about he teaches
compiler design and had monitored
students for not understanding what he's
talking about fluid dynamics is there
there's a couple of portraits of famous
people and you can fiddle around without
it's also a fireplace and you can play
with that and so on the other project is
called qubit and this is about where you
can come up and interact with
your own information so you can swipe
your staff card it comes up the little
panel which is your file system if you
like you can have images text
powerpoints and videos in that from the
little panel that's sitting in front of
you drag it offer your panel into onto
the screen space and then it is there
for you to resize to manipulate to shift
across you can throw it across move it
across you can take it over and put on
someone else's directory space and then
it's transferred to them you can also
lift it up and put it to the top band of
the touch panels there and then it
automatically gets taken into projector
space and is projected if it's a video
it goes full size and the audio comes up
if it's a PowerPoint it goes into
PowerPoint presentation mode and then
you just simply flick your hand against
the touch panels and it'll fix through
each of the each of the slides of the
presentation so it's meant as you can
see here this is a poster display from a
conference we had there so we've used it
a couple of times for conferences in
this space so people come in when
they're registered they get us temporary
swipe card and their conference
information is up there and the other
conference presentations are there so
instead of giving them a book or
whatever this is what we give them so
we've had some interest in that is in a
general sense this is also post the
display of that conference this
application can go on any of the zones
of the cube just as any of the other
projects can so in this case a number of
people again there's I think the
limitations about 20 people at once can
have their information up there you drag
and drop you just drag it onto the
display space you can resize you can
turn you whatever and again if you flick
it up it just goes on to the full
projection one of the other projects
called the history wall or the data wall
and this is a project where geo-located
images so in this case we decided to
play with the story of the flood of
Brisbane some years ago to two and a
half years ago a large part of Brisbane
was flooded this is a also a call
sometimes called the community war
because you can go to a website upload
your images
bit of moderation and then they're GLA
tagged and then they come up so you can
come into here go to your interest area
touch on the space and up will come your
image that you put up and so this is an
opportunity for us to capture all that
information that thousands of people
took images of during the flood and it's
not lost and so it becomes into a public
environment and what you're seeing here
is a few explorations of that interface
in terms of time and how we wanted to
present the information it also accepts
video and various exploration this is
the current interface you can't quite
see that text because of the way this
space is and this is where we get into
the questions of interaction so with the
reef which I'll show you in a moment
it's a seamless space but with and with
the physics playroom it's a seamless
space between the touch panels and the
projection in this case it's not and
with qubit it's not so here if no one is
there then this resides back to an image
of the river running across the bottom
it's a long river when you come up to
each one of these panels and as you
touch it it then becomes it separates
from the others and it becomes yours and
you can change the scale and
manipulating do whatever you like as you
walk away and after a minute of no
activity it'll just sink back into and
blend in with the rest of the residing
image so in all of these sort of display
spaces you have this issue of what to do
when there's one or five or ten people
and when someone is closed or not close
to the screens what how do you deal with
those different times and in different
environments now some of the questions
we're trying to address with the
worldwide telescope project so the
virtual reef which is the large project
that's in the the inside the wedge which
is the project that I was mostly
involved with and as you can see it's
got some sense of scale and when you at
the upper level looking down because all
of these species in there are built to
actual scale so when the whale comes in
it is a 12-meter while and so on and you
do get that sense of scale it's it is
correct size mostly people interact at
this level
between the projection and the touch
panels it's a seamless blend so as as as
a fish wanders across from the
projection space into the touch space
there's no sense that then they're not
continuous there are 54 fish species
here there are 17 different coral
species the fish species are all AI with
behaviour so the little fish run away
from the bigger fish and so on despite
us programming it we weren't allowed to
have the sharks eating things that was
decided that that was inappropriate for
some reason the manta rays come in and
do their dance that they do they do very
graceful spiral dance they did to
collect fish and so on so we have that
whale comes in there's some carved
mother and calf sort of activity we've
got a boat that comes in the top and a
diver comes off and so on most of these
are fairly prescribed behaviors because
there's nothing to make the whales don't
move out of the way for anybody and so
on but it's all is all still a I fairly
good resolution as you get up closer if
you come in close and you touch one of
the fish for more than half a second
then you you grab it you collect it into
your little space here that image that
you see in the middle you can rotate and
flip around and so as you can have a
look at these things and if you touch
the eye at the bottom then you get a
information panel like this which is a
which is a web Chrome browser and you
can see the top right you can snap that
onto your iphone or your smartphone and
it'll take you to that website without
information and more information and
this is how we connect with schools so
they can connect into that into that
website and add information and do
things to read to the curriculum these
info panels have got images of the the
fish sometimes they have videos and so
on so there's quite a lot that we can do
there so this is this question of the
near and far so the fire you're standing
back you're looking at this amazing reef
I mean we do have whale song and the
whales come in and so on localize when
you're touching these things you get the
audio feedback that you've done
something
but this question of when people are
standing close they've got their own
little environment they can do their own
information seeking and standing back
see what it is so our question is what
other 3d wells what else would you do so
in an environment like this you've got a
problem when it's this sort of scale
what would you put up there in the
original project discussion the there
were five projects thought about when
was the virtual reef another was a
desert landscape that is a lot of it's
big but as life at that at dusk and at
night and so that was a consideration we
were going to do space stars we were
going to do mountains and the snow
mountain scheme which is a large project
in Australia where we turned the coastal
rivers rivers back into the inland and
there was a prehistoric forest you know
the classic dinosaur exercise that was
going to be developed we ended up going
with the virtual reef for various
reasons not unusually because it's also
iconic of Australia and Queensland but
we still have this question what are
what else are we going to put up there
well very luckily we're working with you
guys on the world wide telescope it
seems to be an ideal project because
you've already done all the content for
us when we were developing the reef
there was a lot of time and money spent
on on making all those AI creatures or
that they all had to be modeled a way to
be rigged they all had to be texture
they all had to be given behaviour took
a lot of time as did the environment or
the coral and sign it took a lot of
actual just physical building time so
we've got this wonderful content the
issue is the interaction so this is how
it is for your web interface the
question becomes an obvious question is
how do we get that up into that space
where you've not only got the
interactions all down the bottom but
you've got this problem that you might
have one person five people ten fifty
people we've got school groups and so on
and how do you interact with this
environment at that near or far scale
it's not appropriate for one person to
be coming up and touch
the panels and controlling all of this
all of the time and how do you restrict
that in some realistic way so we asked
them ideas first one is of korva nila
sky and what that will be is simply
taking what you've already got their top
and bottom and putting it all down the
bottom so putting it across those panels
and giving those same sort of icons
there for choosing a tour or choosing a
location and running it all along the
bottom the difference is that when you
touch one of those it's selected it will
gray out and it's going to play but
someone else could touch another panel
immediately afterwards and you can't
have it switching between so
implementing what I've called a jukebox
model which is they sync up line up so
when you touch your panel it goes gray
yes that's going to be listed to go and
that comes back with a number saying
when it's coming up and then we'll just
run it through that sort of process so
that means the near and far interaction
is you come up close you stand back you
see what you want you go there you
choose that you're going to go to
mercury or whatever and then you're
going to step back and watch it yep Oh
career design process like I I'd be
interested to see if you actually do
what you don't want to do let you let
people actually stop you thing like a
red couch like how do you to be
interesting to see if like people create
you know can you give feedback and
people know this is not acceptable
facility as something is happening or
doing each actually fold them not to do
that and have the Q model how much even
where you designed those things do you
account for okay we need to learn how
people going to add interact with this
and I'm going to change how to behave to
evolve this interesting question we
could explore that at the moment the
model is going to be implementing is
almost done is that you simply come
across you choose one you didn't graze
out not to be chosen again for a moment
and it synced up in a this cube model
and that's what we're going with at the
moment it will be interesting to turn
that often to see how people behave I do
think because we get school groups
through that no amount of at the moment
you say don't you
everybody press everything at once it's
exactly what they will do we don't know
how the system would respond actually if
you i think i'm not sure but if you
click click click click click click
click what does it do does it just take
the last click I'm not sure yeah yeah so
the queuing wouldn't be long because if
you've got a lot of things queued up
every time it zooms off to that location
and then it would so we have to explore
that how long do we let it do that do we
let it sit at a location at an end of a
choice for some moments we I think we
have to experiment with that we do have
some ideas about what do you do when
there's nobody particularly interacting
with it so so we'll have some some you
know slow tools running and things like
that so yeah there's a whole lot to
think about in terms of what do you do
when people are just standing back you
know do you have a planetary model the
next version there's two three stages of
this the first station is what I've
called vanilla sky which is this sort of
idea and the end the jukebox queue of
choices second one is called the solar
sky which is similar to this but it's
because of our need to talk to students
and it'll have the solar system sort of
locked in as your choices and across the
bottom panels will be each of the
planets doubled up across the ten there
can there although the the the two inner
ones right in the middle of the end of
the focus of the wedge will not be
active because people can't really stand
there and the students simply an inquire
about the planets and get information
about it including the Sun because as
part of their gear 12 or the k-12
curriculum and so we'll turn that on
when when the school groups are coming
in if that's what they want and the
third area is the is the tours and that
will be in a sense default tools running
anyway but the choice will be for people
to select one of the many tools are
already in there and as we've talked
about today to actually evolve a way
where they can make their own tours and
this will be interesting exercise
because it has to be done at that touch
simple gesture level so we got to
explore that and we've already come a
long way today looking at how we can
possibly do that and then after that
we're looking at gestures so
we're looking forward to getting the new
connects where we can get the
information you want because I want to
explore not just one person standing
back but a bunch of people and have the
idea that if half a dozen or more people
start doing a particular gesture the
system is going to recognize that and
then say right you could you know you
can control it and so if you all sway
your arms at the right way you know the
crowd surfing type thing or the football
crowd wave then then it'll move you know
you can trying to make a bit of a game
out of it but it requires cooperation
and I think that'll work well with the
students I hope it will so that's where
we are at the moment with this with this
project but really what it's trying to
do is demonstrate the potential for this
facility to look at this question of
large-scale displays and also large
scale data so the research we're doing
so we've got this wonderful kit all
about 5 million dollars worth it's fair
to illustrate and to show off and to
inspire people with science we have some
other projects like groundwater display
project that is available there and so
on where and we've got the genome do you
know visualization projects so that and
we've got a chemistry project so there's
lots of interesting visualizations of
scientific knowledge and we also have a
lot of high-resolution images that
people take of going to microbes and so
on and the eyes of little beasties and
so on and put them up there so we have
all this sort of stuff but how do you
get people to engage with it and be
excited by it so with the reef we we
will evolve to a point where people can
do a little bit of experimentation
themselves you know play with a transect
line play with a microscope or a
magnifying glass try and do a little bit
of what a real scientists would do and
have the model where they can collect
and select information and put under
their own they open up their own bag and
they can put samples in and when they go
home like the website they can they get
it and they can play with it on their
computer or in their class so there's
some ideas there about how you actually
learn through discovery rather than
through a more didactic process which
we've got at the moment I have to say we
went for the more didactic process
because
interesting because that's where the
teachers wanted to go because they were
safer with it and I can't get that off
the screen sorry but I'm right are there
done I can't get a cursor that's the
trouble huh nobody sees a kiss sorry
first for 10 yep no I might have to
escape out of that and there we go there
we go so so yes so that so the other
question is is having done all these
things and got that impressive kitten
some impressive applications and the
world wide telescope is going to be a
great one as well what else do we do
with it so the question that we're
looking at is what visualization
processes are most useful for displaying
large amounts of data in a way that
allows meaningful discoveries so with
the genome project we've got a lot of
there's some tools out there such as
blast and trendy which allowed a visual
Oh visualized genomic data but the
people who use this sort of stuff are
used to looking at fairly bland ways of
looking at data and visualizing data is
the real core of the problem because
we've got so much of it we're drowning
in it we've got to be able to visualize
it in ways it makes sense to humans get
the computer to do with that that it
does well and to let us do what we can
do well which is to see patterns and
connections networks so this is what
we're trying to do with the project
these are the research questions that we
are considering we've got a number of
students PhD students mostly looking at
some of these questions and we hope to
develop these connections with with you
guys as as we can so that's really my
talk with any more questions
No
sorry for sure yeah that's right maybe
you or the cover today I have a couple
questions are using a commercial game
engine 43 and some of these things are
you rolling your own okay so for the
virtual reef we use talk 3d engine to
start with we are evolving it all those
assets over to unity is it because more
flexible for what we want to do it also
makes it more accessible for the
students because all of my students can
do stuff with unity but not with talk
the physics playroom is the other 3d
world and rewrote his own 3d
visualization well I imagine it's a bit
of code that's available that's pretty
simple these days so that one wasn't
commercial that's I mean extemporary
will be made available i think it is
through the australian national
university where he did his PhD but it's
probably not easily accessible cuz i'm
sure he hasn't documented it is there
some some of the visualizations are
inherently 3d in other words they have a
perspective so there's better price you
probably have a sweet spot Oh babies
your sweet spot and the people complain
about it okay so there's this particular
I guess I skipped over that one a little
bit you're absolutely right so further
for the reef you had this problem that
you can't just have one viewpoint
because it's not going to look right
when you move around and we did spend a
lot of time playing with exactly that
problem so the way the reef works is
that you've got one state of that 3d
world which is on the server and it
keeps track of where everything is and
what they're doing and it then sends and
the touch information goes through to it
and then it sends it all back to the
individual PC this running that either
the a pair of pad two screens or one of
the projectors and then it's locally
rendered the information is unlikely
rendered so as a fish swims from one
panel to the other it's literally going
from one computer to the other or into
the projection space and back out again
in order to do that so with that one of
the reasons we use talked in the
beginning was because we needed to be
able to manipulate the code is open
source in order so each one of those two
panels each one of the projectors is a
portal into that
particular part of that 3d world and
it's all blended and we've got very
subtle variations in the viewpoint of
each one of those portals so that that
when you're there you don't feel that
you're the perspective is wrong you
actually feel when you walk around that
space that it you're just looking into
this into this world this reef through a
big big glass panel but yes it was it
was an interesting question of how to do
that how does there well we send the
information to the projector from the
state machine which is keeping track of
the whole 3d world and we just we change
the viewport that goes to each of them
just subtly so that the net result to
you is you're standing there as it looks
okay if we'd had just one say vision
point from sent it out and then we send
then we jet and we generate a 3d world
from that and then gave each piece of
that to all the projectors you actually
get a sense sometimes that things are
not quite right so we actually adjust
their viewpoints spread them out a
little bit but there is there is
multiple viewports a camera positions if
you like the align with the projectors
or well we know though the the highest
projectors you points a little bit down
below it okay so that you know when
you're looking up if it looks right
particularly cuz you've got movement if
it was static it would be easier but
when the whales come in because they're
very big sunfish or the whale shark
comes in they're very large and so I
mean just just bit mad if you're gonna
have thing going from one screen to the
other stream and if they are lining if
they're alive right you're
you're assuming a certain perspective
these are prospective members that
presume you're rendering perspective
that enforces that you have one
viewpoint right so you have to paddle
you have to pick somewhere in a room in
your environment in the three minutes
you're going to have to pick a location
where the where this thing is ready from
I understand that the home is this
notion of it but like where do you mean
logically your kind of thinking in the
middle I guess which which would also
mean that anywhere other than that
location is going to be slightly off and
more slightly off the further you are
from that particular ok so the core
server that's holding the stator that
holdings so it does doesn't do any
rendering what it does know is where all
the fish are and it sends that
information to each PC which then does
its own rendering of that particular 3d
world with this particular window into
it so so we yeah so but it is slightly
different each time just slightly it's
not it's not all rendered so we don't
have because there's all different
machines we don't actually have to
render it from one key point each time
each machine is doing a tone so there
are 14 different versions we are coming
from one here needs to be exactly
connected it we are running the other
one then they need to they need to have
got a shared view point we need to work
very close but I had I have a shared
state but as I moved between the
viewpoint is only subtly different and
you and it looks perfectly natural
all these they're really really close by
yeah they are no no nothing like that
was no no no nothing nothing that major
it is very small in real in you know a
span of about a meter in real terms if
you were standing back where is that one
where's that it's it's a it's a bad
midway back here but we basically spread
things out a little bit so that when
you're standing to the questions right
yeah what are you talking about the
actual panels at this point or actually
the large displays so the projected ones
all this they're all okay they're all
that they all have a they all each PC
gives sends off its view of the world
the image is blended yeah but it's view
of the world is not taken from exactly
the same camera point for each please
see it's it's spread out a little bit
about a meter in real terms look at the
the well there will be a Swiss spot
somewhere where it looks great but when
you get close to the screen and you
physically have to move back to have a
retrospective because I know if you go
back to the image lady 31 yeah trust me
it's magic so there's a side view
there's looking there that's looking
down I've never noticed any odd sense
that is out of perspective oh that one's
the other one says so we did experiment
with it a lot and the one of the
programmers who spend an awful lot of
time and awful lot of argument with me
about this just sort of that basically
you might actually see a phenomenon here
which is really interesting that the
the theme that you have here has a mess
amount of blur from anywhere that's not
really in the screen space so as soon as
you are depicting something that's more
than a meter or a couple meters in
virtual space behind the screen is
romantically so blurred because its
water your yes that's right therefore
your approach that you're applying here
to the reef is not going to work for the
stars for example not and there you will
see this problem much much more than you
have here in the reef which is basically
blurring everything that's not really
right in ok so with the world wide
telescope will go experimented with this
we put it up in that space and as far as
we can tell without any tricks other
than the projector blending it looks
fine what we're really doing there is
putting the normal one window across the
four projectors above and in the testing
we've done it seems to look fine maybe
it's just the scale even when we've done
zoomed into planets and we've done that
you know got earth in the middle there
and we sort of looked at that we've
zoomed in it seems to be fine that was
the 2d 2d spoons it's the three
different planet we're building yeah
well be interesting to see be noticing
it is that when you're not standing in
the sweet spot and you have a big planet
it should look circular it will not be
certain it will basically be an
egg-shaped being ellipsoidal something
if you're it has to be prospective wise
if you render something from a
particular perspective yes but winter ok
so in the case of the world wide
telescope we're not rendering it you are
it's coming directly from the experience
is it well that that's that is an
interesting problem we at this stage of
tested it across in the in that space
and put it up and and had their planet
in the middle you know where the wedges
because it concerned about that look and
so far it seems ok we still got to do a
bit more maybe it's a scale but it looks
ok I think the important thing is nobody
seems to mind the particular when the
stars obviously it doesn't matter but
the planets we're going to play with a
bit more see how it looks
what's really interesting was a reap one
is it's an inner Hanley multiscale data
set like it flavor really well is how
you get big space on top yeah and the
small space at the bottom and you can
get all the details in a small space and
all the interactions of small ways
actually because how you can attract as
well to get information with another
question I think it's a big place well
as your and I wonder if they watch L
scope or two examples of me actually
play that well with being able to have
it information spaces has a lot of
density you love detail the bottom and
you can play on the idea of scale on top
like that that's something interesting
West to explore I mean we've got this is
said the near and far experience so with
the world wide telescope we want to keep
it as reasonably far as possible because
that's what you want to look at but when
you come near we haven't yet decided
with the solar sky we're going to give
people local information and they'll do
stuff there and that'll just be like a
really big screen in front of you and up
there will just be at or running or
something so like you know having having
the outline of land that's even earth
looking out that people can crack with
earth in perspective to the rest of the
world feels like he can play on that on
that idea of you know Europe you're
looking at something that's really close
we have a vision to substantially far
hmm which was just some what you're
doing here yeah well I'm you know I
think so what we've done the testing
we've done and we've also done that NASA
will we ran up a NASA protein to the
moon landing you know they got all that
video and we we had that running one
afternoon just and that also looked fine
it's great at that scale I mean
essentially you got a cinema problem
accepting they've got this blended thing
in the middle I mean we we were
concerned even with the reef that when
the you know the whale swims across that
blend so what we've done is made the
behavior so that it doesn't but the
whale shark despite things does
sometimes go across the middle but it
nobody seems that you know because it's
not actually a night
greece i should say it's 110 slightly
open down yeah it seems to be right we
did experiment without what's called
anamorphic projection where you can
flatten a so if you project into that
corner and we did develop this one minor
students project into that three plane
there and it reads as if it's a flat
plane we we did do that but we didn't
then we found we didn't really need to
in fact it had an odd effect on the roof
because it made made it just look wrong
oddly enough when you flattened it
because as you say it's all water and
you're fading off into the distance
anyway with water and then if you
flatten the the it just looked odd model
endure we get more critical about those
issues and sometimes the general public
does write it I find that sometimes even
when we do some of the WT stuff in the
projection work I'm gate when we notice
all the little cracks and everything
yeah yes I asked that question is
because I found for a lot of these
experiences in the sweet spot if there's
always a sweet spot but the sweet spot
is fairly large and public is very nice
forgive you yeah I think if we benefit
from years of being trained the points
of the cinemas ain't seen movies or
faxes which which we're perfectly
argument is perfectly fine to it than
nothing and you don't really notice it
after a while so I think the same
phenomena probably goes in these
experiences they're fundamentally wrong
but they are believable enough yeah I
think you're actually right so even
despite all the fiddling we did and all
the subtle variations to that it
probably made no difference you know we
weren't we didn't actually do any real
experimentation where we tested it other
than we did it by eye in our development
lab which wasn't that scale when we did
it we had four panels and then we had
eight and we played with it and we made
some decisions but you're probably right
it probably makes no difference at all
it's just very forgiving in that
environment as you say people just and
also the nature of this the reef is is
not you know you don't have strong
perspective lines of like a building or
a city street scape or something so it's
it's probably much less forgiving so
much more forgiving and also you're
right people even if it looked odd
people would still forgive you it's like
when you take a photograph and buildings
lean in when you look you know that
that effect of perspective you know we
suspend disbelief we accept that the
buildings aren't really leaning in we
just take it for granted because we
spent so much of a life looking at those
sort of images these things might have
an impact in some of the state of goals
that you have said if you're looking
looking at the data set where Lions
matter connections mmm when when looking
at patterns think that all this
perspective stuff starts coming back in
because then you're basically fooling
people and they have to be standing in
the sweet spot yes listen we mean it a
bunch of these are things like the
telescope in the dome and and once you
start showing you know link graphs to
start doing information visualization
and where the nodes and straight lines
are there and connections between stuff
that's here and there I think people in
your setup well unless you keep it all
planar I think it's going to be very
difficult to know you not only is
something I'm sure you're right yes I
mean the model we've just dealt with
this big open space yeah well that's
right and I think the telescope will be
fine too and we're doing stuff which is
coming turning around telescope coming
back to earth and then blending when we
get close with with this laser distance
and that laid our data that we've got
from the military for for looking at
remote areas and so on and so so but
again it's the scale of that perspective
doesn't seem to matter too much I think
once you've got straight lines yes you
do get a problem you see the CFE let's
say you try to get that a you're the
connect or any kind of sensor tuned to
try to see where the groups or they'd
like one major group and you just
slightly change to the pond view that
main camera thrice and protector of the
adults do you adjust where people are we
this is something I could explore I mean
we have got we've had put the laser
detectors sitting in the middle of the
wedge and the two edges and then back
under the stair we don't particularly
use it but we can detect whip that there
are some one there and how many we
haven't done anything with that yet but
it was it's there and I haven't come up
with a reason to use it but maybe with
the Kinect movement things
then knowing that there's five or six or
you know 10 people then we can pep start
to do things I'm keen to make that space
in there sort of in front of it active
space but I don't know how to do it
strongly like one of you were so sweet
spot right people tend to sleep go there
you could like there's a virtual even if
solution ship like we could afford any
action as well by having the one of you
slightly dead yeah or they'll touch a
good word eglee well see if we get the
laser strong enough we can have it so
they move out they get you know shut
down it's a gamer in me you know you
might change somebody saw something how
many people work this is hard to this
whole thing cost ok so the physical kit
costs about five million dollars all up
there with people that come came closer
to seven there was a lot of discussion
and 22 years out we open at the
beginning of this year it was extent in
October last year than we did all this
testing and about and further
development and my team worked in the
new building before it was sort of
officially open they made a room for us
getting all the networking going and all
the rest of it there's a network room
above just got which it's got all the
machines in it you know the double cool
thing lots of cables running everywhere
you can go in behind this there's a walk
space about shoulder width itching going
behind because you have to get to all
sorts of things so for the reef I had
six people so there's two coders see
coders there was two animators modelers
and there was a couple of people who are
on the specialists on on reef and fish
ecology and and so on and there was
someone whose job was to make sure we
coordinated with the research people and
the museum people got them there
occasionally and they vetted what we did
know those fish don't bend in the middle
they'd bend at the tail all this sort of
stuff so we could all the behaviors
correct so we had external collaborators
and we had those team about a dozen of
the species were outsourced initially to
China came back and then we spend some
time fixing them up and adding more
stuffing and so on we were hoping to get
a lot of us either by them in or have
them pretty maybe they didn't work out
so well because some of the stuff we got
back was not well good enough for what
we needed and and so on plus we had to
put all the AI all the behaviors of
everything in so doing the model was
only half of the job with the physics
playroom there was essentially two
people on that there was Andrew who
spends his entire life standing up his
computer type home coding and he has one
of his doctoral students from a strong
national university helping in there was
an energy project Corey cost which I
didn't show which looks at the energy of
the building and there's live feeds and
whatever there was about four people on
that the history wall project had
initially myself and two interns from
Singapore and then we had two other
coders on it and eventually just 10 and
a video specialist guy he's a six people
today did you start from having a kind
of a distribution distributed display
figured out or did all the
infrastructure of the
when we started it was literally you
know just the screen let's make this 3d
world of virtual reef and then as we got
the kit as we got the early versions of
the panels we had them set up in the our
development space and we sort of put it
across a space like that and that high
and just see what it looked like but we
we didn't have the projectors and then
we got some projectors and there's a
whole lot of that and there was
certainly was a point where we were
waiting for the whole thing to be built
and there was this moment of oh is it
going to look alright because we didn't
know what it would look like at that
scale and whether that corner would be a
problem whether this resolutions will be
a problem and so on so yeah it was a bit
of you know bit of hit miss their long
way it was fairly iterative there was a
lot of the work was just getting putting
more species into the environment
getting the behaviors working you
wouldn't have noticed it but oddly it by
the end of the day most of the fish have
distributed everywhere because
everybody's touching the things and
doing things and that causes them to
flee or to do something else and by the
end of the day they're just out of their
zones you know that the little clown
fish are suppose to be any of the
anemone that they that's where they
start but so it's an interesting effect
of people if you like interacting with
this huge aquarium that the fish just
almost evenly distribute which causes a
problem causes the Sharks come through
then they will run away again so it's
it's odd and we have zones where fish
would normally live and stay but then
they end up being pushed out of that so
there's some odd things we could tweak
in terms of what really happens but yeah
it's it's it was a fairly iterative
process but a lot of it was just about
getting the content up getting the the
coral in and and and and rendered was a
big issue because it just takes so much
grunt to get all those tiny little and
we had to experiment with how much
detail we needed and all of that usual
thing for a graphic display
18 months for the reef some of the other
projects took less time the data will
took maybe six months a lot of that was
the interaction issues and then until we
had the kit configured we didn't know
how much we could do so there was still
some evolution at even as we opened and
so on but the reef was the main opening
event room so there was a lot of effort
to make sure that worked and so a lot of
tension and concern also there's
projections on the back side so they
also have space above that and just see
if you've got it so well so they're the
big one the wedge and then just the
wedge but there's the other side walls
that's on one of the walls the physics
place posted will you here for that one
yeah yeah you do actually computer image
computer and yeah so that's you walk in
the door that's what you see the
beginning of it around the other around
their side of that is that is the roof
so it's a very public space and it runs
it's been pretty seamless it's been
running all this time without any fault
asian alia panel we've had to
re-calibrate the panels a couple of
times and so being some firmware updates
to the panels and somebody they do that
out of our so it's running from 9am till
6pm usually and we have to keep it
running from kendall for because that's
when the school groups come in or
visitors or whatever the vice-chancellor
loves taking international people
through here one where you go the
multiple displays and for anyone to
connect me to move that one or that one
there's projectors there that you can
connect to and this one as well but you
bit with a bit of setup through the cute
team okay so you need to get it through
to the server to come back onto these
screens so this is where so my students
try out some of their games if they if
they have a game that makes sense on
this environment this one
doesn't require permission although we
try to vet it as much as possible so
that's on the upper level so there's the
the wedge to the story and then both
sides and then both sides and so on the
bottom its its standard and above we've
got and that and then on the other wall
we've just got projectors blended and
sit just to the left of that image are
these bench seats at cube seats and
students sit there all day this whole
space i should say is really inhabited
by students is just full if you don't my
son who goes to the University complains
if he doesn't get there by nine o'clock
money can't find anywhere to sit and
work I mean it's a really good public
space and students love it and and you
can see them sitting there that in the
spaces they just this was a recently was
not too many but there's always students
around I don't think we'll ever run out
of funding for for just keeping it
ticking over because it's a vice
chancellors project and so and it's and
it's got so much interest so it'll
always be in a bit of an icon there the
issue is the resources to put new
content on which is always under
undervalued and under-resourced and
everyone complains that the kit costs
five million dollars in so well yeah but
for all the content you got for one and
a half million dollars and I was just
seconded from my faculty you know so
there was a lot of embedded cost said
that no one added up we had in my 16
we're all separately contracted for that
period and paid so i think that was
awesome two years ago just thought you
know like the information environments
program yeah especially interactive you
know things that you go to miss him and
you know you can tell it used to be
awesome but it's been sort of like well
okay well see see ya interestingly the
queensland museum has this reef project
running just as a projection which has
one fifth of that area on a wall and an
ipad as a bit of a control so so it you
know
it could be in other places if you had
some interaction it just and it's just
got one server running it just one image
on the wall one projection but I doubt
that it'll ever be I mean who knows ten
years away but right now it will
continue to be maintained at the very
least just replacing the projector
clothes you know that's so there'll be
an evolution into the full LED
projectors and things like that when
they can get them bright enough and so
on but for the moment yeah there's a
team of three I should say whose job is
technically just to keep it running an
air contracted and then the other one
was the your interaction where you can
log in to your swipes yep you didn't
show actually kind of what what it what
you would see but is it it's just
limited to those types of documents or
at the moment it's oh so there is cool
you know it's cubit and you can look it
up and you can I think you may not get
access if you're not a cutie staff
member but because of the thing about
data and stuff but if you are a student
then you have your own space you can
upload it's like Dropbox essentially and
then in fact there is a connection to
dropbox and also the university shared
data area if the software only will run
a text file PDF ppt and dot mov or mp3
so yeah but you know there was an
intention to do other things there's
also the ongoing project which is to get
that same software into all our lecture
theatres so I could come up here with
this touch panel swipe and then which I
think it is why not you know like in
fact that was why I got involved with
the project because I was pushing that
for some time because I this exercise
seems a bit oddly primitive I mean if
you live here you should be able to
bring it up so I'd like that because
these are all touch panels we have the
same and out all our lecture theatres
you touch them to control the thing but
that seems a bit primitive and why not
actually have that that cubed exercise
and I just pull up the ppt and I can
swipe this and I don't have to carry
this between lectures you
the fuses all of the how many people
make hypotheses no sure you go back to
the reef experiment making a processes
like engaging students or connected
problem solving yeah inference
maintained well like I said I'm involved
another project called the chemistry
wall and that is you know again
University chemex first-year chemistry
but there is a design where at each of
the individual panels I can be doing
some chemistry and it's one stage an
industrial process and then I can bring
it over into the next person who's going
to do their bits of it and so on so
we've got some ideas about how you can
actually engender more understanding and
basically chemistry tutorials in that
sort of realistic as if you've got a
chemistry bench sort of thing you know
you pull things over and you touch
things and you mix things and whatever
you see them a molecule above and so on
so that that is ongoing that's almost
it's been prototyped and beaded and
we're just waiting to develop that one
so that'll be there soon as well the
interesting thing about all of that is
that the three technicians who run it
and make sure everything's working in
other panel switches off they switch it
on again something and if there's
calibrations on but that all of those
apps we've got on a pad and they come
sometimes sitting there and they just
touch things at the Vice chances and
they can just with you know just shuts
down everything brings up the next thing
so the reef takes about two minutes to
load up and all the things that happen
and so we had to write her and that that
brings these curtains across he pulls
him back again so in the vice-chancellor
doesn't have all that with the computer
speaker zipping up on the screen but
literally we can switch any app to any
sign off this iPad app and we just and
the technicians that they're doing it
and testing it so they go downstairs and
they they do it so that that was one of
the things we had to do the whole
commander control and we got one server
whose job is just doing that
to be on the telescope is there any
Microsoft dialogue just radio
large-screen equal a little bit but
mostly we've gone directly to you guys
here but there's been a little bit
through John Warren he affected the
initial introductions and he works he's
yes yes and he works with one of my
colleagues Paul row who's doing he does
the Microsoft enter for us so so yeah
basically this I don't know where this
came from but when one day oh my my Dean
says Michael I need you to do this and
and then Paul said and I'll introduce
you to John who's going to get you
connected to these people and then you
got to go and see them and so that's
what I'm doing but it's an exciting
project because I really interested in
exploring these interaction ideas and
this content is going to let me do some
of that some I'm and there is we've got
we've got the team so we got there II
research could a EV visualization team
and there's four people in there two
three of whom are top code people so
we've got a team of people and we've got
some more money if I need to bring in a
sea person or something like that I i we
related things if you can't review that
reserves
far away yeah yep well I'm interested in
exploring all the levels of interaction
said all this space down here be great
if I could use that in some way and we
did do some there is a there is an app I
got one of my students to do which
allows you to touch your phone and and
it and it interacts there we've just
never released it yeah it'd be great to
explore some of these these ideas for
interaction things well I'm chance I
don't know if you're familiar with a
hollow sphere project done University
fornia Santa Barbara it's a four-story
humongous it looks like the thing from
the x-men and the four-story mungus
sphere spherical display with thing 18
4k projectors Oh including all sorts of
feared by weird I mean awesome spatial
acoustic audio in with the spirits of
this kind of translucent material with
low holset audio carries where they have
a lots of spacious like that when I'm
going all not also large scale large
immersive experience visualisations let
that is interesting me what do we do
with these spices you know it yes and
and our legitimate is I mean like you
can do all these things but then you
don't really test whether that's a good
or bad thing just just how it is you
know and so there's a push between those
sort of the PR I mean I the interaction
and the designer this is about a third
of what I had on the table to start with
we didn't go a lot of the ways I wanted
to go with this just for whole lots of
reasons so there's lots more we could do
with this even as it is and I don't
think we really understand large-scale
touch interaction even even with the
tables I mean at the moment you can get
a cup of people but it's just it's got
to evolve you know we now we don't think
twice about using a pad or a surface you
know we just but three years ago just
wasn't there so I think we just you know
we use new technology and old ways until
we get used to it so you know waiting to
see to some extent what we're doing with
this technology is almost trivial but it
wasn't set up to be a research thing we
do have a research center a couple
floors above this where we've got you
know four of those like that and then
another for the other way we've got the
3d plane our system we've got the
gesture G speak system we've got a bunch
of things in there where we do our
research and we got masters and PhD
students doing projects that's where
they do it and if it gets to a point
where it needs this scale then we can
put it up here but so we are trying to
get
I mean I did for a while have one of
those screens in front of me and here's
my keyboard and that was my monitor just
to see what that meant for you the way
you behaved I mean I didn't have any
other for a few months but it just
changes how you think about the data
that using because it's like this
digital desktop I mean you just stop
using the keyboard and you it is a bit
overwhelming but no no really I see
cheers so we've probably done are we
good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
