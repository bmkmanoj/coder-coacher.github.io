you
so our question is how to write a good
paper which and this is I guess a good
chunk of what many of you if you
continue with research careers will do a
neat and even I hope during your PhDs
but it's not a subject on which anybody
has a monopoly on truth right there's no
one right way to do this
so when rather than me just rant for an
hour and you sit there like stuffed
cabbages it would be more fun if you
would make comments or ask questions as
we go along
so kind of make me feel that you're
alive and here after all you know you
are the you know the cream of the the
world is sitting in this room the yeah
so don't don't disappoint me so seven
suggestions about writing papers I'd
like to just offer you kind of seven
clues for how to go about it that'll
work for me so the first thing is don't
wait right that's always the feeling you
should do research like this you first
of all you have a great idea and then
you work on it for ages like when you're
working on your PhD and then you write
the paper and declare victory right that
seems logical doesn't it very bad plan
right he was a much better plan right so
you have a kind of a idea perhaps not a
very significant or interesting one and
then you start writing the paper and as
you start writing the paper it forces
you to kind of crystallize the idea and
then you realize which bits you don't
understand so you know what work to do
you like it to kind of like I'm a
functional programmer I like lazy
evaluation it's like a forcing function
that forces you to evaluate the
necessary bits of your work right
it's not uncommon to even when you've
done quite a lot of work to start to
write the paper and realize there's a
whole section that you haven't even
started that's essential to the paper
right so writing early is really
important another reason why it's
important is it lets you talk about it
with other people right busy if you want
to have a dialogue with somebody else if
it's a sort of vague mishmash of stuff
in your head it's hard to have that
conversation as soon as you crystallize
it on paper you give them something
concrete to anchor anchor themselves on
I won't tell you how how many
since I've had with people after they
first produced the draft that gives me
so much more to substance just to say oh
but what about this and this we have a
completely different kind of
conversation than we had when they were
just generally telling me about what
they were doing okay so when the kind of
idea I want to get across to you is that
writing papers is not just a way of
reporting the research you have already
done it's the way you do research does
that make sense
I think this is a big shift of
perspective for me I it took me a while
to absorb this so I'm giving you this
for free right now this is the way you
do research it's by starting to write a
paper and then it forces you to figure
out what's going on okay that's number
one
so far so good number two don't try to
identify what your idea is so I started
here by saying look you know idea do
some research but you must know in the
end what it is because what's the
purpose if your paper you might think
it's the sort of you know get brownie
points or something on your publication
they're called but the real real reason
of your paper is to act like a virus
what what's your name Alexander like so
if I write a paper part of my goal is to
get an idea out of my head and make it
infect Alexander's brain so that he is
unable to think about anything else it
monopolizes all his thoughts and then he
tells other people and soon I've
dominated the world so it's like a kind
of infection that's a bit past a bit of
a cellphone self-indulgent way of
thinking of writing a paper but it's a
good a good metaphor for the thing you
wanted to give a is not a system or an
artifact it's an idea and it's an idea
that's not just interesting to me the
way that it'll you communicate it to
other people it's because it's
interesting to them that it's a reusable
idea it's an idea that they might use in
their setting you know so how do i solve
simultaneous linear equations
once you've conveyed that idea somebody
else might see that they could use it in
their context does that make sense
and I just wanted to comment as well
they're just Jack Lang also made that
point how important is when you want it
when you want to start your own business
so I can't really think of where you're
going what do you want to achieve do you
want
do you want to heal the world are you so
same here really right yeah but you have
to be a little danger here once we get
into healing the world right you don't
want to be too ambitious about your idea
because otherwise you never start
writing you think you know oh I'm kind
of stuck at phase one here right I
haven't even got idea so I want to come
back to that in a second but just think
about Mozart for a second right he is a
guy who did this amazingly right
hundreds of years after he died we still
go and to concert halls to listen to
people read his papers isn't that
amazing his ideas were so persuasive and
it's just it's pure thought stuff really
that needs conveying just of course the
musicians are doing wonderful things as
well but um but this it this idea
conveying is the is the important bit
about what a paper is and when you read
a paper I think you always read it
thinking how could this be useful to me
what's the clever insight that I could
apply in my work does that make sense
you know you're not really reading it to
think how wonderfully clever the author
is are I worship at his feet no you're
thinking can I learn from this and of
course the bit at the bottom is
important to write even if you're
Einstein if you sit in a small dark room
and think and think but never
communicate what use are you to the
world you might as well never been born
from a research point of view right all
right so you've got to communicate
otherwise your ideas they matter how
fantastic I just sort of kept yourself
now okay so that's why conveying ideas
important a bit so when you write a
paper you need to know in the end what
the idea is when you read a paper you
will be thinking implicitly or
explicitly what is the idea that I'm
learning here when you're writing a
paper it's important to have that same
question in your mind it may be hard to
know to begin with but you really do
need to know by the time you've finished
right and so you need you need to be
able to say what is the idea of the
paper and if you have lots of ideas so
sometimes you read a paper and it goes
you know
Thing Thing Thing there's a sort of as a
kind of journey that you go on which
goes through a number of ideas none of
which are discussed in very much detail
and it's but you've get the feeling
author hat was packing so much in that
he sort of took you know something this
long and compressed it to this long so
now it's like kind of you know highly
concentrated fudge very difficult to
digest and and perhaps hard to
understand because it's not explained in
enough detail so you've had lots of
ideas just write lots of papers right
what's bad about that more publications
that's good to just don't I mean for me
so by the time when I dipped my PhD
which is why they go any worse back then
then you couldn't Donald papers from the
internet you would go to the library so
I mean perhaps yeah that's four or five
papers a week to go through I mean
nowadays with all that information that
is at your hand so easily you may have
50 papers in a week so is there kind of
as paper writing changed in the way how
you pick up that idea so quickly if you
only have a few minutes or so to I'm
thinking here about pointedly about
authorship right so and I don't haven't
have ideas any faster because of the
internet sadly so the rate limiting step
is how many good ideas you have and how
hardly know how long it takes you to
express them in a clear and articulate
thinking of the consumer to kind of
grasp the main idea of the paper if you
have 50 or so off of those to go through
in a week how you can see I'm thinking
about writing papers here not reading
them so I'm not offering any advice
about how to read 50 papers quickly but
I'd like you to write your one paper so
well that a reader has a very clear idea
of what your I well you know very clear
understanding of what your idea is right
that will mean that they can read your
paper more quickly and they'll enjoy it
more - okay now nobody here apart from
Scarlett has said may ask questions or
made a comment of any kind so I'm gonna
have a little let's see just there's
just a me before we give that
opportunity just remark that if you're
going to have an idea in the paper at
the end you must know what it is and
once you know what it is you must tell
your reader I've written many reviews in
which early in the review I say I
believe that the main idea of the paper
is blah blah blah
I'm not quite sure and I wish the author
had said so
so try writing early in your paper a
sentence like the main idea of this
paper is and then complete that sentence
and if you can't start to worry a little
bit about your paper all right or
sometimes there's a section in which you
after an introduction and a little bit
of background you you you say all right
payload is coming papers often don't
distinguish between when they move off
background and start to move on to a new
material so you want a very clearly
signpost this is the payload the idea is
coming wake up here soon and don't leave
the reader to guess this it's not the
Murphy's business to guess where the
payload is you've got to put big
signpost to it okay all right questions
comments well I'll give you one more
chance I'll go on a little bit but
you've got you've got we've got a van
you've got to think think about your own
writing and experiences and I'm sure
you're happy you have some thoughts you
might want to reflect about that to
everybody else in the book what I
learned that this is perhaps of elements
elements like that because one like this
is perhaps slightly intimidating and
certainly it's often intimidating when
you're thinking about writing papers you
think oh that's the big wide world out
there and my idea is so you know
humiliatingly trivial but nobody will be
interested in it right so you think you
read everybody else's papers and they
have amazing ideas right and I'm a mere
worm and nobody will be interested to
read my little trivial idea but the
truth is that is is really quite
different that as once you start writing
about an idea even one that seems quite
trivial computer science is the kind of
subject that kind of ramifies like you
start with a simple trivial idea and it
turns out to be much more interesting
than you had at first supposed
just occasionally you start writing
about a trivial idea and it turns out to
be trivial right but that's a very quick
paper to write so it's not much lost but
much more common is you start writing
about a simple humble thing and it turns
out to be interesting ok that's a that's
my experience at anyway so do not be
intimidated just start to write and
indeed you know starting to write is you
kind of until you start to write you
don't really know in any with any
clarity what your idea is
unless you're personally works
completely differently to me okay all
right next thing so now you have at
least a proto idea some idea about how
you want to start writing your paper now
what are you going to put in the paper
so there's a lot of things things that
people put in the papers that don't
belong though and some stuff they miss
out which should be there so here's
here's one way of thinking about it try
to think of writing up papers just
telling a story imagine that you were
speaking to somebody with the whiteboard
what would you do right how would you
explain the story you somehow want to
you tell a story something like this you
try to explain what the problem is
you're trying to solve and you try to
give briefly some motivation for why
it's an interesting problem to want to
solve right but you're trying to
motivate them to stay with you to hear
the rest of what you have to say then
you're going to kind of present what the
idea is and they're going to put maybe
in a sort of sketchy kind of way and
then perhaps fill in some more details
about how it works
okay so your goal list is try to get
your reader hooked at the the early part
by thinking actually if this paper could
solve that problem that would be pretty
cool I'd like to know how to solve that
problem and then after a little bit you
want them to think that's quite a clever
solution I wish I'd thought of that
alright oh I'm following that I wonder
how the details work out so here's a
picture of what and papers my sort of
suck my eye as it were default outline
for a paper and I've added here the the
kind of number of readers that you might
expect to get for each bit of this
outline so a lot of people will read the
title a few people will read the
abstract and the first page and after
that things fall off very fast
right what does that tell you about the
amount of effort you should invest in
page one right page one is like your
kind of you know the sugar fix you want
to get them hooked on page one so do not
waste page one with lots of background
stuff that's very boring about relating
what you want to get them hooked very
quickly so um so this is this is my I
want to say a little bit more about each
of these chunks now so in particular
firstly I want to say a little bit about
the abstract and introduction so I'm
just going to deal with abstract quickly
for now I'm gonna talk about a direction
then abstract introduction very
important page one and try to fit it on
one page so in the kind of a CM style
conference formats you know that dense
two column format one page ought to be
enough for this sort of journal smaller
you know folio size size pages one page
is never enough because half of it is
the title and then you only get ten
lines so you can't fit the introduction
on page one but but logically think and
think about an introduction that will be
short enough to fit on the page 1 of an
a4 conference style format that's a good
length for an abstract and what you want
to do in your interaction firstly say
what the problem you're trying to solve
is certainly say what your contributions
are okay so to those two things what is
the problem so here's an example from a
paper I wrote a while ago and so I'm
trying to state pretty briefly it takes
me three paragraphs here what the
problem is I notice that I've done so
here by using a concrete example so
don't try to state the problem in its
full generality give an example that
illustrates the problem that a reader
can grab a hold of and think I can see
the kind of problem you're thinking
about then you may generalize a little
bit so did I generalize a little bit
this here no at this point I haven't
generalized at all at that but so give
an example early on and then generalize
a bit to state this sort of scope of the
problem that you're trying to solve and
do it as concretely as you can but and
try not to over claimed try not to over
state so I call this mole hills not
mountains because people sometimes say
in this paper we address the challenge
of writing correct programs does this
make your blood pump found your body
your heart beat faster and it doesn't
make you think yes this is the paper I
want to read no it doesn't because
writing correct programs is something
that thousands of computer scientists
have been addressing for tens of years
right so it's not a paper problem it's
going to be solved by this paper so if
you describe too ambitious a goal you
make it clear that you're not going to
solve that goal in this paper so you'll
give them the reason no motivation for
reading and make sense so you want to
define this time a soluble go so here's
an example you know an interesting bug
and they're you know you've an example
of this kind of bug it is yeah well so
that's one of the best thing you think
would you remember this page one right
is the one where you have all your
readers still with you is it worth
spending a paragraph saying verification
is good yeah how important is they know
the problem and they know somewhat but
not exactly
so it's a judgment call it's a judgment
call but if you're so if I'm writing for
programming languages conference say I
wouldn't waste the sentence like saying
verification is important if I was
writing for a conference that covered
the whole of computer science I might
but I never do right because that paper
they spoke be too specialized that I
don't know I I would err on the side of
being more specific domain specific
audiences are the only ones benefiting
from it and sometimes like I read some
biology papers because it's not exactly
but if they don't respect what so there
is a judgment call here about I think my
my sense is that most papers are on the
side of too much generality and and and
and then lose their readers too early
rather than earning on the side of too
much detail
and when I say generality I do also mean
things like suppo let D be an epi
morphic by functor over a codomain of
that kind of generality where you state
a very general problem in very technical
language right that's a different kind
of being specialized but it's not good
either so examples are good yeah
something like no no including the
author or the authors in addition to the
others and with the humanities is
something like 0.5 so I think like if
people consider that I think it could I
mean you know you're not often even
gonna get this thousand people reading
the abstract see if you consider that I
think it can help focus your mind a bit
I know it's also a bit cynical you might
just quit but you might think well like
I need to try and get that number up a
little bit you can be the author but you
know this this point throughout that
point we does sound very low absolute as
an average number
readers across all of science but
nevertheless as an author you can get
your average a lot higher by and this
might be part of how yeah so just think
about that page why never mind that the
sort of details I'm making some
suggestions here but in particular if
you think about the page one this is
where I want to get my readers hooked
that's very important rather than saying
I've got a hooked reader who's committed
to read the whole paper what should I
tell them first you see what you see the
difference about between those two
attitudes think about the format okay
good
your weight excellent let's see what I'm
now happy yes now we talked about
describing the problem the next thing
that I think you wants doing the
introductions is say what your
contributions are it's extraordinary how
many papers do not say this quite a lot
of papers in their introductions say the
contributions of this paper this this
and this but a surprisingly large
proportion do not instead they rely on
them offer the reader or the referee to
figure it out oh what a stupid thing to
do
you know what your contributions are
articulate them here's an example I
almost always do this by using bullets
so I have a have a kind of introductory
section introduces the problem and I go
on a bit blah blah blah I think this was
the same paper actually and then in this
paper I usually say you know make the
following contributions here I just sort
of sent more general sentence we put the
choice than a firmer basis and then
bullet bullet bullet so a bullet for
each contribution right so you leave the
reader in no doubt about what you
believe the contributions of this paper
are that is the new bit the payload of
the paper right if you leave your reader
in doubt you you have a problem you
certainly have a problem with referees
and you probably have a problem with
readers because what you want them to do
this is like the specification of the
problem right so we got and and did I
say something about evidence yes so you
see the introduction these bullets make
claims right so what's the claim here
the choice of evaluation effective
interceptor but four basic ways to
identify and discuss these effective
five and six controls so I'm making some
claims and then I'm doing our chat I'm
using forward references to fork to
point to evidence that supports the
claim
so as you go through your claims in the
contribution they should be refutable
claims points to the evidence that
supports it that that makes sense
so think of it as a specification and
the rest of the paper is the
implementation to put it in programming
languages terms and try to make the
specification refutable right if you say
contribution we will study the
properties of system X well that's not
refutable of course you'll study it in
some level like nobody could read the
paper and say actually
they said they'd study it and they
didn't study it like they talked about
their holidays right you probably will
say something about the system it could
be could counter studying so you want to
make sure that the contributions bit if
you can
contains refutable claims that is things
that could possibly be false right think
of it like celery that is something with
some crunch
rather than overcooked spaghetti and
then read other papers with that in mind
as you read a paper think does this
author make refutable claims and if not
there were that well you could look for
the refutable claims that they make
because if yo you're related what you're
doing is not relevant to what I'm
looking for maybe in the related work I
could find something something like that
yes yes and it's easier to find if it's
laid out in a very clear way of all just
dense text I think you would have laid
out one at a time oh please come
i styled of contributions and i kind of
got lost in them so so how much would
you say well so this is another judgment
call right I think you and what you so
maybe you're describing something in
which the the the author went on to say
here what did I said I put a sort of
little paragraph about each of these if
you go on to write a lot about each of
them you find that you don't have the
the notational scaffolding the mental
terminology for the reader to be
understand much detail at this point so
you have to find a way to state your
contributions that's quite compact right
but in a way that but each with a
forward reference so if you say you know
what this doesn't have if you have
technical terms like the eval apply
model seems decisively superior you'd
like to say oh I wonder what that means
Oh section five so it means so-so
anything so you compress but you make it
clear that you're not really expected to
understand everything here unless you're
an expert already maybe right if you're
just interested as a reader you'll find
more later it's a it's not easy to write
the list of contributions another thing
you could find formulas the
contributions is your forward
referencing to section five six or five
seven and eight but there's no forward
reference to section 6 that's weird this
section six not contributing anything to
your paper then so it's a kind of dead
code elimination algorithm right that if
any section is unreferenced here you
might think could I leave it out or
alternatively maybe there's a
contribution this paper makes that I
want to put in the introduction this
isn't a hard and fast rule it's just a
little clue to look I often have
sections that in my paper that are not
referenced here but I always know why
they're there still okay yeah
can you say what Oh nitty-gritty oh yes
yes yes so this is I'm using informal
language Xuan Taiwan nitty-gritty detail
absolutely this is a published paper yes
so so RI I urge you to use vivid
language sometimes if you're too vivid
and - no - too informal you you may
grate a little on your referees and they
met they may complain they'll seldom
reject it for that sole reason but it's
way more fun to read you know and use
the active voice don't say you know it
has been thought that bla bla bla you
say we think that no and so using active
I think that doesn't happen very often
in my experience at least in in commute
obviously did happen to you but I think
the referees who simply believe that
every academic paper should be written
in the passive voice are very few and
far between you must have just hit one
of them and if you have to get past them
maybe you have to switch the passive
voice for that paper but I would urge
you not to do that in general but is
much more boring to read isn't it Oh
makes you lose the will to live an error
along those lines is somehow more
annoying and an error along the lines of
are they just got some preposition wrong
because in that case it's fine but I
don't know I feel like sometimes it's a
bit over the top and so I'm trying out
bits of English but they're not and that
sounds hot that sounds horribly like
superior from the native English speaker
I don't mean it just being it reads to
me like you know I think I think us you
know English speakers native English
speakers are odd and respectful of the
amazing way in which non-native English
speakers manage to write their papers
you know it's hard enough light in
computer science paper in your own
language let alone writing in some other
language
all new non-native English speakers you
are amazing right but but you could you
should seek help from native speakers
occasionally just to proofread your
paper to check for idioms the kind of
thing you know and you're describing
here and I suppose maybe you're right
that you don't want to go too far the
informal language perhaps if you're not
very confident of the idiom and the
check out with the native speaker - oh
the referees may not be native speakers
yes but then there they will seldom say
I suppose in I don't know I've never
I've never had a referee who sort of
criticized linguistic forms it wasn't
pretty confident of other language I'm
not sure that's really too much of a
problem so I guess all I'm saying is I
would err on the side of informality if
you're you know when you're making a
choice but obviously none of these
things are you know extremes they're
just on the whole I think papers are
typically too formal rather than too
informal yeah yeah no do not do this
that's right you look at the paper and
you get to this this paragraph on page
one like that precious gold dust page
one and do you read this with excitement
do you think yes this is the paragraph I
want to read I'm so glad it's finally
come it's like chocolate you know the
reward at the end of the introduction
you skip is don't you because you're
going to read the paper or else you're
not but this isn't going to change what
you do in fact if you've done a good job
with your forward references here right
all this stuff you have essentially said
this because you've already pointed
forward to the sections in the paper
they're good so just don't do this at
all like just use the the contributions
to do that it's a complete waste of time
I don't know why everybody does it's
amazingly common completely useless
thank you for pointing that out now I
want to say bit about related work but
you mentioned this was something
somebody mentioned related work earlier
but
what you see happens with papers is this
why I say usually often you need sort of
introduction you think this sounds
interesting now here's you the reader
like sort of walking up to the paper and
then you get to this sort of section 2
that says related work or background or
something and it has language like this
right so it's a sort of walk through the
literature using terminology that you do
not understand
citing papers that you do not know about
right and it makes you it's bad in two
different ways the first is it makes you
feel stupid as a reader because you've
read this introduction read this
background and related work section and
you don't understand any of it so you
think I must be an idiot and also
because it's long well you know maybe a
page sometimes two pages why do you
think oh I'm just exhausted you're not
sure I'm gonna make it through this to
get to the payload right and yet you
can't you don't feel you can stop
reading it in case this material is
essential to what will follow you see
the problem have you ever felt this when
you're reading a paper you know that
sense of feeling stupid is this what you
would do - yeah we all know that's been
like no way is that what you would do to
your friend on the whiteboard you know
you've got Alexander in the room and
he's you know giving you the the
pleasure of his company and you're
standing in front of the whiteboard
would you say Alexander look we're going
to adopt the notion of transaction from
brown and use the four phase
interpolation algorithm of which
Alexander has ever heard of right you
wouldn't you would skip all of that
wouldn't you you would skip to your idea
and you might mention when you were
introducing your idea you would say oh
by the way this this particular I've
this particular part of the idea that
isn't new right that was this grand guy
I'll tell you a bit more about him later
so it's not that you want to hang on
it's not that you want to ignore related
work it's just that you want to tell
your story and as you tell it you make
incidental references to other people
and then you put the related work part
kind of at the end here so instead of
putting it in the beginning I always put
the related work section at the end by
the end you have a lot more you've got
much more
intellectual scaffolding you have had
another six pages to introduce your
reader to the terminology and to the
kind of problems that you have and also
you've introduced your idea so by the
time you get to related work you're in a
position to say here's what grounded
that was very relevant to me built on
that and but here's how my idea differs
what was until you presented your idea
it's very difficult to say how differs
see the point yeah it's very much a
summary of related work which I've found
to be completely so I kind of felt
through reading through the description
of the problem and how the soul I'd
already kind of managed to infer a bit
what related work might have been and
the last thing I wanted to do what
appeared to be the end of the paper was
then read a summary of related work
because it felt like it's it's just like
somebody summarizing the field at the
end so I think maybe what would be
important this is what's important is it
needs to be a critical comparison of
your method with the other methods
rather than just a list a literature
review at the end of the paper which
seems right so I think that saying the
word critical comparison is very good
right because what we don't want is just
what you often well you often get
emulator work sections is I think what
you're referring to as a summary is is
where you say you know brown and white
did this in 1960 and they and they use
these kind of transactions and then you
say then there's another sentence about
the next one and another sentence about
the next one giving no comparison either
with each other or with your work right
and so I think you're completely right
that what you want is but at this stage
in the paper it's possible to do it to
give a critical person they're better on
this axis they're perhaps not quite so
good on that axis thanks the VOC good
pie and you can't do that at the
beginning but and the bit that an early
related work section does let you do and
which of course you know related work
sections that occur early sometimes do
this very well is they introduce the
problem and sort of build up a series of
ideas that culminate in the you know the
the problem in your idea right that can
work well but if you think of that as
the primary mission the primary
mission is to get to a statement of the
problem a new idea like to do that you
may well need to build up from you know
a series of failed iterations or earlier
ideas and in doing so you may want to
cite earlier work but the purpose is to
get to the point where the reader
understands you idea not to describe
related work it merely sites related
work as appropriate on that journey so
that is what you don't want is for a
referee to think that's brown and
White's idea in it UPR completely
ignorant of that that happen okay not
that you jump immediately to a statement
the problem is in comprehensible you do
what you would do on a white board which
is to explain enough to understand the
problem and the idea that may involve
introducing mathematical notation right
as you do so you will cite the source of
that notation that's all but the purpose
is to help the reader to your idea not
to explain everything about the related
work yeah I think you should actually
put like not just give a citation but
actually describe it I mean if you know
if you stand on its own
somebody's work which is fine it should
be kind of a self-contained unit but you
need to think of the core you running
this paper for so your citations needn't
be - what's the word subtle so you might
want you might want to say you're
introducing some notation you might say
following Randolph 1998 we define an epi
morphism to be this right so you saw in
the text it's clear that you're giving
credit to the right person
oh is it work just to show that you know
domain no no course not right nobody's
really interested in what you know or
don't know right because that's a very
sort of self-centered view why should
anybody care about what I know like
right so then what's the purpose of
relation work section in my paper well
so after we've you know my papers trying
to introduce this idea so I have to help
you to the idea but then at least by the
time I got to got by the time I get to
the end I want to show you how this idea
relates to other ideas in the field why
it was it's a big complicated world
right do you want to locate this
particular piece of work in the grand
scheme of things right and that's
something that we just want to know it's
just that if you present too much of
that too early it's very indigestible
let me say something about credit though
because here's another fallacy about the
related work section is that to make
your work look good you have to make
other people's work look bad right so in
the in your related work perception you
say you know
Randolph &amp;amp; Co did X and but it was
completely hopeless you know it really
didn't work at all and my idea was way
better right they're a bunch of idiots
well you don't actually say that but
that's the implication right so that
somehow I can only be look great if I
make you look stupid but
the good news is that credit is like
love not like money so if I have 20
pounds and I give what's your name
and I give Artem 10 pounds how much do I
have left 10 pounds right money is not
fungible if I give Artem some I don't
have it myself
but if I have credit right if I give
Artem credit in my paper so in items
inspiring earlier work does that mean
that my paper looks less creditworthy no
it's like it's like love you know if I
if I give love to somebody
there's no less there's more love in the
world it's not like a a fixed-size
commodity that only comes in total units
of 20 so I can get divided so and credit
is just like that so take care to warmly
acknowledge the people who on whose work
you build take you know use work use
adjectives they don't take up very much
space but use adjectives like inspiring
or helpful or insightful when describing
other people's work if they were of
course this isn't sort of just fawning
on them or try to make your referees
like you it's because you did find their
work its borrowing or insightful but
take a moment to say that it'll make
them feel good it'll them and it might
even be true and the other thing is when
you're comparing with related work this
is the critical comparison you were
referring to do not try to give the
impression that your work is better on
every dimension you know a better we're
faster were smaller we'll use less
memory you know it's easier to read the
code is simpler everything is better
it's most unlikely to be true just
occasionally if you're very very billion
it might be true but it's often not true
and the not true bits often the bits
that people leave out like so they leave
it for the referee to say well it is
faster but but but but it takes some you
know a 10 to the 12 bytes to compute in
was this this other guy only takes 10 to
the 4 bytes and that's a big difference
you do not want your referees to be
pointing out the weaknesses if your
approach it's rather disarming to a
referee if you point it out ok so be
honest it's even good from it's good
from a scientific point of view and it's
actually good from a reviewing point of
view if you point out your own
weaknesses rather than have somebody
else point them out for you ok yeah
probably in the introduction I probably
mainly focus on and contributions they
know what what you feel the new things
maybe I'd have a very sort of brief
summary I'm like I do programming
language stuff so I'm like summarize
sort of you know one or two numbers
about performance results and say you
know those are given in more detail in a
later section and usually I don't say
anything very much in the introduction
about related worker just say there's a
great deal of related work here which we
discussed in section eight something
like that so introduction has to be
short judgement always I know but up and
if there's a major major obvious
weakness you know but really why you
might want to say something in
introduction like although other systems
are more general in the particular
domain where we apply we think our
results are very good as we shall see in
section so you know a little remark like
that that makes it clear you know we
haven't conquered every problem that's
always a good thing
yes but a positive spin on it it's you
can you can you can you can put there is
a certain element of a sales job in a
paper I mean after all in describing and
you just don't want it to be you know a
persuasive argument rather than a snow
job in which you're trying to mislead
your reader but you couldn't be positive
yes so I never write conclusions I just
stop
I have conclusions and further work and
it's mostly further work just as a
matter of interest because I think the
contributions part is the bit that
drives the rest of the paper how we do
tension that's good
right so
enough about content really I want to
say a little bit about just the process
of writing the paper and the main thing
I want to talk you about is just about
putting about thinking about your
readers when you're writing the paper so
for the main payload which I'm not going
to say very much about is just trying to
think about how your readers are going
to read it and this is to do with
generality here if you introduce you
start off the main payload with the most
general statement of your theorem or
whatever it is you're going to put them
all to sleep
right and they'll again they'll feel
stupid do you want your readers to feel
stupid no right you do not so try not to
make them feel stupid so at the
whiteboard what you do invariably you
start with an example on a whiteboard
don't you almost invariably
you start with an example or a diagram
or something that will get your reader
interested so just use examples as your
introductory did so here's an example
from a paper that I wrote a little while
ago just this is I'm early on in the
paper I'll give a couple of concrete
examples of the kind of thing I'm trying
to deal with and the other thing about
examples is that sometimes in your path
to this paper you have been through a
lot of examples right you have you've
been through a lot of dead ends do you
ever does your research ever have dead
ends in it
my research consists almost entirely of
dead ends
right is when I've got a maze following
algorithm right and it's tempting when
you write a paper to drag your reader
into every dead end with you right
because all those your Buner your blood
is soaking the the the ground and you
want to show them look look blood is
here that was a very obvious you know
thing I did it wrong and you can do it
wrong too and it can be very annoying
for reader if they've slogged through
two pages of material that they found it
hard going and has consumed their most
precious resource namely their time and
then you tell them actually that didn't
work we're going to do something
entirely different
ah you think give me a break right I
could not I could have saved that ha ha
right so don't drag your reader through
your journey of discovery
sometimes there's a dead end that is so
obvious that if you lead directly to the
conclusion you're
we'll be thinking go there go there
and you know why are you taking this
very complicated path when there's
something so much simpler is available
and then you perhaps have to say
actually guys it looks simple but it
didn't work and here's why but do try to
avoid the taking them down every
dead-end concentrate on the idea that
you get to either shortest path and so
this was about trying to think about
your readers right and taking them by
the shortest path that will get them
where they want and the other thing
that's about you talking to them but the
other thing is about them talking to you
right so one advantage of having written
a paper down is that you get some
feedback on your paper so how do you get
feedback one thing is just give your
paper to some guinea pigs that is
friendly people who will read it for you
and when they read it if you give your
paper to what's your name then right so
I'll give my paper to Ben and say Ben do
you think you could just read this paper
tell me what you think and the result
Ben Ben will come back to me with a
great number of grammatical suggestions
right you will say this sentence that
you know doesn't read very well and I
think you should use a different
adjective there and I put a comma there
that's what we just do if you don't
educate them otherwise but if I say then
do me a favor read this paper and tell
me the first place that you get lost and
then stop and we want I'd like to talk
about it you see the difference right
then that focuses Ben's attention not on
the details of the grammar but actually
understanding the paper and then he
could say well actually it was someone
page 3 I lost touch with the argument
right and then you could say oh then you
go to the whiteboard you say what I
meant was this and Ben says why didn't
you write that down and you say smack
followed
I should have see the dialogue right and
then you iterate that process about a
hundred times but so you need to use
your guinea pigs with with care right
because like any pigs in a laboratory
once you've inoculated them with the
drug right then they're kind of you know
used up and they can no longer read your
paper for the first time so after I've
used up then I have to move on to Thomas
right so then Thomas is my next guinea
pig so if you used all your guinea pigs
at once then you know you don't get to
show them the successive jobs because
after after I've revised it then won't
have the same difficulties as he would
the first time okay very important so
these are your friends right
it's also possible sometimes they get
Guinea to get some help from from actual
experts like your phones do not need to
be thoroughly expert in this area right
it's if they're kind of like English
graduates you know they're your
girlfriend or your boyfriend or
something then that then they they may
give you some help but it won't be the
kind of help that I'm describing about
where you get lost probably you need to
find some computer science friends right
that's but but they don't need to be
expert in the particular narrow sub
domain but in the narrow domain it is
possible sometimes to get help from
experts and one thing that I sometimes
do is I kind of this gets easier as you
get get on it because to send your draft
to one or two other people don't do this
in a blunderbuss way and a good approach
is well you know I've read your
inspiring paper about this I know and
I've done some work that's based on it
and in fact in my related work I do
discuss how the two fit together and I
if you you know if you had a moment to
glance with related work sections see if
I've described your work fairly then
then that'd be really great and
sometimes they think oh and they'd look
and then they get hooked and they'll
give you some feedback maybe this is
this is this doesn't i wouldn't wouldn't
recommend this as a sort of default
strategy a lot but you may meet somebody
to conference that you think alright
maybe I you know I've met them once I
could send them a job getting good
reviews from experts is hard this is
just one way then yeah could they pinch
your idea oh they could pinch your idea
but it's terribly terribly unlikely so
in them what's one of the lovely things
about computer science in biochemistry
say the boundary of the subject is very
carefully - is very clearly defined and
many research groups who write at the
boundary kind of competing with each
other to see who will publish first in
computer science it's like a snowflake
right that everybody is working at
they're bitter the snowflake and it's
the snowflake is growing ahead of them
as we invent computer science it's not
like the natural world right it's sort
of synthetic so mostly if I tell you
what I'm working on you think well
that's cool but it's not my part of the
snowflake right it's very rare to point
to someone to find somebody who
so much in your part of the snowflake
that they would really want to steal
your idea even if they will wick it
enough to do so so generally speaking
it's not a problem but it does tell you
another thing which is that in computer
science novelty is not enough because
novelty is too easy the snowflake grows
you can always describe something that's
new
like what difficult is describing
something it's new and useful so don't
just think for my paper is it novel
because that's not enough in computer
science it's enough in biochemistry it's
not enough in computer science should've
had a slide about that last thing about
feedback is how you receive feedback so
you've you sent your paper to a
conference or to a journal it's come
back reject it ah
and there were views are just written by
idiots right they had no clue they
misunderstood everything they they don't
appear to know their subject and you're
bleeding right because these unfair
reviewers have slammed the pand your
paper and it got rejected so first thing
to do is just set it aside for several
days till you stop bleeding and then go
back to the reviews and think to
yourself how could I write the paper so
that not even the stupidest reviewer
could make that error okay
you'll get good value from your reviews
occasionally you will think it cannot be
clearer than it is he's just an idiot
right but that is where mostly reviewers
are quite well qualified and they
certainly have devoted for your paper a
quantity of their most precious resource
which is their time right that is the
one thing they cannot make more unlike
love if I give Ben's paper half an hour
of my time I never have that half hour
again right so it's a precious resource
that they're giving you as you treat it
with respect
right so don't don't tell them even in
your head you stupid idiot you should
have understood it try to make it so
they could not possibly misunderstand
okay so they want
I thought those that those are the the
things I wanted to tell you I've got in
the slides which I guess scarlet will
let you have and there's a few there's a
bit more about language and style and
visual structure but I didn't want to
put that in the talk because I'm we
don't fit it in time I want to sort of
we please there's seven the sort of
seven ideas that I would like you to
take away from this talk this is an
example by the way of what is the main
idea well this this does have seven main
ideas but the biggest idea is know what
the idea is and convey it other
questions and observations or gary is
moving his joystick wallah vigorously
yes and this might be a non-native
speaker problem but i have the biggest
and trouble getting the tense right and
sometimes so when i say say uh they did
this and I thought or we thought this
would be a good idea well I still think
it's a good idea so or we conducted a
user study and five of them were female
well there's they are still female so
there's jumping between past and present
sis what do you think about that I don't
know that I can help you with a sort of
simple answer now what would I do
I would get hooked up with a native
speaker
right and certain sort of somehow say
you know would you be kind enough to
look at this paragraph or even this
paper and advise me because without
quite a bit of context I'm not a good
enough teacher of English as a foreign
language to know do you read your papers
in the present oh yes most mostly I
liked in the present ok yes even though
you still think it's a good idea yeah I
need more context to - well certainly
it's more engaging to write in the
active voice but I'm not quite sure
about I'm not quite sure about this
present thing can you give me another
given can you give me a concrete example
again just one concrete example well if
you if you think it's a good idea or if
you thought it was a good idea to do
this back then when you're happy idea
you can I think you're describing your
research from a point of view when you
had the idea but you still think it's a
good idea I wouldn't worry about the
tense so much is about whether we want
to say that at all like visits of no
great interest of the reader what I
think so saying that's like telling
telling them what I did in my summer
holidays you know first I did this and
then I did that and then I did the other
that's no the reader doesn't care about
that they're interested they're not
really interested in what you think so I
suppose I'm I'm stepping one step back
and saying I wouldn't say that at all in
any tense do you think of another
example over lunch talk about it yeah I
come from a different field from
computer science ah jeez theoretical
economics I mean it has a different way
of expressing ideas but I'm doing a PhD
in in computer science and I'm
publishing in computer science
conferences so sometimes I I think that
the the way that I used to express ideas
in the other fields better than this one
so I I explicitly chose this way but
when I when I give the draft or the
computer science is said one of the main
critics I
I get is no no you should express this
differently even though I explicitly
made this choice the choice that you
made specifically the choice especially
when you when you express these macro
ideas it's in theoretical economics
usually you get more fighters off you
can be hard math and and which is I
think is a better way of giving some
instruction of the idea but this doesn't
I mean computer science don't like this
a lot but I I still think it's better
but I also want to get to maximize the
rate of acceptance if you were talking
to somebody on the whiteboard or in your
office would you start off with the
philosophy ok so just do what you do
with your friend I would say but you
probably wouldn't have a very long bit
of philosophy I don't know I think it's
sometimes there are cultural norms to
which in effect you have to conform
because otherwise you'll get you have
too much trouble with your referees and
I really can only speak to the cultural
norms for computer science and maybe
you're butting up against that but on
the whole I would start by thinking what
is the clearest most engaging most
exciting way to present this idea to a
fresh reader and secondly worry about
whether that fits with the cultural
norms right we did not to say that
they're not there maybe you in the end
you have to give way on the norms but
start with what's engaging and exciting
if you if you start by thinking tactical
questions about what you think people
want to read then then there's a danger
your whole paper will be put out of
whack and you'll and you'll actually and
it turns out you were wrong about what
they were expecting so the dangerous
place to start from these narrow
tactical considerations yeah and what do
you think about the use of images and
figures in papers so I have the
impression that having a picture on the
first page which also costs you some
space for text actually it's actually a
good idea if the picture ever actually
says something it gives you an idea
yeah so I've so I mean in general and
everybody will tell you this pictures
diagrams figures all good right I in in
my paper I have a lot of figures because
they contain reference material you know
the API for a library the typing
judgments for something so anything that
somebody might want to refer back to it
very good to put in the figure pictures
of graphs sort of diagrams of how things
fit together it certainly makes a paper
much more engaging to read blocks of
solid text avoid as much as you can even
if you can't find think of a convenience
of pictures use lots of subsections and
bullets I don't know about the page one
thing as you say takes a lot of column
inches for a picture there but if it's
an insightful one that somebody can look
at the picture and get a real sense of
what papers about go for you I also just
have a common when I brought my PhD my
dissertation um there was an upper word
limit for that you had so you had to
really squeeze down your your ideas and
digest them and just put in there what's
really essential whereas of course if
you don't have that there is a danger
that you put things in that are not
really relevant is there any advice for
paper also most confident comfort ISM
and some journals have page limits
limits yes but that you have that you
have perhaps if you have only a small
idea and then you kind of fill it up
with with things that are perhaps not
really relevant for your main idea but
you don't have enough content yet
I think the the idea is too small and
you pad it out is vanishingly rare in my
experience like I said you sometimes you
haven't you have an idea white paper
about it turns out to be trivial then
don't pad it out into a full length
paper right obviously just just publish
it on your website and move on
much more common is you have an idea and
you're struggling to fit it in the page
limit and you really have to think about
you know maybe there's a whole section I
can export to an appendix or something
some way but what you cannot do is to
simply take a paper that really needs 20
pages and compress it to 12 by omitting
every third word this is not good right
because then you put off all your meters
you just have to find a way to say less
but
comprehensibly it was quite new right at
the back behind you there was this guy
in the Czech shirt yeah we mentioned
that a generally bad idea to speak about
dead ends to speak about were to write
about where you failed and what the hand
I had the discussion recently that all
over the world people waste lots of time
because we don't know where other people
failed in a similar or exactly the same
area so do you think it could be do you
think that somehow people need more or
less formal way to share their failures
to share what doesn't work so that they
oh oh you're asking kind of a lot about
negative results yeah so sometimes
that's right so this is a difficult
thing in science generally and ending in
in computer science in so negative
results are important right being able
to report that something does not work
is important but it's very difficult to
get it published so it's really really
hard to to write a paper that says you
know we tried x y&amp;amp;z and none of them
worked you should publish this paper but
maybe particularly in computer science
because it's so synthetic right there's
so much of the snowflake that's
unproductive that reporting that I mean
in biology there might be a stronger
reason but it is hard publishing
negative results unless they're so
obvious like I was saying that do you
think that really ought to work anybody
would think of that it would work
there's been seven papers that have
suggested that as a as a direction that
should work and it doesn't you know is a
pretty compelling story to make a
negative result publishable and even
then it's better if you can also say aha
but we fixed it thank you I'm gonna be
young oh you know I'll be hanging around
doing luck so come and talk over lunch
