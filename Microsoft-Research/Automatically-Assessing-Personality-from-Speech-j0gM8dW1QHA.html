hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
no I think most people here know floor
and it just for those who might be on
video florian finished his PhD in 2005
at karlsruhe he was working with Alex
hribal he then worked for a few years at
deutsche telekom on various speech
things and call analytics and he's now a
faculty at CMU and doing lots of
interesting research including this
stuff so gonna let you go for it around
thank you Dan so thanks everyone for
having me and thanks for allowing me to
be here so this has really worked at
them started when I was still a postdoc
at berlin i started working with tim who
is now a PhD student at deutsche telekom
laboratories and technical university of
berlin so yes you were asking this
there's no CMU affiliation on this on
the title and that's really because
deutsche telekom is funding Tim and I'm
doing it on my my spare time and because
i like the because i like the topic that
we're working on so we're trying to to
find what how much personality we can
find in speech and what added value
maybe speech could bring to an
assessment of personality if if you look
into it so brief overview i want to
start by explaining how you can assess
personality in the first place and
verify that you can assess personality
in speech because that's not at all
clear that this is something that you
can reliably do and you're going to make
sure that this is the case we started
collecting a database on which we then
run a couple of experiments on both how
do humans assess personality in speech
and how can machines mimic that process
are we want to first do human human
baseline experiment on personality
assessment from speech and then see how
well can a machine do the same and feel
free to interrupt me at any at any time
during the talk i see doubtful faces
already so
oh yeah whatever you like so that would
probably be a cross cultural perception
of speech thing then because the work
that we are doing is on German and I'm
gonna play you some some German speech
and let you assess the personality and
it's always that's always good for
interesting discussion as well if not
laughs so um now why why do we want to
do this well I mean you know you all
know about the motion detection from
from speech and how that's sort of kind
of useful but not really because the
only emotion you ever find is anger and
that's maybe five percent of the the
time and ninety-five percent of the time
at least in call centers it's neutral
speech so maybe if you knew what
personality person is maybe it would be
easier and more reliable to detect
emotions so if somebody is a neurotic
person maybe he's going to express
emotion differently than somebody who's
a very very extrovert person so if you
knew about a person's personality you
could normalize emotion detection we
work with ten classes but of course the
the scheme that we are using is sort of
a profile so it's a it's continuous
scales so we could have any number of
classes with ten personalities well I'll
come to that but there are five by five
scales open those anxiousness
agreeableness extraversion neuroticism I
can I remember them by now well yes of
course they're related but they're
different so let me I'll come to come to
that in there in a minute and of course
it would be interesting if we do with
which speech transcription if you could
annotate speech with properties saying
that this was this type of person saying
this and another thing and this is
really also why don't you telecom is
interested in this type of work is that
they spent a lot of time in brand in
the corporate brand and whenever they do
ads whenever they have voice or call
centers they spend time to make sure
that the voice that they use in the call
center transports their corporate values
so they do brand monitoring and quality
assurance saying that if you hear a
voice in a Deutsche Telekom at least
automated call center they want to make
sure that the voice instills in you the
values to Deutsche Telekom stands for
which is it's a former state-run
companies so they are reliable they're
your grandfather's company they don't
have to be young and hip but they want
to be solid and reliable so any voice
that they want to use in the system and
any voice also that they want to use in
a tts and a speech synthesis system
should also transport these qualities
that they stand for so to speak a
personality so if you had an automatic
system to assess that there will be a
useful instrument to make sure that the
dialogue systems for example transport
the brand values I don't think they
quite there yet but that's something
that this could be this could be used
for and of course any kind of
human-computer interaction would be
useful if you had personality
information both for recognition and
synthesis if you could synthesize voices
with different emotions or personalities
so the work that we're doing could also
be used to assess the personality and
the impression as synthetic voice leaves
in you so that's what we are working
towards now what our personalities um I
can read to you this definition which I
like it's a dynamic and organized set of
characteristics possessed by a person
that uniquely influences his or her
Commission's motivations and behaviors
in various situations now that's a one
of many definitions of personality that
tells you a little bit but it's yes it's
not very precise and that's part of the
problem here it's really I think what it
boils down to some analysis of how
people and their perceived behavior can
differ so you're looking for a property
in a person that others can
not directly but that they can detect
because people are doing things in
certain ways so you only observe
personality by by proxy if you want
because this purpose people this person
speaks like that this person speaks like
that these people this person does these
things like this and this other person
does these things like that and that's
because they have different
personalities for lack of another sort
of observable property that's different
between people the important thing about
personality and also the differentiator
between personality and emotion is that
personality is meant to be stable over
time emotions can change very quickly so
a person your personality wouldn't
change over days weeks or even months
while emotions can change within minutes
within between the two then I don't I
wouldn't argue that there is a clear-cut
separation between personalities and
emotions they are speaker States if you
want or traits and at least at this
point we can't say with certainty well
this is an influence of personality and
this is an influence of emotion you'll
always have certain qualities but here
we're looking for something that some
stable over time and in psychology there
is what's called the five-factor
inventory ffi that uses five factors to
describe person's personality profile
that you can use to measure and predict
sort of habitual patterns that a person
has in their thoughts behaviors and in
the way that they express their emotions
try to be dominant
it's it's similar in marketing they they
have these personas what is prototypical
fo there's there's several several
different I mean I think the Germany has
a different set of personality or of how
do they call it sinus milliers so they
have different types of people that they
used to do to do marketing what to do
observational studies and I think that
different from what people use in the US
but i think the personality at least
this way of representing personalities
of there's a kind kind of academic way
of describing it where you have a space
in which you can then distribute your
personas or your prototypes if you want
but in theory you should be able to map
other schemes into this scheme how how
well that works and if one is more
suitable to your purpose and one is more
suitable to another purpose that's of
course depends on what exactly you want
to do but this new fi framework or the
new ffi framework that we are using it's
been developed over the course of
several decades now research in
psychology it's being essentially
measured using a questionnaire of 60
questions that people answer either
about themselves then it's called self
assessment or that they answer about
somebody else whom they know then it's a
third person assessment and this the
personal assessment is generally
considered more reliable because people
tend to see themselves differently than
other people see them and in the end
what's what matters or was more
consistent more reliables how other
people see a person so with this type of
questionnaire the Neo ffi about in
English about 110 studies have been
performed with 24,000 participants and
in German which is what we are using
this workers in German about 50 studies
have been done
within 12 and a half thousand or tuna
two thousand one hundred participants so
this is the population against which we
can compare the personalities that we
and the profiles that we find so if we
have a certain profile we know we're in
the space of all these personality
profiles we are if twenty percent of the
other population is more neurotic than
via then this person is or eighty
percent is less neurotic and so on is
also which I don't remember the name of
it but it's scott judgmental sensing
introverted extroverted and there's a
couple of more I know that there's a
media is also 6 factor inventory and
there is categorical purely categorical
schemes and continues I need two Indians
versus something that yeah it was
another axis there's a there's a zoo I
may have come across the one that you're
talking about but I've we've only really
worked with this one this is also the
the questionnaire is to you have to pay
for it if you use it for every year you
pay a dollar here or something / /
questionnaire but yeah probably
any-any questionnaires has its
advantages and disadvantages and there's
a lot of debate about which one's better
and but this one seemed at least from
what we could find this one is the most
established one and also one that exists
in the essentially the same form in
English and German and other languages
so you could you could do it across
languages or culture severe if you want
so what are the five factors that I've
been been talking about here I found
this this image in the internet so I
just had to have to use it it's
neuroticism extraversion openness to
experience agreeableness and
conscientiousness radiation is ocean so
you can you can remember them and each
of these five factors is expressed as a
value between zero and 45 corresponding
to low and high so if you have a low
score on the neuroticism access or in
the neuroticism scale that means that
you're not very neurotic well if you
have a high value on the neuroticism
scale that means that there's a lot of
neuroticism in your personality profile
this profile is determined using a
questionnaire or with from 60 items
which you answer on a five-point likert
scale so you answer questions like I
like to have a lot of people around me
strongly disagree disagree neutral agree
strongly agree or I often feel inferior
to others strongly disagree disagree no
neutral and so on I laughs easily you
either do that about yourself or about
somebody else and from these answers
there is a set of rules an algorithm
that computes this personality profile
and it's not that any of these single
questions directly maps to any of these
personality factors but it is
essentially a linear interpolation of
your answers to these some to these
questions which determines your
personality profile as a value
essentially as a set of five numbers
between 0 and 4
that describe how your how you're
supposed to be now gene and correlating
assuming I'm going to show some some
statistics on that later of course
they're not completely independent they
are independent to some to some extent
but yes if you if you want to see them
as a coordinate system then the five
dimensional space then that's what it's
ideally what it would be now what does
it mean this personality profile if for
example somebody has a low value on the
openness scale then he would be
described by words like conventional
simple unimaginative literal-minded well
if he had a a person had a high value on
the openness scale he would be described
with words young curious original
creative artistic intellectual and the
same for all the other axis so the way
to interpret such a profile is to say
well the more towards the one end of the
scale you are the more people would be
likely to use any of these words to
describe your your personality and now
what you can do is if you take for
example a certain sample of a population
if you take 20 people what we've done
here you sort of average their
personality profiles then you get a
graph like this USD neuroticism
extraversion and so on access here's the
the median value the interquartile
ranges so you can see that if you are
here then you know that and you can also
because you know what the total
distribution of the personality profiles
is from all the 2,000 questionnaires
that have been filled out in German or
the 12,000 that have been filled out in
English you know what the rest of the
population is doing where they are so
you know we're in respect to sort of the
total population you are so this is what
a personality profile of a single person
or a group might look like now of course
the question is how how good our DS and
how independent RDS on these 5 x's now
here for the german neo fi the manuals
or the book that describes it contains a
table that shows what's been what's been
computed and you see that for example
that the correlations or the
off-diagonal correlations between these
axes they are relatively I would say
well behaved not in a maybe in in
physics or in statistics you would get
even lower correlations but for sort of
a table on psychological data I think
the argument is that these numbers are
relatively relatively low relatively
close to zero but what's what you notice
for example is that there is a strong
negative correlation between neuroticism
and extraversion so a person that has a
high value on the eroticism has tends to
have a lower value on the extraversion
taxes and the other way around that's
kind of intuitive if you would think
somebody who would be you would imagine
it would be difficult to be neurotic and
extrovert at the same time so that's
what what this strong negative
correlation means but all the other
numbers are relatively relatively close
to zero if you want so that to some
extent these axes are really independent
but of course it's not a completely
they're not completely independent in
the sense that you you could vary them
totally at your will company I want
projected mature stable reliable
image so and you mentioned the
grandfather voice what would the grand
father voice ian is tournament we do
have
so we do have our our sort of the
Deutsche Telekom corporate voice which
is the guy that we were recording for
our database he recorded a number of
sentences in his dodgy telecom voice and
this is the this is the profile that we
computed for this for this voice so that
that's exactly these these bars where we
computed his average profile for a
number of samples that he had that he
had given so he scored high on the
conscientiousness scale and relatively
low on the neuroticism scale and average
values if you want on the extraversion
openness and maybe a slightly more
towards the positive side on the
agreeableness voice on the agreeableness
scale and that would be a maybe or your
grandfather voice but that's the
personality profile yeah that's I guess
that's what you that's what you want to
be right so that's the that's a voice
that Deutsche Telekom is is happy with
of course if if you talk to the
marketing folks if they could also be
happy with a voice that has a different
profile we don't we don't know yet we
haven't done a lot of studies on that
but that's the profile of a voice that
they're happy with so yeah of course
there's a lot of there has been some
other works on assessing personality
from from speech mostly on analysis of
psychiatric patients shara did a lot of
work on that and also apple and that's
apple the person not Apple the company
they found that the extra version can be
estimated from speech reliably and extra
words speakers for example speak louder
and the fewer hesitations so they
establish that you can take
a speech and derive from speech d or
hackett cues about the personality of a
speaker or if you know what the
personalities make predictions about how
this person's going to speak recently
Francois Maris was doing work on textual
information and also intensity and pitch
and he found that also extraversion can
be modelled well followed by what he
calls emotional stability but which is
essentially another term for neuroticism
he was using a different scheme than
what we are using and this also of
course tells us that personality doesn't
only influence the acoustics of how
things are being said but it also
influences what's being said so if you
describe a certain image if you describe
a situation an extra what person is
going to use different words than an
introverted person for example so that's
of course also something that we need to
control and then of course there's
Clifford Nass who learned a lot of work
on computer human interaction or a lot
of work he did work in computer human
interaction claims essentially that if
we talk to a dialogue system for example
we assign a personality to this dialogue
system to this computer and we tend to
have positive feelings towards a person
that a personality that we encountered
it has similar characteristics to our
own personality so he did studies in
which people liked a dialogue system
better if it was extra word if they were
extra words themselves so this is sort
of an not sure if this is a completely
thorough understanding of the problem
but it gives you an indication that
personality is important to take into
account in a human computer interaction
and he's been exploring some of these
ideas no it's a person it's a researcher
not not the company he's a psychologist
okay so with this we started collecting
a database the essentially collected a
database in three parts we took the
part is going to be a professional
speaker that we record that we give a
fixed text and ask him to record this
fixed single text in various
personalities so that we can we have a
baseline understanding of its active
personalities but you can see what
changes and if you can detect it
automatically if people can pick it up
automatically they're always going to
keep the text fixed the second part of
the database we are relaxing this fixed
text constraint and allow the speaker to
use different words if he is in
different personalities but and so if
somebody listens to that he might be
able to pick up on the personality by
the vocabulary by the lexical
information so that's difference between
the first and the second part and the
third part really is we're putting
people from the street or subjects into
the same situation as the professional
speaker in the second part they asked
him to describe images various images
and then we get other people who know
them well to do their personality
profiles and then we see if we can pick
up speaker independently and non-active
situation cues from the acoustic
properties of the speech towards the
personality of a person so we really
have three conditions to acted
conditions in fixed text and free text
and then non-actors real persons if you
want that do the same free text exercise
and our goal will be to pick up from
these three parts of the database see
what changes from condition to condition
and try and understand how well are
humans and picking up personalities and
how well our or well do machines do
machines work now let me give you an
example of the the data I think I
briefly tested the the audio so this is
a standard text like it that it could
appear in a budget telecom call center
and in fact the the professional actor
recording in a Deutsche Telekom voice
sort of a neutral
message something that's a bit positive
a bit negative that's friendly but not
overly overly friendly saw something
that we hope could be said in any
personality very common bamboo child

Eden go join in luzon motion vielen dank
on Alfreda on so that's sort of Europe
grandfather grandfather voice and here's
the english translation of the the text
that this that this guy has been reading
and acting now what we're going to do is
we have the personality profile and now
we're going to ask us professional
speaker to record personality or
variations of this text with low
neuroticism and high neuroticism low
extraversion and high extraversion so
the ten extremes on these scales and we
do to allow him to do that we gave him
the descriptions of the personality
profiles that we find in the New Year
amplified framework so he gets a piece
of text that essentially contains these
descriptions of persons with high
neuroticism are expected to be
controlled anxious and so on and he he
gets some time to put himself in the the
mood if you want and then he produces
various some recordings of always the
same text in different personalities
which we then recorded so we have about
them 75 minutes of this twenty second
text in various personalities now I know
that there's German speakers in the room
yes how can you decide
very cool value about it how can we
decide on the numerical values okay so
what we do when we have these recordings
is we have people come in and they
listen to these to the text to the to
the audio recording and they fill out
the questionnaire so they say they
listen to it and they say oh I think
that this person is likes laughs easily
or this person likes to have other
people around me and by filling out this
questionnaire we get a we get the
numerical value we get the personality
profile and the question really is is it
reliable if people only have about 20
seconds of speech or maybe a minute of
speech is it reliable that they can fill
out this questionnaire and therefore
assign a personality profile but that's
that's what we did so we had a speaker
produce many examples of different
personnel of different personality
prototypes and then have people listen
to that and fill out the questionnaire
they were free to listen to it as often
as they liked so they could listen to it
many times there was no time pressure
and everything and then we they fill out
the the profile so yep where your
valuation date is generator the way your
drain is generous oh so if humans aren't
any good at the valuating personality
for speech but computers could be yeah
we have your limited by the end by the
humans well it depends so here this part
of the database we have active data so
it could be that machines are better
than humans at picking out the intended
variation that the actor produced
because we know what the actor was
supposed to do so we could train a
system that has super sorry for using
the term super human performance
and we in fact we did two different
experiments so we did the classification
experiment where we tried to reproduce
or where we try to figure out what the
actor was doing and we did the
regression experiment and where we try
to reproduce the ratings that the humans
would assign to to the speech no matter
what the actor was trying to do i Justi
uz blanking love you maybe he learned
right ready school so basically this was
wrong the other person can compare to
that's an interesting an interesting
point can you if you listen to two
samples can you would it be easier to
describe a difference between two
speakers and that's work that I would
like to do that I would like to get
funding for but I don't have any any
funding for that yet and I don't know
what the answer was going to be we've
played a little bit with that idea what
do you get when you play two samples and
tell somebody don't tell us what the
don't tell us what what you think this
person is but tell us how different they
are if we really have a metric space if
you want in which different people would
be located like these personality
profiles would you find that I take a
profile that has that slow here to take
a profile that's high here otherwise
they're the same with people then say oh
this voice sounds a lot more agreeable
than the other voice or so i don't i
don't know what i would like to i would
like to do that experiment yes easy
yes so I told you that personalities
don't change and now i have an actor
producing personalities that will
clearly as a as a problem here the the
the actor these guys so this guy but
this guy does is he does he dubs movies
also so he's been doing a lot of movies
when playing different characters in
different movies and so what he gets in
that context is a short description of
what the character is he reads the
script and all that then he produces
different different voices so somehow
this actor has a superhuman capability
of producing different voices even
though his personality doesn't doesn't
really change but of course we're open
to criticism in the same sense that
emotion detection on acted emotions
detects something that's very different
from real emotions but it tells you
something about the space of the problem
where you're where you're in and for
example for synthesis experiments and
for analyzing synthesized personalities
or emotion this data is very very useful
but yes the basic fact is that here we
have one person producing speech with
different personalities that you use our
kind of very formal and polished them so
I'm wondering how much you can use it's
a different person to the tox screen and
it's saying a extremely emotional state
I would expect that give a speech
stumbles heathers at certain critical
moments and you would also do you use do
worse express something specific thing
can you estimate how how much
information is encoded in the wording
yeah yeah so this is the first part of
the database where we have a fixed text
the only thing that changes is the
acoustics the second part of the
database we allow the speaker to use
different words and in the third part of
the database we allow different speakers
to do different to use different words
in the same condition so that's exactly
why we designed these three these three
steps holy moly oh well let me let me
let me play your journey neurotic voice
a few everybody else the technical the
typical way I do this because it's so
much fun is that I ask you to close your
eyes for a second and I'll going to play
you one of low agreeableness high
neuroticism and high extraversion and
I'm going to have you guess what it what

so those are the the sample of the 10
different and the neutral neutral little
dimension that we that we have and even
though it's cross-lingual or
cross-cultural if you want it seems to
be that as a few universal thing
Universal things in there that allow you
to pick it up but clearly it's something
that's dependent on on language but it's
clearly something that's very that's
that's something that you want to be
able to understand in a human computer
interaction system and I mean I'm I'm
sounding like Alan black now that if you
want if you build speed synthesis you
want this also you want to be able to do
to do these these kind of things and
also a system should be able to pick up
on these type of differences in
automatic system and do something with
it now there's a one fun fact for you
you you recognize it looks like that guy
banging her phone yet it's very bad
good with the guy oh is that what it
tasted like what is his name I don't
know what its name is great semester
yeah there's a question its word who are
these guys the American this is American
Pie oh that's the movie American Pie and
our speaker he's the German voice of
Kevin so I don't know if lo to telecom
knows where yeah that's not really good
for their bread so that's this is what
this guy does for living in pubs clubs
movies so okay so what we've done is
we've recorded a number of recorded this
total of seventy five minutes of the
speaker reading this one sentence in
various personalities and we've recorded
about more than three hours of this
speaker describing a selection of these
images in various personality styles and
the idea here is that we put him in a in
a task that he has to do that doesn't
involve any other human that could
influence the way he speaks but these
images mean there's a selection of
romantic abstract scary peaceful images
depending on what image he's looking at
and what image he is describing
depending what personality he is sort of
doing that should influence the way that
he's that he's speaking these email most
of these images are also taken from
what's known as systematic Apperception
tests which is a standard psychology
test where exactly people look at what
words do people use to describe these
images and that allows them to take some
sort of get some clues about what
personality of mental state a person
this is in and that's all been done in a
in a studio with high-quality recordings
and no no noise and and everything and
again also for the
non active personalities so for the
people from the street that we brought
in we did the same image tests and also
a few human human interaction domains
where people talk to each other to get
data in a comparable situation to which
we have the recordings of the actor and
I would like to report on on the results
of these but we're not we're not done
yet Tim as a a young father and work is
going slower than we were hoping it
would so but now what do we get we have
this database where we have ten
different types of recordings of the
same always the same text and we bring
in the first thing we did is we selected
from from these 75 minutes and from all
these samples we gave to students the
task to rate them to rate every sample
individually and I think we have 20 or
30 repetitions of each utterance in each
personality profile so we rank them
according to naturalness and threw away
the ones that sounded most on the sound
of the least natural so that we don't
have any obvious obviously fake they're
obviously acted samples in our database
and then we had in total 87 test persons
come in listen to their samples and fill
out the personality profile of the
person that they're listening to the
voice that they're listening to while
they could listen to the data as often
as they wanted and this is what we get
so on the five scales for the variations
towards low values and the variations
towards the high values we get medians
and interquartile ranges and it's clear
that these are clearly separable and for
example extraversion seems to be
separable reasonably well neuroticism
work some better agreeableness works
probably the same as neuroticism
conscientiousness works quite well but
openness for example is something that
either our speaker doesn't isn't able to
separate very well or it's not
is task this text isn't good to
distinguish openness very well or it's
just not something that you can pick up
from from speech very well but it's
clear that the same that what the
experiment that you were doing in this
setting this is something that you can
that you can pick up and that you can
that humans at least can can tell apart
now when we're doing the same from with
the free speech so the descriptions of
these images where we varying the
textual information that's also being
said originally we were expecting that
well we're adding another sort another
dimension of information so this should
be easier to pick up so if I have a
description of an image in a neurotic
personality versus and non neurotic
personality if I can also vary the text
that should make the distinction between
the two even even easier because the
words would also be different but it
turns out that this is not the case so
here's the the old image for comparison
the overall structure of the result is
quite quite similar openness is again
can't you can't distinguish openness but
even the other ones are closer together
so our understanding for the moment
although we don't have any way of
proving that is that the actor is sort
of hyper articulating if you want in the
red speech and the fixed text case
because he's always he's he's sort of
because he's always producing the same
text he's learned very well how to do
that in in various personalities and
what we could do for example is have him
re speak things that he has said about
an image and having we speak that over
and over again to see if he sort of
that's a magnum effect of entrainment
for the actor or if it's really the case
that
the the length of the utterance or
anything else that's a difference
differentiated between the two is makes
it harder for him to produce it or for
people to pick it up at this point we
don't know but it's interesting to note
that it's easier to pick up these
personalities from a short sample that's
been read verses a longest longer sample
where we also vary the the lexical
content and we we do have transcriptions
of the data now but we haven't done any
lexical analysis to see which words were
varied if any and what's what's going on
there that's on the list of things to do
now the next thing that we looked at
also is if we know that this is the sort
of the table of correlations between
different personality factors how does
it look like for speech so the top one
knew you fi that's the one from
psychology how does it look like for for
us for the fixed text case and for the
free text case now the the first thing
of course is that the overall the
off-axis correlations are much much
bigger in our case simply because we
have a lot less samples but if we look
for the free text case for example where
we do have most most data then we see
that the numbers overall the absolute
values of the effects is the
correlations tend to be smaller than the
fixed text case so they tend to be
better and also the biggest value here
the biggest negative correlation is also
between neuroticism and extraversion in
this sort of the same structure as we
see it in the new fi case so in the
psychology case so still given the
number of samples that we have I
wouldn't call it a significant result
yet but it's it's sort of it seems
plausible that this is going in the in
the right in the right direction that
all the the other values tend to be
smaller than than here and in many cases
they have the same sign at least as the
correlations that we find in d yes so
you've used that to the Sun label in
there and then these are you listening
yeah yeah these are these are all human
listening tests yeah yeah the what would
people be trying to understand here is
is this a minister's a good protocol to
use then can people pick up personality
from 20 seconds of speech or from longer
seconds of speech errors or are we just
measuring catch catch what an actor is
just saying yes which i think is
different from personnel yeah it's like
can you read that like that I mean why
not do something where like you go to
NPR where they have a lot of interviews
a interview doesn't well not but if
you've been told a day and so you get
these samples of all these different
people they interview and then go to
other people and say look does this
person's down to ride does this person
sound agreeable go and and then you're
working with data that just sort of
naturally occurs but it's still going to
come from a big range of personalities
probably
yeah we could do that and when other
people have done that the why we didn't
do mean we started off with a single
speaker because that was also what the
company the company was using what the
company was interested in and we could
also use it for synthesis so that's what
we can do with this data what you can't
do with this type of data there how do
you love you still need to provide the
test knowledge love whether that person
actually especially that society real to
hear you not the Tegrity there and if
you can tell it people agreeing is good
don't agree your politicians I can't go
either we directors yeah there would be
a couple of very interesting things to
do one would be to take movie to take
not the original soundtrack of movies
but the soundtrack or did the sound
recordings that these guys do for movies
because then you have it without
background music without noises and they
do the same thing lots of material in
different personalities or as you say
take take interviews there is work a
group in trento in Italy is working on
they try to figure out personalities of
call center operators or people in a
call center and their first look at
their data was the dare with both human
assessment and automatic recognition
rates were very very poor so they added
a telephony channel don't know if that's
that's a difference but so yeah it's
cleared it with an age with an actor
we're making the task a lot easier while
with and we have less data while when
you're going to the telephone and take
samples do you make the task harder but
you have a lot more data so I I had to
interact with
American Express to make a reservation
today for I cast and I'll say as usual I
could tell you know within like 10
seconds of the person saying hello
whether the person was going to be able
to solve the problem or not it like
confident verse is not competent I claim
you can determine that I the telephone
we've got some an operator in within 10
seconds five seconds it's the I i agree
i mean you you have an estimate of a
personality if it's accurate or not
that's that may be one thing or if it
corresponds to what people who know this
person also assigned to this person we'd
you don't know but it's clear that in
your application domain that's what
you're eventually that's what you're
eventually eventually after that's what
you're eventually interested in you
don't need to know a personality you
want to know is this person going to
solve my problem or not and for that you
may not need this whole five factor
inventory shenanigans general
intelligence on truck you are the button
features
so what we the next step that time is
currently working on is taking the
personality labels that people who know
our subjects well assigned to our people
who have been giving a speech and see
how the assigned personality on the
audio corresponds to the the personality
that people are assigned to by people
who know them well but we don't have
these we don't have these these results
yet but clearly I mean the big data
approaches always collected somewhere
label it and and see see how reliable it
is and that's just as valid I think it's
doing what we are doing here and another
thing that we that we analyze this if we
if we do the recordings at different
points in time and also if you do the
annotation so if you do the labeling at
different points in time does that
influence the the results and of course
the statistics get poorer if we divide I
was set in two or three subsets and had
one labeled at the one month intervals
by the same people and to the extent
that we have reasonable statistics in 36
out of 40 tests we are confident that
the time at the time of the recording at
the time of the labeling doesn't
influence our results so that's
something we want to make sure that this
is a reproducible experiment then we
have we looked briefly let's skip over
that a little bit we also looked at if
the actor is varying one axis how does
it influence the perception of the other
axis so if he for example increases
neuroticism then we find as a
significant decrease in the perception
of extraversion and if he for example
increases extraversion we find that
there's a significant decrease in
neuroticism and that's also consistory
you would expect this kind of when you
think the test is in the
this negative correlation between values
assigned on are between the neurosis and
extraversion scales other than that
there doesn't seem to be too many other
interplays as we called it now last part
is signal based analysis if humans can
do it how well can can machines do it
we're doing two different things predict
human ratings and classifying the
intended personality and of course we're
doing a standard approach we extract a
large number of audio descriptors mfcc
features harmonics to noise ratio zero
crossing rate intensity pitch loudness
for voiced unvoiced segments and silence
segments we expect where their silence
and then total about 1200 features we
use an information gain ratio filter for
ranking these features according to how
well they could work in a classifier use
10-fold cross-validation SVM regression
and an svm classifier and built build a
classifier on in this case again the
acted and say fix text data and we see
that well after about 20 samples we
already getting around after about 20
features that we put into the classifier
we already get a relatively stable
performance and this is the regression
experiment we can predict the
extraversion rating that certain speech
sample will receive by our humans with a
correlation coefficient of almost point
7 neuroticism works a lot less well
about point five point six and
agreeableness conscientiousness and
openness are even below that but these
are also the factors that humans are in
good at estimating from from speech so
it's not surprising that or I don't know
you would expect that the correlation of
a human assessment with an automatic
assessment wouldn't be too high too high
either
justing is that this seems to be
saturated after maybe 30 features that
you put into this predictor and if you
do an analysis of what are these
features will are the salient features
that the machine picks out to predict
personalities while you find that here
for the example of the extra version
versus the neuroticism you see that a
lot of the extra version features are
pitch related and that's consistent with
psychology literature that the
variations in pitch are a good predictor
of the extraversion in a person of
course there's the mfcc features that
pop up everywhere although they they
shouldn't neuroticism there's several
intensity and loudness features so
pinches capturing dynamics and also a
pitch and mfcc features and it's also
consistent that the voice of a neurotic
person is very controlled very very flat
very level with very few changes in in
dynamics and yeah we did the
classification experiment so for the
intent for the intended variations of
our actor we did again 10-fold
cross-validation svm classifier and this
is a set up as a 10 class problem
indicating about sixty percent accuracy
on the the 75-minute data sets of six
times chance and we working on doing the
repeating the experiment on the larger
large data set with text independent and
and also with the large number of
speakers not only the single the single
actor here the ground truth is the
intended so the instruction for the for
the actor when we told him make this
extra word make this introverted this is
the ground truth for training and test
training and test here so that's also
why this is different from the
regression
okay yeah there's a number of for the
classification we see that for example
neuroticism and conscientiousness work
work quite well while extraversion works
slightly less well measured by the f
major / / class and openness and
agreeableness seem to be working or
seemed to be hard to to classify
consciousness is sort of how I a
conscientious person somebody who is if
you think is reliable careful I think
it's also planned in some sense I I
could see if I have samples of
conscientious versus non non
conscientious on my computer with its
it's interesting that then the
conscientiousness works well in the
automatic classification while and human
assessment conscientiousness doesn't
work quite as well and there so that
pretty much sums up our the state award
the results that we have right now we we
think that the protocol that we're
following allows us to measure the
personality of a person reliably quite
reliably from from the voice definitely
in the actor case and we with the
results that Tim is getting now also for
the actor in a free text case for when
we the database that we have recorded
under the same condition as the actor
with people from the street we haven't
fully we haven't run the statistics on
that yet we collected it so we hopefully
have results later in the year what we
find is that the neurotic is clearly
distinct while
very open and very extrovert are very
similar acoustically have skipped over
that in the details neuroticism next
reversion are in human assessment sort
of reciprocal openness typically tends
the perception of openness tends to
follow agreeableness if at all but
openness is the most challenging feature
and on the automatic assessment it works
quite well for neuroticism and
extraversion conscientiousness classify
as well but we have a hard time pretty
hard at I'm predicting the human
perception of conscientiousness and
agreeableness sort of correlates
moderately with user assessment but we
have a harder time calcifying it if you
sort of want to rank these features
relative to each other with how well
they they do and openness is sort of an
unsolved case we can't humans don't
assess it well and automatic assessment
doesn't doesn't work well so there's
certainly the biggest of the five and
the five factors so ongoing work we've
done summer workshop at Johns Hopkins on
using emotional speech synthesis using
articulatory features as parameters that
you can change and use in a parametric
speech synthesizing the using these this
database and these this classification
approach to measure how well a
synthesizer produced this speech with
emotional or characteristics that
doesn't mean that the speech is
understandable but it's emotional and of
course we want to continue on the text
independent and speaker independent case
here to see see where we are and of
course we're very interested to see how
we go with them non acted speakers and
enacted results and this is some sort of
jutsu phrenic setup that we have one
single person producing speech in
different personalities 10 months to
look at what personality factors what
independent factors can you extract from
the data if any are there different from
the ones that you think you find in
the psychology or depending on how much
data we have we might be able to do that
and you have merge the acoustic
information that we have here with some
textual information and see which is
more salient which is harder or easier
to extract and what does it for example
mean if the message that you're getting
from a the text channel doesn't match
the acoustic channel so if we had a if
you take the text that the actor
produced as a neurotic person and
synthesize it in a non neurotic voice or
have him speak it in a non oriC voice
thus that sort of sent mixed signals and
confuse users one beating the other so
there's a lot of things that you can
play with there and the computes might
have any questions
so I think Florida than we do
enjoying excelencia other West Carter it
was casting all your expectations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
