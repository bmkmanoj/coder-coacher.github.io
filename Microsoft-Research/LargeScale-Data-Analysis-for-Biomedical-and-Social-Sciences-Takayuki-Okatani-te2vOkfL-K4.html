you
very interesting that on doing jobs or
maybe last analysis or he purchased so
you can see that is a very profound
societal impact thank you for
construction my name is the weather and
its focus about it okay which is our
budget doing scenes from the years ago
and asked and surely i will show you my
poker face he is official action plan I
don't think I study but finished our
base what happened to magic the money
you without me merchants which is
available she was great hmm just before
Sioux Indian the he was actually the
largest no one Japan but the real
political hostage real Owens fortified
Nani goodbye
whole time and it kills killed almost
3,000 people anything and if there are
no silencer it's always like that Oh or
something like that and there are a lot
of people for students and how invert it
is standing the middle is the area and
actually powered diversities fortunate
Eastern folder across time so we but we
are so we over eager to contribute to
people are needy and the computer vision
researcher I ages of interviews and
Australia how fitting is nothing special
just it is the side portion we put 300
rupees car with GES señor and human
nation
be not you thought people would seem to
feel how disability because I village in
such I swing we deduct included
everything else and a half hour and we
and we study this project sorry I we
wanted to go
first week we don't have to treat and
apologies we update our data about right
so we do this every month support in the
protea now to put it all right or
develop lung and actually this is one
I and example which among heroes is so
you can see there is a trace joey is
just you know being a choice now use
either a student and happen
we have to
20 little bit in place even if you saw
her life in a pathology along and by
ok so this type of sleeping but you're
easier maybe somebody'd if you know
one you can't be the double degrees
sweet but most of the buildings retain
their chains so Japanese of this is
jeremiah maybe it's not purchase because
of this my advantage of this video just
buy a bit of big hugs orange polish
reconstruction focus or you can see the
main buildings are not among them are
still left untouched but
and it is over from it so it is my we
were to be we will approach somewhere
and die so easily over here working and
comic strip of this field so we look
like nature something makes it for
attention
so what came to my mind is quantified
damages or face of the cards and I think
we do inspire computer vision or we
consider which is used my powers to
model how he changeup is structured
option here when this type of woman has
not being studied much so in two studies
for wanting to achieve goals and
actually swing creaking about the same
images in your study for years
Electrical cannons and the first problem
of we oxidize detecting structure
changes of the same here we use to
initiative is chapter 25 times for these
two instances or longer to these
exchanges of the scene so what we do is
to the bone structure promotion for each
which he has to get three shapes and
then religious thought is to signature
construction but we shine
change and here these are winters is
innocent a structural change not too
immature change so my way is seen this
identity then compared to 10 feet to the
change I want it still ely program it is
not too early in the case of this energy
structure for r equal e and so what we
did is not least made explicitly as
negatives but focused on explanation of
whether the scene exchanges want changes
so we have made most convenient steps
but justified an invaluable possibility
changes that same structure eh eh
No
each
so
so they will change interesting but I'm
oh so now there will be some more I
think I equal ease using the future
so the method viewer
images which is very possible to show
the singular expression it's late
Oh
so are there other things that folks
like us at Microsoft could actually help
with this because there's other work
that we've done an image processing
booklet the aerial photography which we
would be a great overlay as a time
series in conjunction with the street
side panorama but also some of the other
previous work that's been done on the
street slide kind of view panorama to
make it easier along with some photos
sent photosynthesis photos that work and
some of the new work going on as well
because I think that you're absolutely
right for the connection of the time
recovery mapping it then with the social
and government data on what was put in
for reconstruction would be a very give
you a big picture of actually how the
reconstruction exactly how
