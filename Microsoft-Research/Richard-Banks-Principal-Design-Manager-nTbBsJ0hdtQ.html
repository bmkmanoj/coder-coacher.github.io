group microsoft research in cambridge
and we're we primarily focus on people
we start with ethnographic work so we go
out to people's homes and we video them
day-to-day doing their just their
everyday life asking them questions
about their home you know what they were
they typically do on the day and how
they spend their time with other people
and so on and based on the observations
that we see in people's real
environments we then come up with some
ideas for new things that we can design
and develop so my background is in
design so I trained an interaction
design of the Royal College of Art in
London so my focus if you like I think
of designers as producers of sketches
and prototypes around ideas so I'll work
with social scientists on the one hand
and I'll work with engineers and
developers on the other sound I think
we've moved into a phase where our
relationship with technology we begin to
understand is quite a subtle and in some
ways is all about simplicity and ease of
use and actually that's really really
hard to attain actually reaching into a
product and making it accessible and
simple and easy to use everyday is we've
come to understand is is way more
challenging than we might have thought
so you end up understanding that it
isn't just getting the engineering right
that matters it's at having that
emphasis on kind of the front end if you
like and the way that humans get into
this these systems really matters I
think Microsoft Research is a very
strong technology focused organization
and it's critical that we really have
the human component of that that kind of
relationship if you like in the devices
and software that we use every day
