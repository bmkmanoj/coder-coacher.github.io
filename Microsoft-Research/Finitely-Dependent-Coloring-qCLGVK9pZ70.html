you
okay welcome everyone I'm delighted to
see so many people attending the
Northwest probability seminar and it's
our annual Northwest event and I'm happy
to see that it's going so well mom I
have the pleasure of introducing the
first speaker actually are the first
speaker did a great job of introducing
himself other caller ID who is
representing a Microsoft at this mini
conference will talk about finally
dependent colorings although sorry just
one coloring please okay thank you well
wonderful to be here and see so many
people so what I'm going to talk about
is some new and rather strange and
mysterious object that we found
stochastic process I think it's fair to
say that we don't fully understand how
it works I mean we can we can prove a
lot of things about it but we don't
entirely know what's going on so
certainly be pleased to have any help
that anyone can offer on that so its
joint work with Tom Liggett and it's
dedicated to odo tram and I'll explain
why so the basic motivating question I
guess is do local constraint demand
global organization so I mean there are
lots of questions in real life that sort
of fit into that category I guess so you
do you need national banks to organize
financial transactions do you need
national borders and do you need central
planning of road networks or could you
just let road sort of evolved and
organize themselves like they did for
many centuries and of course I don't
have any answers to those questions and
but I want to talk about a very very
simple
clean mathematical question which is a
version of that general question and
before I state it formally I'm going to
just tell a little story I hesitate to
say application because it's not really
that realistic it's just a story and
imagine you have a network of machines
computers and simplest type of network
of all is just just a line integer line
and suppose you want to assign some
schedules to them say schedules for
updates when when the machines update
their software or something like that
and for simplicity let's say the
schedule is simply a day of the week so
you want to assign a day of the week to
each computer when it's going to do
something so maybe we just update them
all on Mondays but maybe that's a bad
idea maybe we have some local
constraints and so perhaps we have the
local constraint that adjacent machines
you don't want to update them at the
same time because maybe that creates a
conflict so maybe you want to update
adjacent machines on different days so
you could alternate Monday to esteem and
New Jersey and so now suppose I also
have a security constraint and my
security constraint is that I would
prefer adversaries not to learn too much
about my schedules and so the best way
to make something secret is to choose it
at random so I want to choose the
schedules in random at random in some
way and I want it to be the case that if
somebody finds out some of them then
they don't find out too much about the
others so for instance maybe they find
out the schedules of these two here and
I would like that that doesn't give you
too much information about the others
and now it's bound to give you some
information because if you know that
this one is Monday then because of the
local constraint you know that this one
cannot be monday next to it but maybe
you can hope that it doesn't give you
too much information about other
machines further away some some larger
distance away
um okay so let's just that's the story
let now let me turn it into a
mathematical question um so here's the
question arose from discussions between
myself and each I benjamini and Benjie
Weiss in 2008 so fixed integers K and Q
does there exist a stationary
k-dependent q coloring of the integers
and of course I will tell you what these
words mean so by a Q coloring I mean a
random sequence indexed by the integers
assigning a color which is just an
integer from one to q2 each integer
whole sequence is random and I want it
to be a proper coloring which means that
adjacent integers must have different
colors ok that's the local constraint
and stationary of course we all know
what it means if you shift by one to the
right say you sequence you get a
sequence with the same distribution and
the most interesting condition is K
dependence and this says if you take two
sets of integers which are more than
distance k apart then the the random
vector that you get very restricting to
this set is independent of the random
vector that you get I was written to
this set to you ignore ok guys in
between and you look at some set of
integers here and some set of integers
here then the colors I see over here
should be independent of the colors I
see over there ok search definition
clear and of course you know the integer
line Z is only one graph there are many
others and now have something to say
about other graphs later and proper
coloring is just one local constraint
and I'll have something to say about
other local constraints later as well
but it turns out that this simplest case
is also the key case in a certain sense
so ok so again the question is does
there exist a thing like this coloring
and it's Kate
and stationary so let's just try some
simple and in some cases foolish attempt
some things that won't work and so
suppose you just try to have identically
distributed colors for each integer you
had just have some distribution about
over the colors and you choose the my ID
so of course it's stationary and it's 0
dependent because anything is
independent of anything else but of
course it's not coloring because there
must be some color say color one that
has positive probability P and that
means you have probability P squared of
seeking to one's next to each other okay
so obviously doesn't work and let's try
something that obviously is a coloring
if you have two colors you can certainly
just have them alternating one two one
two well that's a deterministic sequence
that's not stationary but if I want to
make it stationary then exactly to
deterministic to coloring is where I
alternate red blue or alternate blue red
and if I choose this whole sequence with
probability half and this whole sequence
with probability half then of course I
have a stationary process but it's not
k-dependent it's not anywhere close
because if I know x0 I know whoever its
red or blue then I know exact for any n
so no way x0 + xn are independent there
one determines the other half and so if
that doesn't work and so another thing
that you might try which also won't work
is just make the coloring as random as
possible so just essentially choose
uniformly so to choose x0 to be a
uniformly random color and then choose X
1 to be uniformly random from the colors
that are not the same as X 0 and so on a
sequence and do the same going the other
way as well so of course this is just a
stationary Markov chain with transition
matrix so it's stationary and it's a
proper coloring but because it's not k
dependent for any K because you know you
can just compute given that I see a 1 at
0 you can compute the probability i see
a 1 @n and it's you know it's decaying
towards 1 over Q exponentially first but
it never
just 1 over Q so so so these two events
and never independent so that's not a
gay dependent so so that won't do and no
it's so thinking about Markov chains
still there are k-dependent Markov
chains so here's a one dependent Markov
chain just to understand the definitions
a bit better so the state of the Markov
chain is that you have four states and
this corresponds to having two coins in
your hands and the the move of the
Markov chain the step of the Markov
chain is you exchange the two coins and
you toss you re toss one of them say say
the coin that ends up in your left hand
so maybe you start with head head and
then the first step you just move this
coin down there and you re toss that one
so maybe it becomes tails now you have
tail head so that's the step of the
Markov chain and you keep going so has
some Penn Station matrix so this is this
is a one dependent process because as
soon as you've taken two steps you've
tossed both the coins so you've
completely forgotten where you came from
so x0 is independent of X 2 but more
than that all the pasta up to x0 is
independent of all the future from x2
onward so it's a one dependent process
but of course it's not a coloring
because you can perfectly easily make
the transition from head head to head
head ok so of course that doesn't work
so it turns out no Markov chain will
work and so no Markov chain no
stationary Markov chain can be a
k-dependent coloring so why is that well
if it's k-dependent then I mean what's
the what's the probability that you see
a particular color say color be
at time k plus 1 given that you saw
color a at time 0 well it's k plus 1 is
bigger than K these two events should be
independent so that should be just the
same as the stationary probability of
seeing color be so in particular it's
the same as the conditional probability
of seeing color be after k plus 2 steps
as well okay so that means the matrix
the transition matrix satisfies this P
to the k plus 1 equals P to the K plus
to learn that means the matrix satisfies
this equation so the eigenvalues of the
transition matrix are precisely 0 &amp;amp; 1
but perhaps with multiplicities on the
other hand if it's a cue coloring then
that means the the transition from color
to color a happens with probability 0 so
that means the matrix has zeros all
along the diagonal so that means the
trace is 0 but but the trace is the sum
of the eigenvalues the eigenvalues 2011
okay so that's impossible so we can't do
anything with Markov chains and for the
more you can say more so um Oded SRAM
proved that there's no hidden Markov
k-dependent q coloring what what does
that mean it means you have a Markov
chain on a finite state space the finite
state space is important and then X is
just some deterministic function of the
Markov chains it's just you collapse
some sets of states into what if you
want that gives you the poster so so
even that won't work there's no such
thing and and you know this covers many
things that you might think of like k
step Markov chains which is where you
know where you go next depends on the
last K steps and so on and Gibbs
measures with local interaction as are
just markov chains on the integer line
and so I mean this is proved by similar
ideas to the very simple proof I just
showed you but
in a more complicated setting so I heard
air tram as is well known to almost
everyone here central figure of his
generation in probability theory passed
away in a tragic hiking accident in 2008
and that this problem that i'm talking
about was actually he became very very
interested in and it was one of his
favorite problems in his last few months
with us so this is one of the reasons
that have been so keen to try to make
some progress on it to come up with
something that oded would have been
happy to hear and I think we've we've
succeeded as I will try to show you so
there's another potential source of
examples and and maybe this would be one
of the first things you would think of
in fact when I mentioned k-dependent
purposes so that's about a block fact I
so so suppose you I is an iad process
process of iid random variables on any
space and F is any function which takes
our arguments and we just let X I be F
of a block of consecutive views like
this so say obviously you have these
independent years and you take some
function of these three X minus one you
take the same function as those three
etc right so this is automatically going
to be a so it's called an hour block
factor of an iid process the process X
is so it's automatically going to be k
dependent for K equals R minus 1 because
if these blocks don't overlap with each
other then certainly the X is over here
are independent of the exes over there
now refers does this coin example I
showed you is actually a two-block
factor of a sequence of coin tosses
because
you can think of it as another another
way you can just think of a sequence of
fair coin tosses and then you just look
at the pair's look at this is head head
this is head tail turns out that's the
same focus but then there are other
examples which are not Markov chains
which which are really a new type so a
simple example is just take uniform
random variables uniform on the interval
0 1 they are and see which way the
inequalities go between them and write
down a 0 if the only quality goes this
way and the one if the indy quality goes
the other way okay so that's kind of an
interesting stationary process and it's
really a different type it's not a
Markov chain or hidden markov chain but
of course it's not a coloring because
you can perfectly easily have two ones
next to each other and so an hour block
factor is an hour minus one dependent
process because as i said if the if the
blocks are far enough apart then the
random variables are independent and and
you might wonder whether these are the
only k depended processes whether
there's an implication in the other
direction and this question so this is
nothing to do with colorings right now
it's just the difference between block
factor isn't k-dependent possesses and
so this question has kind of an
interesting history and so the answer is
no so there are counter examples and and
this was stated without proof in a
russian book by Ibrahim often linic in
1965 and they proved for Gaussian
processes that it is equivalent okay
after example and this question received
quite a lot of attention it was
explicitly stated as an open question by
a number of people and finally the first
published solution at least at was by
these people Anson guillotine and devel
kin 1989 so they they came up with a
counter example but it was kind of a
little bit of a strange indirect proof
and they asked for a natural example and
then there's been a whole sequence of
papers people trying to come up with
better more natural counter examples
there's a explicit Markov chain that
people came up with and then and one
back there is Burton Goulet and mr.
found a even a one dependent process
that's not an R Block factor for any are
and that's a hidden markov chain interns
that and there's another twenty papers
on this people trying to really
understand what the difference is here
and come up with more natural examples
and but the sort of the general belief i
think it was summed up by bothered in
diaconis and fulton and so in this is
particularly for one dependent process
as they said it appears that most
natural one dependent processes are to
block factors and so all these counter
examples that people came up with kind
of a bit contrived and it seemed like
the only the only examples anyone could
come up with were ones that were
specifically constructed for the purpose
of counter examples i think that's a
fair summary now this is interesting
because it turns out block factors will
not help with our question so no block
factor coloring exists for any r and n
eq and this is one of these results
where it's a little bit hard to know who
to whom to attribute it to that there's
essentially an equivalent result proved
by mo'nin or and 91 although stated in a
very different language from how i'm
stating it now you can argue it's really
a variant of ramses theorem but anyway
it's fact and in fact one contain more
so so here's a very clean statement and
interesting perhaps little-known
statement if you have any iid random
variables and you have a function of our
arguments which just takes finitely many
discrete values what up to q and you
look at the event that
f of you one up to you r is equal to f
of you two up to you r plus 1 then that
is strictly positive to any function and
and moreover there's an explicit lower
bound that you can write here very very
small low band but it's strictly
positive at the tower function and this
is essentially tight to this tower
function form there are examples that
are more or less like that and let me
show you why this is true ok I won't
prove the this power function but a bit
but i'll give you that i won't even show
you the proof but out to just tell you
the idea of it and from this slide you
if you went away and spent five minutes
you could reconstruct the proof and so I
just proved that it's positive so you
have a function and you have iid random
variables this is strictly positive and
it will be by induction on our the
length of the block and of course r
equals one is easy because the blocks of
just length one so f of e 1 and F of you
two are independent discrete random
vector so that's the argument a show
divider the beginning thing so the
inductive step is the following and at
least here is the key step and once
you've done this it's not hard to change
the proof and so I'll define a set a set
valued function of r minus 1 arguments
and what it is is you look at F and you
fix the first r minus 1 arguments and
you allow the last one to be random and
you look at which values which colors a
this can take with positive probability
ok you look at the set of all those
colors when you are with random and that
is a it's a set valued function of r
minus 1 variables so in particular it
takes at most 2 to the q values because
it's a set of the numbers of one up to q
and you apply the inductive hypothesis
to that
suppose you think of this as a block
function of a block of r minus 1
variables play the inductive hypothesis
to that and everything falls it and and
you can see why you would get this tower
function bound because in inductive step
I've gone from Q colors 22 to the cure
and you have to do this once for each
step in the induction okay so so back to
the question so is it possible that
there could be a k-dependent stationary
k-dependent q coloring and its really
looking like the answer ought to be no
at this point because we've tried markov
change we've tried hidden markov chains
they cannot work and we've tried block
factors they cannot work so that only
leaves these unnatural counter examples
that people really struggle to come up
with of k-dependent possesses that
aren't block factors and seems very
unlikely and so Oded actually proved
that it's not possible in the sort of
first non-trivial prepare case of K and
Q which is one dependent three colorings
so we saw a right at the beginning that
two colors isn't enough but three colors
in one dependent also doesn't look and
well Oh dad conjectured and I think all
of us who were thinking about the
problem at the time and agreed as well
with this conjecture that it's not
possible for any K and Q so oded even
reduced it to a problem of functional
analysis a see if this weird thing
exists then there's a Hilbert space with
some strange properties and whoops and
indeed there's no finite dimensional
space nizar f and denisof came up with a
complex hilbert space example but it has
to be a real Hilbert spaces that doesn't
help and so this was where the problem
rested for quite some years until I
started talking to my co-author Tom
Liggett at UCLA and and I hope he
doesn't mind me
sharing the story and I I told him about
the problem he was kind of interested
after a week or so he said I think I can
prove Oded theorem that there's no one
dependent three coloring he proved it
himself so I said great that sounds good
and he said that so now I'm going to
look at for coloring and then a week or
two later he said I think I can also
prove that there's no one dependent for
coloring and now i'm going to move on to
five colors and that sounded good and
then a few excited he said you know i
think there was a mistake in that last
proof and now i think there is a one
dependent for coloring and there was
very skeptical about this and and so we
managed to come up with this incredibly
complicated formula which i won't go
into but if you're interested in dick
words and linear extensions of post-its
then i can tell you about it afterwards
it's kind of interesting so what this
purports to be is a is the cylinder
probabilities for a one dependent for
coloring hey the finite-dimensional
distributions some weird formula and we
were able to prove that this satisfies
what it needs to satisfy for one
dependence and stationarity and being a
for coloring but what we couldn't prove
was that it was non negative it has to
be non-negative if it's a probability
and of course that's always the hardest
thing typically because it's an
inequality in ecology as much harder
than equalities often and you see it's
an alternating sum so it's not at all a
bit and we struggled for three years
over this we had all sorts of special
cases that we could prove we checked
billions of cases by computer and so but
we really couldn't do it until we found
another way which I'm going to tell you
about so there is a one dependent for
coloring and so number of consequences
in particular this old question about
the difference between block factors and
colorings now there's a beautifully
clean answer to it coloring can be done
by one dependent processes but not by
any block factor so that's very nice and
interesting and it answers some other
questions about
hidden Markov processes and this weird
Hilbert space exists I don't know
whether anyone cares about that now and
and and this previous complicated
formula I showed you is also correct and
that leads to a number of combinatorial
identities which I don't know how to
prove any other way interesting comment
or like this so that's the coloring and
um so here are some weird properties
that it has this is a very very strange
process we don't understand what's going
on fully it's symmetric under
permutations of the colors maybe not
such a big guilt if you you know you
exchange red and green and mentor cycle
so boom you at the colors anyway you
want you get to process with the same
law and here's something interesting if
you just look at the ones so if you just
look at the red say some process look at
the indicator of where you have a red
dot then that the following process you
take fair coin tosses and you look at
the places where you see head tail in
sequence perfectly nice places obviously
one dependent because it's a two-block
factor that's what the verbs are and if
you look at one or two so you look at
the places where you see red or purple
the indicator of that event that gives
you a process of zeros and ones and
that's this process that I told you
earlier where you take a ID uniforms and
you look at which way the inequalities
go very strange and and because of the
symmetry this holds for any pair so in
particular try to think of any process
on four colors so that if you look at
any one any pair of them ones and twos
or ones and three etc you get this
process so I no no I I know of no other
example and possibly this characterizes
the process we don't have a simple proof
of this really we conjecture that the
one dependent for coloring is unique
actually and this property is true for
any stationary one open for coloring to
the first
okay nevertheless despite all these
strange mysteries I'll tell you how to
construct the processor and it's very
simple I'll tell you two ways to do it
first one start with just iid uniform
colors uniform on 124 ok we know this is
a silly thing to do of course but now
i'm going to condition on something and
so I'm not just going to condition on
the event that this is a proper coloring
yeah so I should have said what I'm
going to do here is I'm just going to
tell you the finite dimensional
distributions tell you the Joint
Distribution of X 1 up to X n ok and it
will turn out that this is a consistent
family of distributions ok so first of
all lectures iod uniform colors now i'm
going to condition on a certain event
and the event is not just the event that
i have a proper coloring that would be
too easy that would give me the markov
chain that i started off at the
beginning instead I choose an
independent uniformly random permutation
of 1 up to n as well and I think of
these as arrival times i'm going to
condition on the event that at each time
the subsequence that has arrived so far
is a proper coloring and i'll show you
what i mean with the example so so here
are my colors and then they arrive at
these random times so at time 1 all i
see is blue at time to icy blue red
because the red guy a bike at time T I
see red blue red which is good time for
I see red blue red red and that's not
good because that's not a proper
coloring because I have two Reds next to
each other even though there were some
other things that we're going to arrive
in between doesn't matter so a condition
on the event that every time the
subsequence that I see so far is a
proper coloring so you see in this case
because they have two Reds next to each
other at the end no matter what
permutation I chose it wouldn't work but
but if it was a proper coloring then
might or might not depend
on the permutation so that's it a
condition on that event that gives the
correct lot of x 1 up to xn it's
obviously a coloring but is it obvious
to you that this is a one dependent
process it certainly isn't to me here's
it second construction here's an
equivalent way to do it and it's not too
hard to show that it's equivalent to
what I just told you start with a random
color uniformly random now i'm going to
insert extra colors so maybe i insert a
red to the left and maybe insert a blue
in between in the middle maybe answer to
read there so what's the rule the rule
is at any time you have these possible
slots where you can insert at the end
points or the internal slots and how
many possible colors are that you could
insert well at the end there are always
three possibilities if you want to make
a proper coloring and in the middle /
was too because these two colors a
difference there the two things that
could go there and you choose uniformly
from these possibilities down there so
you choose the position proportional to
the numbers 3 to 2 2 to 3 and then once
you've chosen the position you chose a
random color again that's it you you do
that for n steps you get a random vector
of length n and turns out these are
consistent distributions and they're the
ones I want and yeah well yeah it don't
have time to talk about the proof but it
but it is the proof that this works is
quite simple it's only a page or two E
and you you can express this probability
as the number of what we call buildings
which I permutations that work for that
particular coloring divided by the sum
of all of them and the denominators
something innocuous and there's this
lemma the number of buildings of X is
equal to the sum of the number of
buildings that you get by deleting the
elements one at a time then obvious if
you think about it because you just see
which was the last element that was
added and you just have to prove this
the number of buildings if you sum over
this color in the middle and you have a
word here in a way
here these are supposed to be
independent so you're basically going to
show it's equal to that product and you
just expand using this lemma you split
into some cases you use induction it
just works so what about other K and Q
so so here's a here's a very easy way to
get a three dependent three coloring
start from the one dependent for
coloring eliminate color for wherever I
see it and replace it with something
else replace it with just the smallest
number that's not represented among the
two neighbors so this is a block factor
of the original coloring it's a three
block factor because what I put here
only depends on myself and the two
neighbors so if you think about it that
means it's three dependent and it's a
three coloring so so that only we know
that one dependent three coloring can't
be done that only actually leaves too
dependent three coloring and we were
getting all ready to say this is a
interesting up from problem and then we
realized that can be done as well and
astonishing thing is and this just blew
me away the same process works so these
two constructions that I gave you their
equivalent you can do the constructions
with any number of colors you always get
a consistent family of distributions it
turns out so you get a coloring on the
end of July and with four colors it's
one dependent with three colors it's too
dependent with any other number of
colors it's not k-dependent for any K
very very strange there's something
absolutely magical about three and four
which we still don't fully understand is
that they're very few other colorings
k-dependent colorings known you can do
embellishments of these like the thing I
just showed you with the three colors
and there's one more family of examples
which hey if you won't have time to talk
about interesting properties of the
three coloring as well so that this
three coloring I just told you is just
the fork
conditioned to have no force at least on
a finite interval so why should that
work I have no idea but you but it does
it why should it work that if you take a
one dependent for coloring and you
condition it have no force you get a two
dependent process no idea except we have
the proof also if you look at the
locations of a single color one in the
three coloring those have a beautiful
and a beautiful form as well you take
these IAT use and you look at the peaks
you look at the place where the U is a
local maximum turns out that's what
process it is so remember this strange
thing about the for coloring that ones
and twos have a nice interpretation in
terms of the use so you would really
think there was some connection between
these three facts here the three
coloring is what you get by conditioning
the for coloring and this has this nice
probably with use and so and this is
another nice property with use I I have
proofs of each of the three things but
they're completely different and we
don't understand what the connection is
I'll skip that and I well I will skip
this then what do want know how to say a
word whatever wait one can one can
define more general local systems of
constraints coloring is just one
constraint but you can say you know on
windows of length 3 i'm only allowed to
see this finite list of things that
gives you what's called a shift of
finite type you can extend it some of
these things two shifts a finite type so
if you have any system of constraints
like that throw aside some degenerate
cases that don't matter then you
basically have the same thing you you
can satisfy it with a k dependent
process and you cannot satisfy it with a
block factor so there's an even more
remarkable answer to this old question
so any shift of finite type if you want
your process to do anything at all
non-trivial then you could do it with a
k dependent process and you cannot do it
with a block factor and we can say some
things about so you
as well but things are open and I don't
for that and have lots of open questions
uniqueness how many colors do you need
on ZD for a one dependent coloring we
know it's between 9 and 16 can you
express it as can you express one of
these colorings as a function of a
countable state Markov chain we know you
can't do it as a function of a
finite-state markov chain and on the
other hand any process can be expressed
as a function of an uncountable state
Markov chain shifts of finite type in D
dimensions is a big very complicated
array we didn't have much to say about
that but yeah I guess the bigger
question is just what's going on here is
there another way of thinking of these
processes that make the properties more
obvious so I'll stop there any questions
or comments oh really understanding
correctly that your construction doesn't
work for 45 colors because it's not okay
right the construction works so it gives
you a a stationary 5 coloring but it's
not k-dependent for any k so do you have
a construction then for larger number
that's a great question so yes so I mean
first of all there are some triviality
for coloring is a 5 coloring so it's
done and if you want positive
probability of each color then you can
just split a color you just whenever you
see color for you toss a coin in and
make it color 5 something okay but you
might ask is there a symmetric 5
coloring for example so metric in under
permutations of the colors the answer to
that is yes this is one of the things I
didn't have time to say but there we
managed to come up with a family of
symmetric one dependent Q colorings for
all Q greater than or equal to 4 and and
this we understand even less than the
other thing is that possible but it is a
pisser so that
not much more complicated recursive
formula for the probability in terms of
the things that you get by deleting one
symbol at a time with these are
chebyshev polynomials which can also be
expressed in terms of hyperbolic
functions with this word parameter and
so yes but we don't really understand
why it works it's not written under all
yeah symmetric under all permutations in
the car yeah the Englishman's comments
so this formula doesn't make sense for
curiosity ah right here we go see
there's some over 0 or something like
that you look even appeal no T is real
yeah yeah good customer but yeah yeah
 you go see it is exactly about
breaks down
well if there are no more questions or
comments let's aim under in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
