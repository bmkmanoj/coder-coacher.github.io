often is hampered by the inability for
scientists and their colleagues to
easily reproduce and augment each
other's experiments ideally scientists
want to learn what other scientists have
done create new ideas and methods and
then collaborate with one another about
research topics of mutual interest
finally coda labs community members may
wish to organize a competition around a
particular research problem so that the
community's best and brightest may
challenge one another to develop the
most effective solution finished
competitions can then be resubmitted as
new worksheets to begin the innovation
process a new
to learn more about coda live
experiments let's click on the
worksheets tab learn by examining
worksheets that were published by others
in the community the first worksheet
listed here is a natural language
processing experiment using the Stanford
core NLP toolkit at its core let's
examine this worksheet as we may wish to
edit this one in order to publish our
own experiments using similar elements
the worksheet is essentially a data
processing pipeline annotated with text
data input data output and executable
code used to operate on data or all
referred to generically as bundles by
scrolling up and down to view these
steps in this experiment we can get a
sense for what the author is trying to
accomplish in this experiment the author
is using the Stanford core NLP toolkit
to parse and tokenize text taken from
poems the author begins with a brief
written explanation of the experiment
and has added the first bundle in this
case some poems by Lewis Carroll click
show bundle content to see what poems
the author has chosen
there are two poems that are being used
as input the bat and the crocodile as
well as a shell script that was used to
upload the files selecting bat txt opens
to show us the contents of this file all
files contained within a bundle can be
inspected in this manner
in order to process the text files the
author has uploaded the Stanford core
NLP toolkit the second bundle which will
process the text files we saw earlier
contains the toolkit as well as the
scripts to upload in download data from
the coda website and finally a run
script which provides the desired
parameters for the core NLP tools to
process the text in addition to being
able to view these files we can click
the download arrow to download this
bundle to our desktop in this way we can
edit the files in the bundle directly
and make changes to them for use in our
own worksheets
the third bundle shows the results of
running the Stanford Corps NLP tools
against the Lewis Carroll poems in the
first bundle clicking on bat txt XML we
can see that the words from this poem
have now been output into XML which
shows tokenization part of speech and
entities in preparation for further
downstream processing here's more parse
text from bat txt XML now that we've
parsed the text thus making it easier
for a computer to process we'd like to
run another program against the parse
text in order to generate a
visualization that shows the part of
speech in the poem for this purpose
we'll use the viz program in Python the
code for which you can see here
you
once the author has run the
visualization program against the parse
text some HTML output is generated
by opening the HTML file we can see the
result of the part of speech
visualization program
hopefully this brief walkthrough of a
natural language processing experiment
hosted in a coda lab worksheet provide
you with a concrete example of how
data-driven researchers can use coda lab
worksheets to learn create and
collaborate community members can now
easily copy and modify this worksheet in
order to collaborate on different
approaches or create their own from
scratch and publish it to their peers
once it's ready to go the ease of
publishing and collaborating on these
data-driven experiments ensures that
coda lab will remain a vibrant learning
community for a long time to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
