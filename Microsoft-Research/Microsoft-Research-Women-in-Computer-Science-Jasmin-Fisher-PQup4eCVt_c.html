called computational biology and more
specifically what we are doing is
something that I refer to as executable
biology where we try to create these
executable programs like computer
programs but we're trying to create
computer programs that mimic aspects of
biological behaviors and specifically my
group is focused my work and my students
are focusing on developmental processes
and processes that are taking place in
in tumor development and in transit
I think it's one of the very few
professions when were there's no such
thing as routine every day something is
is new the other fascinating side is the
fact that once you have a new discovery
this is really a meaningful saying in
the sense that it really makes a
difference either in people's life or in
in terms of drug targets or a
therapeutic for certain disease so this
is the kind of science that really
allows you to make a difference in the
world
I started by studying biology for a
bachelor degree and then I did a
master's in biophysics and physiology
and then I continued to a PhD in urology
and then I did a shift to computational
biology and my postdoc and I did four
years of postdoc in computer science
working very closely with very strong
people in formal methods and I tried to
somehow bridge this gap that I have
because I don't have any formal
education in computer science but the
transition was was very natural to me
because for me as a biologist as an
experimental biologist it was just like
learning another technique in another
method the first thing would be
determination and the second thing would
be persistence and the third thing would
be trust in your instance we we came up
with some theory that came out of the
modeling work that we did of a certain
process about how cells make decisions
about their fate and it took us five
more years to prove the exact molecular
mechanism that explained that behavior
now where exactly at that time point
where everything becomes this
comprehensive story and we have a theory
and we have the evidence and we have a
molecular mechanism that explains the
theory and this is really exciting
because it really changes I would even
say completely revolutionized
the way we thought about the 7a behavior
this particular finding opens up a whole
spectrum for for not just stay the way
we look on this process but also for
potential therapies contribute in cancer
research surgery the implications are
really in far-reaching yeah this this is
really what makes me excited distance I
wanted to be an actress but that was
when I was really really young and then
when I grew up in my round when I was
about 16 I I kind of realized that I
want to become a scientist I always like
to do my own to the things my way and
take my own track and make my own
mistakes and I truly believe that this
is the right way to learn my main advice
would be to decide on on your goals
designed or your your path and to aim
high as high as you can and just go for
it that's what I would recommend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
