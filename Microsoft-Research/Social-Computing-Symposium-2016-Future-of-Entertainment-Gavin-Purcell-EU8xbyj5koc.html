academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
I'm a gapper saw it myself earlier I do
things like this from time to time but
like one on everybody so what I did here
I wanted to take you guys through
something I think it's kind of
interesting that we do unique which is
basically for those who don't know we
were coming tonight show which is you
know the largest late-night talk show
Jimmy balanced with host of it now for
almost two years I started with the show
in 2008 or 2000 yeah 2008 has hardened
2008 one of the basically the first
producer working on the show I helped
launch the show and the digital stuff
for the show so before that I was the
executive producer of attacked the Shoji
for which is a show that kind of bridged
the digital and television worlds kind
of before anybody else so anyway I got
into this business to do this stuff it's
fun it's interesting i've been doing it
for a while but i feel like in order to
give you guys a real sense of what i do
and what we do with the tonight show
that is separate from other shows I
thought what I would do is basically
take a 24-hour look at how we cut up our
show content and really see from a space
to space actual day-to-day basis what
we're doing with the stuff so the base
our basic sense of what we do in our
show is we have an hour of very very
high quality content I'm not bragging
just feel like we do a good show and
what I try to do is find and my team
tries to do i work with four people on
my team I'm ahead there's the director
of social underneath and then 30 people
underneath her and we take that content
cut it up into small pieces in different
platforms and really try to stay in
touch with our audience for 24 hours a
day so I'm going to go through starting
at five o'clock a show taping which was
last Wednesday show the guests were
Billy Joel and JK Simmons on the show
and I'm just going to show you guys what
we do from a day-to-day basis 24 hours
and just kind of that's the the basis of
what this will be here so starting at
five I hope by the way also i know
there's no PowerPoint this is a this is
a word doc and some tags so I apologize
for that okay so if I have a clock when
the show tapes I'm
on the floor with our one of our other
producers in the middle of the show
taping but our digital team is upstairs
there's four of them and they're in the
middle of pulling video as it happens
from the show server creating gifts
creating image sets be used during a
live tweet we'll get to that in a second
that's happening from 5 to 6 15 my
personal experience in the show as I'm
down there with Jimmy's desk and so
we're sitting on the stage I'm in
communicating with Jimmy via i am
telling him like what the time cues are
letting him know what's going on we'll
go up to his desk in between the brakes
and then he'll go up and talk to the
audience before the band every night i'm
shooting at six-fifteen that night a
really cool thing happened we do
commercial promos every night where
Jimmy tops to the audience with the
guests and they'll say to the local news
anchors he'll say hey lace you know hi
New York Chuck and Sue tonight we've got
JK Simmons and Billy Joel well that
night Billy was there with his band JK
Simmons and JK Simmons to talked about
the wanting to sing the longest time
with Billy Joel and suddenly that just
happened so this is something that
happens every once in a while on the
show happens off camera or at on camera
but off air like not for the show
actually so we decided hey this is
something that happens from time to time
we made a piece of content out of it and
we say well we want to get this uploaded
to YouTube along with everything else
that happens that night so for this
night we wrote the title description we
make gifts of that video and have it all
ready to go for the live tweet as well
okay and then from 615 to 5 6 45 the
blogging team is starting to go through
this week's hashtag contest and kind of
like Jason show we have been doing a
thing on our show called late night
hashtag well now it's called Tonight
Show hashtags for about five years now I
think it was one of the first user
generated content in mainstream media
clearly not in in you know internet
media but one of the first at least
mainstream media things so this week's
was worst first date which turned out to
be a really good one I'm having her I
can't get like the full look of this
year but uh oh shoot hold on sir yeah it
was a good one it worked out really well
okay when we go back to my pages here
now then we get our email that there's a
whole bit ops team not that interesting
then there's a preview for the night's
episode so let me see if I can bring
this up here
guys can look at it well not on the
internet here a second is it as the
internet connections down okay well
anyway there's a video preview for it
then we spent a lot of time drinks to
the live tweet happens every night so
every night from 12 11 30 to 12 31
member of my team is awake tweeting with
members of the audience so every night
there's somebody there who's connecting
a real time real person with a real name
not just the show name who's interacting
with the audience so you'll see things
like this tweet which is oh that's the
problem what that's the preview but it
won't be able to see it but anyway
that's the preview video look like then
okay so this is noah is one of our live
treaters so he was there this is the
tweet that he pushed to push out the
start of the live tweet and during the
live tweet he also pushed out he's
content from the show we do a bit every
week where the NFL we make fun of NFL
players we basically give them high
school superlatives so this was the guy
who was most likely to have sneezed
himself into puberty the idea is that
Noah then created this piece of content
with the you know the nose and the in
the breath of air up there and that
became someone we pushed out to our
twitter handle our twitter handle has
three point i think five million
followers now so it's a pretty big
audience and that's the show twitter
handle and then also what happens during
that show live tweet is that we've
created this one piece of content this
was from our show every night we have
one piece of content that we post early
on the internet so as the show airs
during there's one piece of content that
we will go on to youtube with at like
twelve o'clock this one particularly was
Jimmy and Billy singing The Rolling
Stone beasts of burden you can also see
the way we've crafted the tweet is it
has gif attached to it just to make a
little bit more visually interesting and
then this is also a big thing that
happens during the live tweet is our
audience responding to our audience and
having interactions with them that's
really important thing for us to feel
that the audience to feel like we're
there and we're talking to them it's
hard when you're working traditional TV
to be like so you know it's such a
one-way street in a lot of ways so this
opens up a lot of different
communication pathways it allows us to
kind of get instant feedback on how
things are happening I'm not sure if any
you guys
complaining on facebook video but the
Facebook and Twitter audiences are so
different and like we get really
interesting reactions to videos that are
pushed on YouTube versus Facebook
certain people facebook hates certain
people YouTube hates and it's a really
interesting thing to see just the
different audiences there anyway this is
more of that interactions here and then
so Facebook so also that night the video
gets posted on Facebook another thing i
want to point here on facebook is that
our show really spends a lot of time
commenting on both facebook and youtube
as well and one of the things that's
very valuable about that is that it
helps bring the it helps rise those
condos to those comments up so it can
kind of push down some of the more kind
of garbagey stuff and I I'm you know I'm
a big fan of like interactions but
obviously sometimes there can be kind of
crazy things that happened in comments
basa talked about but that's one thing
we try to do is comment on those
platforms as well okay so I know I'm
taking a while but I'm just rip through
this stuff okay live tweet happens okay
then then one of the bloggers sends out
at 1am the recap at the live tweet they
did then to get to sleep the next
morning we have somebody who's on the
opposite schedule so I not like I
promise I don't run like a horrible
labor practice that those people are on
separate schedules so that person gets
up at six o'clock they're at work there
in the middle of going through the same
sort of stuff and then they post things
from the morning on so there is a break
from like one to six but that's about it
for us so you know we're basically on
from let's say six a.m. until 1am we're
creating content in some way on the
internet so then from 730-10 a.m. we're
doing all that stuff snapchat which
somebody talked about a little bitches
and talk about earlier we're getting a
lot more into that we snap out the
guests every night in addition we have
videos that the guests help create with
us that's a big thing so we see from 10
to 1030 respond to messages a lot of
that stuff there's a production meeting
I'm in charge of every 10 45 or a day
that I'm missing right now that's just
fine with me to be honest with you as
well then we have a thing that we do
every Wednesday called tickets at 12 so
again these are just a selection of some
of the stuff that happens on a
day-to-day basis there's a lot more
kinds of things that we do but this is
just kind of a taste so one thing that
happens we do this thing where so
there's our image set from the thing as
well so every Wednesday we have a thing
called hashtag tickets at 12 where you
can go into the city somewhere and find
our tickets to The Tonight Show they're
a hot ticket people wait a couple months
to get them some time so this is
something we've a fun thing to do we use
snapchat to kind of set up the location
and then we will also pay it off with
the person that won it this guy found
them where we were going and with this
so this is that we send an internet with
the tickets they're there so that's how
it works just a fun thing we do on
wednesdays then we pick the clips from
the show last night to put onto facebook
we answer questions on Facebook answer
Twitter questions and then we start
engaging with things that have happened
the night before with other people on
the internet so one of the things that
happened that night has happened a lot
with the fit with the football players
is that the football players or the
team's themselves discover this pearl it
is going to interact with us so there's
a back and forth so the Seahawks
actually where I'm from Seattle so I'm a
big Seahawks fan and I had the
connection with these guys but they're
very active in our reactions to to our
tourists purlins bit also they made an
entire video featuring their players
doing super loads of Jimmy which was
really funny so those guys do a lot of
back and forth with us and then you know
individual players also unfortunately
this is a guy who missed the field goal
this week and so I feel bad for him but
the individual players go back and forth
as well on their Twitter handles which
is kind of a cool ways to extend that
the the bit okay then get announced
tickets for nerds I'll get through the
rest of stuff pretty quickly 1230 we're
also you know this show handle Jimmy is
really amazing on social I mean
obviously you guys know who he is and
he's been doing it for a long time I was
lucky enough to work with him in the
very beginning of when we started and I
was lucky enough to kind of get him on
Twitter and talk about Twitter but he'd
really took it on and it does his own
thing and and so now he doesn't he uses
it really as a platform to him to talk
to his audience and to me it's it's an
amazing transformation of how
celebrities are able to discuss things
and talk directly to their audience and
Jimmy's used in a real interesting way
so anyway any time something like he won
the People's Choice he tweeted about it
the show will then retweet stuff that he
does and they'll find ways just to push
out to make sure everybody can see it
another thing we do if you don't know on
YouTube there's a way you can use the in
video player to promotional to on
YouTube where you can change if while
you're watching a video you get a little
slug that comes up kind of like an honor
graphic that let you go to a video
that's feature we use that every
probably every day or every other day
a change it with whatever we think is a
big popular video it drives a lot of
additional views for us we update the
snapchat story at 130 update more
comments then we have guests pitches so
we do individual guest pitches for the
web every mostly every night so we'll do
small one on one kind of video blog
style interviews with guests in addition
to the stuff that Jimmy does on camera
those are web only and it does do pretty
well as well more talking blah blah blah
let's see I'm trying to get through here
then another clip to Facebook we've been
posting videos to facebook pretty often
and just as a room kind of discussion
facebook video is giant it's not going
to go away it's something really
important to pay attention to for us I
don't really were talking about what
snapchat is like its facebook is a
little bit better but not entirely yet
like it's still a little confusing but
it's definitely made an impact on us so
it's something important to be aware of
and I think what's interesting about
their I mean obviously Tim knows that
YouTube is a very mature platform in a
lot of ways there's a lot of interesting
analytics we really love the analytics
we get out of YouTube Facebook is not
that way in some ways and I think
they're coming along in a really good
way but it's really important for
everyone to pay attention to because
just the audience size is so massive and
then we're back at four o'clock again
and we're preparing for the show so
that's just a small kind of like snippet
of what we do on a week-to-week base our
day to day basis and the one thing that
we're really lucky to have is we're a
you know a five-day week show I always
say that the late night shows are
particularly are very lucky in their
very beneficial of this internet social
space because we are essentially a
Content factor no that's not and he's
not good thing necessarily but we're
making we're making an hour of content
every day and it doesn't stop and for us
it's it's addressed drag sometimes it's
fun but like the greatest thing about it
is there's always going to be something
for somebody out there in the world of
these people what we do so we have the
ability to keep pushing stuff out if
you're on a limited series or say you're
on mister robot which is amazing you
have a much smaller window of things to
work with so your marketing is a much
different set of marketing than what
we're going to do and how you're going
to do social is much more than I think
and I'll probably talk about that too
but for us we are able to kind of do
this blitz on a regular basis and
hopefully not annoyed too many people so
that's it I think you have any questions
thank you Kevin
I'm wondering to what extent does things
that you think will perform well on the
web drive the type of things that you do
on the show I'm thinking of like the
lip-sync battles and the like reading
the stories that kids have written given
the titles of things that have done
really really well in the web are they
kind of you design them to do well on
the web well you know it's that question
comes up a lot I think that the answer
the general answer I give is no like I
think in general what we do on our show
is we create what we think is going to
be interesting content the lip sync
battle i think is is it is it is an idea
that could have been done on Steve Allen
show you know I mean you could watch
that same exact idea in the exact same
way and if you watch Dean Martin do and
how amazing would that be right so it's
like the same idea hashtags is a
different thing right hashtags is
something that we did kind of create to
think about how could we use Twitter in
an interesting way and that was
something that came out of the idea of
an interactive experience but in general
I think people talk about do go to
create video to make viral videos or
what's your secret and actually one
thing I was talking about earlier i
thought would be interesting to hear a
conversation about is that i really
believe there's no such thing as a viral
video i mean there are there are viral
videos but i should say it's impossible
to make a viral video right like that
and i think people forever have had this
kind of idea but to me you just have to
make the best possible thing you can I
think part of why our show works so well
in the Internet is that we're speaking
to a different audience than the older
audiences used to be so whereas say J or
Letterman's shows those audience doesn't
have the same sort of cultural
touchstones that are did ours do and
that's why I think it's a more internet
savvy I guess is that I would look at it
a quick question of curiosity the qu
said these different channels have very
different experiences and different
reactions your goal to have a coherent
voice across all of them or do you have
different people working creating
content or so my our my goal for our
show stuff is to have a coherent
creative voice but I think the tool sets
and and the kinds of things that that
voice is expressed and are very
different so for instance like snapchat
voice are our voice of our show I think
if you don't already know is like kind
of playful fun and joyful right Joe is
what we kind of take as what The Tonight
Show should really bring into your life
right so how do you how do you create
joy across the symbol you know for for
tumblr its image sets right so its image
sets with with like photos or something
for Instagram it's my it's a single
image of something with you know with
text on it or not like it's just about
how you find those different ways that
the platforms can be cut up in different
things it's that by the way snapchats
such an interesting thing because it's a
completely new version of that and like
still trying to figure out what that is
and what that experiences is a
phenomenal interesting thing
yeah in the context of the previous
conversation do you attempt to
independently monetize the digital
component or is it just the monitor
you're just pushing the show itself we
from the very beginning of our show
there's a bunch of different ideas on
that when I first started with the show
which was in 2008 Jimmy and I were on
the same page now we just really wanted
to more than anything get our show out
there and uses a marketing platform all
all those tools marketing platform and
it was great for us but NBC at the time
didn't believe in that so it was a
different regime than is in there now
but those guys were really not into the
idea of giving away and their quote
unquote content to for marketing
purposes that said there's a bunch of
new people that have come in here to our
company in the last five years for years
who are really smart and understand the
marketing platform of it as well too and
they were really good about that and I
think now we're reaching more of a
balance because you know we just started
monetizing YouTube and there are things
that are getting monetized out there so
it's for us as show producer for me it's
all about audience and all about growing
and again it goes back to that thing was
where we're very lucky to have the
immense amount of content available I
always believed that the great thing
about what we have is if I you see a
video if you watch that Billy Joel video
and you didn't see it on the air to me
that's okay because you might the next
night watch remember to watch our show
and the fact that we're on every night
and that we're creating something people
should talk about appointment TV like an
appointment TV being like 830 on
Thursday night all I want you to
remember for us is that we're on every
United 1130 so that's a much easier
appointment to make you know I mean one
night a week or one night every two
weeks that's valuable to me versus the
other people had to have you show up
every thursday for those eight weeks
straight and then they were on repeat so
it's a little different for us
are you just to follow up to that you've
been able to measure the impact of this
stuff on how many people actually view
the show well so here not it's so weird
because it's hard to ever and I don't
you know the ratings thing is such an
interesting question if you never really
know all I can say is there's been a
significant atrophy in the space in
general and I think we've held up pretty
well so I don't know what that means
exactly in terms of real numbers but
like our time yeah well I sell out of
real numbers on TV are pretty good for
what our spaces in general so I
attribute that to the idea that we're
doing some of this stuff and we had a
lot of success in it I don't I I can't
scientifically say x equals you know
this thing but I hope that that's the
case and our numbers have not gone down
I think most people would think if this
were a disaster and it wasn't working by
giving away the farm it was good i think
it would undercut the entire media
business in our world and for us it has
it it's helped us so that's all i can
kind of look at a curious kind of
related to that you're in an institution
that sees its job is making a television
show right but there's some part of your
audience that is you know they're going
to see a kid's instruments video on
youtube and they're going to follow you
know like Amir and Tariq on on Twitter
and that's kind of their only access for
you as like from a creative standpoint
if that's the only access points that
somebody has and they never tuned in at
eleven thirty or they never DVR is that
still an audience that like you care
about and you want to reach and that's
not spying I think so because is that
the future is that part of these well
here's the thing i think it's a part of
my job at this show i think is kind of
future proofing what we do i have to
think about like where that audience is
gonna be and that's what i think a lot
about and you know i'm like we were just
I'd wreak black thought the rapper from
the roots is just like kind of gotten
very active on Twitter and I think
that's awesome right he's he's like such
a cool guy and he's kind of been behind
the scenes for a while whereas you know
Ahmir Questlove has been like kind of
out there and in the face of those guys
but to me the more that we can raise the
profile of those people the better
because that's the people that people
represent our show like We Are The
Tonight Show but truthfully the sideshow
is really Jimmy first and foremost and
then the roots as well like that those
personalities are what drive you
want to come back to the show to me The
Tonight Show brand is not as important
as like how people feel about Jimmy or
feel about trigger or request and those
kinds of things help bring people back
to the back to the show on a regular
basis
one day I'd sort of like to point out
that is sort of obvious but ignore it is
this is a humor show yes okay humor is a
purpose of humor is essentially social
I'm thinking of course in the psychology
of humor we laugh 30 times more when
we're with people and alone when so
humor is an ideal environment for these
social networks and traditionally that
when you look at humor if you look at it
like the source source of humor and the
person who responds okay it's like a one
directional thing I'm the source let's
say on TV you're out there in the
audience and that's it now then you go
to thing we are Oh the respondent can
respond to the source back and forth
that's conversation and that's how you
know when we laugh about every 10 or 20
times the normal conversation when you
keep Diaries of it you don't even
realize how much it's happening so
that's social then when you amplify that
by the sort by there being a whole
network of the sources here a whole
network of respondents and that's why I
think humor basically is such an
important sort of phenomenon here for
social networks because it really it
really creates the ideal environment
where first of all people can comment in
a in a very relaxed way right and and
the feedback is constant so that's what
I think is really personally happening
here which is why this type of stuff is
exploding oh sure I think that you know
and it's both on the other side of it
it's also why criticism and anger is
also exploding right like it's it's the
same sort of things it's people's
emotions i think that they want to feel
something and I think this and I hope
that we are able to like engage people
in a way that that same sort of stuff
does that thing
I know you know I think your truck down
the competence right yeah because you
start to get you start to get sort of
the Gresham's law of commons therapy
with the way the band's be definitely
that you know you get comments of all
across the board i think we are try we
always try to stay positive and just
engage with positive people because
that's just the way it has brooke for us
but yeah you definitely get both sides
of thing I mean anything any online
conversation you have you have that
thanks everybody I appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
