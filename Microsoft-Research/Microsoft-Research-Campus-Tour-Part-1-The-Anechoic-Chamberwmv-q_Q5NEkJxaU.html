Microsoft campus tour Larry Larsen gets
a very special look at Microsoft
Research with general manager Kevin
Schofield now this tool was so extensive
we had to break it up into three parts
so make sure you stick around for part 1
part 2 and part 3 let's check it out
hi I'm Larry Larsen and we're here in
building 99 Microsoft Research and we're
here with Kevin Schofield GM of MSR and
this is a great space tell us a little
bit about this welcome it's great to
have you here in building 99 we've been
here about three years we got to work
with the architect designing a space it
worked really well for a research
organization that's open and
collaborative and spontaneous he comes
up with ideas and people run each other
a hallway so you see lots of big open
space we can spot people from all over
the building
they've got you know comfy chairs and a
cafe area where people is actually a
working space people can work in each
other you know we've got lots of smoke
glass walls where if you run into
somebody in the hallway you can just
start scribbling mathematical formulas
on the wall great it's a really great
open space and we're gonna get a very
exclusive tour here a place that most
people can't really get into yeah we're
gonna see our anechoic chamber where we
do sound testing we're gonna see our
hardware lab where you do hardware
prototyping we're going to see some new
interesting prototypes of surface
computing kinds of devices that we're
just sort of experimenting with the
research on all these things but you
know will down the road hopefully some
of the stuff will end up in product
someday great let's go check it out
great
to go inside the anechoic chamber is it
with Yvonne Tasha is one of our
researchers disallowed an audio related
research fascinating stuff that actually
is shipping a little short leave now and
I'm connect great well let's go take a
look all right I'm here at the van
Tasha's from the anechoic chamber in MSR
and tell us a little bit about what an
anechoic chamber is and what you do here
so anechoic chamber is a room which
models absence of room inside we have a
complete silence and this walls absorb
the sound so we don't have the
reverberation the sound bouncing from
the walls and ceilings and this allows
us to simulate situation when we can
measure the directivity patterns of our
acoustical devices microphones
loudspeakers and to do precise
estimation in tuning of our sound
capturing and sound processing
algorithms but without further ado let's
go inside alright so actually we're in a
in a concrete cube which sits on 1/4
thick rubber so we don't acquire
vibrations from the street from the
ground
three way we don't touch the room the
building anywhere and you see those
edges when the sound goes and it kind of
reflects like this and it is absorb it's
inside so we are in a complete silence
here it's the sound level is way lower
than a pin drop it's perfect environment
for measuring acoustical devices
microphones this is work we do our work
and the paradox here is that the fight
with noise environment actually starts
in complete silence for humans being
here strange thing happens the first who
I sound weird there is no noise and most
importantly there is not the first
reflection from the ground which is an
important cue for distance so I'm kind
of stay somewhere second is if you keep
silence here after
two three minutes you start to hear
noise in your ears this is the blood in
your vessels and after a couple of
minutes you start to hear your heartbeat
so then after 10 15 minutes there is
information deprivation the brain dies
which is a pattern matching machine
tries to match that noise with something
you have heard and as a result you start
to hear stuff things you have heard and
the brain matches them with the segments
of the noise so we are not going there
but let me do a little experiment here
I'll Club and you see how dry is this
sound there is absent that juicy
reverberation there at the end which
will repeat will hear when you repeat
the experiment outside if you guys want
you can scream first it sounds weird
second nobody can hear us okay now we
can go outside and see what was actually
created and measured it here okay so one
of the devices we created here is
so-called microphone Airy support for
Windows Vista microphone array is a
device which looks like this it's
nothing else but for microphones or more
Tooty for more than one microphone
usually in a line but they can be at
different configurations what gives the
microphone array more than a single
microphone is the sense of direction so
pretty much when the sound comes from
that direction it reaches the
microphones one after one and we can
measure this distance so this allows us
to distinguish when Kevin is talking
from the moment when you talk and this
allows us to do additional additional
separation and removal of the noise and
the reverberation so here is the
experiment I promise it inside the sound
capturing room to the anechoic chamber
the club so you see how after the that
sharp signal we hear the reverberation
this is good
when we were here but this is bad when
you captured this through a microphone
and send it to a telecommunication went
to the other room because here we as
humans and to two years which is a
microphone array by the way in a hundred
billion neurons between those two years
we can use those special cues in
separate remove the noise and listen
towards the given direction one
microphone one telephone line
you go and play this in a different room
those special cues are gone so we hear
the reverberation the brain tries to
remove it cannot get started and as a
result this increases the fatigue we get
tired faster when you listening
attending a meeting in a using a
speakerphone to do this we have to
remove the reverberation leave the noise
and this is one of the devices which
allows us to do so for many of us speech
recognition is a something when you are
a head separate call spot microphone and
you do dictation which may or not may
may or may not work it's a kind of a
more geeky thing
microphone arrays as a sound capturing
devices allow us to do a hands-free
sound capturing which means we can be a
certain distance and the microphone
array fights the reverberation finds the
noise and provides you a NAPLAN signal
to the speech recognizer so you can
basically do voice commands or even play
some games so this is the second demo
let me show you a game which is a model
fast approaching the category is showbiz
come on vivo it's a game okay let me do
this one National Geographic Channel
correct yeah are so many times training
the guys oh this time I'll let you guys
to solve the problem don't forget to
raise your hand
above and beyond Wow
so this is pretty much it as you can see
there has it sound capturing systems
allow us to do a lot of more stuff to
open the door for scenarios and
thinkable let's say couple of years ago
to let people to feel free to
communicate with their computers in a
different way not just using keyboard
and mouse but using the voice and voice
actually is important component but not
the only of so-called natural user
interface what we try to achieve by
improving the voice recognition in the
sound capturing is to provide the
important component of so-called
multimodal user interfaces the way we
will communicate with our computers in a
mixture of gesture Mouse touch voice
everything in its mode which is the best
the most efficient the most convenient
for the users
Wow so we've seen some really cool
things here today what happens after the
the big problems are solved what's the
next path for these things well we work
really hard with Microsoft product
groups you know really cross the board
Windows Office Xbox all the product
groups to try to make sure we get sort
of this constant flow of sort of
state-of-the-art and new technologies
into all of them and it's really a
partnership it's about sort of defining
a really good complementary relationship
well thank you for the tour and my
pleasure
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
