in our day-to-day lives here in the
information age which means that we have
an entire world of information
accessible to our fingertips what this
means is that you know as the you know
as we can access knowledge just woulda
monetization of knowledge so that we're
not learning from experts and ivory
towers such as professors at
universities we're learning from each
other we're learning from our peers what
this means that there's been a real
acceleration of innovation as people
share in these contexts within
communities up in a billion each other's
work which is really striking in epcot
on the evolution of ideas unfortunately
we're not fortunately but a lot of these
learning communities are really
definitely they're still sort of highly
motivated self-starter who are fighting
each other and sharing and so an
interesting question for us is how do we
how do you sort of get other people
involved with learning process with our
money from each other the cessation of
motivation it becomes really important
then we're talking about informal
learning online we're really talking
about what's going to want to be a media
to go online and take the time to
actually learn something new a lot of
variables that can go into you
motivating people to learn i like it
definitely is something that's extremely
important is developing able to develop
a sense of captioning or relatedness to
other people and everyone emphasizes
quiet because this is where we can
really begin to see or social media
plays a very important role so giving
people a sense of
connection to each other through your
extended networks exposing them to their
interests really motivate people to
learn new topics online is this really
brings me to describe them social which
is a project sotl and so that's CL what
is the product that you probably can we
had a few slabs we're really exploring
these issues and how can we help you
integrate search you have access to the
entire internet combine that with
sharing and in the contents of your
networks to help inspire and motivate
people to learn you top it so to give
you an idea this is what it looks like
what I login you can let them search at
the top this is opposed that I made
based on my browsing the internet it's
like an put you second thanks and then
I'm sharing with people you know some
sort of a twitter-like model of
following people follow me and I found
them you can converse around these
topics you know their feet and it's
really oriented around helping people
discover each other around new topics
connecting around those topics and then
being inspired by by each other you know
that's really cool with it you know
there's more proudest really into
animated Japan you know what does that
mean and I was really interested me I
want to learn more so we deployed social
in fairburn summer just a few weeks ago
who are you extending this group of
university students who've been using it
for the past couple of months like
really trying to get it understanding of
their existing learning practices and
how easy soldier can actually impact
them people was really interesting today
it is definitely keys that you know we
asked them how do you learn how this
your primary source of information they
are the web the web is where they learn
already and then do their friends and
then to their captions and social
working like Facebook just as important
as email or cell phones or anything else
as a place where they learn in high rate
with their fellow students over the
course of its use again we have these
students use it for a couple months we
saw a lot of a lot of mysticism people
are connecting a right on common
interest you know here they're cheering
you know recipes for halloween pumpkin
carving drugs Apple I mean obviously
want to encode it at all like how web
how are they expressing in what are they
getting here and self-expression is
extremely important part of the sort of
searching behavior that were surveyed
like I'm searching to share about myself
my interest in you don't connect around
them um really interesting phenomena
probably expecting that emerge there's a
lot of riffing so one person might do
something like CG art of the next
response or bill of that sort of
building or elaborating on that I p.m.
and so over time we actually have this
sort of a collaboration of ideas that's
actually really exciting to watch it I
think that uh should agree to style your
on common interest that's pretty cool um
as if you know I has we were going
forward and thinking about into a
informal learning online there's a lot
of variables that go into successfully
motivating a community to learn and then
because you're learning from each other
innovating as a community need about
these models and how we can really love
our social media to inspire formal
learning and I and everything will
emphasize
the sense of play is extremely important
so we're learning it was fun when in the
world and learning is about fun fun and
play that's what we really find that
this is actually how people do you want
to spend their time online is learning
from each other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
