about the need for and sort of strategy
about building shared resources that bot
developers can use so we talked a little
bit about I think to primarily two
topics primarily so one being like a
collaboratively curated open-source set
of training data or like utterances so
just things like you know 5,000
variations on how to say yes or no or
stop or help so everybody thinks that
that's probably a good idea either for
use in like straightforward pattern
matching or you know training you know
bootstrapping your training training
data and then the other thing was
establishing some way of sort of showing
people the basic must-haves or like good
patterns that your BOTS should should
exhibit so ranging from things like
onboarding patterns like positive
onboarding patterns to things like you
know primitives for collecting certain
data types like a like a date or I guess
know or a disambiguating you know an
input that needs to match a list so I
think the outcome was basically I'm
going to create a couple of github repos
and like seed it with some stuff and I
will post them in the botanist chat room
and various other places and we'll just
get this this going so if anybody knows
of these things that already exist
please you know feel free to share them
and there's some of that stuff that's
already built in like hidden away in
people's deep dark you know ten years
ago they built it and never never
released it so now the time to share
that stuff
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
