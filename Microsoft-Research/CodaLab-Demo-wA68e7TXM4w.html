field correspondent I've labeled her the
senior roving Hall corresponding
Josephine Chang news out there on the
hood floor to experience some of the
great demos for her so lutely senior
because you hear the buzz around me
that's because there's more than a
hundred people in here now for demo fest
they actually get to lay their hands on
the actual products like Cortana or lab
of things and we are fortunate to have
Evelyn's villegas here with us and
you're going to demonstrate something
called coda lab so briefly explain what
code 11 Thank You Josephine so could a
lab is an open source platform for
machine learning research which allows
you to learn from other researchers to
share data and code and also to create
experiments and collaborate with others
that's one aspect and the other aspect
is about being able to use some
benchmarking bike racing competitions so
let's see what you mean let's say that a
researcher comes to your site and then
what one today this is where you come
this is food a lot org and then I'm
going to show right now what aspects
which is the first aspects about
worksheets what we call worksheets which
is about sharing data sharing code and
really about doing an experiment and
showing others how you went about
solving our problems so for instance if
I look at the specific worksheet which
was created by Percy Leon which by the
way for a kill this morning Brazilian is
from Stanford University and she might
not be award winner right like you and
so his vision on faux pas de la really
comes from a person who is sort of a
community late so this is just an
example this Lewis Carroll poem and what
this is just an example so here actually
what you do is like you just for this
example I want to see how I'm going to
take a poem some text and I want to toss
it in the feet of natural language
processing so i can describe what i do
so somebody else can come and do exact
what i'm doing so are saying you mean to
like figure out either what it means or
to analyze exactly sources if you look
at this little text here what we're
going to do is just
decompose mistakes in terms of figuring
out what are the tokens what are the
words what are the observed denounce the
actions events and so funny that's a
funny poem twinkle twinkle little bat
how I wonder what you're at up above the
world you fly like a tea tray in the sky
now do you want to know where the
determiners the nouns verbs are okay so
I want to know what the poem means was
what I'm going to show you today is just
like you can actually use some libraries
from somewhere else in the world and
apply them to your problem so that's
what we do here for in some of these
libraries you discuss the process you
can put some metadata so that other
researchers and actually we do what
you're doing that's really about
introducing a research what I'm going to
show you like you know we also have a
command-line interface which means that
you can run it and then you can actually
then provide some output fear if I
manage to get there and which gives you
hear all those determiners and all that
is not these examples with resume 0 to
understand why so you have a better way
to it indeed so now I'm when you know I
cannot really visualize all that I mean
I cannot read it's good for the machine
but not so much for me as a human right
or me Oh indeed so we're going to go and
find some other libraries and now we're
going to apply some visualization
library and the first thing I just
showed you we done we're going to show
you now some little a visualization here
which is going to come up and where you
be able in a second here to to see right
so now those determiner there is a
determiner these are noun phrases as so
on and so forth dude in port that's just
an example I mean obviously they're not
going to be analyzing homes they'll be
analyzing data sets and and why would a
scientist want to share I mean aren't
our scientists sometimes a little
proprietary about their work what is so
good to be proprietary and to Bill you
know like wanted to keep it to yourself
at the very beginning what you are kind
of experimenting but as part of the
science process and
process you want to make sure that your
resource can be validated by others and
that's the whole point chair and really
make it really really easy to be able to
do in producible research and I found
the great guys here I want to bring in
here Isabel guy on who is a researcher
at Chow learned she's someone who uses
code allow the customer basically so can
you show us like how you run
competitions right that that sort of
allow scientists to figure out what is
the best solution to a problem that's
right I'm the president of the channel
which is an organization dedicated to
organizing challenges in machine
learning there are competitions that
which scientists can demonstrate
excellence and we put that I'll show as
an example we put out a number of
problems so recently we put out a
competition on quiz effect there's the
participants had to determine whether
given some variables is a cause of b or
b ecause of a and they made a true
breakthrough the improved tremendously
compared to the baseline performance so
for example if a is smoking and be could
be lung cancer does a Cosby that's
correct you see lots of claims you know
in the media recently people claim that
the chocolate consumption was
influencing the brain because there was
an article in The New England of Journal
of Medicine where actually the
researchers should this correlation
between chocolate consumption and the
number of mobile prices per capita oh
really well for that eat more chocolate
anyway let's see the results of the
competition like who won and what is
that or if you hear the winner is so
starting from performances there were
near 0.5 so Neal random the best up and
entrance made a big leap in performance
that
error they already fell down and that
the accuracy is near eighty-two percent
and that you know an execution time
which is relatively modest the beauty of
Korolev is that it lets participants
submit their code so the code can be
benchmarked and both the speed is
measured as well as the accuracy that's
interesting so the competition lets them
arrive at answers quicker but also that
they can collaborate afterwards as to
who what good ideas that they have very
interesting work Thank You Evelyn and
you go to coda lab dot is a code lab org
to try it out to register and try it out
