microsoft is sponsoring the
International Women's hackathon because
we really want to bring more women into
the world of computer science we're
really focused on how people can use
technology to solve the world's most
pressing problems with the international
women's hackathon we have the
opportunity now to bring more people
into the fold to encourage young women
to learn how to code they can really
discover that coding can be the ultimate
creative canvas the International
Women's hackathon is a crowdsource event
where we empower young women to create
the event they want our hope with the
hackathon is to enable young women to
put together events on their university
campus that will focus on building teams
and solving challenges from top NGOs
around the world on real social issues
that need to be fixed where they're the
innovator and they're going to build the
right solution the way they want to help
make an impact so we have two great NGOs
who were working with this year to
inspire women to help them know that the
code that they create in this day can go
towards a great cause so the first one
is direct relief and that's an amazing
organization that comes in to support
people in the wake of a natural disaster
and so they are challenging us to come
and create a game to help responders
train for simulating what happens after
a disaster so the game can be on any
platform can run on any device and we're
excited to see what comes out of that
the second organization is the Nature
Conservancy so the Nature Conservancy is
a leading NGO working to solve the most
pressing conservation problems at the
largest scale the Nature Conservancy has
challenged us to help them create tools
to help decision-makers solve problems
around climate change problems with
business government and our communities
at large we have developed tools and
resources that allow people to
understand the impacts of climate change
one of our tools that we will be
presenting today is called the climate
wizard it's a web-based climate change
analysis application what we would like
the hackathon participants to do is help
us rethink our interface a little bit
make it web mobile just do whatever you
want the creative energy is there in the
room and there throughout the world we
look forward to seeing whatever you want
to do and we are very excited to hear
what you have done and we look forward
to implementing the changes and the
modifications and suggestions that each
one of you is head thank you very much
hi my name is Andrew Schroeder and I'm
the director of research and announces
for direct relief direct relief is a
global nonprofit organization based in
Santa Barbara California we work in over
72 countries to bring essential
medicines on a charitable basis to local
health care providers treating many of
the world's most vulnerable people our
challenge to the International Women's
hackathon community is to help us build
a computer game simulation that can help
us and the world improve how we think
about disaster response thank you very
much for taking up this challenge and I
can't wait to see what you come up with
I'm incredibly excited to invite women
everywhere to join a hackathon near you
or host one of your own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
