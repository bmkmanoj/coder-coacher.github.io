of words my name is Colleen Estrada I'm
the design director for Microsoft
Research views labs they event sponsor
for the annual design expo on stage with
me is our trusty MC Melissa quintanilla
she's the design director and founder of
dupla Studios a seattle-based ad agency
and formerly of my studio and Microsoft
Research last year she competently
handled our emceeing and I asked her to
do that again for us today um Thank You
Melissa so I'm just going to talk really
briefly about the goals of design expo
it began really 13 years ago I think now
Lily Chang and several other design
leaders in industry and academia joined
together and said wouldn't it be
marvelous if we gathered the top design
schools from around the world and pros
to challenge to them to build community
foster collaboration and just learn from
each other and that has gone on that
tradition is going on now for the past
13 years really quickly about this
year's challenge the challenges are
always varied and tried to be super
current for this year's challenge we
look to our past our present and our
hopefully designed perfect future which
we know is very hard to achieve
impossible in fact and posed a challenge
of achieving symbiosis taking the nod
from JCR Licklider pivotal work on man
computer symbiosis which imagined a
world where humans and computers were
interacting real-time seamlessly to
achieve things we look to our present
and determined that wow this is the last
year a plethora of chatty bots how were
emerging and personal agent services
that were doing all manner of things for
us often being driven the commanding
interface being the CD why the
conversational user interface or the cui
combined with the GUI why is this a
great thing well for that symbiotic
motion that that symbiotic symbiosis of
the human end computer being able to
work better together now we think that
with the cui the GUI and you know all
the the pervasive user agents there will
be new types of computing experiences
we can design and that's where we post
the challenge so that's the brief
background on the challenge you will see
the 9 student presentations from
everything from the the practical
implausible to the perfectly provocative
coming up so it's a great show melissa
is going to handle the rest of the
process and management of the program
for you Thank You Colleen so a bit about
the process of design Expo design Expo
culminates today in this event but it's
a process that lasts almost the whole
year so it starts in the fall of the
year before where the schools and
professors in the topic or challenge are
selected then each school has a course
on the subject and we also assign
Microsoft liaisons to partner with those
schools throughout the course to give
feedback on the student projects and
also to select the winning project to
come here present some of these classes
are up to 20 some people they have
sometimes eight groups so today are
seeing the top select the groups of each
of those schools the schools today are
going to present their work at design
Expo they have eight minutes to present
and then they have brief feedback on the
critics and the critics today are we
