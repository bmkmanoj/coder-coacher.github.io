lectures freely available
you
so these last we talked should be pretty
fun the theme is consequences but I sort
of beard from the theme as usual so we
the consequence of creativity or
something like that so the first talk
that we have is from Tony Tony and I
actually know each other probably longer
than anybody else here we went to
architecture school together back at
Cornell and sunny also went to Cornell
architecture school so we have like a
Cornell being here I guess so when we
think of hardware think of this is like
really big hardware hardware physical
space and how you make it and the
process of maybe old school a little bit
and how it's changed so uh oh thanks
Lily Lily for that okay I'm an architect
a little different field but I think
it's all relatable I'm going to talk
today about my own home but also our
work in the transition and the design
process from physical paper modeling
being around oh sorry I start again ok
anyway at the transition in our firm
using 3d software and 3d print models
and how to incorporate that into the
design process that we find in port I
borrowed from magritte at the top there
say nest mime a song this is a photo of
my house but it's a photography piece
house is actually it's split right here
this is actually a reflection in glass
so it's a metaphor for the house it's
it's a physical part of the house but
the idea that it's a suspended form in
space and sort of the ideas what we work
on but realistically with a critical
practice we're investigating and this is
pre 3d software but investigating a
surface transformation and geometric and
material changes in buildings but we
also feel that we're artists and we're
sculpting with sculpting space and form
and how to do that and this with the pre
tools self similar objects their group
clusters
one-directional self similar objects
which means each roof this isn't a
pointer but it goes in a different
direction but relates to itself and
you're creating a movement of fluidity
but done with very simple structural
techniques to produce it and these are
projects in that those magazines that I
just showed you a 12-year investigation
different ways to do it here's one about
fluidity these are physical models we
designed physically and then bring it
into the buddha software and 3d software
to create construction documents but
we're not designing in a 3d program of
any kind at this at this point this is
2000 and then here's my own home which
was actually also basically
revolutionized and used design ideas but
without the software availability at
that point this is my house it's
unfolded it's a one piece of paper here
it is folded up I and then we created
two directional movement which was
became proved very difficult without
using 3d information to do it here's a
printed model years after was built for
the moca museum you can just see the
overall forms of what you're going to
see in the photos in just a second so
you can see the process the form so here
we are and so I try to add it to relate
to today and the consequences of
democratizing contemporary architectural
ideas being discussed in major
universities since the 90s used only for
a few public budgeted buildings you know
at the billion dollar level basically
that I'm sure you're all aware of in the
last decade so the consequences project
time it took two years for me to
convince the city to let me build this
and it took six years of construction
from Oh 329 and here's just the 15
different sections we had a build to to
sort of be able to fabricate this
elsewhere and then erect it on the site
and here you can see basically built
there's three loops we won't start from
the back foot bar then the roof wall and
then the next piece while they infilled
the wood until we got to the final
product and that was a two and a half
year process just for the steel wood
part and that's why the house tickle
took a while actually and so here we
have it it's that single articulated
plan that you saw in the paper model
that transforms itself into this
hovering object held up by pylons
this is the back section it's an open
read section one of the other projects
also talked about this this allows you
to connect to the site purely in one
direction and for people to understand
that it is from one plane or it's a one
directional movement piece and hear some
my neighbor's roof and it's split
materially white and black to talk about
the fact that there are roof walls and
floor walls there are no walls in other
words no vertical nature of this there's
no horizontal nature of this they are
both the same either floor wall or roof
wall it's a shot from the back from the
side tell me if I'm clicking fast and so
here we have then the interior interior
of the main level the public spaces hey
well it's a light-filled space connected
to the outside Southern California a way
of living it open and fluid the forms
are open and fluid the idea of spatial
living is also open and fluid here's
from that front object that you saw
before is it you can see through the
house it's a why so it's split level and
you can buy res this up like I normally
do on my iPad you could just see through
the entire house at one time this house
is about 2,400 square feet but it feels
like 5,000 because only those sites
houses have vistas that are 90 feet long
within a space and and such and so when
I said democratize before this is on a
normal site it's in Venice Beach it's on
a normal flat lot small lot 4 x 120
2,400 square feet average home in
America is that size but and it uses
ideas and forms and technology inside
for everyone and this is what architects
it's what we talked about with each
other what we feel the future is but you
only seen it in a few public buildings
around in China and by Frank Gehry and
such because doesn't the technology in
the construction industry to build it
yet I mean that's what I would hope you
guys could come up with when zaha hadid
builds a building she's having car
manufacturers make the skin panels for
the building because they understand how
to building curves and
and 3d and so again this took me six
years to produce here's a living room
space the front of the street but well
protected when you indoor outdoor but
still calm you know the movement doesn't
mean that that you hear that your
phonetic in the space actually people
will normally comment on how quiet it is
now it's glass wall so it's really not
that quiet sometimes but your mind
thinks you're outdoors still and so it's
quiet for being outdoors and you
adjusted that's a very zen space
actually within within it here's the
master bedroom it's a it's a glass room
in the middle of the house so that it
does you can see through the entire home
sort of gives you a landscape feel
without having landscape of like
mountains and extreme home locations in
the Aegean Sea and such looking back
down through and so some of the projects
that in construction right now went back
from the two directional ideas of my
house back to the one directional just
because the timeline it takes to build
these things we're reserving at here's
something that's for us from the Getty
Museum it's about to go into
construction we're just waiting for the
final permits and it's a group cluster
again that one directional idea but that
gives you the overall movement these are
projects where the clients like would
like you to build it in one year and we
don't have to worry about inventing new
construction techniques to do it but we
can get these spatial ideas and form
ideas of what we're interested in you
can see the paper model in the last shot
in this shot the computer is used to
detail it to look at materiality in
detail things that larger levels and
give it to the structural engineers but
the design is all in the paper model
which is why if juxtaposed it on the
screen to you that it's as detailed at
this level the design level as the
renders are but now here's our first
house in 2015 I'll go back this paper
model we started this way again but now
we've taken it into into the computer
program and in the flat fold and then we
brought it into Maya and we're creating
the fluidity and now it's only going to
be done within the computer so this is
the first residential that we're doing
in that way I'll show you some
commercial work and how we've been doing
it in commercial work for about three
years now this is the same house here's
the renders what's going to the city and
the engineers you can see the more fluid
forms that are
to appear from it those are solar panels
that that black gray ribbon on top there
this is a competition from a while ago
it just transitions to the commercial
projects and again the the folded forms
the one directional group clustering
self-referencing forms we don't rely on
past additional forms we're also not
modernists in the sense of a box and
glasses is modern space it's a figural
space of a space of fluid movement and
the only way to make that understandable
is to give cues like that open section I
discussed and also create forms that
relate to each other at least so they
have their own relationship actually
it's kind of weak architecture weak form
architecture a cloud looks like
something different to all of you if you
put this next to six buildings in the
location we've we've related it to those
buildings on geometric levels that are
subtle but they're there in your mind
we'll find them this is just very early
renders I'm putting the dates on this
for you folks and you understand this
1990s the render levels that these
things are so the commercial works this
is Natalie ty again the last building
that we did with kind of in physical 3d
right paper paper models and you can see
why it's a one directional in that sense
and some others thai house and Beverly
Boulevard on a commercial street we've
actually that otay do have open section
you drive right through it very la car
culture so the facade includes the
driveway it's an art gallery
house of pies this is a three commercial
projects the first one which was drawn a
few years ago but it's the original
location of the restaurant so we haven't
done it yet cause he does want to share
that restaurant down it's a single
direction this was made through paper
model and then rendered in here and
developed further in 3d but we didn't
design it in 3d in the sense of a 3d
form and it's the last transition to
this this is house of pies it's actually
called the gateway building to Venice
Beach it took three years ago through
zoning approval with all the committee's
and the Coastal Commission and all that
it's in structural phase with arup
engineers who did the nest and also the
water pavilion for the China Olympics
and this is a parametric building so
this is our first parametric building
truly 3d designed so typically as I said
before we started with paper model and
then brought it from idea model what we
call a junk model to a model that we've
worked on for many many hours and then
in the computer but actually this one's
reverse it's here it's here and now this
is in the computer it's just we like to
start in the computer with kind of a
white model a paper model but in the
computer and it helps us transition in
the way that we think about non material
yet just about form just about the
difference between solid and void so a
solid and void condition which is how we
start with our buildings so here you can
see the first little print model the
early spatial of it after it was brought
Maya and see it's very curvilinear
here's the second print model the
framing and some detail ideas are
brought out and obviously had a larger
scale is that so developed from
small-scale to larger and larger it's a
scalar process until a bling we occupy
bringing into the programs to produce it
and here's some more renders that of
what it's going to look like and again
these are about two years old so the
last one I'll show you the render level
is even better as software changes
I think we have enough time I have a
little video in here that i'm going to
give you before i show you the last
project I thought it'd be interesting to
a show you how we design now using these
programs in the same way that we had a
physical model that you can turn and cut
and rotate and work on it's here where
we're working on their actual structure
now the change of the structure that the
engineers are requiring to make this
back mesh area that covers over the
parking lot to actually build be built
they added all the triangular this is to
it but our main concern is to keep the
floating reading the pullout of the
structure through the skin but they add
to that column in the corner there that
stops the design it ends the building
and that's not what we're trying to do
so this is literally a movie of us
working on how to solve that problem is
it seems to be going slower than I'm
talking though at the moment so again
that's isolated the issue this ending of
the special forces that don't want to
end with a vertical column at the
engineers put in trying to keep the
self-similar angles in two directions
for the movement and so obviously we
would we have to make some adjustments
so and he circles a lot it seems so
we're stretching out the the top skin
first which is again a mesh and framing
system and of course that'll solve some
issues from some locations but then we
still have a column issue so we tilted
in to relate to that bottom wall as well
we've jumped to the actual the final
model that the engineers have now it's a
color-coded difference it's just
explaining the angle changes and the
color rotator once really quickly to
show up keeps the dynamics of what we're
trying to do how the center columns they
added in our different color and their
vertical and they're about just vertical
structure but the end columns are part
of the skin shaped building the wrapper
that we're discussing the figural form
of the building as it rolls around I'll
show you our last project I think we can
give them that reading for you
again it now relates to the column
framing so that was designed
intentionally so take something that
change and then back to the intention of
the design idea is what this is showing
pause that and move on so this is our
latest project so the last project is
engineering it's going to go to building
department start construction about
eight months this one's in the planning
department right now when it comes out
it will follow suit it's another house
applies so these are restaurants that's
that's why I say democracy these are is
a restaurants but they're public
buildings in the sense that the other
one is on the corner of the start of
Venice the beach community of Venice
which are you guys have all heard of and
this one is the corner of the Glendale
another city in down near Los Angeles
and it's the corner of their entire
historic business district historically
not historic in the sense of what the
buildings look like and so it becomes
another corner building to to hold the
site and to welcome people to come into
but they are restaurants they're
functional their dysfunctional
businesses and actually the back flat
area is an existing building that we
have to tie in just by the codes that
are available and so how do you tie in a
parametric form to a square back piece
here again is in the computer what we
call our white paper model and how we
designed there's no paper model for this
project at all it's all just in the
computer and that's where we are now or
what the papers is gone and it's this
ribbon effect that ties the old part to
the new form ties the old cubic building
peace to the new forms that aren't
square and relatable and this is that
transformative material that just goes
around the building geometrically and
tries and creates on a new hole down the
street
here instead of a three-minute movie i
just said want the show that really real
advantage came this was a incredible
improvement over the project as designed
it was designed architecture i'll say
architectural ideas that architects want
to discuss with each other talk about
push for the future but then it's
actually going to be built and then how
is it a building for people to really
occupy and deal with and so the original
concept had the metal piece only on top
is cap a solid form that's been
vivisected by glass to relate to the old
glass piece on the left and in the end
working with it we changed it so the
ribbon ties everything together the
glass is flipped so the glass pulls
through at the bottom so at the
restaurants people have street access
and view in and out to tie it to the
community and the wood is really the cap
layer but this would never happen if we
didn't use 3d software and tools and
rendering because to create a new
physical model of this change of the
building and believe me this is a sea
change of the building I was fought by
the guys working with me oh that's
that's not a good idea why should we do
that we've been working on this idea for
you know two months or three months at
that point but when you have the
capacity to just try what ifs so quickly
with software you should take advantage
of it right so you you just say at the
end of a long day a 12-hour day a
ten-hour day you said let's just try
this for ten minutes which means an hour
and a half and when it happened
everybody went oh my god it's a better
project and it would have never happened
if it 12 years ago it just wouldn't have
occurred that way so here we are and
this is this is what I've shown you is
the project it is that it is the project
I won't bother you with that since I'm
running over time just some interior
projects right there and end on this one
where the weave create faceted forms are
easier to build when we do curvilinear
ones it's much more difficult
curvilinear in 3d and 3d Direction is
the future where we're working on that
we like this idea of space but I love
the juxtaposition of the fabric chair
which has smooth form and our folded
pieces as they both in view the same
sort of body geometries right a not a
square architectural space and certainly
not a pediment at historic idea form but
somehow form that's
dateable to the body thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
