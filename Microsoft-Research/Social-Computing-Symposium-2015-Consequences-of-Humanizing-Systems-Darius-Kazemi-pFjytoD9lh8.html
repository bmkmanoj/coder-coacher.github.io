hundreds of influential speakers from

you
then I will introduce Darius who
self-identifies a person who makes weird
internet stuff under the moniker of tiny
subversions his best-known work is the
random shopper which is a program that
bought him random books DVDs and CDs
from Amazon each month he also has a
small army of Twitter and Tumblr bots
that he builds because they make him
smile and in his spare time he founded
nanogen mo where participants spend a
month writing algorithms to generate
50,000 word novels um and also bought
summit a yearly gathering of people who
make BOTS so please welcome Tara hey
everybody um thank you for the
introduction uh so yeah I what I
actually want to do here is just go
through some of the things that I've
made and talk about design
considerations around them mostly I've
just been inspired by the conversation
that I've had with everybody over the
last day and a half or so and then the
breakout afterwards I just want to like
talk more about design considerations
for BOTS and autonomous agents with with
you all so as was mentioned in the in
the opening the the most probably my
best known project is this thing called
random shopper uh i was working i was
thinking about what happens when you
order something on amazon and it takes
two years for fulfillment to happen and
then two years later it's like you got a
present from some you know purse past
version of yourself and you get
something you don't really care about
anymore and i also been thinking about
recommendation algorithms and all of
that kind of stuff and and i thought
well Oh wouldn't it be great if I make
an application where you can you know
put in some categories and there's a
slider and one end of the slider is
deterministic it just buys you stuff on
your wish list on the other end of the
slider is completely random and in the
middle it sort of traverses your
recommendations and so you know I built
a prototype which just did the
randomness and and then it turned out I
really like that so I stopped the
eject and shifted and so when I ended up
with was random shopper which basically
pulls a word out of a hat searches
amazon for it finds things that are
within its budget that you give it I
give it a fifty dollar gift card once a
month and then just at random points in
my daily life I get these packages and I
didn't know what we're inside them and
it sent me a Chomsky book kind of funny
as the first thing and then I got this
like a dislike acoust electro-acoustic
avant-garde Swedish Hungarian music as
well in that first package but but so
that was that was like this and this one
so this one is a bot but it's really
weird because it it doesn't match up
with most of the other BOTS that I bill
which live on social networks and that
kind of thing this is a bot who's
operating system is sort of on a server
that I right but it also gets executed
through the united states postal service
I here's one it's a it's a tumblrbot
it's called reverse OCR it's also on
Twitter but it's more popular on tumblr
one of the things that I learned by
making these BOTS and sometimes
deploying the same bought the different
social network is that different social
networks have different affordances so
things are going to get more popular I
can on certain networks depending on
what kinds of actions they're doing
Tumblr's generally a more visual place
than then Twitter and what reverse OCR
does there's this awful awful OCR
library based on tesseract called OC rad
and I was just playing around with it
and it was I mean that's pretty good I
thought that was a Tildy but uh yeah
like it thinks that character is like an
L with an underscore it's awful ah but I
like false positives so I wrote an
algorithm that basically just draws
squiggles until it elicits what it
thinks is a word so that's chimney
that's adoption that's addendum some
good ones some of some of them you can
actually I like to stare at these and
sort of figure out what's happening with
some of these yeah here we go this one's
this one's plowing you can sort of see
the end there's an N
right there uh that's kind of a ji OHS
are really hard for it but that's just
because the algorithm and I wrote the
algorithm that I wrote is is kind of a
funny like that it basically i just put
i just put a pen down in the middle of
the canvas and scribble until it thinks
that's a tee I think that's a slash
which that that's actually pretty good
anyway uh so that's that's that's
reverse OCR and that one was a project
that I didn't think people would like
because i live on twitter and when I put
it on Twitter nobody really liked it but
I put it on tumblr and people went kind
of bonkers over it it's got thousands of
followers and I'll take a quick detour
right now to talk about this context
stuff people love to ask me uh
artificial intelligence questions I have
done artificial intelligence in the past
like I used to work in video games I you
know I'm familiar with that kind of work
I'm not doing artificial intelligence
work here when I build these BOTS it's
all smoke and mirrors which actually if
you're familiar with how artificial
intelligence video games happens it's
that's actually all smoke and mirrors
too because you're optimizing for
entertainment rather than something like
academically capital H hard-on so so so
here's something right so this is a word
promoter and then a definition for that
word one that promotes especially an
active supporter or advocate now i can
write a computer program that grabs
another word and displays its definition
residue the remainder of something after
removal of parts or a part avatar the
incarnation of a Hindu deity etc right
creeps chloroformed of creep so yeah so
we can just go through this okay all
right interpretation the a cure process
interpreting um all right it's not
terribly interesting all I have to do is
add a few words and a picture to this
and this becomes a joke generator girl
you must be an interpretation because
you are the act or process of
interpreting a girl you must be an
appliance because you are a device
our instrument designed to perform a
specific function especially an
electrical device such as a toaster for
household use see synonyms at tool on
girl you must be cuddling because you
are the present participle of cuddle uh
so so if you if you were to ask someone
you know is writing a generator
computationally difficult they would
probably say yes but it doesn't have to
be this is computationally
extraordinarily simple and there's
really just a sort of sleight-of-hand
trick an on computational design based
trick that you can put on this very
simple algorithm that turns it into a
joke generator and I have I have a like
a like a toy version of this that I put
out on the internet and like every every
month like some blog picks it up and
then like thousands of people like waste
many many hours you can probably you
should you should get productivity loss
exactly many many hours with this thing
as a toy and they tweet it and all that
and i just love wasting people's time um
uh so this is something uh one of the
patterns that I often do is I'll look at
human stupidity or human-like basically
repetitive human behavior in the wild
sometimes it's stupidity and sometimes
it's just interesting stuff this is an
example of interesting stuff I was
looking at the labor of fans on tumblr
and I noticed that people love to take
snapshots like little make animated
gifts of their favorite TV shows and
caption them and put them up on tumblr
and I thought well that's pretty wrote I
could automate that labor so what this
does is it goes through the wire the
television show the wire and DVDs have
subtitle files on them which contain the
entire text of a script along with
cueing information so all you have to do
is grab a line of script from the cueing
information and then you know what time
to snip out the video of and you can
make a gif and you can put it on tumblr
so so this just every hour it's been
going for it's done thousands of these
every hour it makes a gif sometimes it
sometimes it captures these fantastic
loops
that I I don't think a human might have
grabbed on their own arm and my favorite
thing is when I see people using these
in the wild as reaction gifts there's
one there's one where one of the
lieutenant's just goes stands up and
goes this is and a nice people
use that in the wild quite a bit and
that was just algorithmically created
and again this is also on Twitter but
it's more popular on tumblr because
tumblr is sort of like the locus of this
kind of fan labor also an accident of
this was uh was that I picked the wire
because I like that show because I
needed to to be able to evaluate the
utility like the the fact that my thing
was working and creating something
interesting I couldn't do it with a show
that I didn't like this just happens to
be that the wire sort of became crested
in popularity well before tumblr
question and popularity so there weren't
a whole lot of tumblr gift blogs that
were doing stuff for the wire so there's
a lot of wire fans who are actually very
grateful for the labor at this bot get
this bot performs um this is again
another example this is more of a
stupidity a simulator this is based on
this is called Auto charts it does a
couple different types of charts I just
noticed people sharing these terrible
flowcharts like they'll take song lyrics
and turn them into flow chart form and
it's a really terrible joke and so I was
like well okay I'll just sort of like
copy that format and and just build
these absurd ones so this one's got to
start are you garbage yes or no yes you
see me in your timeline no do you have a
yes you are drunken sleeping or drunken
cheating on me and this is just sourcing
questions and answers from from Twitter
so like declarative statements and then
and then questions as well there's some
other ones on here too but here's one
this is definitely a stupidity one I
love finding a wrote jokes that people
tell and just writing up their
algorithms and then spewing them to
Twitter this is actually weaponized
humor I'm trying to kill a form of joke
that I don't like
and I've had mild success with it this
one just goes you know stubhub give away
more like shrub hub give away am i right
and it just looks at trending topics and
it just parses them out into individual
words and then it picks a rhyme and then
it just tweets it five words to ruin a
date more like five words Chengdu ruin a
date uh uh John Elway more like Dan
Ammann elway and the best part about
these joke bots for me is seeing people
um use them somewhat innocently they'll
reply to someone making that style of
joke and they'll go oh that's just like
am i right bot and then my hope is that
they look at the bot and then they go oh
what am i doing with my life um that was
very much the motivation behind to
headlines which does that sort of lazy
form of joke where there are two things
in uh in the news and the joke is just
you confuse the two things they're
actually when I was searching for names
for this Twitter account hold on there
like there were like a zillion people
who have like tried to start accounts
where they do this manually where they
just they just manually write these
jokes that confuse different things in
the news and they never get that very
far my bot is far more industrious at
creating this type of joke than any
human ever could be an end to headlines
is actually funny a lot of a time Mitt
Romney used tricks to beat Baltimore
Ravens but don't be fooled why does the
mainstream media call General Motors the
Prophet yeah second black box from
Matthew McConaughey flight 8501 yeah so
um there are so they're a lot of people
really like this they like to talk to it
all the time I get a ton of people who
use this as a one of those reference
points again oh that's just like to
headlines and I have people who
anecdotally have said they think that
these bots have actually aided in
somewhat killing these lazy jokes
so so this is the these bots are
assassins of concepts in addition to
being somewhat funny and and and to
headlines is again a really really
simple algorithm all it does is it's a
scraper it goes to google news and it it
goes to the sidebar and it picks one
category like us and it'll click on one
of these topics by at random like Mitt
Romney and then it'll grab a headline it
makes no sense for Mitt Romney to run
for president again it knows Mitt Romney
is the subject so it swaps that out and
goes to technology and picks iphone it
makes you know it makes no sense for
iphone to run for president again right
and that's how it constructs these jokes
and it's a lazy algorithm befitting a
lazy joke uh so so again this is this is
really this is really simple stuff I
really don't like putting a lot of
effort into harder AI type things or
computational stuff every year I tell
myself I'm going to learn computer
vision and every year I find ways to
hack my way around without having to
learn computer vision software this
one's a more recent project is called
the yearly awards you just follow it and
it just gives you an award for 2014 you
know best best Lotus of 2014 most
sarcastic person of 2014 etc etc and you
just follow it and it people love it
because it's playful and very limited
engagement and everyone loves getting
awards even if they're not deserved and
again this is all that but this is that
context stuff again you know I'm
launching this during awards season
because I was annoyed by how much
awards-season chatter I saw on Twitter
it's like oh yeah some website named you
best writer on this niche topic okay
that's cool my bot just named me you
know best chief so take that uh content
forever is another recent project of
mine and this one was me looking at
medium and looking at long like really
detailed me
the pieces are like think pieces on
medium that really like just get deep
into a subject and you learn almost
nothing of value about the world or our
lives or anything and so this you can
just say uh give me give me five minutes
of content on computing everything you
need to know about computing oh that's
oh that's a long one hold on let's let's
split hold on I gotta try different
topic some of these are a little zippier
than others doesn't demo super well uh
grapes why 2014 was the year of grapes
grape seed oil from crushed seeds is
used in cosmetics cosmeceuticals and
skincare products for perceived health
benefits bacteria in a person's mouth
convert glucose fructose and most
commonly sucrose into acids such as
lactic acid through gleich process
sucrose forms a major element in
confectionery and desserts dessert is a
typically sweet course that includes
that concludes an evening meal the
village was founded by German immigrants
okay uh and what this actually does is
it it it's actually the process of me
automating myself falling down a
Wikipedia hole um so it just goes to
Wikipedia for the subject you give it
looks at the first five paragraphs
speaks a paragraph at random prints it
out grabs a link from that power from
that paragraph goes to that article
grabs another one of the first five
paragraphs and the design process of
this was actually the process of because
originally i was grabbing any paragraph
at random but actually constraining it
to the first five paragraphs was
important because the cut on wikipedia
the context of the first five paragraphs
is usually to set you up for a topic so
it sort of keeps it on that sort of
general not too deep level so it feels
more like a medium article um I very I
just copied their CSS completely so so
there's so this actually is laid out
like a medium article it puts in photo
pictures as well from these articles
um and it gives you a way to share it
with your friends as well at the end and
and this was again just me like looking
at things that people do and sort of a
road algorithmic away and and making it
a automated i'm going to plug very
briefly a bot summit which is an event
that i run yearly now the whole thing is
online we just get sort of art bot
makers together once a year to talk
about the art and craft of creating bots
if you google bot summit you'll find it
you can watch the whole thing it's only
four hours long nanogen mo is another
one that that actually has a lot of a
contextual stuff around it this is if
you've heard of NaNoWriMo it's national
novel writing month I proposed national
novel generation month where people
spend them up November writing code that
generates a 50,000 word novel and so and
so it's just it's like a competition
that we it's like a friendly competition
there's no prize or anything and and
this is a bunch of people who work on
the context of a novel rather than the
context of social networks as well and
it's just a totally different problem
set that might be worth looking at as
well uh I was really happy to hear Tom
talk about rudeness in these things uh
so when you live on a social network you
know when this when this thing you've
written lives on a social network you
know it's a it's a there are people
there and they have feelings and agency
and all that sort of stuff and and so I
try very hard to both design things with
the people who are interacting with them
in mind but I also try very hard to sort
of impress this upon the rest of the bot
community the bot making community as
well uh sometimes uh-uh they're like two
headlines is pretty popular so a lot of
people interact with it and sometimes
I'll get you get kind of like the too
soon
spawns because it is pulling from news
stories right so if there's a if there's
a massacre and a bunch of people are
killed it's probably going to tell some
jokes about that um and and I had to sit
and think about whether that was
something I wanted it to do or not and
um uh part of the way that I mitigate
that is I make it very clear that this
is a bot I sort of refer to it as the is
they from the mouths of bots type of
reaction like from the mouths of babes
but there are these like simple-minded
bots on bye bye conceptualising this as
a nonhuman entity and being as
straightforward and vocal as i can about
how non-human it is the fact that people
can look at this and understand pretty
quickly what the underlying algorithm
that's happening is like they can look
at it and understand the formula and the
fact that they understand the formula
means they they're sort of literate
about like they have some level of
procedural literacy about what's going
on on and they're much more forgiving
for that reason when these algorithms
are more opaque people tend to
understand them less and then they tend
to be able to like ascribe motivations
to them or that sort of thing and so one
of the greatest tricks that I pull to to
make my bots less offensive in general
is simply labeling them but if I tried
to pass my bots off as people people i
know this because i've seen other people
attempt to do this with their own work
people get very upset if they think that
this entity is is maliciously doing this
but if you sort of present it as this
childlike algorithm that's so simple
anyone can understand it then they just
go oh that's an interesting consequence
consequence and it seems much more like
a like a clockwork machine doing
something weird than a malicious entity
that's not to say that i don't put a lot
of work into this i have an extensive
blacklist of turn
that I just my bots will never say I run
them all through that I've open sourced
it so the rest of the community a lot of
them use it as well uh i'm actually
working on my least favorite thing about
to headlines is that it likes it
sometimes tweets jokes that are
essentially just the punchline is just
inherently transphobic where it'll be
like Vin Diesel looks beautiful in her
evening gown and people find those jokes
really funny and I don't like how they
find those jokes really funny and I
wouldn't tell those jokes myself so I've
actually been like working on like a
like a transphobic joke detector that
I'm hoping to open source and release
pretty soon um so there's a lot of of
curation and stewardship that I do on
these things too but again there's a
reason why I lean on these contextual
tricks far more than I lean on on
algorithmic cleverness to do this sort
of stuff okay cool um uh so yeah so
that's just wanted to point out some of
the uh some of the contextual tricks
that I use around this sort of thing I
want to talk I just wanted to point out
that that not all of this is technical
in fact it's mostly not technical which
is why I'm excited about people who I
actually get much more excited by bots
created by people who are not primarily
programmers I think you get much more
interesting results from from folks who
have a better understanding of the world
than necessarily api's and programming
languages and that sort of thing so if
anybody here would like to work on a bot
please let me know I can point you to a
bunch of resources or help you out and
in our breakout session we're going to
talk about more about these design
considerations I'd love to hear your
experiences with bots or you know any
questions you might have around bought
designs that you might be working on so
thank you
