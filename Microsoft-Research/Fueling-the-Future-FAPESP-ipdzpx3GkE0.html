hope SP is a research funding agency in
the state of são Paulo Brazil it funds
research in all areas of knowledge
Microsoft Research and Ferb as we
started collaborating as a joint
research center back in 2006 we work on
a call for proposal basis so researchers
from the state of são Paulo are invited
to submit proposals and Rico fund
research the fast microsoft joint
research center is a collection of
research projects which are selected by
fat ASP and by microsoft research mostly
fields related to the environment our
objective is to somehow assess the
impact of climate changes on plants my
role in this project is to develop a set
of computer science applications tools
and algorithms that could help into data
analysis in the data acquisition and
also in the data mining process in this
project you have two teams the first one
based on univ university is in charge of
the phonology aspects the second team at
UNICAMP in the record lab is in charge
of developing the computer science tools
pathology is the stead of recurrent life
cycle events such as the flowering
leafing bird migration and its
relationship with climate and that's why
phenology is now a day one of the best
indicators of climate change
traditionally the phonology is done on
the ground through on the ground
observations and this takes a lot of
time we have an effing ology course site
which is in the sahara savannah in this
side we have the tower with a digital
camera photographing the vegetation and
then we take daily photographs of the
vegetation then we can see the changes
on the vegetation and we validate that
this camera
with this on the ground observation I
phonology compare that with a
traditional underground phonology is
much more efficient we can have much
more information with the last human
labor but also one thing that is very
important that we can repeat that over a
large number of sites what is nearly
impossible with this on the ground
traditional phonology we have different
outcomes in this project from the
computer science perspective we had been
developing some algorithms for image
processing data analysis based on
database features also some techniques
based on machine learning approaches
from the phonology perspective we have
been developing some models to establish
connections between image features and
phonology data that have been obtained
the joint research center provides two
main benefits for us as researchers the
first one as allow us to do risk
research and the edge of knowledge
without constraints and the second one
has put us to work together a computer
scientists which expand our
possibilities to answer questions
analyze data and open up a lot of new
origins for our research so that's a
win-win we can focus on problems there
are strategic very relevant to the human
kind and at the same time those problems
posed a challenge to computer scientists
and we can advance the state of the art
in computer science if you invent a new
tool that can observe or measure
something nobody could do before that's
when you have a chance of doing new
science this new generation of
researchers they're going to be I
believe much more skillet than the
previews only had because they are being
trained it and skills from plant ecology
and from computer science so we are
building up a new generation of
researchers through this joint research
you
each year microsoft research helps
hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
