hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
okay so I'm probably going to be hitting
you a little bit out of out of left
field with this presentation coming to
Microsoft Research and seeing super cool
stuff like like David was just showing
you but what I want to talk about is the
efforts that we've been making an in the
group that I work in to build a
prediction engine for the planet and
I'll explain what what I mean by that
and be showing you some examples
throughout the talk so I work in a group
called computational ecology and
environmental sciences where I like to
say that we we work on the science
policy and tools and technology
necessary to conserve or sustain Earth's
life support systems and we work in
microsoft research so we do that by
marrying up the data to the models to to
make robust predictions in order to
allow people to try and set effective
effective policy and so anytime I tell
people that I'm a computational
ecologists or any colleges in general
that works for Microsoft Research I
always get why Microsoft um I usually
come back at that with well why doesn't
every company have a computational
ecologist but uh but to avoid having to
have one-on-one arguments with every
single one of you throughout this talk
will focus on why Microsoft and and I
really like to think that it's because
microsoft and particularly microsoft
research here in Cambridge truly
understands the power of predictions
you've been hearing some of the really
cool stuff that has been going on in
this building things like the movie
recommender infer dotnet all the cool
prediction technologies that people are
starting to do with Kinect I don't know
if any of you have had the opportunity
to find out about the predictable data
centers work that has come out if you're
really really fantastic stuff and so so
we really are I might be an ecologist
and somebody else might be in the
machine learning group but what we're
all interested in doing is making robust
predictions what we're trying to make
predictions about might might be
different but of course from a corporate
first corporate perspective as well
we're really interested in making
predictions Bing is is basically all
about making predictions and and Bing
travel is really one of
the the most fantastic examples I like
to think of how Bing is being used as
Microsoft used to call it as a decision
engine right because we're making
predictions about what flight prices are
going to be doing over time and we're
literally giving you an thumbs-up or a
thumbs-down decision support mechanism
for whether or not you should buy a
flight now so so I think that's great
and there's a nice quote from from from
our CEO on that exact same topic and so
what's interesting people say why
Microsoft and I read that quote from
Steve Ballmer and that gets me exactly
in my in my in my nerve center of
intellectual interests and so I'm
ecologists but but that's really where
we're all coming from here and so the
thing about predictions is when you can
make really good ones like we do with
like we do with Bing travel you can
enable people to make some strong
decisions you can enable people to make
what might seem like if you're unaware
of the power of the science and the data
and the technologies that go behind
these predictions to make some crazy
predictions right so you can see some of
the kids in the audience start to freak
out a little bit this is chris bishop
we're kind of circling back you heard
him talk on on the power of inference
this morning and so you can tell right
it's not just corp that believes in the
power predictions this is chris putting
his head on the line here so you can see
now chris is a distinguished scientists
in the company so if if he looks a
little bit nervous you know that you
know and look at him he's a little bit
he's a little bit you know he believes
but but there's always that angel of
doubt sitting there right
look at that all right so so that's
fantastic right and and you know most of
you don't go to work and pull a bowling
ball back to your for its everyday but
you do that every day right we rely on
robust predictions to build our society
those of you who came in cars or trains
or planes are sitting higher than others
or maybe we're brave enough to go more
than one floor off the off the ground
floor in a building right you're using
strong predictions that are built off of
a strong intellectual experimental
scientific and data-driven um framework
so you know chris bishop didn't die
because we have a long history
thankfully right otherwise we wouldn't
know as much about inference as as we do
now but you know chris bishop didn't die
because we've been able to combine data
theory and experiments to make near
predictive certainly right I mean Chris
couldn't know for sure that that bowling
ball was going to come back and crack
him in the head maybe there was a guy
standing at the other end that was just
going to give it a little push right but
but he knew enough that he could
constrain the assumptions in the
uncertainty in the underlying model in
his mind and make an actionable
prediction about whether or not that's
crazy or actually a rational decision to
stand there with his head behind that
thing now what we think about in our
computational ecology group is that
we're actually doing this every day as
well right and most of you again
probably don't think of it in this way
but through deforestation ocean
acidification co2 emissions species
extinctions all of this we really are
pulling that bowling ball back to our
heads and letting it go the problem with
doing that is unlike that physical
bowling ball in the world that we know
and understand we don't actually have a
strong understanding of the fundamental
laws that govern whether how far that
pendulum is going to swing not only that
but there's one earth so we can't have
this replicable experimental design
process and so you know Kristen died he
pulled that bowling ball back to his
head he made a good bet what we're doing
with some
of our Earth's life support systems
probably isn't a good idea if you
believe in this kind of data driven
engineering kind of principled approach
to making decisions and and this really
is causing problems so one of the one of
my favorite authors also happens to have
a fantastic quote that I get to use and
get to use in my talks and of course you
know climate is what you get or climate
is what you expect weather is what you
get and the problem is climates are
changing for for example we don't really
know how to make actionable predictions
because we don't have that strong
theoretical understanding and mind you
this is a system that we probably
understand from from a physical sense
better than most other environmental
systems we're still unclear on how we
scale back our uncertainty about what's
going to happen into the future from a
climate perspective and what that's
going to mean from a weather perspective
and this matters fundamentally from an
economics perspective from a governance
perspective right I mean when you're
when you're putting in the new sewage
system for Seattle these are you know
very expensive municipal projects for
example and they really want to know
should I put in a pipe like that or
should I put in a pipe like that right
and you can't just be like well put in a
pipe like that because the taxpayers
have to pay for it if they don't need it
they're not going to be too pleased so
um right now literally we're stuck in a
bit of a quagmire on this and this graph
here is a number of billion-dollar
weather weather billion dollar loss
events from from the insurance industry
over time from from 1982 to 2010 you can
see it's going up the insurance
companies are suffering pretty heavily
from this lack of ability to make
actionable predictions and so what this
really kind of brings me back to is is
actually a quote from before my time but
huh from former US President Jimmy
Carter who some of you may remember and
if you paid attention to to some of the
the world events that were going on the
US was going through a significant
energy crisis right people were lined up
for miles down the street to go to
petrol stations they were worried that
tomorrow wasn't going to be
like they knew today was and yesterday
was they didn't know if they were when
they turned on their lights the lights
were going to turn on they didn't know
when they stopped at the petrol station
there was going to be petrol and that
uncertainty really brought up a massive
societal unrest and it was one of the
defining moments in in the US over the
past couple decades where people
actually came together to to get our 12
maybe to get ourselves out of it or
maybe just to delay that into the future
but um but you know this quote is we're
losing our confidence in the future
we're also closing the door on our past
and I think that's hugely relevant to
the things that are going on with the
environment today and so what we're
trying to do in in the computational
ecology group is build this prediction
engine for the planet and you can see
what we're trying to do is marry up a
whole bunch of models of things that we
care about everything from forest
mortality to climate deforestation and
terrestrial carbon fire risk
agricultural yields to mention a hugely
valuable um industry that that is kind
of shaking at the knees right now
worrying about things like climate
change serving up the predictions and
the ability to manipulate those models
through simple to use api's bringing
predictions data and things like that
back to enable kind of in a classic
sense this ecosystem of partners right
of people to be able to go on and make
actionable predictions based on
environmental models that were running
so I was putting this slide deck
together this morning and I put that
together and I was kind of happy with it
and and then I realized as I was going
through it i forgot the data step right
so so and that's a critical one it's
actually near to my heart and it's one
of the things that I handle in our group
so it's a bit a bit erroneous of me of
me to miss it and so really these models
that we're building here they're they're
data-hungry models we need to confront
them with with points of observation in
the past to see if our models actually
can replicate what's previously happened
so that we can have a bit more
confidence and certainty that they might
be able to replicate what's going to
happen to the future and so you know
that shouldn't be a problem in the one
respect I bender
rrible institutions like the Economist
tell us that there's a day to deluge
right here's a businessman harvesting a
bunch of data and using it to grow some
genetically modified crops for for
example so on the one hand I completely
agree with that from an environmental
standpoint we are suffering a day to day
luge right I mean satellite imagery is
one of those things that everybody in
this room your life has been
fundamentally changed by an extra
dimension by which you can contextualise
your existence satellite imagery has
changed all of that the daily use of
satellite imagery is fantastic this is
daily modus right 250 meter resolution
so this isn't even the high resolution
stuff this 250 meter resolution about 6
million pixels streaming in every day
and and there's all sorts of other
information that's coming in in the in
the typical Big Data paradigm but if you
hang around Microsoft researchers for
very long you realize that we're
actually not all that interested in big
data don't really care how big your data
are we care about how much information
is in your data and in that respect from
an environmental context we're suffering
a bit of an information drought so
ecology this is a Wikipedia definition
of ecology right so I'm sure my
professors at university would be happy
that I pulled that up but uh but you
know funny enough wikipedias then it as
well as they have so so a scientific
study of interactions among organisms in
the environment and interactions
organisms have with each other and
they're abiotic environment okay so what
do we mean by that so if I want to
understand ecology that means I need to
understand okay well we're how many
species are there where are they what
are they doing where they are how are
they interacting with each other how do
those interactions create the resulting
ecosystem services that we all depend on
and on and on and on it's not just about
RGB from satellite imagery data
streaming and everybody saying oh why
are you complaining right look at all
the data that's coming in I turn around
and I say well what's the information
content of those data it's actually
quite low from from from a ratio
perspective right because we really want
to understand how all this is going to
respond
to to changing environments and I put
this down here in a small picture
because the amount of data that we have
on this stuff is small this is this is
an ecological network a network of
species as these nodes and all the
little connections are who we tune sort
of relationships so that's fantastic you
know this is actually created with a
software program called network 3d
created by scientists in our group but
how many of these datasets do we
actually have less than 100 how many of
them do we have over time even fewer
than that how many of them do we have
over space we're literally down onto one
hand and we're talking about the entire
or earth for trying to understand some
of the fundamental processes that keep
us all here every day so from a data
perspective what we're trying to do in
our group is is a bit of a multi-faceted
approach this is one thing a technology
nature take technology for nature
initiative can you raise your hand if
you stop by our fantastic booth this
morning come on it was the one with the
trees the elephant all that kind of
stuff the drones how can you pass by a
drone right so so this this initiative
with zoological side of London
University College London and us at
Microsoft Research trying to develop the
new devices if how many of your don't
know about gadget here for example does
everybody heard a gadget here nobody
sort of Gadgeteer okay you need to learn
about Gadgeteer I'm not going to give a
talk about Gadgeteer but that's a that's
a fantastic platform that really will
change the way you think about hardware
it will make you understand the hardware
is no longer immutable you can change
hardware like you change software and
it's simply fantastic so we're using
Gadgeteer to to build these novel data
collection devices and and to try to
create what I like to call a ubiquitous
computing of the environment and to have
such ubiquitous can be the environment
you need devices to be small you need
them to be cheap reprogrammable
repurpose about and very very power
efficient this is one device that we've
created in our group that called mataki
that is just that and it's super small
super cheap orders of magnitude cheaper
than anything else on the market we
don't sell it
be working on licensing it and it's got
some software that sits on there that
sets up a mesh network across all the
animals within the ecosystem that are
wearing it and when one comes by it will
download everybody else's data onto a
base station just so you know this is
what gadget here comes in a little kit
like this and it's just a bunch of bits
and bobs that you can plug together in a
kind of Lego style fashion anyway I'll
move on we're also working with the
world's largest conservation
organization International Union for
Conservation of Nature and their Red
List to help them handle all of their
spatial data but more importantly
collect a lot more of it because we
don't know very much about the threats
to species we might know where species
are but we don't really know what the
pressures there they're facing are and
how those are changing over time so
we're working with with the sequel
server databases and and things like
that to try and get data collection up
to speed if you would have stopped at
that booth you would have also seen
something called fetch climate which is
really a an ability to retrieve global
environmental information with the click
of a button or a few lines of code and
at least an environmental sector this is
kind of transformative because we're
trained as ecologists there are very few
among us who are very computationally
proficient because that's not really in
our training we're busy learning about
the environment and but but increasingly
we need to run models and have
understanding about the future of the
environment which requires as i said
before confronting our models with data
how do you get those data right now
they're really complex spatial formats
really big databases that are pretty
gnarly to work with many of you probably
spend your days dealing with databases
like these so we're trying to get those
that difficulty out of the way so that
so that normal people like me can can
can use them so on to the models really
quickly here so this is the really the
key intellectual core of the work that
we're doing in our group and so I just
want to show you a bunch of examples
this is just one that's kind of close to
my heart because I'm really interested
in the question which is a really old
one in ecology of how many species are
there we don't actually know but there's
all sorts of different statistical
methods for finding that out right and
this is a pretty simple mechanistic
model which is it says we think that as
as time goes on we get more efficient at
describing species that as there's more
tax onymous or people out there
searching for species we should find
more and that as we approach as the
number of species that we know starts to
approach the total number of species
that we don't know it should be get
should be more difficult right it's like
bobbing for apples and and the fewer
apples that are in there these are the
harder it is to randomly encounter one
so I don't necessarily expect you to be
all that interested in this but but um
it is a an inherently nonlinear model
that's inherently kind of hard to solve
right we've got some data in blue and
we've got some parameters in red and
we've got to solve for that so we solved
for that using a Bayesian estimation
engine that we created in our group
called called fills back and and that's
proved really useful for fitting all
sorts of models that i'm going to show
you in to the future so if you cared for
plants it's about seventeen percent more
okay you can take that away right if
anything okay so let's let's talk about
something else but we can predict
terrestrial carbon one of the major
source of uncertainty in general
circulation models the IPCC is set to be
launching their next report in the week
or so right what's the major source of
uncertainty in their ability to make
robust predictions it's actually global
carbon uptake terrestrial carbon uptake
it's uncertain as you can see this is a
suite of different modeling efforts and
this is above zero and below zero it is
uncertain whether terrestrial carbon is
going to be a sink ie we're going the
trees are going to and soil etc is going
to take carbon out and keep it or is it
going to be a source is it going to
release it right are we going to cut
down the Amazon burn it and release all
that carbon back up into the atmosphere
well what we've been doing in our group
is building a very battle that takes
balance complexity into account so in
every step we say well how important is
this component in the model and when I
say important we measure that with with
formal uncertainty methods and we put
that all together and we also say how
important is it computationally because
oftentimes the scientist we love did you
say oh throw this in their throat listen
or throw this in there and then you
can't run it or you can run it once and
it takes about seven years and and then
somebody said to who I screwed up that
and you're like well so so that's what
we're interested in and the nice thing
about our methods is it allows us to
start to poke our model right because
our model says oh this part if you fix
this our overall model uncertainty is
going to be reduced maximally that's the
information content of the data and the
model components that were really
chasing so we've done that right and
this is work primarily of a guy named
Matthew Smith in our group and we've
produced the first fully data constrain
terrestrial carbon map of the world
which is pretty fantastic I mean who
would have thought that Microsoft
Research would have been the first to do
that well what else who else sucks up or
releases carbon into the atmosphere well
the marine world does in particularly
phytoplankton those tiny little guys
that cause algal blooms and things like
that so what do we what do we have here
I won't get into the details but another
model that does fantastically well the
dart line our data and this this grayish
band here is is the uncertainty bounded
uncertainty around our model predictions
and you can see again this is one of the
first efforts to do so well at
predicting the the phytoplankton
dynamics over time across the the
world's oceans so we're also interested
in predicting roads and deforestation in
the complex interplay between those two
things because deforestation causes
roads to come and roads cause
deforestation away from their boundaries
so you can see here we're using some
visualization software for for these
kinds of data to run through a model
output from from some of our former PhD
students and now postdocs and so just
being able to fish model this stuff
predict it and visualize it is really
really fantastic from the perspective of
people who are trying to do something
with this kind of information because
we're trying to take this science out of
the domain of just doing it publishing
it putting a static map in a PDF and
printing it out handing it to a
policymaker whatever that is and and in
saying
right oh you know do something good with
it in this case they can inspect it they
can change it they can ask different
questions about it this is I mentioned
agricultural earlier agriculture earlier
right i mean everybody cares about
agriculture most of your company's
portfolio is probably in some way if you
trace all of the you know derivatives
back somewhere you've got some features
commodities markets in there so you know
here is under a 2 degrees Celsius
warming scenario global projected wheat
yields in tons per hectare you can see
that certain places are going to be
winners under this scenario in certain
places are going to be losers people
want to know who's going to win and
who's going to lose where and why we're
also trying to predict things like
biodiversity so what's the fate of
species and and the diversity of species
into the future under accepted socio
economic policy scenarios that like
maybe the United Nations has come up
with things like that so we've got two
two complementary approaches to trying
to do this at the moment one's a really
simple statistical model it doesn't look
simple but I'm compared to the other one
it is so maybe i should say i'm
relatively simple statistical oh no and
you know so a while back when i was
doing my PhD I used to always be
offended when people would say it's what
I was doing was simple and now I think
it is a quite you know a significant
portion or part of my pride because I've
spent a lot of time doing complex things
and I don't want to be associated with
them but but so we've got a very simple
statistical model which over and through
and a very more complex process based
below they're both hugely interesting
they're both helpful for assessing
scenarios but they both have a lot of
assumptions but critically they also
both let us project into the future to
internationally accepted biodiversity
monitoring metrics the red Lucinda and
the Living Planet Index the red listened
X which is which is overseen by the iucn
which you have a corporate partnership
with the Living Planet Index which is
overseen by Zoological Society of London
WWF and one of our former postdocs now
actually runs the Living Planet Index
for is SL and so the simple one only
requires us to take
un socio economic scenarios that take
into account how food crops energy crops
livestock and forestry and all sorts of
other things are going to change take a
hugely complex model of how land use is
going to respond all of that take
another hugely complex result of global
climate models and what future climate
is going to be but then take a
relatively simplistic statistical
approach of correlating presence/absence
of species with their current
environmental characteristics and then
projecting that into the future and then
refining that with best ecological
knowledge of where species are going to
occur and thinking about how they might
be able to disperse how will they get
from where they are now to where we
think they're going to have to go and if
we put in all sorts of other ecological
information we can start to figure out
things like density and potential
population size and eventually calculate
some of these rather simple metrics and
all of that work this is super
depressing as well right all of that
work then you like like there's a line
so um you know uh anyway yeah yeah so
yeah anyway okay so what I'm showing
here is two different Rio plus 20
accepted potential socio-economic
scenarios one is just business as usual
right just everyday into the future is
like today the way we use technology the
way we release carbon into the
atmosphere all that kind of stuff
another one is consumption change in
that we actually change our practices so
that we consume less we travel less all
that kind of stuff and we can see what
if we only allow those things to affect
land use what if we allow species to
disperse as far as we think is possible
and take into account climate change etc
etc and you can see the Red List indexes
is this red one and the Living Planet
Index is this blue one so you can see on
baseline which your business as usual i
should say as you go down things are
good so um there no yeah
can see that things start to start to
get better if we if we do something
about what's going on and they don't
really if we don't hey there's a
shocking result but it's funny because
we allow uncertainty to paralyze us from
a decision making process so it bothers
me that I have to do all that work to
tell you something that you already know
but if i didn't i would be beat back by
people saying well you don't actually
know right so anyway there we go this is
the mattingly model this is the much
more process based complex model and in
it we're taking a much within grid cells
in the earth that whatever resolution
you choose we we allow animals of the
kinds that you can imagine heterotrophs
and autotrophs marine and terrestrial
carnivores herbivores omnivores all that
kind of stuff and we and we put them in
there and we let them go about their
business they chase each other they eat
each other they grow old they die they
they have sex they have babies all sorts
of crazy stuff right they eat plants and
and all of those processes this is a
fundamental bit of the this process
based model is that what we want to do
the way we test our model is we run it
and then we look at the output and we
say does that output look like an
ecosystem looks we didn't tell it that
an ecosystem looks like this we said we
think this is how individuals within
ecosystems interact and then we take a
coarser level view and we say did that
build you know something that um that
looks like an ecosystem and what's
really fantastic is that we finally got
this thing up and running and and you
know I could have made something that
looked a lot prettier than that that
actually didn't do anything but what's
going on is a lot of computation every
one of those grid cells and we're
picking up I mean you can already see
the seasonal shift and phytoplankton
blooms and stuff like that right so it's
it's fantastic we just with a few simple
kind of agent-based rules we're allowing
the ecosystems to kind of get on with
their business and then we can force
them once they've once they've kind of
spun up right to a realistic state we
can force them with sonar
that we're interested in like what if i
convert this half of this grid cell to
agricultural use or what if i take out
all the top carnivores in this rensa
what happens to the ecosystem structure
and function can we start getting these
more process-based understanding of
what's going to happen but probably more
importantly why is it going to happen
the other thing that we've been working
on can we figure out you know if animals
have to move how are they going to get
from point A to point B right for a bird
maybe I'm just going to pick up and fly
but what if you're in this case a frog
and you've got to go up a mountain right
if you've ever climbed a mountain you
realize that unlike the mathematical way
that we typically represent them in
ecology or environmental science week
we're in a group meeting recently and
there's a pure mathematician in our
group and she said exactly what we
always you know try not to say in our
group which is imagine a spherical
animal right and and and and therein
therein lies the dichotomy between being
computational and a and an ecologist so
but anyway this is just just trying to
figure out how the landscape might
constrain an animal which has a limited
perception of its local environment and
you can see that it really fragments its
range as it has to deal with the
virginity and elevation okay and finally
we're working on decision support tools
and working on ways of allowing people
to make trade-offs right because I might
have my own personal views about what we
should do but that's probably not all
that relevant to what we're actually
going to do what is relevant I think is
that the team that I work in we do
everything possible so that when people
do make these decisions I can say at
least you knew right you knew I gave you
the best science I visualized it in the
best way maybe you haven't seen some of
the best visualization that's coming but
that's what we're really trying to to
work towards and of course you know some
of the things is i can't tell you what
to do but i can give you efficient
algorithms that don't require you to to
throw uncertainty out the window
maybe you want to purchase a couple
planning sites or protected areas I
could easily have said maybe you want to
purchase a couple data center sites for
example but you need to do that over
time and the uncertainty of whether or
not those sites are going to be
available over time changes etc etc and
traditional optimization routines which
we like to steal from control
engineering and things like that really
fall down in the face of these sorts of
uncertainty problems and so we're
working on what we like to call flexible
scheduling so that you can we can give
you a solution that's flexible to the
vagaries of life but importantly we're
also learning from the experts we have
relationships formal partnerships at the
corporate level with IUCN we share
scientists with united nations
environmental program here in Cambridge
we work closely with professional
societies like the British ecological
society and and and Matt government
bodies like natural england and we're
just trying to figure out well how do
people make decisions so that we can
provide the best support possible and
finally I said we're trying to build it
a prediction engine for the environment
and for the planet and all of those
pieces are our efforts over the past
several years to bring the components
together and finally we have a bit of a
software solution where we're just
starting to do that so I think I have a
couple minutes and i just want to show
you a very short video of this going to
work let's see i think and this is a guy
named drew purvis a scientist in our
group who may be in ultimate fail
who is demoing what we call distribution
model a the very early stages what we
would call the prediction engine for the
planet from the title that we built that
makes it much easier for all kinds of
people to take data and models and make
predictions about things that really
matter like food or fire here's a fire
model showing predictions for fire
frequency across the United States for
the next 20 years in general we know how
to make those kinds of predictions we
need to take data and models and combine
them together with Bayesian analysis to
make predictions but the technical
challenges involved in that pipeline are
so severe that it's difficult even for
the experts to do that stuff and most
people can't even get started with it at
all and so I'm just going to open our
prototype everything runs in the browser
what I'm going to do is use this
application to build a model that
predicts the yield of wheat as a
function of the client so i'm going to
import the file and we see that it has
latitude longitude and then the yield of
wheat we're going to make a chart so we
can see how the yield of wheat berries
across the world and now i'm going to
supplement that file with the climate
information that we need so i'm going to
use our fetch climate service which is
baked into the application and just that
quickly i could go and get the
temperature didn't have to supply it
myself it was supplied by the tool i can
go get precipitation as well and
immediately then we can have this table
with the yield of weak temperature in
the preset we can go and make a chart
which shows how the yield of week
depends on the temperature and preset so
the next step is to build a model of the
relationship between the yield of weeds
on the temperature and precip and fit
that model now the model predicts the
yield of wheat I'm going to add a
dependency of the yield of wheat on air
temperature I'm going to also add a
dependency on precipitation and I've
done everything I need now to go and fit
that model to the data which is what's
happening here with a fully
state-of-the-art Bayesian analysis mcmc
parameter estimation as we call it now
this is now estimated the parameters the
model like for instance the optimum air
temperature of wheat and it's telling us
that the optimal air temperature is
about 12 degrees and here's my
predictions which I'm going to again
view up on the map it's a very flexible
graphical system we can look at all
sorts of different aspects of the data
here
in this particular view shows the model
predictions then across the world
including the uncertainty so we could
put all of those various charts in there
and we can see whether our model looks
like the real world and it does seem to
done quite well now if I want to share
this whole analysis with someone else I
just hit a single click up here and I've
just saved a file that I could share
with you you could open it and retrace
everything I've done modify anything and
extend off it to build ever more
sophisticated models so we're just a few
clicks of the mouse we've been able to
take that model and the accompanying
parameters and make it available via the
cloud in our fetch climate to service
you can see that here you can go forward
then and look at some projected possible
wheat yields under a climate change
scenario and those same predictions are
actually available on a phone I hope
I've been able to show you is that we
can make it dramatically easier for
people to go from big data to models to
predictions about things that really
matter and that then gives us the
ability hopefully to make much better
decisions about how we look after the
planet on which we all ultimately depend
right so that seemed kind of like a
melancholy ending didn't it so but the
point is what drew just did in the three
minutes is he went from nothing to a
continental scale analysis of wheat
yields over over time into the future
under projected climate change that kind
of thinking and ability to generate
those sorts of data constrained but
uncertainty bounded predictions is is
truly kind of unprecedented in the world
of Environmental Management so so with
that I'm here you can ask some questions
if you want and it's probably the first
talk I've ever done that i think is less
than i was actually supposed to give so
anyway thank you thanks
just wrote open questions I know what
you're all thinking at the moment that
is where do I get me a computational
ecologist I was an outstanding so any
any any questions at all for Lucas
please map yeah you mentioned we only
had one have you thought to find that
some uncertainty thing to the Drake
Equation find out if there any more uh
no i'll tell you why actually um not to
be two antagonistic about it or
facetious but i actually think you know
i got i got a bit tense when I was
saying I it bothers me that I have to do
this stuff to prove to people that you
know what's already so obvious do I
think most of us and things like
geoengineering and people saying oh you
know maybe I know you weren't completely
serious but the you know people saying
oh ho well we can always kind of find
life support on another planet etc etc
that just this is a personal view now
but that just perpetuates this pushing
off into the future of don't worry
somebody else will solve it you know and
I love my kids but they're three and a
half and one and a half and they're not
impressing me that much right now so
like you know at the moment I'm leaving
it my own hands and I'm not too
confident about about solutions like
that that's a completely completely
valid point in that wasn't quite the
point is make was actually interested in
whether that that sort of Bayesian
analysis could work for the the Drake
Equation you know it's a poll working at
how many planets there are I'm not
seriously thinking we're going to solve
on this by going yeah at least you gave
me a soapbox right um uh sure I'm
probably not the most qualified to
answer that to be honest but there are
other exceptionally smart people in this
room or hiding out another one that
might be able to come sorry you know not
sure about the other one any other
questions at all this one crucially um
disease patterns have you modeled the
impact of climate change and run of the
variables on
frequent occurrence of disease and that
crop yields for example yeah definitely
so we are in collaboration with so so
what the the carbon stuff that I was
talking about I said that was
principally done by a guy named Matthew
Smith we all have all the pies in our
group have various very different
backgrounds I'm formally trained in
wildlife ecology and did my PhD in
conservation biology drew is a forest
dynamics modeler and Matthew Smith is
actually a mathematical biologists and a
disease epidemiology guys so his whole
background is in modeling disease we're
starting to work with I'm not sure if I
can say large charitable organizations
that are interested in public health to
apply these this software these
techniques to exactly what you just said
because again the disease community is
waking up to the role of the environment
in promulgating disease and and this
stuff I say species they say species
we're talking about talking about like
furry critters and they're not but you
know it's all the same so great stuff
all right thanks again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
