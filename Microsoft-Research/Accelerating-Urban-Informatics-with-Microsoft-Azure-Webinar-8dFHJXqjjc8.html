urban informatics with Microsoft Azure I
would like to turn today's event over to
Tim pan Tim you now have the floor Thank
You Stephanie good afternoon or good
morning or good evening to other part of
the world
welcome to the Microsoft Asia webinar
series my name is Tim Penn I'm the
University Relations Director for
Microsoft Research Asia based in Beijing
today's topic is accelerating urban
informatics with Microsoft Azure which
concerns how to use cloud computing to
advance the research on urban problems
probably most of us are aware of urban
problems especially those living in
Beijing and Shanghai including all the
speakers today in April The Economist
that has a special report on the cities
that will change the world
which discusses the challenges and
opportunities of the fast-growing cities
in China it appoints out that in past 30
years Chinese urban population has risen
500 million Gaza phenomenon never seen
in the human history and it's not the
end the chinese city population is still
growing by 2030 1 billion people over
70% of chinese will be living in cities
so no matter how fast the chinese
government develops infrastructure is
never enough there's always traffic jam
and awfully crowded public space Corie
urban population also causes other
environmental problems such as air and
water pollution noise and
overconsumption of energy
however in Chinese we like to say when
there is a crisis there is opportunity
if we manager bin' problems will like
the economies assess we will change the
world so example by 2020 we expect a
high-speed rail connecting all Chinese
cities with more than a half million
people that means around 1 billion
people will be connected by a network of
high-speed rail and we have never seen
that level of convenience in human
history along that thought we hope more
urban problems can be solved and more
opportunities can be found so Microsoft
Research Asia collaborates with academia
working on various projects the purpose
is to accelerate urban informatics
research with the power of Microsoft
Azure starting from last year we have
requested for proposals addressing
critical urban challenges and receive
the many in the areas like urban
transportation noise pollution energy
consumption smart community or buildings
urban lifestyles and a social happiness
most of the project use cloud to collect
and/or analyze the big data of the big
cities we hope a research community can
be fostered so the school of urban sizes
can continue and prosper with a joint
efforts we hope our cities will be more
livable in years to come
in the meantime Microsoft Research is
running a program called Asia for
research which provides free cloud
resources to academia if a professor has
a research idea and wants to try cloud
computing he or she can go to the
website Asia for research come
submitting a three-page proposal to the
arty then there is a chance to win a
sizeable cloud resource for a year in
addition to RP you can also find a
workshop in a training
Meishan dear now in this webinar we have
invited to distinguish the speakers one
is my colleague dr. Dunn he's a leader
researcher of Microsoft Research in Asia
the talk he was share with us his
advances of urban computing in Microsoft
Research Asia the second speaker is
Professor Yin Ming Zhu
he's an associate professor from
Shanghai Jiao Tong University he wants
to share with us his research project
crowdsourcing based urban noise mapping
with smartphones this part is a winner
of both urban informatics RP and Azure
for research RP now let's welcome the
first speaker dr. Lewton e you have the
mic thank you for introduction okay so
I'm you for Microsoft residential are
working on urban computing as we know
the rapid progress of urbanization has
modernized many people's life but also
generally another problem such as
traffic congestion energy consumption
and environmental pollution traveling
these challengers years ago seems nearly
impossible given a complex setting of a
city originally the once is in sensing
technology and a large scale large
sphere in computer infrastructure as
generally they were a rarity or big data
from social media to travel for or from
your profit data to meteorology data so
if is crackly the data can help us Tero
these challenges we are facing in cities
motivated by this opportunity we came up
with a region on urban community which
connects urban sensing urban data
management urban data and attics and
service providing into a loop for
continuous and unobtrusive improvement
on people's life city operating system
and environment in short we're going to
tackle
big challenge in big city by using big
data so in the following slides I will
show you what kind of big data we are
using in urban computing the first one
is a real nail data so this map shows
Beijing registro Network well the red
line stands for the highway connecting
Beijing to other cities
the blue circle means the window of
Beijing having the data of consecutive
years we can sense how the city is
expanding the second data is a point of
interest data how each point of interest
has a name address
category and location information okay
so for example this map shows the
distribution of MU sitter and Parks in
Beijing where a yellow point stands for
a movie theater and Blue Point means a
problem as we can say that tons of
Harbin Beijing which means begins or a
fun city so having the data of
consecutive years we can sense how the
business of city was growing or is
changing over years for instance the
number of movie theaters hips are
increasing in past five years are
reaching 260 within the urban area so
this could implies more than what people
would like to watch a movie in a movie
theater instead of buying DVD air
quality data which usually classified
into some category like good moderate
and a heresy is very related to people's
hairs and this data is also very ready
to meet your logic data such as weather
humidity temperature etc check in data
is not kind of human mobility density as
we know well people have been to a place
so this figure shows the check-in data
in Manhattan on two categories
wise and at him another nap
9 live sports so this is a citywide
human memory data last but not least
it's a GPS trajectory data set
generally by over 30,000 tests gap in
Beijing this is a visualization of three
months data well the lighter the denser
the data tells us not only a traffic
pattern on the surface but also the
citywide human mobility pattern because
we know well people get on taxi and get
off a taxi using these data sets we help
enable a series of technical work from
finding the practically fastest pass
based on large-scale taxicab
trajectories to clean the Pro Matic
design in your cities or network and to
identify the function regional City last
year we have three new results about
large-scale dynamic array sharing among
test caps and air quality and real-time
gas consumption sensing your city so I
will give you three example in my
following presentation the first one is
about air quality air pollution are
global concerns especially in developing
countries like China many cities have
viewed on the ground air quality
monitoring station to inform their
citizens here urban air quality every
hour however the number of air quality
modernization are quite limited because
building such kind of station is very
expensive in terms of money land use and
human resource unfortunately air quality
were roused by location significantly
and is highly skewing City for example
this is a map of region which I can
stands for one air quality monitoring
station the number associated with each
ICAM means air calling the index the
smaller the better the bigger the worse
Koreans were good and
red means I'm here see as we can see
even at the same moment the air quality
rating from these stations could be very
different even if some of station are
very close to each other it's not
surprising to say this phenomenon as air
quality is influenced by multiple
complex factors such as traffic floor
land use density of structure of
buildings and the fan grade meteorology
meteorology this vector could be worth
different in different place of city now
the problem is we don't really know the
air quality of a location without a
monitoring station so for example was an
air corridor overall carbon locations so
it's not a every number of the station
of the radium from the existing stations
so what are we to hear it
we're in for real-time and fan korean
air quality information through our
intensity using to power of big data the
first one is the real-time and historic
air quality data from existing stations
the second part of five additional data
source will observe in city first one it
could be a meteorology data such as wind
ease sunny or temperature humidity deck
structure traffic data human mobility
that is the number people move into
location and leaving on location in a
given time slot or point of entry data
such as how many parks the number of
restaurant shopping more factories in a
region and the structure of real
networkers such as the number of
intersections traffic lights of highways
using data mining and the machine
learning algorithm we can view a network
between the data we observe in your
location and the air quality of the
location so in the future given the data
of the location we can infer its air
quality so this is a whole range of data
we have and this is what we can improve
so having such kind of fan green air
quality data we can inform people's
decision making
for example our when and where good
jogging and when to close a window it
could be where different from the
average member of our city and also this
is stabbed towards at any file she was
identified the root cause of air
pollutions before we identified were
caused because of air pollution we need
to know well is always polluted so this
system is better personnel
Freeman that can ask crowd which clan
where crowd continues connecting data to
collect data and process data and to
serve users with real-time service and
user can access real-time information by
using either mobile clients or a web
service so you can search for urban air
in Microsoft our app store or access the
website through that URL is partly
available so we have evaluated our
service our ways the data from ten
cities three whether the accuracy of our
result we intentionally remove one
station from existing map and we can
infer the air quality of the location
using our air ISM then we can measure
the accuracy of the prediction using the
reading from the former station
conscious so we do such kind of
evaluation for each station each hour
and say how statistically accurate our
algorithm is in past one year as a
result our everything means about eighty
percent accurate in Beijing which is
much higher than existing measure using
bar used by environmentalist so which is
only about sixty percent so that means
the big data has bring twenty percent
jump on accuracy beyond the stead of art
so that's a very big data you can refer
to my paper
published at a KD deal last year for
details of the research the next example
is about identifying the functional
region of city using to power of data
human mobility and the point of interest
data so this is the result so with
presenting you here it's a real resolve
page in the red region means educational
and science area of Beijing and black
area means at the once commercial area
but I want to emphasize that the
functional region it's not single it has
a region has a mark all functions so the
region sharing the similar color really
have the similar distribution across
different functions on the other hand
even the region was recognized as a
educational area it does not mean every
part of the region is serving
educational functions so we need to
further identify the kernel density
distribution of each kind of functional
region so this figure shows the kernel
density function of commercial area in
Beijing where the darker color is the
high probability this location could be
commercial area so for each kind of
function region we can build such kind
of kernel density distribution so white
need what do we need use to power up
data so that's of data it's very
intuitive to use point of each data
because if we say there are none of
university in region this region could
be educational area that only using
point of into data is not enough because
theta is static in the database let's
take a look at example showing that
failure of the bottom slice there are
two restaurants are post recorded as a
Chinese restaurant in the PIO I database
but clearly they have different meanings
one could be build in neighborhood
serving local p7 local papers but
neither one could be built in commercial
area or tourist attractions so using
human mobility data we can differentiate
the POS or the sim category and also
point of entry data can differentiate
the functional regions itself let's take
a look at this example if we say the
majority of people live in a location in
the morning and coming back in the
location to the location in the evening
then most likely this region could be a
residential area so that's the reason
why I need to comment open up data um
how we evaluate our service mmm we can
compare the results generated by our
matter in two consecutive years and say
whether the change makes sense okay here
we can say region a was recognized as an
emerging area in in Beijing which is
indicated by yellow but becomes but
became Karimi which means on the
construction area in 2011 after started
we found this is the the tallest
building of the gene is truly under
construction in this area so this region
is truly under construction that means
our algorithm accurately I clear this
change in the city so another example is
region B which was recognized as a green
area of meat which means Park Nature and
Park but later later become a black area
which means commercial area so this is
actually the Chamber's tree around the
Olympic game this tree has been revealed
with hundreds of shops and stores
located here now it's truly a commercial
area and they will also compare our
result against a land use of Beijing
this is a one g area which was planned
for residential area in the you are
without the majority of praise was
identified as an emerging residential
area which is correct
I will also find some proper area which
means emerging commercial area this is
not bad but we need to let our city
planner knows so they can have a better
planning for the future
in the third example we are going to
start the real time gas consumption your
city so let me ask you one question
um who can tell me how many liter of gas
has been consumed in past one hour in
Beijing I think nobody can answer this
question and then we don't even have
data available so how will you achieve
that okay we use GPS equipped with tax
cap as a sensor to infer auto detect
they're queuing time in his gas station
that means that the time they spent for
reviewing their cars came and then based
on the reading time we can infer the
lens of Q then we know how many workers
are there being refilled assume each
each Baker's has been fueled 40 K forty
liter gas then we can infer the gas
consumption of the entire gas station so
if we can do such kind of calculation
for each station so we can crops grasp
the gas consumption of entire city and
pass one hour so what is researcher for
very simple application scenario is gas
station commentation based on in terms
of Willingham so usually we are not we
were looking for some gas station we
said short is Q by the closed gas
station is no not really the quickest
one so I prefer try where e100 father
and they'll find a better one but more
what was more important is our research
can improve energy infrastructure of the
city for example if we see an area where
we always find a lot of people a
refueling in their car and people have
to wait for very long period of time so
probably we need to consider your
additional station around the state and
at this area on the other side if we
found some region where guests are
having overbilled
probably we can shut down some station
temporary or reduce the staff working
there and we can also tell government to
number people
who are refueling their car in gas
station at any hour for example in the
morning rush hour there about 60,000
people are there in gas station Beijing
and average' Billingham is about 30
minutes in workday but when time goes to
8:00 p.m. in the Union the everyday
Willingham is about six minutes so I
usually choose this time to refuel make
her this figure shows the results we
have why I would emphasize we are not
infer to get something or get
consumption of test caps we are using
gas test cap as a sensor to infer the
gas consumption a kiss consumption of
all the Lakers in the city so we can
compare the hill map of the Torah's out
figure beef shows the time span by test
caps and figured it shows the time spent
by all recurse you can see the
difference and figure series shows the
heat map in terms of taxes with it and
figure it shows the urban which that
means all week course with it there are
some regions we found there are none of
test cap for the median region a but in
terms of the total number of liquors
here is not not not many so that's the
value of a research so let me summarize
what's urban commuting some thicker we
measured our region is 3 B that means
using big data to tell big city speak
challenging all methodology is rehab
that is data management data mining
inversion learning and our results is a
win-win situation among people city in
environment so in an even shorter code
is read BMW that's purple computing
thank you for your attention
now for more information you can search
for urban commuting on the internet and
you can get slide tech and paper even
the data about the research
thank you for attention now I'm handing
the talk to Professor drew from Java
University thank you
this is he I mean to in and very
Shanghai University in Shanghai China
try change so my project is about
crowdsourcing based bourbon noise
mapping with smartphones but this is
aqua all my talk stop to our talk about
the motivation of the project second I
will talk about the design of our system
which we call it noise sense and next I
will discuss how we implement with the
surveys from Microsoft Asia and finally
I conclude my talk our pockets of annoys
definitely noise he the excessive sound
that may harm the activity or balance of
human life and in daily life noise
pollution is everywhere so the noise can
be caused by traffic on the road or
caused by machines in construction or
caused by loud music on streets and long
term exposure noise pollution may lead
to emotional - physiological and
psychological effects and they are there
actually many harmful effects for
example related related diseases include
hearing impairment hypertension is
chemical heart disease and etc and along
the effects may result in changes to
immune system and birth defects so it is
really important for the public to know
what is the noise label and try to avoid
long-term exposure to noise pollution
he is no what is the noise label at a
given location in sunset in timeslots
unfortunately it is really limited they
are limited ways for the general public
to know what is the noise level at a
given time a given location so one
available way is to actually install
measurement stations and the people can
read the noise level from the display
but this method has limited coverage and
the general public is difficult to to
read to access the north's data beeps
tape reading the in of noise pollution
is to develop a noise mapping service so
this picture on the right gave one
example so what is the noise mapping
service so essentially we add one
overlay on the map so then this overlay
gives the the information the noise
level at a given location at the
presence or at a time in the past so by
using this noise mapping service wise
able to quarry the noise level at a time
and at any location this user may
interested in the goal of the project is
build a cross sizing based system for
large-scale fine grained urban noise
mapping I would like to emphasize this
project still ongoing and not finished
yet the technique of it so first of all
by using this noise mapping service the
general public is able to assess the
exposure to noise pollution and clock
measures can be taken to avoid Londa
exposure and a second the authority or
local government can better understand
the situation of noise pollution of a
given City
and may we impose of example laws when
it is necessary
and finally urban planners can take the
noise pollution into consideration when
they are planning urban areas next I
will talk about the design of our Tipton
annoyance basically a system tries to
leverage the technique we call it
crowdsourcing which is a very popular
approach now to try to make use of the
power of the cloud so the main idea of
our system is the following
so by it each smartphone can measure the
noise label at a given location with its
embedded microphone so by recruiting a
large number of individual smartphones
exactly the mean crowdsourcing it is
possible to collect a large data set of
noise data in an urban area and about
collecting and processing the noise data
across smartphones we can provide the
noise mapping service to a given open
area then the general public can look at
the service and get the idea what is the
noise level of one particular location
at a time but a given x slot for example
so our system our tech day it's showing
in this we are we are using the surveys
from Microsoft Asia so basically on the
bottom we have a large number of
smartphones and each smartphone will
measure the data the noise data and
share the data with the cloud so on the
cloud side we we make use of several
services from Microsoft Asia we use Asia
storage to store the data Ronda Ronda
forms and we use our computing resources
like some of virtual machines to process
the data and also we use our cloud
service
to to get the data from the smartphone's
and also we use Asia web website service
to provide a noise mapping service then
you ders example text our clients can
you their brothers to accept to access
the noise maybe service smartphone users
can use Malcolm air to access the noise
maggie service in buildings are
consistent they are typical engines so
first we have to accommodate a large
number of sensing terminals so in our
case that is asthma pons and the number
of users can be large so again we have
to accommodate a large number of
students and their requests so second
smartphones are not designed for noise
measurements and a measurement made by
us Mapo may contain error so in this
case we have two calibration and finally
smoking odors are reluctant to perform
sensing tasks to collect noise data for
us so we have to to provide incentive to
the smartphone audience first of all I
talked about how we calibrate okay so in
this slide I purses show errors can be
very large so as you can see on the left
a big picture we show the measurements
made by a smartphone and also the true
value which is strong annoys level meter
which is a professional meter so as you
can see there is a big gap between the
two curves and the error can be as large
as 15 DBA okay on the right this curve
is empirical CDF of the errors so as you
can see around 40 percent of the errors
is larger than 15 DBA so that is a real
big problem
our approach calibration is motivated by
one observation so we plot the scatter
plot of the data from the smartphone's
and also the measurement plant a
professional meter so x-axis is my own
measurements y-axis is the true value so
as you can see there is a clear linear
relationship between the two values so
we can use example reparation techniques
to derive the slope of the line and also
we need to derive the offset in order to
calibrate the measurements from the
smartphone's based on this operation
with time we design one intervention
free calibration so here are emphasized
that it is in the beta free that means
smartphone users don't need to put any
input in order to do this our
calibration so this approach consists of
two components wise no debase the
calibration and the second crossing
based the calibration so first we
introduce know the basic calibration so
this is actually simple so by using
these no debates calibration each node
can automatically find what is what is
offset for this smartphone so the idea
is to find our common quiet base so
based on this space we can compute it
offset okay so after having this upset
we can calibrate all the measurements by
this by this smartphone and output is
correct it's close to the true value but
the major problem with this know debase
the calibration be that it takes time
okay that the latency can be large so in
order to address this issue we propose
another another component which is a
crowdsourcing based calibration so
idea of this components as a simple
different forms different poems of the
same model they share similar offset
okay so after phone already get the
offset this object can be shared through
a clock for example so the idea is we
build a table or a napping what is
offset for a given for a given
smartphone model then a new smartphone
with our calibration if they can look up
a wooden offset for this model and then
get the object for this for this
smartphone so by doing so this
calibration latency can be significantly
reduced next we talk about how we
provide incentive in general as ma
commuters are we locked ins to provide
sensing data to the system so the main
reasons are the following our first
sensing noise data consumes resources
for example computing resources and
energy and a second by providing
resources there's a risk of privacy
bridge so it is really important to
provide enough incentive to the
smartphone users in order to get a large
number a large number of smartphone
users to share their noise measurements
our idea is to her by intent to of
example money or points and we build a
system which is based on reverse auction
model so we knew the idea of auction so
first of all the platform will announce
what is what is the available things in
task and the smartphones can compete for
these tasks by providing a pitch to the
platform and the problem will determine
which are winning asthma phones okay
next
smartphones will collect the noise data
and share the data with the platform and
eventually the platform will pay the
money
Anna based on thieves a framework we
propose a truce for auction Magnussen in
essence this mechanism consists of two
algorithms one is task allocation
algorithm to determine which winning
smartphones and they will provide the
data and the second algorithm is a novel
payment scheme okay so I'm not going to
talk about the details of this algorithm
design if you are interested you can
refer to my papers so one paper is in a
super import on this year and another
one is in our choco Yi I see TCS again
this year
next I would about how we implement this
system with the help of windows Asia
this showed that inner framework of data
flow and processing so on the Left we
have the lower data from the smartphones
and on the cloud side we reviewed data
receiver component to receive all the
raw data but the raw data may contain
errors so we need a filter to fill all
the errors and eventually these data
will store in the cloud storage and this
data will be processed in order to
arrive a given a given noise level for a
given location and for a given time slot
and the web service will display oh-o-oh
give this noise label at a given
location at given time slot to any
others so this is what we say a noise
mapping service building on building on
windows asian we actually use several
services of windows asia first of all we
use cloud service
for data receiver and second part we use
virtual machine to to build to deploy
our data processing algorithms and also
also we use cloud storage from the Asia
to store the raw data and also we use
circle server servic service runs on
windows asian to store the data to show
on the website on the website and and
and also we're the web site service of
the windows asia to show the noise
mapping service and we build its mark on
apples but using the smartphone app a
user can share the data with the cloud
and also the user is able to access the
noise mapping service so as you can see
in this slide there are four pictures so
picture one show what is the noise label
at the current location of this Yoda and
the second page showed the noise mapping
service so basically this our map and on
top of map we add an overlay to show the
noise label at different locations at
present and it is also able to show the
noise label at Klein's of the past and
picture 3 show how many points you
earned and the last picture show how
many things in tasks you can compete
Paul in this slide we show how Windows
Windows Microsoft Azure can help in
noise data collection for a large number
of smartphones so the major challenge
here is the number of smartphones
contributing data to the cloud can be
very large so the data receiver should
be scalable to be scalable so the
solution we are using is we make use of
cloud service which is assuring sharing
pole to the number of smart phones when
the number of smartphones is large
the cloud service will create more
instances to address these large number
of smartphones and the number of smoke
bombs are become smaller the number of
instances are decrease so it is scalable
and the data from the smoke bombs will
be stored in the cloud storage across
Asia it is called a blow so which is a
very convenient to use to store to store
the key to store the data in each slide
we discuss how the data is stored in the
cloud so basically there are two kinds
of two kinds of data we should store on
the cloud one data is raw data London
smartphones so we store this kind of
data in cloud storage using using the
concept bra and the second type of data
is to show on the North mapping service
so this is a more frequently shown or
exist by by the users so this data will
be stored in Serco server again this is
the service from Microsoft angel in this
slide we show how we view the web the
website and the web pages for showing
these noisemap in service so on the
cloud side we make use of the web the
website service on the Microsoft Asia so
again that the major challenging is this
service or this website should be
scalable to the number of users so when
the number of users is a very large the
web the web service you create more
instances to address to accommodate so
large number of users and and for
example at night the number of users
becomes smaller we can use smaller
instances on the web site and on the
client site we develop web pages based
on the API our bean Maps okay
that is how we can show an overlay on
top of the electronic online maps and
also we developed javascript to show to
show the noise label at a given location
okay really conclude my talk in
conclusion we leverage the power of 30
sensing with muffins to build a noise
mapping service and by this service the
general public can quarry the noise
label at any location at any time and
windows asia really facilitate
large-scale urban computing by providing
Clouser cloud services websites virtual
machines and storage and I have to
acknowledge that many age of features
and services are yet to explore in this
project thank you
ok thank you so much for attending
were there any additional the presenters
have any closing remarks ok I think we
have another 12 minutes for Q&amp;amp;A so if
you have any question you can type into
the dialog box and then here is a
question for professor - yes ok the
question is about the noise mapping
service apparently it looks like a
mobile a PP dot evoking access and due
to - no the mapping of maybe Shanghai is
that is right yes and the question is
it's not aligned yet because this
project is still ongoing and it is not
available to the general public yet but
for example after half a year I hope
this service available to anybody in the
wall ok and then
question is the how to use the noise map
because we can see that the the noise
map shows the current noise condition
mmm but but how do you use that result
I mean you know day to day as a regular
Yoda there are several ways to access
our surveys so one simple way is to look
at what is the noise label and our given
area at the present okay but if you are
interested in the noise level for
example in the past three days or one
month you can use the history data
Explorer 8 expiration okay so basically
on on our website they are several there
are several menus you can choose so by
for example by collecting the most
noises there is a pain and noise noisy
places in the in the campus then the web
page will show and locations okay do I
answer the question yes thank you very
much
okay and there's another question for
dr. Cheung the questions like this you
have highlighted three be big challenges
in big cities with big data however in
the era of big data is always a
challenge to find a data could you share
experience with us about how to find a
big any useful data for research so
thank you for the question um our dealer
actually comes from Sri parts first one
is Microsoft has its own data sets like
porno page of data and ruin our data so
we have been map service the second part
of data comes from public portals of
Garmin website such as New York City has
opened their data source for doing
research and there are other cities even
China is share some data source
we can also collaborate the sir part is
we can class um data through cooperation
collaboration with academia and the
garments for example we're collaborating
with MEP as Chinese environmental
protection ministry so they're Sheriff's
with air quality data of different
cities to enable our students to that's
an experience that way class data that
we collect data in this big data error
but I think it's true it's not easy to
get data and it's always most important
thing to collect data first okay thank
you very much and now there's another
question for professor to this question
is is like this you will you use
crowdsourcing to collect your thoughts
and how how do you ensure their privacy
issue because you are collecting
information from their mobile home you
know this is a very good and a very
important question so privacy is
actually a very important a very
important issue here and I think it is
it is true for many similar projects
okay so you collect data across
smartphones so in our case each
smartphone will share its noise
measurements along with its location and
a device ID right so in this case
location is a concern location private
is concerned so in order to ensure
privacy of users of smartphones just
know there's no leak right so we we must
use techniques to protect this privacy
but I have to say privacy is still a
very important it's still very hot topic
research topic and many people still
doing different techniques to protect
the privacy so go back to our
we can use several techniques for
example we can use encryption to make
sure the data trans communication
between smartphone and a cloud cloud can
is safe and is a secure that means no
other people can read the data from the
smartphone so that is one and a second
in order to make sure the location
privacy is is ensured we can use for
example add a noise to the location okay
so no accurate location of the user is
release and also we can use example
anonymization to make sure that the ID
is protected okay so that is a few our
potential solutions but they are this is
a very important research question okay
so many research efforts should be made
yes thank you okay good there's another
question coming for you it's a shown
question maybe asking for short answer
does the data storage layer use Hadoop
the question for me yes I think so in
our case in our case we don't use Hadoop
yet because at the present the
processing applied to this data still
quite simple so we simply store the data
and periodically process the data and
store the result in the SQL Server but
Hadoop is certainly very useful when we
apply more processing requirements yeah
that is my answer
okay thank you there's another one for
you
he started the I just read the question
okay he asked her why role data is sent
from phone to the data processor server
doesn't it cause a lot of data traffic
for users oh process
on the phone yeah maybe that is
inaccurate working warding so actually
in our in our project we don't send raw
data actually we send a noise level
measured by this smartphone so the data
data traffic is actually very very low
okay so don't worry about this thank you
for these for the question okay alright
and there is an question coming for it
dr. Cheung it says where you release
your full data of your urban air
relevant paper published in ktd 2013 on
your website okay so we have already
released the air quality data of page
nhi higher to city in past one year but
regarding other data sets such as point
of interest data and their own network
data it's very says at you but we are
considering release the features
features extracted from the two data
sets so hopefully we could put the
features on our website but that's
enough for for your research yeah okay
okay there's a question for both I will
ask it professor jewel first I don't I
don't know if you have the experience
with ec2 from Amazon but the question is
can you compare Asia with ec2 from
Amazon do we have any experience with
yeah thank you thank you for the
question but unfortunately I've never
been I've never used an ec2 yes okay so
there may be in future I can okay so we
will just skip this question okay and I
because of time I have one last question
and then we'll wrap up we we hope to
close at five o'clock sharp
I have a question for dr. Chen we know
we know that your air quality project
you can measure the places where
actually there is no quality air quality
meters right so my question is is it
possible to forecast the air quality
like well ideally for someone like
forecasting the weather you know that
maybe tomorrow there will be PM 2.5 to
be how many yes thank you for giving me
this opportunity to liberate on our
project so we are actually working on
air quality forecasting that means we
can predict the air quality in future
hours such as what's air call in six
hours later or six hours 12 hours later
the prediction accuracy is not there
right now I began we are very promising
to have it service available in but then
obvious a year that's very promising
yeah yeah it'll be very excited if we
can know what the PM 2.5 to be for next
to next week oh no that's where people
exciting they'll be very difficult we
are predicting a very short future okay
short distance or future two hours now
twelve hours yeah Tora power it's
possible yes very exciting okay because
of time we have to stop here but before
we close I want to make a little bit
ahead of at Iceland so again please go
to Asia for research comm Asia for
therefore is one two three four for Asia
for research come you can find a lot of
more information there and our upcoming
deadline for the Asia for research RP is
in is on June 15 so please you can go to
the HR for research and look at into
this program and submit your proposal
you may be able to win a sizable as a
resource for your research and I want to
thank Papa that you and dr. Cheung for
wonderful presentation today and they
wonderfully presented the possibility to
use cloud to solve city problems as a
new and exciting area that we hope to
attract more researchers to work on this
and hope this webinar Prince Valley to
