by Southwest edu we've got a great
workshop we've been working on it's
going to talk about how we can use
project-based learning teaching with a
narrative so integrating a story and
then how we can use some open resources
to get students really learning and get
them really engaged this workshops
really going to stand out at South by
Southwest because we're not only sharing
some of the open resources and the tools
like chromosome we're also sharing some
of the educational framework we've been
using so we've got the Kronos umar's
guild and we've got zombie based
learning and we'll use those as examples
of how we can engage students and get
them learning really deep south by
southwest Education Week is a unique
opportunity for teachers to see new
tools that can really revolutionize
what's happening in the classroom we're
just really excited to have chromosome
be a part of that last year of
chromosome 1 the South by Southwest
Interactive award for education resource
this year we've developed an authoring
tool that lets anyone use krona zoom to
create a timeline that captures any
period of history Crona zoom is going to
give teachers a new way to present
historical information to encourage
their students to develop content to
create timelines to share their own
learning with their classmates and with
their teachers to show what they're
learning in their classes chrono zoom is
not a Content destination resource you
shouldn't go to chromosome and expect to
find timelines that cover everything
that's ever happened in history Crona
zoom is a content creation tool and the
authoring system is really designed to
make it easy for students and teachers
to create their own timelines we can
build stories that students will really
respond to and get deeper into the
curriculum integrating a story or a
narrative into project-based learning
isn't just about having a fun layer on
top it's really about integrating the
story into the proj
concepts with zombie based learning we
use a zombie apocalypse to set the
geography projects so a student is now
engaging in geography research and
planning and presenting what they would
do a zombie apocalypse in the kronos
rumors guilt we use a time travel story
to teach history and students begin to
research some of the causes of major
historical events and think of how that
would impact if it was changed by time
travel I know my students were really
excited about project-based learning
because they had choices they could
bring in their own interests and they
were participating in their own learning
