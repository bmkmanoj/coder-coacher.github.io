for gestural interactions on the move
the wrist-worn sensor allows the full 3d
pose of the users hand to be recovered
in real time while removing the need for
wearing a data glove that covers the
entire hand
the recovered hand pose can easily be
used to recognize diverse gestures even
while on the move our system can be used
in a variety of scenarios including 3d
gaming and augmented reality where both
discrete or continuous hand gestures can
be used to control input as the devices
wrist-worn no line-of-sight to an
external sensor placed in the
environment is required the user can
perform subtle gestures while resting
their hands on their leg or table digits
is built using only off-the-shelf
hardware the main components are a wrist
worn infrared camera infrared laser line
generator additional diffuse infrared
illumination and an inertial measurement
unit
one interesting interaction possibility
digits enables is 3d spatial interaction
around a mobile device that is seemingly
interweaved with traditional touch
interaction here the user starts
semantic zooming using an in air pinch
gesture and continuously controls the
zoom factor with the remaining fingers
another gesture is used for panning the
interface or manipulating an object once
it has been selected through touch
another interesting design space for
digits is eyes-free interactions where
no visual feedback was required to
control a mobile device
in this example the user controls
functions of a mobile device while the
device is left in the pocket here the
user turns on the radio switches
channels by mimicking returning of
identity changes the volume by moving an
invisible slider up and down and finally
answers a call by doing a thumb-up
gesture
digits can also be used for fine-grained
3d interactions for example as a
wearable gaming controller in this
example the user mimics a gun with their
fingers to shoot targets and navigates
within the virtual environment by
performing a grabbing motion and moving
the arm and also selecting objects using
hand gestures we have presented digits a
wrist worn sensor that recovers the full
3d pose of the users hand in real-time
while removing the need to cover the
entire hand of the user thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
