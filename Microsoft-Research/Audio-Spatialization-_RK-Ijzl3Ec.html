researcher at the maxim research so our
project is about how to specialize the
audio in order to improve the user
experience in multiparty audio
conferencing so the limitation with the
current CEO confidence system is that
all the remote voices are mixed into a
single channel so you have to spend
effort in identify who is talking and
was was discussed about and this is that
different from in a face-to-face meeting
in fists this meeting all the voices are
coming from different relations so we
can use our natural ability called the
cocktail party effect to tune to the
voice from different duration and we
have two scenarios to this to solve this
problem and here is my colleague itching
I have my name is shin i'm going to show
you the art technology using the
loudspeakers and here i'm showing the
die I am cerrito first I will ask you to
record a short message then I will play
back what I heard you can start or stop
recording at any time by pressing the
pound key okay let's get started please
record your message after the tone why
is it that sometimes when you start with
an address in the children and dogs each
hate the other Alec offices just
completed a speedy man can beat this
track in India and Tommy's fails only my
voice will be handsome channel surround
completed how do email addresses get in
your address book yes what I heard who
here was funny focus so you hear my
voice but not much of the remote there
is a middle position in an ear and are
talking suppose only my voice will be
heard from the night episodes thank you
for calling goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
