hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
so welcome to ms are we are going to
have a speaker today Jay Davis who's
going to talk today about MOOCs she's
from the University of North Carolina
Chapel Hill works with Ken hillis and
she will be speaking for we have an hour
and I will promptly cut us off at 11 we
might have a little time for QA within
that window but so please join me in
welcoming James Jade Davis thank you for
that introduction the stand away from
the light as Merida said I'm Jade Lee
Davis I am a doctoral student at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill and the Department of Communication
Studies and what I'm presenting today is
the work I've completed here at
Microsoft Research New England as a
intern over the summer the title of my
project is tentatively students as end
users in the MOOC ecology it is a
working title so if you have something
that's a little bit sexier at the end of
this I would love to hear suggestions
I'm not quite there yet um but it's
basically what it says looking at
students in the MOOC ecology um so to
start with I think I should define what
MOOCs are there a term that I know lots
of people have it's a term but not
everybody knows what it is and what the
acronym stands for is massive open
online courses so the brief history of
MOOC starts in 2008 in Canada so it's
actually one of those wonderful media
things that comes from Canada and makes
its way to the United States with a
class called connectivism and connective
knowledge at the University of Manitoba
and this is in 2008 it's the first time
the term MOOC is used in the focus of
this class is on creating community
connections in order to use online tools
for learning outcomes um so it's
communities of learners in 2010 we have
this wonderful funded paper that comes
out of Canada called the MOOC model for
digital practice where they explained
MOOCs are about the connectivity of
social networking the facilitation of an
acknowledged expert in a field of study
and a collection of freely accessible
online resources but one of the things
that this makes very clear is it is
about the Community Connection amongst
learners so when we get when we look at
the 2008 one there's 25 people who are
actually enrolled at the school where
the course is being offered and there's
like 2,300 people who are just online
who want to learn with these people and
have some type of format where they can
participate and create knowledge if we
speed ahead from 2010 in this lovely
paper which is really available online
all the resources I'll be talking today
are accessible just to note we see a
movement of MOOCs from Canada to the
United States in a very interesting and
big way so we start having two terms
which I don't have a slide but I guess I
should write down we have see MOOCs and
ex monks and the United States is about
the X MOOC the C stands for community
and X is like multiplication how big can
we get this oops I went ahead on my size
I apologize for that um and we have two
articles that come out on November
second both of them in the New York
Times there was one that announced 2012
as the year of the MOOC and it got a lot
of press it made all the circulation
it's talking about these three big
companies on Udacity EDX and Coursera
who have sort of taken over this X moog
landscape and have become the talking
points that we use when we talk about
MOOCs and they have an article that
doesn't have an author called the big 3
MOOC providers that comes out on the
same day that's basically setting up
these three companies as the standard
big three companies that control the
entire sector that we're used to talking
about in media studies um what's
interesting about the three of these is
Udacity has started by somebody at
Stanford Sebastian throne and it is a
for-profit Coursera is also a for-profit
at EDX has started at Harvard and MIT at
it's an opera it so these two are both
in Silicon Valley and this one is here
in Cambridge Massachusetts so in terms
of how we talk about
moocs a lot of focus has been on these
companies what I'm really interested in
is how we configure students in this so
keep this image in mind it will come
back later on um the way that the
companies talk about students like if
you go through the press if you listen
to the talks that people are having
there's three different types of
students their students that come from
these top institutions that are the
founding institutions of the companies
so Stanford MIT Harvard and that's
basically it and that makes sense when
you think about who's talking about
these that's their realm of experience
so those are the schools that they know
um the other people that they talk about
that MOOCs can capture so basically if
we go back to the early see MOOC and
seeing the outside people that we want
to come in and learn with us are these
USA based education people so people at
other universities people who might have
done in education 20 years ago and
us-based education usually encompasses
like the whole educational sphere of
Western education and then a global
learner and what a global learner
student is is basically somebody who is
maybe in India as a common place that
they like to mention Africa is another
place that they really like to mention
where the founder of EDX he has the
story from Mongolia that he consistently
tells and you start having these um read
things made very very clear I want to go
back very quickly just to explain one
other difference that I about to mention
with these companies versus the
wonderful Canadian companies so the
Canadian companies were focusing on
creating these communities and networks
of learning and what's the main
difference with these companies as they
are platforms for learning so instead of
focusing on we can form a community with
these resources that we already have
maybe build a small tool they're
building a tool and then curating what's
hosted and how knowledge is disseminated
and where it's coming from in a way that
was not part of the original Canadian
model and the ideal candidates like the
way they're structuring what they're
going to put on there from what I can
tell is by thinking about how they can
target these students specifically the
ones
here which is why I have this term end
user which I will get into once I start
getting into the meat of my project but
it's an important term to keep in mind
so another thing to know about moocs is
the business model they're still working
this out this is one of those things
that blew up really really fast they all
announced that they were forming in
January of 2012 by November it's already
the year of the MOOC even though it
hadn't been a year and they get lots of
questions about how are we going to
monetize this what are your plans and
regardless to what their answers are
there usually somehow related to the
data that they have on their platforms
so they want to sell data about student
performance and potential employers they
want to offer their platforms as data
hosting services and storage for other
schools they can charge for this they
want to take their algorithms to figure
out how to optimize understanding how
students learn they just want to be a
platform in some cases completely
outside of education they want to verify
that the data that they have is accurate
and that individual users who are
operating in these systems are having
the outcomes that employers are looking
for and they're forming all of these
algorithms that potentially might be
something that can be monetized at a
later time to outside of the platform I
can't say that this is the absolute
business model but if you start looking
at how they speak about it these are
certainly themes that come up when they
talk about that and response to
questions about well what are your plans
for monetization in the future and they
is the CEOs and spokespeople for these
companies and also their blogs which I
like to think of as a day because
there's somebody writing it um so on to
my projects um the central question that
I had with my project was what are their
cultural effects of turning students
into end-users specifically as it
relates to move I spent a lot of time
gathering a bunch of press sources and
interviews and talks at the CEOs
co-founders spokes people &amp;amp; blogs were
making about the companies and did a
very broad thematic coding what was
amazing with all the press stuff as I
started noticing that a bunch of the
legal documents were being made
available to because of the freedom of
information act so I like contracts
between course hair
the University of Michigan and the
University of Maryland I have some
financial agreements for EDX that I was
able to see a partial contract with
Udacity and Georgia Tech is also freely
available online and these things were
publicized on Inside Higher at in The
Chronicle of education as they've been
doing like massive amounts on coverage
of MOOCs which i think is how most
people know about them after I did the
thematic coding the why of the project
is sort of how can we really understand
the student by looking at these two
conversations so there are literally two
conversations happening and that is
there's the public conversation that's
coming from the company spokespeople and
that one has a very set narrative
there's themes that we can see across
all of the companies but then there's a
legal one and at the end of the day
regardless to what they're saying we do
have to abide by legal for legal terms
so it becomes a really interesting way
to juxtapose what's happening at that
space and what it means for students um
so what I'll be talking about for the
rest of the talk are these three things
on the first thing i would like to look
at is what company say about themselves
and that's the discursive space of
public discourse the second part is what
companies don't say about themselves so
looking at the legal framework they're
putting it out there but they aren't
necessarily saying it explicitly and you
have to search or have a desire to read
something like a terms of use to be able
to see that conversation and my
understanding is most people don't cuss
its walls of text and the third part is
looking at the cultural implications of
these two conversations being put
together so you want to what they say
about themselves
for the project it's a case study of
Coursera and the reason I'm focusing on
Coursera is because if you look at like
market footprints partner institutions
new stories that come out about how many
people are in these classes Coursera
right now has the biggest presence and
they're partnering with them a more
diverse type of institution so in
addition to like universities they
partner with museums and they give a lot
of press like their co-founder and
co-ceo Daphne Koller who I will be
talking about she is just a placeholder
um talks a lot she writes article she
does interviews and she's sort of all
over the place so she's an integral part
of the story but I don't want her to be
the face um to talk about this my
wonderful place holder um I will be
going through her TED talk um she gave a
TED talk in june of 2012 that Ted global
TED talks are these wonderful things
because you can all access them after
this talk if you're curious to hear
everything that she said they have
transcripts available and they are these
very scripted media events so it's
something where she went through this
was probably checked with other people
to make sure she was hitting all the
points that she wanted to hit on for her
talk what we can learn from online
education um what is really interesting
about this talk um and this is one of
the themes that we see across the place
is when we start framing this story are
not we but when the story gets framed by
the spokespeople of these companies they
usually start with a little biographical
thing I'm this person I'm amazing which
is what she does she is this person and
she is amazing she's a third generation
academic she always went to the best
universities and she just took that for
granted and then she heard this horrible
story about South Africa where the
higher education system was built around
a part ID for the white elite in South
Africa and at one point a few spots
became open for the University and
people lined up for a mile to try to get
one of these few spots the night before
when the gates open of course there's a
stampede and somebody gets injured and a
mother dies and this is an actual slide
from the Ted
talk so she says this was a mother who
gave her life trying to get an education
for her son and he comes this pivotal
thing to show why education is so
important like ah there are people in
the world who are literally dying for
this thing that we just have and I say
this thing that we just have because the
next thing that happens and this is
again not just staff nikola from
Coursera this is all of them we move
from these people who are really
struggling who have real limits on the
access to education to the United States
so after she says she was a mother who
gave her life for it trying to get an
education person she basically takes a
one second pause and says but in the
United States so the but in the United
States part is we also have these
problems with the cost of health care
but don't forget education because the
cost has been going up so much that we
should remember about this mother who's
fighting but remember that we also have
these problems with cost and they do
another thing that's all that's very
interesting and again I think part of
this is their own framing and where
they're coming from but they separate
out the people from their institutions
so we start with the African mother and
her son who might or might not be able
to get access to education we move to
the people in the United States who have
these problems with education in terms
of costs and then we immediately move to
the people at these top institutions is
what she says in this talk and other
talks other people call them elite
institutions um Harvard MIT and Stanford
there's a theme here um that don't have
these problems and by problems I mean
not just the cost but the fact that
education is suddenly a lifelong
endeavor and you constantly need to be
refreshing this and coming back and
trying to learn more because if you
aren't you're risking your ability to
earn for a life mstar seeing as this
thing that can make it so that you will
always have access to and these are not
my words these are Daphne Koller swears
and out agarwal from EDX and Sebastian
throne from Udacity the best education
from the best universities in the world
so they really see themselves as
delivering the best but the impetus is
on the individual to take advantage of
that and go and learn from
it but there is a group that does not
need this and I think that's a really
important distinction because all of
them say in interviews when they're
asked you know well what if somebody can
get into Stanford or Harvard or MIT I
might be a big oh no they should
definitely go so there's this belief
that there's something that's coming
from there that is different than
everywhere else and that's one of those
things that they talk to and that's also
one of the justifications they have for
providing their services we have the
best students you we have the best
people you can access them to so outside
of those themes I'm going to go right
back into the TED talk and go to wear
this ended and I think this is a really
important thing to see the words and
hear them set out loud because it sort
of sets up some of the dynamics
altogether that they're playing on with
students so MOOCs would enable a wave of
innovation because amazing talent can be
found anywhere maybe the next Albert
Einstein or the next Steve Jobs is
living somewhere in a remote village in
Africa and if we could offer that person
in education they would be able to come
up with the next big idea and make the
world a better place for all of us so in
addition to MOOCs filling the gaps that
are happening with the u.s. education
system there is also this idea that
maybe that South African child that she
starts with will be the person who is
the next great person in history um as
defined by Albert Einstein's and Steve
Jobs so if we go back to this model that
I asked you to pay attention to we can
start making this more specific um with
how they're talking about it so the
students from the top institutions are
students from Stanford Harvard and MIT
um and then we have the university
student from the USA who is either a
past student or a current student but
it's simply a student who is in the West
who is not at one of these institutions
and then we have the African Indian or
somewhere else student or learner was
the person who is this untapped
potential who wouldn't have access to
education otherwise so MOOCs are sort of
filling in that bottom space people at
the top are safe one of the things that
I didn't say that makes students
orton is when you actually go through
and sort of count the words the most
common word that she uses in the TED
talk is student she uses at 62 times um
she doesn't start there in there with
the word but when she goes in and talks
about what they're doing it's very very
student centric and I think it's really
interesting that when they frame it they
make a point to never start with student
for the most part but it's definitely
the thing that happens right in the
middle but not the thing that's designed
to stick in the same way so Oh
understand this pyramid is it is it like
a foundation yeah so this is sort of a
foundation that supporting MOOCs like
this is who they're targeting and up
here are people who I mean Harvard has
explicitly said no we don't want our
students taking MOOCs because there is
it something that you get from actually
being on site on this campus that we
think is different so this is a
foundation and I'll keep coming back to
this so if by the end you still aren't
understanding we can explore it again
but since I have a time crunch thank you
um so I just went over some of the basic
very large themes that are happening in
the discursive area around students and
sort of how the student is being framed
and now I'm going to move on to what
they don't say about themselves and this
is the legal conversation and I'm going
to start with this wonderful activity
for all of us which isn't really an
activity which is just a big giant piece
of the contract these slides are going
to be very very text heavy and like I
said in the beginning as a cultural
practice we tend to just glaze over the
legal stuff and click through the I
accept thing and just move on to a
service but it's really hard to take
legal text and pull them out and
maintain meaning because they use really
large broad sentences so I've reproduced
those here to go over this part but
hopefully I've organized it in such a
way that it's not like oh gosh what's
happening to me um so I have these
little circles to help think through the
legal framework because this is a
conversation that's not being said so
there's not a narrative that I can say
this is the narrative around the legal
framework I'm sort of creating it right
here and one of the things that I think
makes MOOCs different and does this
thing where students become end users
which is a legal terminology
was the first slide that did anybody
actually read the first slide okay
awesome so that means that you saw that
at the end it said end users so if you
log on to a MOOC you are not a student
you are in an end user and that is a
legal subject position that we are going
to be discussing um and it's different
from being a student so when we think of
universe the university experience and
what it means to be a student the
cultural things that I think we can talk
about based on the legal documents are
what is the campus experience there's
some guarantee that you're going to get
an education you have an association
with the school that you're going to
there's this wonderful thing called
FERPA that protects your privacy and we
have legal gray areas that come up in
MOOCs such as various and intellectual
property that i will talk about in the
third section but i'll start to talk
about here as sort of a primer to
understand that legally um but moving on
from here starting with the campus
experience so in the publicly available
contracts from Coursera on the ones that
they wrote with the University of
Michigan and university of maryland and
these are documents that are signed by
the company which is what they call
themselves and the university which is
what they call the university these
aren't something that's put out to the
students they have this designation
called registered student and what this
means is that there are some people who
might log on to MOOCs who get to take
the class for credit they have an
agreement with the university that says
students can do this it's written to the
contract the terms are very very
specific and one of the things that is
in both of the contracts that I think is
very interesting is that the number of
distance learners and the number of
on-site learners cannot be equal if you
are doing this for credit there needs to
be more you can exceed the number of
distant corners so if Coursera is the
one who's primarily providing the
educational service to the number of
students you have from that school
they're obligated to follow the Coursera
contract and not the University contract
was it which is interesting because as a
student as a university again you get
certain legal protections and guarantees
um one of the things that you also get
that isn't necessarily able able to be
replicated in legal documents as a
campus experience
and by that I mean part of what's sold
in the media when we talk about school
is this idea that you go somewhere and
you do something you sit around on the
campus you have these learning
experiences and it's sort of this
romanticized image that we have of what
education is and if you go to their
websites you see the pictures of actual
campuses and it's beautiful there trying
to look like these education sites from
universities that try to sell this
experience but they can't offer that so
I think it's extremely interesting that
they make a very clear definition of
what it means to be on-site and off-site
and that that affects how we can think
of people because if you have a bunch of
people to class or like well let's go do
something and a bunch of people who are
then it's a little bit strange um the
next thing is a guarantee now I
understand that this is one of those
things that might be up for debate we
cannot say that there's an absolute
guarantee that when you go to a
university classroom you're getting an
education and you're getting what you
came to get but there are protocols that
make it so that you can go and you can
talk to a department chair you have
course evaluations where you can
complain theoretically you have access
to office hours and all of these ways to
ensure that you're actually getting what
you think you're supposed to get with
MOOCs in the terms of service they have
a big giant disclaimer that says we
can't guarantee anything we can't give
you access to anybody from one of these
partner institutions that we have listed
on our site and you also don't get any
of the resources we are not liable for
basically anything that happens in this
site including the educational part
which is interesting because when we put
that in conversation with the discourse
that's sort of what they're selling its
access to the best education in the
world and they explicitly say in the
terms of use by the way don't complain
to us as that happens and I think
there's like a twenty dollar limit on
their liability if they don't give you
what you thought you were going to get
but you have to pay prolly to legal
proceedings um the next thing is an
association so part of picking schools
is picking places that will be a part of
you for the rest of your life um when
you go and you submit a resume for a job
or you some your cv you usually list the
institutions that you went to schools
are ranked we know the difference
between our one or two or three all
those things have meaning
and being associated with different
institutions gives people different
assumptions about you um and this is one
of the things that Coursera sort of
trades on like in their contracts they
have a specific thing say we get to use
the brand of the University we're going
to use your name and your logo in the
terms of use they tell the student no
not you you don't get to do this you are
not associated with them um and that is
again very different than what's
happening in traditional higher
education and something that's important
and interesting that it's happening in
the legal space especially we think that
these are students taking classes from
these places they're actually taking the
perm individuals um so the next thing
that I think is really important is
FERPA or the Family Educational Rights
and Privacy Act and this is something
that was passed in nineteen seventy four
and it allows students at schools that
receive state funding to have some
protections with regards to their
records it allows them to have some
recourse if their records are wrong when
they access them to get them corrected
and it allows them to have the
information of where they are be public
or private because MOOCs are not actual
educational institutes they don't fall
under this protection so this is one of
those things that people aren't
necessarily talking about a lot there's
been a couple of blog posts on it but
it's something to keep in mind that I
think is a big distinction between a
student and an end user we need to ask
what are the privacy protections for end
users especially if they are posting
stuff that they would like to later on
mobilize in order to get into a
different school or get a new job and
how much of that information is going to
be made made public um the next part and
this is going to bleed over to part
three is the idea of intellectual
property for this I'm going to speak
with both the contract between the
universities and the terms of use
because it's really easy to dismiss
something like a terms of use as this is
just standard practice this is just the
way legal jargon looks what we say in
those so it's not a big deal but because
we have these two legal documents that
were designed for different audiences we
can start to see choices that were made
um so one of the things that happens in
the contracts with the University of
Michigan and the University of Maryland
with regards to ownership of
intellectual property and content
that the university retail retains
rights to their content they don't give
them a license to modify it they aren't
allowed to distribute it outside of the
platform and once their contract is over
all ownership rights go back to the
people and they maintain um distribution
rights um this is very different than
what happens to end users in the Terms
of Service and this is one of those
things that I'm going to read because
it's a snippet that happens like pretty
far into it that's easy to miss um so if
you're an end user you can't cursor on
the participating institutions a fully
transferable worldwide perpetual royalty
free and non-exclusive license to use
distribute sub-license reproduce modify
adapt publicly publicly perform and
publicly displays such user content and
user content as basically anything
that's happening on the site so all of
these sites acknowledge that they can
can they record all the clicks that
people are doing all the post people are
making uploads people make problem
solutions voting on forum posts because
the primary place of interaction is
within forms for the end-users all of
that stuff is user content and their
retaining a very specific right in terms
of intellectual property that means that
end-users have no way to go hey what is
the agreement that we actually have with
this and do I own anything that I
produce and while that might seem not
that big of a deal i think that it sort
of is um to this so i just went over
some of the legal spaces that i examined
and explore to understand how students
are being positioned in that area um
after talking about the discursive stuff
and now I want to talk about some of the
cultural implications of putting these
two conversations together as i said i
was going to very quickly do the
intellectual property thing and that's
because these two spaces fair use and
intellectual property both have to do
with knowledge creation and these are
two things that if we look at higher ed
on a hole are kind of in flux right now
because of digital environments we
aren't sure what to do with fair use
fair use is basically the protection
that students get and other people get
to culturally critique works for the
purpose of creating knowledge
when you're at a university you somewhat
have a barrier between that because you
can say no I'm definitely out of school
so this is very use and you are in fear
of having litigation presented against
you but because Coursera makes you
liable for everything if you distribute
something on the site like say you have
a article that you think would be great
and somebody sees it and they sue
Coursera they're really suing you and
you're responsible for everything and I
think that's sort of like the extreme
end of okay this isn't a good thing with
Mary's the intellectual property thing
is very interesting so basically since
1945 with the Manhattan Project there's
been this weird thing that happens with
intellectual property and universities
where if the government is giving
funding they sort of want to own the
thing that is produced in the end there
were a couple of really big cases in the
70s where the government took the full
license for things that were profitable
and the government freaked out so in
1980 we have this beta laughs that's
passed that says that okay we'll have
this licensing agreement where we'll
share the revenue and after nineteen
eighty you start saying universities
really get into the idea of owning the
intellectual property of the students
theoretically student should know that
you can go up to your professor or go to
the school and ask what are the
ownership rights for the stuff that I
produce in these classes but that's not
something that we just say and depending
on the discipline the idea even in a
traditional institute of higher
education of owning the work you produce
it's not consistent there's some
disciplines worth like no of course I
wouldn't own it and others where you're
like no it's mine um so that's one of
those things that I think needs to be in
a broader discussion but MOOCs with
their legal classification of it take it
to like an ultimate end where no there's
no room for discussion because when
courts look at terms of use since 1998
they always side with the company like
there's been no case where a user has
been like no even though I click I
accept I didn't really understand what I
was clicking for that's not how it's
legally understood so that's an
important thing to think about saying no
it's not yours um the next space where
we can bring the cultural implications
together with some of the legal stuff is
the idea of trust and verification so
because we have FERPA and because
universities are long existing
institutions for the most part they have
these established identities and we have
ways to protect our records that we know
mean that there is some social value in
this right now MOOCs do not and so one
of the things that Coursera did for end
users that didn't get a lot of press was
in January of this year they announce
something called the signature track and
this is basically a service where you
can have an official verified and
trusted certificate that looks
surprisingly like a diploma that was
made on the computer um that is signed
by them it gives you a site that you can
distribute to people so they can see how
you did in the class it names the place
that the class was in partnership with
and it gives your name so you can say
yes this is actually what I did this is
a paid service so while the business
model in the way that they talk about it
generally has to do with being able to
partner with businesses to sell the data
are partnering with schools to figure
out how we can make learning better in
these online environments this is one of
the things where we see cash flow moving
towards the end user so you pay to have
the service what I think is really
interesting about it especially with the
idea of trust and thinking of these is
sort of part of the social media
landscape or digital media landscape is
you create this strange signature
profile and i remember when i read this
thinking about the things that happen
when Facebook or Instagram or another
site change their terms of service or
terms of use there's usually like an oh
my gosh this is too invasive how can you
require my real name so Coursera
requires your real name to sign up they
suggest please use your real name but if
you want to sign up for the signature
track you also record a unique typing
pattern that is a biometrically profile
lead type thing and their blog posts
they actually say we're creating new
biometric profiles which is a little bit
creepy for me and when I talk to people
about this creepy as the term that
usually comes up they also want you to
take a photo of yourself with your
webcam and any time you submit a
document you're supposed to take another
photo and when this was in early
discussions they talked about being able
to turn on the web
that's what it looks like that has sort
of dropped out I'm just so that they
know it's you they also want a
government-issued photo ID so in
addition to having your typing pattern
your real name you have this government
thing that usually has a number that can
be traced you also have the live photo
that you just took with your webcam and
then to pay for all this of course you
need the credit card to finalize your
identity and all these things come
together to create this trust a document
that is this that is verified you are
verified to show that you've done
something in the site that may be as an
end user you can't say I went to the
school but you can use it to fill that
gap that happens with the 20 years
you're out of school that might make it
so you aren't employable um so those are
the two really big cultural implications
that I'm interested in and I think they
do really interesting things with
bringing together some of the legal
frameworks and the discursive
conversations um if you want more
clarification on what I mean that that
by that please ask me questions um so
what I've talked about is we're getting
close to time is how the companies are
publicly talking about students and in
doing that how they're not talking about
end-users even though that's who they're
targeting most of the people who log on
to these sites are not going to be
students they're not going to be
learners legally they are going to be
end users of a platform and end users of
an algorithm algorithm is another thing
that's in their legal framework I've
talked about how legal how legally they
defined end users as different from
students so again these are people who
cannot be associated with the University
and can't fall under the rubric of FERPA
and have no intellectual property rights
and no protection under fair use
technically and the cultural
implications that I've discussed our
that fair use and intellectual property
because that's my that's the thing that
I want everybody to talk about um and
the issues of trust and verification
that are coming with these and what
they're doing with that um my conclusion
for all of this is coming back to my
wonderful triangle is that those from
the top institutions are the students
with MOOCs like if you want to be a
student that's
really the only way you can do it the
story of the the child from Africa who
might be the next Albert Einstein or
Steve Jobs is usually told in other
conversations as the story of the person
that they found who was a genius who got
one hundred percent on everything and
they were able to see it in the
algorithm right the student tell them to
apply and offer them a letter of
recommendation and now that they're here
they're like real students because
they're at some school here instead of a
school in Mongolia um everybody else is
an end user so if you log on to a MOOC
chances are you're being conceptualized
and legally bound as it end user and not
a student if your school has a
partnership with one of these platforms
and you want to take a class you should
probably check with them to see if they
actually have an agreement that says
that if you take this class you can get
credit because probably won't um and the
third thing that I think is the biggest
cultural implication is that MOOCs are
in the process of heightening the spaces
of rupture that we're currently seeing
in higher ed like trust and verification
and value of education as a whole are
being questioned and it is because of
those things that Daphne Koller says in
her TED talk it's because of the cost
it's because things are changing so
quickly that maybe 20 years from now
your education isn't worth it it's
because we don't know what to do with
intellectual property and who owns it
but we do value it and we think it
should be monetizable so MOOCs take all
of these things and basically take them
to their ultimate end and for me I don't
know if that's the best thing for higher
education but I would love to open up a
bigger conversation about that kind of
using MOOCs as the foundation and the
way that we end this triangle is this is
basically the students um these are the
people from the top institutions and
MOOCs end up being this white space
where there's a gap and these students
should never enter into this place but
their foundation becomes a thing that
bleeds down and to end-users and it
doesn't matter if you're from the United
States or Western Europe or if you're
from some rural village in Africa are
Mongolia on a MOOC you are all end users
if you're not here and you are something
that's feeding into their data stream
um time so the last part these are the
big questions that I have that I kind of
want to start with with everyone um and
that is what can we learn about big data
and big data economies from MOOCs
because I think this is a really
interesting space the massive part is
their thing like hey we're a big data
education but people aren't necessarily
talking about that and it's not
something that I was able to get into in
my paper but I think it's a conversation
that be really really fun to have in
terms of understanding the implications
of big data and how that relates to
imperialism when we think of it as like
global capital accumulation all those
other wonderful things um what are the
effects of massively teaching towards
the machine and not the human across
disciplines so if we see MOOCs as this
place where all education can go online
what does that mean for disciplines that
are highly subjective where we're
measuring things that aren't necessarily
machine gradable but are based on seeing
changes over time and those changes are
usually not usually but oftentimes off
of the grid so they would be off the
chart in a way that might come across as
wrong but are not and the last thing
which is the big question that I hope
all of you can help me answer in the 20
minutes that we have left for questions
a time um what can media studies and
communication and scholars add to the
conversation that's happening on moves
thank you yeah thanks thanks Jade for
that awesome awesome talk and so I had a
one request for clarification and then
two questions so it seemed to me I just
wanna make sure I had this rate in terms
of IP it looks like the agreement was
Professor content stays with the
professors and student content goes to
the MOOCs is that right yes but not
students end users because there are
registered students which is why it gets
it's a language slip that they kind of
built into talking about them so suppose
if a student so if I'm teaching up for
sale records it's on Coursera any
content I put up stays with me and the
students at Rutgers who might take that
class
content their IP stays with the
university or with so it would depend on
the terms of the contract but right now
the way that the contracts are worded
the ones that are publicly available on
all of them they say that the contracts
are basically the same across
universities is if you have six on-site
learners so students who actually go to
classes at Rutgers and six students who
are just distance learners but are
affiliated with Rutgers then even the
on-site students are considered end
users so their IP all belongs to
Coursera interesting if you have for
on-site students and six distance
learners and those on-site students stay
with Rutgers so it's one of those areas
that becomes really really slippery yeah
yeah so yes and no it depends basically
is the response of the clarification
thank you and may two questions one was
about like the earlier model the
Canadian model of like MOOC as community
um has that persisted like the community
component or has that started to sort of
shift into the more American component
and do you think it's possible to a good
idea to have MOOCs that maybe are more
based on a community ethic and the other
question was just if you'd seen in any
of your discourse analysis not just sort
of like a you know colonial idea like
the students over there we need to help
the students over there but I'm also
wondering if there's a narrative of like
helping students who have physical
disabilities helping students who you
know like how can this will help them
and if that's part of the narrative
solutions yes the Canadian model I don't
think has died it's just when we look at
the big press coverage like the New York
Times they're definitely putting it as
the big three stuff that goes up in USA
Today or the stuff that's on Inside
Higher Education or The Chronicle are
focusing on these three companies but
the community of education technologists
that are working with the model of C
MOOC still exist I know people who are
building like these small micro MOOCs
themselves and building their own
platforms so that's still there but in
terms of how we think of the public
framing of it like if I tell people hey
I'm working on MOOCs
you're like I've heard that term isn't
there something happening at MIT or
Stanford with that and it's not isn't
this this really cool community learning
tool um so yes that still exists but
that's not sort of the public face that
we're given right now the next part
around helping the disabled yes they do
talk about that a bit the way that it
gets talked about is through success
stories so there's a story that comes
from Coursera about a father who has a
daughter who is really really sick and
he can't leave the house because he
can't bring germs in and he's able to
take a class on Coursera and he finds
it's really fulfilling because he can't
have social interaction and he feels
like he's doing something um there was
also there were a few webinars offered
over the summer um where they brought in
professors who have been distance or
doing distance learning for a long time
I community colleges and one of the
things that they noted though is when
you actually take students who might
have different learning patterns are the
students who are at higher risk of
dropping out of school they tend to fail
in these spaces so the place where they
tend to be most successful as not by the
people who wouldn't be able to access
school it's by people who already have a
base of education who are really doing
this for a self fulfillment and can
navigate these different courses like
some of the courses have really hard to
gain certification requirements and if
you haven't already had that foundation
if you haven't been able to get to a
school for disability reasons then
you're kind of left out of that in a
specific way um that isn't being
directly directly talked about yes well
it's because no no no yeah no it's fun
um very quickly on the micro moot point
when you look at the Canadian one and
they're like we're massive because we
have 2,300 2,300 people and you have
Daphne Koller giving a talk at the
Wharton important business school and
she's talking about a MOOC with 70,000
students and somebody asks her what can
you learn from what happened with those
70,000 students and like ninety percent
of them dropping out she says we don't
have a big enough sample size so there
really is like an X massive and a
community massive Campo
that's still playing out yeah that was
awesome I enjoyed that um so my question
is largely about like the degree and
qualifications and I just find that all
to be really interesting like the there
seems to be a huge conflict in the fact
that the user end user can't claim
affiliation with the University and yet
that university's logo is plastered all
over their certification and I just
think it's really interesting the way
that the discourse is happening with
like you know doc Nicola or whatever
because they're talking about education
is like knowledge acquisition versus the
way the education is normally looked at
which is earning a qualification like
you know you get your degree but that's
not possible um Coursera it's almost
like court I'm trying to think like an
clinical offline parallon it's like an
extension school right like you get
someone it's like saying oh well I I
went to Harvard but so-and-so like you
only did like a course at Harvard
Extension school which doesn't it's like
the point for a lot of these top elite
institutions is getting in right the
fact that you got in means that you are
of a certain caliber and yes that's the
thing that matters it seems I don't know
I find that that conflict within the
discourse to be incredibly interesting
yeah really problematic um one of the
things that we can see with the Coursera
contracts is when they start talking
about the monetization models they know
being able to tie into that desire even
if they can't actually offer it as a big
thing so there's like a whole section on
branding with University and if the
university agrees to all these branding
arrangements if they do somehow make
money off the courses that are being
offered the university sort of gets a
cut of what they're making EDX does the
same thing in terms of partnering with
universities but they do a really weird
thing where their university has the
papers but because they get to use the
names of these schools and you get a cut
of the money in the event that we bring
in revenue obviously it's a small
percentage compared to what the company
gets but the branding is the way that
it's framed in the contract is seen as a
good thing for all parties because oh my
gosh not only is there a crisis in the
cost of education there's a crisis of
the funding so you'd be really smart to
let us bring in some extra money so
that's sort of how they're being
position and why you see the branding
being so prevalent like that's the legal
thing that's happened which I a
substance if someone does claim an
affiliation right so I mean I don't know
yeah I would ever like chase after
someone but what if someone like put on
their resume like I you know student
like was a student at Harvard Stanford
MIT even though it was just a Coursera
like I just find that to be really
interesting like the ya ali ation i
didn't know it is and when they talk
about the success stories it's
definitely framed as these students
talked about the experience they had
with this professor from the school and
their interview and they were able to
use it to get a better job but it's not
one of those things that has ever said
in a clear-cut way in the public
discourse by the way you have nothing to
do with these schools um The Chronicle
did an article where they were they were
talking to these high users of these big
MOOC platforms and they talked to them
about what are the experience of these
classes like what's important to you and
what was really interesting with that is
rather than associating with the
school's the students were associating
with the professors who they also don't
have contact with I mean they're getting
these eight minute videos but again this
is something that's put into the
contracts contracts are fascinating
they're selling a professor like this is
we're going to pick only two percent of
the professors who want to do this you
have to have a certain something that
makes it so that your video is not just
like a YouTube video and it has to be
this excellent thing that we can sort of
build our brand around so the levels of
where people are making associations is
absolutely fascinating but it's hard to
parse out outside of the legal framework
in a way that's like actually concrete
question which is in illegal contracts
does it prohibit me from reaching from
contacting
so it doesn't restrict it so because the
contracts aren't speaking to an end user
it doesn't say anything specifically
about that where you start saying
conversation about that is in the
frequently asked questions and the terms
of you so when it says you have no
affiliation with anything or any
resources from the university professors
are a resource so you technically don't
have an association with that person and
the frequently asked questions they
highly discourage you from emailing the
professors because there's so many
people in these classes chances are they
won't see it so you should just post the
forums because we have all these
students that are learning with you and
they can probably do a better job of
answering your question and by the way
the professor might be trolling the
boards responding to people so you never
know maybe you'll get a response from
that person um so it's not something
that's prohibited but it's something
that's definitely a dress but not
exactly directly so all of the stuff
ends up being a very gray gray space you
never know thom yorke could totally be
monitoring the bus yeah what's
interesting is since it's so early right
now and they're sort of figuring out
what works a lot of the courses that are
up are in the first iteration of these
videos that take a really really really
long time to create like people are
spending a hundred hours making sure
they can fit everything they need to fit
into eight minutes and making sure it's
to the specifications of the platform
professors are there and what you're
finding is a lot of professors from
these universities are using ta hours to
go and see what's happening on the forum
so they can see what's going on so that
they can then go and maybe do a second
iteration of the videos if people will
not sure because again it's for most
people it's been a big time crunch is
met a bunch of articles with professors
talking about that and I've talked to
some people who made the videos but
since it is round one year one there are
Luke one point oh there are people from
the schools that are there but the
contracts say that the courses will be
up for three to five years and they do
this weird thing with course
enhancements that's really interesting
when it comes to intellectual property
ownership with the courses and that
means that there will be iterations of
this course where it
very far removed from the instant where
it was made in the people who made it
more than likely because you start
having people like that color and out
agrawal teaching these classes they're
doing a lot and they're out talking a
lot they it's not really realistic that
they can spend twenty four seven on
these sites which is how often they say
there's activity or learning which are
like you really hope specific which are
like global ways of doing like things
together because I mean it's virtual and
basically enables that possibility as
you say there are like the frequently
asked questions were students alvida
each other very start like implemented
in the education um so the way that they
talk about student interaction is
primarily through forums so people post
a forum so let's have upvotes and
download so you can say how useful or
unuseful something is and all that data
can be collected and associated with the
user and it can be pulled into the
algorithm so we can figure out what's
going on in the classes but one of the
things that they mark a success stories
across the companies that is not
something that they do it's just look at
what our amazing students are doing is
there's meetups so a lot of the people
in the classes will say hey I'm in San
Francisco I want to have a meetup is
there anybody else in this class taking
the class and they'll get together and
do this Coursera apparently had a big
global group of people who wanted to
learn with people from different
cultures that formed an online meeting
space to go and talk about the class one
of the stories that I have when I was
talking about the project early on
though is there was a class I was being
taught by the other co-founder of
Coursera Andrew Inc and I was speaking
with two people for like weeks about my
project and they're both enrolled in
this course era class and they had no
idea until like week three of us having
conversations that they were in the same
class so while yes community formation
might happen it's definitely not built
into the system because its massive and
it even if you're using your real name
to a certain degree it is anonymous and
I don't know that people when you get
like the 100,000 students class are
going to go through a list not sure if
they're
is a list to see who all is taking this
class with me so basically all the labor
stuff is put on the end users to do that
work so the discussion of the sort of
post Manhattan Project kind of IP
institutional relationship was one of
the most sort of compelling critical
arguments for me mm-hmm but I guess I'm
wondering so what is that sort of you
know putting on our design fiction hats
what is that dystopian future look like
because I can imagine you can imagine
someone who's familiar with sort of
traditional models of research that you
described in terms of like grant funding
and high sort of high degrees of you no
need for overhead and capital in a lab
for example and you know to be able to
fund graduate students and all that sort
of you know exploitative labor
relationship for another set of reasons
um and just to that person that's so
familiar with that model the kind of
like IP farm that you're describing
might seem kind of alien and some
curious like what's are their historical
analogues that can help us understand
the sort of pathway and yeah I guess I'm
just sort of wondering how do you make
that argument sort of make sense from
you know the perspective of not only how
our MOOCs changing education but how are
sort of MOOCs reshaping the role of IP
and society I don't know if I have a
clear answer to that but as you were
talking and told me to put on my science
fiction hat and think about what this
might look like I thought of this talk
if MOOCs are doing this thing where we
own everything this talk is being
recorded I signed a release that said it
can be used it can be cut up all my
words are being taped your words are
being taped and it's no longer mine and
in classes when we think about how they
operate now it's a place for
experimentation and a place to try to
figure out understanding and we
understand that we might say something
that's really really awful in the class
because we don't understand something
but it's a safe space to do that so if
we start thinking about the broader
implications of surveillance society and
entering school and the fact that most
computers have microphones now who's to
say that a MOOC at the end wouldn't say
we're just going to have this on all the
time like the thing that happened with
the xbox one and this will be our
intellectual property and maybe and
passing you'll have this great idea and
suddenly it's yours I think the science
fiction version is we're because we're
always in the process of understanding
the world those recordings then become a
constant thing that we're like should I
even say this out loud because there's a
chance that this can be used against me
or monetized or turn into something that
I'm not ready for it to be yet and it
sort of takes away the part of education
that is perhaps playing or exploring are
just really not being so smart yet but
that's sort of why you say I'm going to
be a student it's a position where
you're inherently saying I don't have
the power here and I'm here because I'm
getting something that I wouldn't be
able to get otherwise so yes with that I
think yes
could you comment quickly on the
nonprofit for-profit distinction between
Udacity and Coursera and EDX yeah so EDX
is the only one that is not for profit
um they received all of their funding
from Harvard and MIT like their startup
funding came from their Udacity and
Coursera received like venture
capitalists funding and angel investors
to start their businesses and the way
that this is being positioned publicly
as that EDX really really really cares
about learning and figuring out how
people learn best and how we can use
machines to enable that so they're
creating this platform that they think
will be really really great for other
educational institutions to use to help
their students the other companies are
not pushing that board as their primary
business model but if you actually look
at the talks they're basically saying
the same thing like when they show their
graphs and talk about their algorithms
they're all talking about learning
optimization but the main difference is
that the ones who are being funded by
venture capitalists seem to not be able
to make that the forefront of what
they're doing and instead they have to
start talking about the business
partnerships and data monetization
possibilities and they have to list
themselves as a content hosting platform
an algorithm company and not an
educational technology company which is
what EDX gets to do with their
association so right now what I would
say is well they're both for-profit and
not-for-profit at this point in time and
this is again maybe said MOOC 1 point 0
there's not a big difference that we can
see between the three companies outside
of what they forefront and as what
they're doing thank you so we're gonna
take a break fertile</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
