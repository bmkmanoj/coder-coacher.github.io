hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
okay so let's get started
the next speaker is dr. jeannette wing
her background is in security and in
fact she was on the board of the
trustworthy computing initiative but
more recently some of the things that
she'll be talking about is going to be
very very important to all of you who
are I'm sure after this going to go run
startups and that will hopefully grow
into big companies and you will need to
know how to influence large groups of
people and so dr. Hwang leads Microsoft
research labs and she is sort of my boss
is possibly one of the things that is
amazing about her is how she is able to
influence this group of people into
making big ball beds going forward doing
research a little known fact about her
that also helps is that she's a black
belt in karate so with that I'd like to
invite dr. Bing so good afternoon I hope
you all had a good lunch I am going to
talk about computational thinking and I
have a grand vision for the world my
grand vision is that computational
thinking will be a fundamental skill
used by everyone by the middle of this
century this vision of mine is pretty
bold in the sense that I think everyone
will be thinking computationally is a
fundamental skill just as they know how
to read write and do arithmetic of
course this vision of mine is incestuous
in that it will be computing and
computers that will spread the probably
the use of computational thinking this
vision of mine also has implications
with respect to research research in any
discipline whether it's a science or an
engineering discipline or humanities
arts and so on and in fact for the first
part of my talk I'm going to try to
convince you that computational thinking
has already influenced the research
disap
the research thinking of these many
other disciplines from the science and
engineering fields all the way to the
arts and humanities
but this vision of mine also has
implications with respect to education
if I indeed feel that every single
person should know how to think
computationally one can argue that well
maybe we should be teaching
computational thinking or computer
science or some notions of computing at
early grades early ages K to 12 not wait
to teach computer science until you
reach college or when you go to graduate
school
so I'm going to save a few minutes at
the end of my top to tell you about how
much progress has been made around the
world in teaching computational thinking
at the K through 12 level and also at
the undergraduate level many years ago I
wrote a 3-page article called
computational thinking and I encourage
all of you to read it it's very easy to
read it's a little poetic it's one of
those reads that you do right before you
go to bed so it's not deep reading so I
hope you go home tonight and and read my
computational thinking paper before I
talk about the influence of
computational thinking in research and
education today let me start by trying
to phrase what I mean by computational
thinking now this phrasing of it is a
little technical computer scientists
would appreciate some of the words I use
in this definition and I'll walk you
through it but computational thinking I
mean the thought processes so it's
thinking it's what you do in your head
it's what you do in your head thought
processes it's not what you type at the
computer because they're already you've
done something in your head
computational thinking of the thought
processes involved in formulating a
problem and expressing its solution or
solutions in such a way that a computer
and a computer could be a machine
or it could be a human because after all
humans compute and more interestingly a
computer can be networks of humans and
machines working together to solve
problems that neither can solve alone so
the thought processes involved in
formulating a problem and expressing a
solution its solution in such a way that
a computer can effectively carry out so
a couple of the key words in this
definition are expressing the word
expressing is key because it underlies
all the theory and practice of
programming languages and specification
languages that we know and study in
computer science effectively is very key
to this definition because we want
solutions that are efficient that you
can actually run on a machine and
they'll finish in time and so
effectively is not any old solution it's
got to be something that a human or a
machine can actually execute so I'm not
going to belabor that definition but I
just wanted to give you a flavor of what
I mean by computational thinking more
abstractly I like to think about the
most important thought process that we
learn as computer scientists that we
practice as computer scientists on a
daily basis is abstraction that's when
you have a large system that's quite
complex underneath and you're trying to
just understand a of it for instance
that's what Jennifer uses modeling this
complex behavior using some abstraction
so the process of abstraction is
ignoring irrelevant detail in a large
complex not messing the bottom and
defining a model an elegant usually in
mathematics a mathematical model so that
you can reason about what you care about
in terms of this model in terms of the
abstraction so what we do in computer
science all the time is
the process of abstraction the process
of defining these models so that we can
do better reasoning so that's just an
example of a kind of thought process and
there many instances of these
abstractions so computational thinking
philosophically it's actually the way
another way to think about it is that it
combines mathematical thinking and
engineering thinking it's certainly
related to mathematical thinking because
computer science the science of computer
science is defined in terms of
mathematics so the underlying
foundations theoretical foundations of
computer science um is mathematics and
so it's no wonder that there's
mathematical thinking in computational
thinking but the difference between pure
mathematical thinking and computational
thinking is that when we execute our
solutions or effectively carry out our
solutions on a machine or as human we
are constrained by the physics the
actual physics of the machine we can't
represent we can't reason about all
integers because we're only representing
a finite number of them in our machine
for example up computational thinking
also draws an engineering thinking
because in fact when you're building a
system a computer program we're running
a program in you're building a system
you're engineering an artifact and so
you want to borrow from all the
discipline of engineering that we know
when you design you build you test you
verify and you iterate all of that
engineering methodology goes into the
way in which we build software systems
hardware systems so there's definitely
some engineering thinking that goes on
in computational thinking but there's
one difference between traditional
engineering thinking and computational
and that one difference is because of
the one difference between computer
science and all engine other engineering
disciplines if I were to have an
interactive lecture with you I would
start asking the audience questions like
what one thing might that be but I'll
just ask what one thing might that be
and answer it myself so what one thing
like that be its software because in
software you can do anything you can
build world's virtual worlds that defy
the laws of nature defy the laws of
physics because it's a virtual world you
can invent your rules
and you know this from games where
avatars die and come back alive or are
they fly around and and and so on so in
computation in computer science
um because of software where you can
invent anything you're not constrained
by the physical world the way you are
and say civil engineering where your
bridge has actually got to stand up and
it can't fall down and similarly with
the buildings and so on
so you could imagine in computer science
being completely immersed in the virtual
world and ignoring the physical world of
course today there's there's a merging
area of what I call cyber physical
systems which combines regular
engineering thinking with computational
thinking ok so when I talk about
computational thinking I actually I'm
talking about the abstractions I'm not
fixated on the artifacts that we produce
and I do believe that it's something for
everyone everywhere so just to be a
little concrete I just have a list here
of other kinds of computer science
concepts or abstractions that we use as
computer scientists on a daily basis I'm
not saying that everyone should learn
all of these but everyone
can learn a few of these like what an
algorithm is or what a state machine is
but the reason I list these abstractions
here these concepts here is to contrast
what I mean by computational thinking
from computer literacy I don't mean
everyone in the world by the middle of
the 21st century should know how to use
Excel and word although that probably
will be true I don't mean that everyone
in the world by the middle of the 21st
century will learn how to program in
Java or Python or whatever the favorite
language of the year is of course
computer programming as ed lovasco
mentioned this morning is an important
skill that and helps you learn the
concepts of computational thinking so
along the way of learning computer
science you learn how to program much
like along the way of becoming a
mathematician you'll learn how to prove
theorems so now let me talk about how
computational thinking has already
influenced the research approach the
research methodologies of other
disciplines and let me start with one
discipline that's been influenced
already by many different computational
methods so again in my interactive mode
I would ask the audience what one
discipline might that be and I'll say
well what one discipline might that be
and on Adhan will say biology and I
think it was in the triggering event of
the sequencing of the human genome when
the biology compute community woke up
and said you know maybe those computer
scientists have something to add to my
repertoire of thinking skills because it
was the shotgun algorithm an algorithm
that expedited the sequencing of a human
genome
of course there was a lot of compute
infrastructure that
along with that but I think it was that
time that point in time when biologists
and computer scientists started talking
to each other and now we have
departments and programs and degrees and
courses on computational biology so it's
a completely new field as blended from
computer science and biology and the
many examples that I list here are
really different computational methods
or tools or languages or techniques used
to understand and discover new biology
what's common to these models and
languages for representing what's coming
to these models and languages is that
they are all ways to express the
dynamics of interacting complex
processes because actually if you look
at nature it's just these complex
processes that interact with each other
their information processing agents that
communicate with each other and of
course in computer science we know how
to do that because after all what's an
operating system it's just a lot of
concurrent processes trying to
coordinate and synchronize with each
other to get the job done so we have
many models and languages and reasoning
systems to explain how these concurrent
processes interact to explain how they
should behave or how they should not
behave so it's natural for computer
scientists to think maybe the models
that we use for understanding concurrent
processes or distributed systems
would be appropriate for modeling and
then understanding the dynamics of
biological processes so let me give you
one example and this actually comes from
research at Microsoft Research actually
there are two parts to this story the
first part is simply a theorem prover
that was built at Microsoft Research
this
theorem provers called Zed 3 it is the
world's best theorem prover and what I
what do I mean by a theorem prover if
you consider this formula B plus 2
equals C and F of so on it's just a
formula and the question is this is
formula is it satisfiable modulo some
theory T and you'll notice in this
formula I have a mix of theories the
first part B plus 2 equals C is probably
something about integers the second part
read of right of a be 3 it's probably
something about array so I need some
theory to reason about arrays and the
last part is also about integers and
possibly with the FS on both sides
uninterpreted function symbols so Zen
threes a satisfiability modulo theories
solver SMT solver because it knows how
to reason about lots of different
theories integers arrays uninterpreted
function symbols and so on very powerful
you can throw a whole bunch of one
formulas at it and it can find and it
can answer this question it can answer
does this what when I asked the question
does this formula is it formula
satisfiable I mean does it does it fall
in the blue region or outside of the
blue region and the blue region gives
mean assignment to all the variables in
that formula that makes it come but make
it true so this is a long-winded way to
say we've been doing research in this
area verification and programming
languages and formal methods and
applying to all sorts of systems at
Microsoft Research for many years many
years in fact the person who was sitting
in the middle of the panel Shri Rama
Rajyam aunty has done work on exactly
using this kind of system so this is
bread and butter computer science what
does it have to do with biology that's
what I'm going to tell you
so now take your computer science head
off and put your biology hat on and I'm
going to tell you about another piece of
work also done at microsoft research in
our cambridge lab in UK on stem cell
prediction the setup is the following we
know some things about embryonic stem
cells and we don't know other things so
we'd like to learn more in particular we
know that embryonic stem cells have two
interesting properties one is that
they're self renewing which means they
divide indefinitely
the other is this notion of pluripotency
which means a single stem cell can turn
into some kind of differentiated adult
cell like a kidney cell or skin cell or
a brain cell we don't know how that
process works but we new know we do know
it that it happens and so that's the new
biology that we'd like to understand how
is it that stem cells stem cells turn
into whatever they turn into and what's
so exciting about this is the biologists
know that if they take an adult cell
they actually know how to reprogram the
adult cell to turn into a stem cell so
with that you can imagine if we can
steer a stem cell in a way to become a
kidney cell or a skin cell then we have
a way of attacking many diseases many
possible organs
and so on so this is the tantalizing
part of the story we don't know how to
do that we don't even understand how
they work so this work was hardly to
understand embryonic stem cells so what
we do know is that if
have an embryonic stem cell and there
are three kinds of signals that it can
react to in fact only two out of three
of those signals help a turn determine
then that kind of the next state of that
stem cell these signals are lyft Chiron
and PD so what you can do is you can
express the King genes under different
combinations of these three signals to
see whether there's some a positive
interaction between the two between two
genes or a negative inhibitory
relationship and so you can actually
express that that heat map if you will
in terms of a graph this goes back to
Jennifer and her grass or a state
machine you can think of the blue nodes
as the blue nodes representing the genes
and simply think of them as states and
the black nodes are signals into this
state machine and the blue arrows
represent a positive interaction between
two genes given whatever input signals
there are and the red arrows represent
some inhibitory relationship and then as
a computer scientist you look at that
and you see a graph or you see a state
machine and then all of a sudden all the
tools that we know how to reason about
dynamics of concurrent processes or
graph like structures come to play and
so what the computer science biologists
did was use said three
that's your improver that I talked about
earlier to encode this state machine in
code this graph but the problem is there
are basically ten to the forty three
possible boolean networks represented by
this little diagram and you can't
possibly analyze each one but what you
can do is you can constrain the
out of the possible bullying networks
you constrain the ones that are
interesting to look at by using
experimental evidence so that's what she
did she basically you know fed this
graph into Zed 3 added the constraints
representing experimental observations
from real experiments and then she was
able to to extract a minimal state
machine that represents the minimal set
required to explain explain stem-cell
behavior so this is you can think of the
kernel or the essential program that
governs pluripotency so this was the
breakthrough science because she was
able to feed this left-hand side graph
into this theorem prover and determine
the right-hand side based on
experimental evidence she discovered new
biology and that paper appeared in
science so that was my story with two
microsoft research stories to back up a
the point being there are off-the-shelf
computational methods tools and
techniques that can be used in the
repertoire of tools that biologists
might want to use to discover new
biology so now let me turn it around I
was really arguing that there's one
science I picked on biology that has
been influenced by many methods and I
picked on one method because I'm
familiar with it but let me flip it
around and say what one method in
computer science has had influence on
many different disciplines
that's that's a question anyone want to
guess machine learning so that's pretty
obvious these days
and the some machine learning or the use
of large amounts of data to analyze and
find patterns and classify and so on is
prevalently used in the sciences in
astronomy medicine meteorology in the
neurosciences and it's also used on
beyond the sciences it's used for
detecting fraud in credit-card usage
it's used in recommendation systems on
reputation services it's use even used
in analyzing sports the the players
analyzing all the videos of professional
players so that maybe coaches can train
off of those professional players for
the high school or college teams so the
one story I want to tell it's a
Microsoft Research story that's related
to machine learning actually goes back
to the introduction that psychic gave of
Raj Reddy and it has to do with this
breakthrough that happened in speech
recognition so up until basically 2009
we were able to recognize the word error
rate in recognizing speech was on the
order of 30 percent so roughly speaking
you know every third word that I'd say
would be wrong that would the Machine
would not recognize properly and then in
2009 there was a dramatic improvement in
word error recognition rate down for the
basically whenever's say one every sixth
word and what that
improvement came from was this notion of
deep neural networks and Chris Bishop
the person sitting here at the panel
talked about in his own career of
inventing and using deep neural networks
for fusion I hadn't known that story
well here we are in 2009 using a newer
version of deep neural networks that
helps us do speech recognition and so
and and a lot of this work was very
fundamental science
um after decades of work in speech
recognition a field that I'd like to
think Raj Reddy actually started and so
in 2012 in Tianjin China my former boss
gave a speech he spoke English and this
speech recognition system was good
enough then to in real time recognized
his speech then transliterated into
English text and then that was
immediately translated into Chinese and
then the Chinese speech came out of a
synthesizer that was based on his kind
of voice and so this was a demo this was
truly just a demo of how good speech
recognition had become after so many
years of poor word error rates and it
was an astounding demo many of us in the
front row were at that demo in 2012 and
it was really a breakthrough result so
since this demo
Microsoft has taken it one step further
and we now previewed in December of last
year in Skype a system called Skype
translator which allows speakers
on in English and Spanish to talk via
Skype and communicate with each other in
real-time and so we have there's a young
girl from the United States here on the
left and a young girl from Mexico on the
right and they have a conversation
together about where they live and what
they like to do and this is happening in
Skype in real time and you can they they
can actually see the translation and
what the other is saying in this script
right here phenomenal progress taking
from a demo to Ashley a real system and
so we will see I hope in this coming
year more languages supported so that's
machine learning specifically deep
neural networks has one kind of machine
learning technique that has transformed
society this speech translation system
that I just talked about addresses what
Raja Reddy was asking for this morning
breaking down the language barriers and
so we're getting there it's not so easy
it wasn't so easy to do just the two
languages Raj knows this
okay so computational thinking in other
sciences I'll go through quickly
chemistry physics geosciences we have
many examples computational thinking for
society one of the most exciting
emerging areas in computer science and
at Microsoft Research today is the
combination of computer science and
economics and also computer science in
the social sciences but what I wanted to
talk to you about is how computational
thinking can actually help in healthcare
and I want to bring this back home to
India so in India tuberculosis is a
really tough problem to solve as the car
was taking me over today I noticed
something like a national tuberculosis
Institute that I passed but
it hits you hard the problem with
treating tuberculosis is that it's it's
hard to make sure that the patient's
actually take their medication so you'd
like a way to have the patient let the
doctors ensure that patients are
complying with the treatment taking
their medication and so on and you can't
have the patients you know go to some
central location and you know have the
doctor administer the medication or make
sure that the patient is saying because
that takes a long time it might be
really hard for the person to travel if
you have to travel then you miss work
it's just not a reasonable way to do the
compliance checking so what a group at
the Microsoft Research India lab came up
with is the system called 99 dots and
it's so simple and it uses mobile
technology and basically the the doctor
will put in this kind of blister pack
all the eight pills spring since this
one it will fit eight pills and then
seal it and then the patient will have
received faith from the pharmacy a box
of these blister packs all lined up all
numbered in a particular way and say the
patient takes the first blister pack and
then the first treatment is to take four
pills so you pop four pills out and then
you'll see on the back of each of the
each of the pills covers is a number and
so what the patient then does is it
calls this toll-free number filling in
the last four digits and that
authenticates with some server and some
doctor that the patient has taken these
four pills and so what's interesting
muscle about this
design of the system is that it the the
call is actually a missed call and so
it's free for the caller and this is an
example of really taking into
consideration the local region when
you're designing these sort of low-cost
computational methods to help patient
healthcare in say rural India and so
they're able to use servers to real-time
track patients at scale and right now
it's been tested at four sites in India
and there's a grander scheme use with
foundation money and NGO money to scale
it out so computational thinking I
already said is used in Sciences and for
society and so on it's it's everywhere
you go in at least in the United States
you see new programs coming up like
digital archaeology or digital
journalism or digital humanities and so
these are all this is all evidence that
computational thinking is entering the
thinking of these fields what I wanted
to do is very short example of how even
in daily life you can be thinking
computationally so here's my example I
getting morning coffee from the
cafeteria and this is a real real
example so here I am and I got my cup
and then I put some milk in it and then
I get some coffee I put some sugar in it
then I pick up a lid and then I get a
napkin and I leave so so as a
computational thinker I say what's wrong
with this picture um you know this is my
path and it's even worse if there's
someone in your way because you know you
want to get your lid and he's going
his cup so as the computational thinker
what do you think so odd this again in
the interactive version of my lecture I
would ask an audience number I would
think pipelining so then you would think
actually how would I affect the most
efficient pipeline or I might think what
are the minimum number of stations I
need to move to effect a pipeline excel
on and so forth well I've given you some
time to think about it if you just move
the lids over then you can't effect a
pipeline it's not the most efficient but
at least you minimize the number of
stations to move ok so I wanted to save
some time to talk about how my vision on
computational thinking for everyone has
already made inroads in changing
curricula at the national level around
the world it's not quite hit the US and
a national scale in terms of curricula
changes but it has hit in terms of many
many different organizations and the
u.s. there's always lots of
decentralized and uncoordinated ways
that education changes on but I will a
point to co.org which was mentioned
already by Ed Alaska this morning as one
of the recent influential mechanisms
that we are reaching case of twelve
students to teach them computer science
to teach them computer programming and
it's quite a recent wave of really
reaching lots and lots of students the
UK is probably the country that is most
ahead of everyone else in the world and
I really credit on some of the
individuals for instance Simon Payton
Jones of Microsoft Research Cambridge of
being one of the leaders the passionate
leaders to affect this change in the UK
so currently this past fall actually the
United Kingdom mandated from the
Ministry of Education all the way down
that
some sort of computational thinking or
computer science concepts be taught at
every single grade level from K through
12 this is a remarkable policy
achievement if you think about it and
it's going hog-wild right now in the UK
in terms of many many organizations
really jumping on to see how they can
they can make sure that every school
child gets exposed to computational
concepts in China thanks to some of the
efforts at Microsoft Research Asia we're
also starting to see changes at the
college level in terms of curriculum
where the point is to make sure that
every college student would have access
to some computer science course major or
non major and so I wanted to close of
course with what's going on in India and
I understand that almost all of you in
the audience have been touched by
massively empowered classrooms how many
of you have interacted with mechs that's
quite impressive so I don't even need to
tell you what it is but I can't share
with you how far it's gone and so my
understanding is that the blue regions
are where mech already is and the green
regions of India is where mech hopes to
be and I'm not going to say anything
more about neck because the talk after
me is all about neck so I will close
then and say that my three page article
has been translated into Chinese and
French and someone from Japan just sent
me a version that will be published soon
and someone in Korea is working on a
Korean version so let me close by just
saying help me spread the word help me
make computational thinking commonplace
thank you
