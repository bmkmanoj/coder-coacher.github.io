Sciences Group here at Microsoft and I'd
like to tell you a little bit about our
work in high performance touch so
currently touch systems have about a
hundred milliseconds of delay between
when you touch and when the image
actually changes well if you're moving a
finger
at about a hundred one meter per second
that means that the image is going to be
100 milliseconds behind or about 10
centimeters behind that's really obvious
and so this analogy that you're trying
to draw up moving a real physical object
really breaks down because the object is
following so far behind so we built a
test system in order to understand how
much better the experience would be as
we decrease that latency we used our
test setup to examine different
latencies so here you can see that this
is about a hundred milliseconds of
latency we're not moving at a full meter
per second but the delay is still very
clear now that's about the level of
current devices if we move this down to
50 milliseconds that's significantly
better than most devices on the market
but it's still quite a bit of lag even
at these slow speeds now if we move that
down yet again to 10 milliseconds you
can see it's dramatically better in each
of these steps the user preference is
very clear that it just gets better and
better but if you look closely you can
see it's not really staying on the
finger it's kind of rubber banding
around it so if we move all the way down
to one millisecond then you can see now
it's really staying on the finger and in
fact if you were playing with the real
setup you would notice a real perceptual
cliff that this really starts to feel
like a real physical object if you take
a look at a current tablet you can see
the performance as I said is about 100
milliseconds and this is most noticeable
if you draw like a squiggly line on it
and you can see in this example that in
fact the lining that is being traced out
the ink is about a half cycle behind now
if you use our device and you take that
down to about a millisecond latency then
of course that if that goes away and
it's almost like finger-painting that it
feels like the ink is coming from the
your finger and its perceptually very
very different just to give you some
better idea of what's going on here
we shot some high-speed footage so this
is slowed down by a factor of eight so
you can see the difference here but at
one millisecond civillian see you're
right on it
and again it appears quite noticeable
when you are doing squiggly lines then
you can tell just how far behind you are
and of course if you go down to one
millisecond then it feels like you're
right on top of it so what we've seen is
that the current levels of latency
around 100 millisecond really could be
improved and noticeably improved for
about two orders of magnitude and so
what we've done with this research is
set something of a bar for where we'd
like to head over the next decade so
we'd like to see systems decrease their
latency down to the one millisecond
level and then you start to actually
have things that feel like you're moving
a real physical object thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
