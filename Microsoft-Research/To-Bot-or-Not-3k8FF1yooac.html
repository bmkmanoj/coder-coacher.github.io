hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
hey I'm Gila Amadeus like this here and
I spend a lot of time working with data
spy i was editing this slide today with
subway and somebody was sitting next
music do you do big data a lot of people
i'm sure i've been spending a lot of my
time in the last half year looking at
the elections and what was going on
directions and i was amazed at the
number of times different markers from
social media are used by media in this
case study twitter users add a lot much
more less than Robby there are so many
articles on all these sudden increases
and Romney's followers right so Alice
writes about this inner fantastic
dissertation these are called status
affordances they're all across social
media and hour markers that we use their
easily available to all these numbers
that we need to compare ourselves and
sort of wrap ourselves provided
providing hierarchy inside these social
networks because apparently
social beings that's what we seek and
I'm sure she can expect a much better
also with all these examples actually
prop also common in Mexico right before
the elections there are all these cases
of people buying audiences buying
bottles so if you if anyone does like a
little search on Google by Twitter the
next word would be followers followers
you want to know which service to use
because there are thousands and
thousands of services that will give you
followers so i just pointed to this one
service called fiber which is absolutely
fascinating it for five dollars they're
all these things you can buy and some of
them are I will report Morgan Freeman or
character voiceover black velvet much
better I'll simply birthday as Marilyn
one roomie so so if you actually search
for Twitter later you get just all these
ways in which you can buy mostly by
followers there are other things are on
classification but some of them will
want to give you twenty seven thousand
five hundred followers for five dollars
that's insane
awesome only give you 500 so i settled
on middle I would I bought 4,000 fall
not ashamed so here's how it works ah
you go into the service you say okay I
picked this guy I'll get for that spot
words within 24 hours you pay five
dollars and I was expecting never to see
if there's no way this gonna work this
is what happened
that's the way to build your audience so
in my satisfaction callers x-axis face
but alligator geek Oh notice a little
here we are starting to like I'm hearing
goodbye more
but when you actually also a lot of what
I do is a map these networks on behind
it but actually what I did immediately
is grab all the day guys start mapping
out who these people are so I think you
can like usually guess who are the real
people
the notes are users Twitter users the
edges are connections between them and
what you see are these are sort of the
handles the names and they're clustered
based on how they follow each other how
are they follow each other so you see
start up a lot of people follow me and
kind of far with each other they're
colored vials called modularity it means
regions of the graph that are much more
connected so these people have almost
nothing in common with a lot of these
people so almost not in live follow me
before actually use the service in my
followers when you dive in you can
actually see like just different
communities super so start seeing okay
scoble is sort of most heavy follow from
within my followers all these way I mean
that that's going to go behind your
friend like you bought follow is that
these sort of a little central from
among the people following so they
follow them but you see all these other
weird clusters or have nothing to do
with anything else and then we can
easily dive in and see sort of these
different worlds this is when I take out
all the normal people and I pull me into
the box you can even even see these
other communities resourc these groups
of people
we'll have these folks always so once i
get all this data the first thing i want
to do is look at who else wants this
service right
of course so this is an example of one
of these BOTS annalisa mom saw at least
I once saw a disease she follows me
she's my one of my favorite blocks like
17 tweets in the period of like two days
to look kind of human and she almost two
thousand users which is the limit that's
where their food will cut you off unless
you have more almost and when you go to
the people she follows really
fascinating and they're they're like
they're all real they're all in media
they all like positions are social that
without having an obvious without having
got melter answers about blackmail
service oh yeah that's it I guess yeah
make money Microsoft Research is here to
help
example like really bizarre last slide
damn Shaw Bell is a personal branding
expert on the job what's his connection
to already see that John hours walk to
black by lowes any I don't so so what
they do generally for the bio the
description they just grabbed random
text or a book source and they like pace
so many times it's not even during times
yes to that I mean in order for silver
grill so this is actually this is a real
person ah she's a promoter in Saudi
bastard party animal of God and my girls
she's one of those and you get Holly
spoke so here we have a late start about
to see plate I can happen so do i get so
we have all this interesting data and
the question is so what so okay we can
out them yeah that's great it's going to
be fun but
turning phone now this is actually
effective like we all know that having
that number just okay it makes you feel
better $500,000 power but beyond that
what are the implications so one of them
you get a higher gospel ipods forces
that even with the followers but it's
interesting because if you take that one
step further with the being and clouds
relationship that actually affects your
being scores search results sorry so
when somebody search on such fun if
there's filtering organization by cloud
score and i don't know how you thought
that that would effective you now it
also most likely defects with your
search where people search on twitter
you would be ranked higher for the
search of the alcohol so we do everyone
does google SEO all the time the
acquired traffic to raise our alexa
ranking why is this so gross sniffing
I'm not defined
this might be feel sorrow bloody country
like why does he feel really wrong and
that's actually what what I would love
to talk to a lot of you about and I have
some of my solutions but we do with this
Lily gave a great option but this is
this is becoming actually a really
prominent prominent thing that we're
seeing on Twitter in FN many of social
networks that have long so i would love
to talk to more of you about this i
think i ran out of time so we don't know
I'm ready to thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
