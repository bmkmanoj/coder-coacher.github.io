monitor infectious agents as they move
across the planet so in the endgame we
would like to have a global system
available that detects new infectious
agents and then monitors their movement
as they emerge in this way we can
intervene before they become an epidemic
or before they become an infectious
problem for humans or wildlife the
mosquito is the most dangerous animal on
the planet because it carries so many
pathogens what we want to do is to be
able to catch that mosquito efficiently
at scale in that low-cost current
collection technologies are very limited
and and present a lot of biases when we
do this in the field now it takes a lot
of effort and money and personnel time
the big challenge is going to be
creating new traps that can collect
mosquitoes that's drone portable and
that can be automated in a very
efficient way what our team will do is
take the mosquitoes and then each
sequencing the results of that
sequencing will be placed through a
series of computational steps that will
detect viruses and will distinguish
between viruses that are known viruses
and those that are novel viruses so
right now our ability to analyze these
sequences depends on computer power
we're going to have to expand our
computational power and we're going to
have to have to develop new algorithms
that can process the data much faster
what we want to apply it to achieve a
goal like this our advanced operating
systems analysis tools to find bugs in
software before they're in the wild
machine learning and vision to add
complex autonomy into these drones so
that they can make decisions and then
finally cloud computing and genomics so
that we can at scale
analyze the complex data we obtain I
believe in the next five years a system
like this is attainable
