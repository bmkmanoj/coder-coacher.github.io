hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
so it's my pleasure to introduce Livia
Klein who's a cardiologist down at UCSF
in the heart and vascular department
he's also director of the mechanical
circuitry or circulatory support heart
failure device program and specializes
in heart failure as well as arrhythmias
in his clinical practice in his research
life it's the other half of his life
Olivia's done a bunch of work looking at
epidemic G especially for heart failure
in women but I did a little bit of
digging online and found two interesting
nuggets when he's born in Romania about
a couple of minutes away from Dracula's
castle sort of an interesting nugget but
to that his parents were engineers which
probably accounts for the engineering
bit that he takes in much of his work
working with sensors and devices for
remote monitoring she's going to tell us
about today so without further ado take
it away thanks so much yeah that's nice
oh yeah so interesting I guess so my
both my parents are engineers and you
know in Romania I go from high school to
graduate school at college and when I
was trying to choose a high school you
know was 1988 so computers are sort of
just kind of coming out of this in
Romania and my parents wanted me to go
into computer programming and that sort
of Engineering so you know we want to
kind of visit high schools and we all
stopped at the computer High School on
the way home wouldn't be nice if you
actually go here so I end up going going
there at the idea High School in brush
oven actually I think 50% of my class
actually works at Microsoft and they
were working here when I was in med
school and they're laughing at me so
yeah but I always sort of had this
combine the interest and I used to
program what you know decades ago C++ it
was many many years ago but anyway thank
you for a for the invitation I think
hopefully I'll try to to you know
introduce you to remote mind in which is
something that you
think about everyday and then sort of
try to emphasize my you know the other
side of the story my clinical sort of
view on this concept and why do we
really need this in in health care so as
you probably know the health care it's
one of the most expensive industry in
the world and you know us tops that with
over eight thousand dollars per year per
per patient and if you look at the
civilized world they're around three
thousand dollars and you know even know
Canada you know it's about four thousand
dollars so we really spend a lot lot
more money than any other civilized
country and then especially if you think
about Medicare so obviously everybody at
age 65 and over covered by Medicare you
know it's a huge rise in the Medicare
cost in over the last thirty forty years
or so and you know continues to to rise
even further there was really no end in
sight it has plateaued for the last two
or three years probably because of the
economy's hope had nobody can spend any
more money but not the real decrease and
that's what also actually very
interesting it's you know the oil is
here about the 1% this is the one person
that nobody really talks about so twenty
percent of the Medicare costs are really
spent by the one percent of the
population okay and then half of the
Medicare cost is really spent the top
five percent of population so a lot of
chronic disease in this country and a
lot of money being thrown away at it and
I'll make an argument that actually is
not all for you know providing great
treatment it's a lot for doing things
that we should maybe be doing so how do
we actually spend your money well so if
you look at the national health
expenditure in 2010 two point six
trillion dollars so if people don't know
what that means it's actually Apple
Microsoft Google Berkshire Industries
J&amp;amp;J and the Procter &amp;amp; Gamble and Chevron
is what we spend every year okay so
imagine this piece of the pie which is
hospital care this is Apple this is
Google is Microsoft in one year both
it's gone okay and then we start again
next year so if you really look at what
we spend on half of the money spent for
monitoring and testing and some
treatment but mostly is mine during a
testing
okay and you think if we spend so much
money you want to actually maybe fix the
problem and you know spend something
about you know in prevention sure we do
3% of our healthcare costs every year
spent on prevention okay so very very
small amount of money which actually
leads to what what the problem is so
what you get for your money not much
really
so if you look at survival across in the
astralis world you know these were Japan
and North Korea and South Korea are you
know about 80 years of age Western
Europe and then us 78 years of age
that's all expected life expectancy at
birth which is actually close to Cuba
which is not on this graph but it's
actually close to Cuba the difference is
we spend eight thousand dollars per year
Cuba spends about four hundred dollars
per year okay so not a lot of profit for
for our investment and what actually
leads this healthcare cost well it turns
out cardiovascular disease so if you
look at the top 22 diagnoses that
account for the majority of healthcare
cost one is you know heart problems
which is mostly myocardial infarction
and heart failure hypertension other
circular condition so peripheral
vascular disease and stroke so these
actually are the top if you combine them
together as cardiovascular disease it's
the top you know reason for spending
money in health care in this country and
if you actually distribute this by age
you can see the faster rising segments
is the sixty five to eight years of age
so people are just retired and unhealthy
otherwise enough to live longer lives
but they spend a lot of money and if you
actually break down all these money goes
you know the red bar its
hospitalizations so a larger one of
money spent in the hospital okay and
again if you think about where people
live they you know they live at home so
they we should really be spending this
money at home where they are trying to
prevent them to get into the hospital
you had the paradigm you know it's
actually the but you know the other way
around
I think the main reasons for what I call
the broken care so what happens the
patient usually have some symptoms but
they don't really recognize the symptoms
early enough at some point they get you
know worsening of their symptoms that go
to see a physician in the or
you know the average of his lease about
13 minutes right so doesn't you know 50
less than 15 minutes so limited time
there's limited staff to get all these
symptoms limited diagnostics if you ever
been to a physician office there's
really not much there's cup of blood
pressure cuff right and the scale maybe
so not a lot of tools to diagnose
anything there's really no mind that you
have any kind and then there's limited
intervention you can you really can't do
anything in the office right just write
the prescription and then there's really
no education about diseases and
management recognize symptoms earlier
and more correctly but in fact the cost
would change dramatically I mean yes I'm
sure I'll certainly respond right so so
actually I'll actually show some data
you know in Harvey which is a subset of
the car vast planet that just deals
exactly with that and then you know the
symptoms worsen so what people do they
go to the emergency room right and then
what the ER physicians do it they have
no relation with the patient they've
never seen the patient and then medical
legally they have to send the patient to
the hospital so patients end up ends up
in the hospital and of course the first
person that you meet is the case manager
that comes that you have to discharge
the patient right and then you sign
paper saying that as long as you're you
know physically able to go then you have
to go so again pressure to decrease the
length of stay there's not enough you
know if you try to therapy or a new
diagnostic you don't have enough time to
to see if it works and then you send the
patient home a bunch of people come back
you know so get readmitted and your
cycle kind of you know perpetuates over
and over again so I think this is just
reactive care okay we react to something
so I really have to change that and go
to be proactive and I'll use hard fair
which is you know my specialty to try to
emphasize this point so what is heart
failure you know it's a very complex
syndrome they can result from any
structure or functional impairment in
the cardiac function that either
prevents the heart from either you know
accepting the blood or ejecting the
blood right and you know the Cardinal
symptoms that people have are shortness
of breath and in fatigue which limit the
exercise tolerance or fluid buildup so
in the lungs leading to lung congestion
and people become more sure of breath or
fluid buildup in the legs or in the
belly and you know these features really
impair the functional capacity of the
patients and make them symptomatic but
the main physiological normality is if
you have one way to define from a
physiologic standpoint what happens in
heart failure we have actually an
increase in the intracardiac pressures
so in an ideal world if we all have this
pressure setting in the heart that can
determine the pressures 24/7 then we
know how to manage these patients we
obviously don't have that so how do the
patients look like kind of like this
right so they're really short of breath
and they're puffed and then you can see
that you know the blood flow you build
up build up builds up in the in the
lungs and patients get short of breath
the pressures in the heart increases
there's Harmison weakening and the
harmonics are become stiff and this is
sort of what the again a more another
picture of patients I have the swelling
in the belly or in the legs they're
coughing all the time because they're
fluid in the lungs of we're not you and
then they're tired and short of breath
so this is what what what it looks like
and you know how here again it's a sort
of a seeing basket of everything so if
you have coronary artery disease or
heart attacks if you have high blood
pressure diabetes a tribulation bowel
disease or caramel patek factors so
people have cancer they got chemotherapy
at some point their life they can affect
the Harma so so they all lead to some
sort of injury in the heart muscle
itself and then you know eventually some
of the patients actually have a
decreased pumping function so I called
them decrease the ejection fraction
which is taluk heart failure and you
know a lot of patients will die some
suddenly form and if you read me a sum
which is done from progressive heart
failure
well how common it is it's quite common
so if you look at all adults in the u.s.
you know what four percent of population
adult population has heart failure but
it's really a disease of the elderly so
actually one in ten people over age 75
has heart failure so it's a very very
common disease and again kind of brings
the medicare point in into perspective
right a lot of these people people are
actual Medicare yes there is a
concentrate with men being more
and 75-plus goes right yes I actually
it's a very good reason so you know it
turns out that you know in the younger
ages you know men have more coronary
disease or heart attacks leading to
heart failure in the older ages actually
women have more high blood pressure
leading to heart failure and it's just
manifest in over age 70 actually is
there a is there an exact definition I'm
actually surprised in some ways that the
number is as low as 10% it's my
intuition is that some people would have
a little bit of heart fair and a little
bit of swagger legs is there an it like
a precise definition in terms of
pressure or a texture vectors like is
there a simple definition that you can
give now or is it very right so I said
again the simple definition is the
pressure so if you have a catheter that
you measure the pressure in the heart
normal the pressure should be below 40
millimeters of mercury so anything about
15 it's abnormal so these patients will
have heart failure so I think all you
know it's about 6 million people but
there's a bunch of people actually we
don't know they have heart failure but
they have you know what they call
premorbid conditions and that's another
10 million people but they don't have
the symptoms yet threshold for an
interim cardiac pressure
correct correct and that's you know the
six million people and then you know the
ejection fraction again some of the
people about half of the people have a
low ejection fraction half of a normal
ejection fraction but actually doesn't
really matter because if you look at the
prognostic value of that survival wise
is abysmal half of the people actually
be dead within five years and you know
these data comes from the Rochester
Minnesota from the Mayo Clinic and they
looked at you know
trends over time and drew that's really
not a lot of change despite all these
good medical therapies that we have and
you know
electrical devices you know a prognosis
has changed a little bit but not too
much so still about half of the people
will be dead within five years so very
morbid condition not only people die but
actually come to the hospital quite
often so you know we actually have over
a million hospitalizations every year
just for heart failure alone and these
data shows you know from the American
Heart Association's you know statistical
power couple of months ago if you look
at data from
years ago in the you know 2010 just no
change all we've done we just kind of
shifted this you know quarters as people
got older but that's about it still over
a million hospitalizations you know for
heart failure again despite all this
technology we have we have not been able
to to alter that so you know half is
really the only cardiovascular condition
for which you know the numbers are going
out actually as opposed to heart attacks
or strokes which are going down and if
you think about cost again again it's
very very expensive
probably about thirty billion dollars
you know in 2012 and again if you look
at majority of that is just room and
board really just hospital care you know
twenty seven billion dollars and we know
that the cost per hospitalizations
actually increasing us that's so the
longer you stay the more money you spend
so if you end up so the average is about
you know seven days in the hospital
about you know eleven thousand dollars
if you spend more than two weeks in the
hospital then you end up costing about
forty thousand dollars okay
and most hospitals on average get
reimbursed about 20-some thousand
dollars so actually most hassles rules
money on on Harvard admissions so not
only it's a very morbid condition but
actually what's even more striking is
that a lot of patients are discharged
from hospital actually come back within
a month so it's actually an article from
The Wall Street Journal a few years ago
where you know I was coding a study that
was done on Medicare population so they
basically looked okay what are the top
ten conditions for which people come
back get readmitted in the hospital and
the top was actually heart failure so
more than one in four people being
discharged from the hospital for heart
they come back within 30 days with heart
failure so really not doing a good job
about keeping the patients you know
treating the patients and keeping them
out of the hospital and you know a
little more data about that again
looking at Medicare data from the last
five years we know that these patients
come back within the first thirty days
and you know Alan Krumholtz actually
group from Yale try to identify is there
any time period that you can say okay if
you can monitor the patients for the
first five days you'll prevent most of
the readmissions and turns out that's
really not a whole lot so if you look
over display over 30 days it's a pretty
constant
number of patients coming back every
single day maybe in the first couple of
weeks you get about 60% of the
admissions but relates across the first
30 days so really you know the so-called
vulnerable period you can't really come
up with any definition because it's a
constant flux of patients coming back to
the hospital
exactly exactly the same thing the same
hardware exacerbation it's actually
what's even more interesting they looked
at the first three conditions that
patients were admitted in the hospital
the first the three most common
conditions that Medicare patients come
to the hospital are heart failure heart
attacks and pneumonias okay so if you
look at these conditions patients go
back home 40% of the patients that have
heart failure come back with heart
failure but look at heart attacks you
know 20% of patients that came in
initially with a heart attack actually
come back in a month with heart failure
and patients with pneumonia 10 personal
patients have pneumonia come back within
a month with heart failure so it's
really a lot of these patients come back
with harford and you know the question
is why well let me show you the standard
of care for heart rate monitoring
it's a blood pressure cuff and the scale
that's all we have in 2014 patients go
home we tell them where yourself every
day if your weight goes up more than two
pounds call us okay that's the standard
of care we have so no wonder that you
know the broken care you know it's still
there because it's reactive care they do
most of the patients they do the problem
is it it the way it is so unreliable but
again that's what that's what we have
and so a lot of hospitals now because
Medicare you know became smarter said
well there's no more money so let's
share that let's spread the wealth
so now Medicare what it does it says
well if you have readmissions for heart
failure
more than national average will actually
penalize you so in 2013 we have to pay
one percent penalty on all your Medicare
diagnoses okay and like 2014 is two
percent next year three percent so
imagine a hospital that has a very
active orthopedic program right what all
you know all people need hips and hips
and knees right
which are very blue crative so imagine
now that if your heart failure patients
come back let's you have 10 hard fair
patients a year and five come back
within 30 days it's more than national
average suddenly you get the 3 percent
pay cut from all your orthopedic
business so of course the hospital
started to pay attention when it's you
know big money so they tried to
implement team approaches to prevent
heart fair actually UCSF is no different
so we went from this you know reactive
care to active care so what does it mean
well we've we've looked at we look at
our program and say ok what are the
elements that we need to prevent
Hardware patients from coming to the
hospital well we need to identify why
they come in we need to teach them about
their medications about diet and you
know try to coordinate appointments and
things like that so you know establish a
really really good team of nurses that
when the patient gets admitted to the
hospital they come there says the
patient they do it so called teach-back
where they actually tell the patient ok
can you tell us what we've told you so
try to assess how much they understood
and you know you discover the patient
don't you get what they tell them so you
know go back and teach them again and
you know you have to set up an
appointment so within several days of
discharge as I just show you that you
know the appointment the readmission
time it's pretty constant for 30 days
but it's probably concentrated the most
the first couple of weeks so having you
know an appointment to see a clinician
in the office in the first week we think
it prevents you know readmissions it
just sort of assess the patient make
sure that they have not regulated fluid
make sure that medications are in order
so not much you know just physical exam
just really blood pressure weight and
physical examination and then again we
have a lot of referrals for dietitian
physical therapy you know home health
and home health again it's a nurse goes
into the patient's home within 48 hours
from discharge make sure that all the 25
medications are in order throws away the
old ones get the new ones
throws the pitch out of the fridge you
know that kind of stuff so we you know
we did that to actually
our nurses got the grant from the Betty
Moore Foundation to do that we
established you know the color-coded
system was we talked in earlier green
yellow and red and then whenever
something happened then you have a plan
to you know do something called a
physician or the physician knows about
it and you know changes medications so
when we started to know our readmission
rate was you know twenty two point five
percent for for heart failure within 30
days
that was our sort of target and we
wanted to get it down to two sixteen
percent so this was out in our progress
in two thousand nine ten and eleven and
you know actually in 2013 we're down to
about 11 percent so with that really
well decrease the - readmissions
decreased all caused readmissions and
ninety readmissions we increase the
number of people that were actually
referred to home health increase the
number of patients that had follow-up
appointments so everything was great and
again is his data you know going down to
- 2012 so you know good hearty
readmissions data 30 days 90 days and I
think it was everybody was happy right
so we actually again we get reimbursed
about $24,000 per K so with our
decreasing number of readmissions
compared to the national average which
is about 25 percent we price el-sayed
about a million dollars to Medicare's
not a lot but you know you know it was
great but we thought what are the cost
of that well have you ever seen this
movie Saving Private Ryan so its mission
is a man that's what we have so I showed
you the team approach right so you have
three nurses a pharmacist the physical
therapists to physicians home health
pharmacists select 10 people literally
trying to prevent that one readmission
okay so this is really not sustainable
okay so if we've done well and you know
it is great but it's not sustainable
how does the hospital's interest because
they're not losing the 3% and on all
their Medicare diagnoses but I think in
the future I'm sure that somebody will
draw the line and say hey what's this
red hole in the budget here you know so
we need to actually come up with smarter
ways and actually they are smarter way
so if you look at how hard further
progress is you know you have patients
that are you know normal patients and
then you have patients that are
asymptomatic so they have an abnormality
their heart function but it don't have
symptoms here and then as they progress
that develop heart failure its
compensated initially then becomes
decompensate and then refractory and end
up in the hospital well it turns out
that the body sends physiologic signals
even in this stage here so when you have
an asymptomatic patients all these
pathways in the body get reactivated and
all this actually can be captured you
know there are physiologic signals that
can be captured so even in early stages
of heart failure can actually capture
the symptoms these signals and you can
use them to prevent you know something
bad from happening and it turns out that
you know intra cardiac devices are able
to capture this so the internal cardiac
devices were initially designed to
monitor and treat the rid mia so you
know ventricular fibrillation when to
attack our idea and you know being
inside the heart here the electrodes you
can capture a bunch of things so
engineers actually came up with a bunch
of things to be captured and initially
nobody was using them but you know
finally people have started to use them
and I'll show you some data that you
know this device actually is so powerful
that you know if you use right you can
actually prevent readmissions and you
know intervene before patients develop
symptoms and I'll just show you some of
these features here so we know that
congestion which is fluid buildup
precedes hospitalization and this is one
of the patients in a clinical trial we
had a few years ago and you know we
actually had a sensor in the heart a
tiny sensor and what this big that you
put into the palm react and you just
leave it there and then you can send
information twice a day and you can
actually send the precious in the heart
okay it's an invasive procedure but you
know once it's there is there and you
can send this information and you know
you can see actually the hospitalization
we know where the patient came into the
hospital and then when the study was
terminated and we unblind the data we
actually saw that the pressures were
high every time he came into the
hospital so very useful to see that the
the point I'm trying to make here is if
you look at the date of the
hospitalizations here okay so the first
one is actually Labor Day and this is
Easter and this is Christmas so very
clearly what drives him to come to the
hostel is bad diet and you know the
patient actually stayed after the trial
was completed he stayed in the in the in
the study and my nurse would you know
used to see the pressures every morning
called the guys a hinge read out again
last night you know you have to change
your medications don't need so much salt
so you know it works another very good
physiologic sign that is very you know
very powerful it's actually patient
activity so you know that you know as
you get heart failure you know you you
don't get enough blood to your muscles
so the patients become less and less
active and you know you have a capacity
limitation you know in heart failure and
they actually have very good studies to
show that the severity of heart failure
correlates with me how much you can walk
and interact cardiac devices actually
have the ability to capture how much you
owe because you have accelerometers and
not only how many hours a day you can
walk with actually to what intensity how
you know how high your heart rate goes
so you can actually capture all this
data and it turns out that is a very
powerful data set so if your patient has
a low activity level compared to someone
it has a high activity level you have
more than fivefold increase in the
chance of being admitted to the hospital
so very very powerful so imagine if you
have this patient for instance this is a
healthy patient this is a time of
implant where they got the device
implanted you can see very high activity
level and this the patient actually was
admitted to hospitals you know a bunch
of times again looking at the time of
implant doing okay for a while but not
kind of going up sort of going down and
here clearly the activity level is going
down and you can actually see that even
before the patient when you do a
hospital you see at least 30 days or so
of lower activity level so have you
actually intervene here you could
actually prevent his hospitalization and
we can see the 30 day readmission right
the patient gets out of the hospital
immediately within a month and sup back
into the hospital okay so clearly even
more so the activity level decreased
even more so this was somewhat high-risk
which could have been if you use the
date these you know this data could have
been actually prevented from returning
to the hospital early on that curve you
still sort of
a few weeks away from what would have
been awesome what's the treatment and
how reliable can you how reliably can
you actually prevent that
hospitalization so you can prevent this
so that the treatments are really one is
controlling fluid level that the patient
have to build up so you can use
diuretics water pills to control that
and then some sort of vasodilators or
blood pressure medications to lower the
filling pressures in the heart treat
some of them they're not on some of them
they are part of lower doses can't you
change that those to to prevent that any
idea cause and effect here is it but the
patient is not feeling well and
therefore the activity is going down or
is the activity going down and that's
causing the patient so the patient's
actually asymptomatic said no symptoms
here that's all we think it's it's cause
cause any effect I think you know
something's going on so their activity
was going down for intervention so
you're not now you know before that we
were talking about after date but after
the first event now you trying to be one
say before the event but how about
trying to treating you before that so
behave all things like like exercise
stress and so one would be in your mind
the right time one question I think
that's sort of the the whole purpose of
prevention right so the easiest way to
three the disease is actually to prevent
from happening right so we tried to
address this messages way before the
patients get the disease once they get
it we always emphasize they should you
know follow the right diet and exercise
and and and you know try to stay
otherwise healthy but they're usually
not so I don't think this information
would change my messages don't be
exactly the same but it'll make me have
some other sort of form of intervention
either medication wise or other
treatment to prevent them from coming to
the hospital try to make sure that
so if you're happy so what you saying
you that if you're trying really to be
ahead of time you know here's ahead of
time people would just not respond to
that and this is why this is the right
time to interact for the intervention oh
right but so we deliver that message
already and they are not following
Thanks yeah so so you know something
that the American Heart Association
calls ideal cardiovascular health there
are seven steps to the right in terms of
your diet not having diabetes having an
author exercise not smoking heavy
control blood pressure control
cholesterol so there are seven steps
basically so if you put them together so
people have all these seven
characteristics their chance of
developing cardiovascular disease by the
age 85 it's close to zero it's really
really really low but if you look at how
many people actually in the US for
instance have that 7 parameters it's
less than 2% of the population okay so
very small number of people actually
have the ideal cardiovascular health we
know it works it's just unfortunate
people don't follow that
another parameter that that we can
follow with intercardiac device actually
heart rate and heart rate variability so
we know that the heart rate is governed
by sympathetic and parasympathetic
forces and whenever you have heart
failure that balance changes so you can
actually assess the heart rate you know
from from these devices and the heart
variability which is very easy so you
have two different heart rates and then
actually averaging those you get the you
know the variability and imagine you
have this for 24 hours you get a 24 hour
variability there and if you look at
actual cases you know so the high
variability here you know said
hospitalization so you can actually see
that we think probably a normal a normal
that will be around 80 milliseconds and
you can see less than 40 is a very high
risk for hospitalization and you know
about 20 days prior to hospitalization
you can see that threshold being met so
again had someone follow these
parameters 2 3 4 weeks before the
hospitalization you can intervene and
patients would hopefully be prevented
from coming to the hospital we also know
that night time the heart is supposed to
go down as your parasympathetic system
is more active actually if it goes up
means your sympathetic system is more
active means your body it's sort of in
the compensated state and that's exactly
what you see here so you see about 3-4
weeks prior to coming to the hospital
done heart rate that nighttime action is
going up signaling something abnormal
with this patient poorly then also that
do patients have sleep problems then
when they're in this state they could
have sleep apnea as well right and they
can wake up you know because I should
have breath and yeah
if you you know if you have intracardiac
device again the major role is to
monitor arrhythmia so you know if you
have something like that Akash you
monitor for atrial fibrillation or
ventricular fibrillation you can see
whenever this happens you know the
patients are more likely to decompensate
and if you integrate all this
information together again you see the
heart rate that night and day and you
know normally you should really have a
nice separation but whenever they are
actually not separated that could mean
that there's a problem with this patient
and also you see that Pvt level can up
up and down so you can integrate all
this information and again draw some
conclusions finally one of the last
parameters that people have used its
interest erratic fluid accumulation so
we know that when the pressures in the
heart built up you have a lot of fluid
in the chest a lot of fluid in the lungs
so if you actually measure this you know
impedance you can actually see when
fluid accumulates and and impeding the
compensation can occur so you know this
is the impedance lower impedance means
more fluid and this is so called fluid
index for physicians who are not really
physics sensitive they need the cues so
whenever the fluid level goes up and
it's more fluid if you look at the
impedance that translate into actually
impedance being lowered and you know
this your patient has very low very
little swings but they actually see
patients with lots of swings in their
fluid level so very very powerful sign
of the compensation and I think the last
one that I'm going to show it's actually
respiratory rate so this is data from
again an implantable cardiac device and
you can measure the actual respiratory
rate and you have patients have little
variation throughout their day and
patients have a lot of variations and
you can see people have a lot of
variations in their respiration rate
actually end up in the hospital and
again it's a very powerful predictor and
comes from a study or presented last
year to one of the EP meetings again you
have a hazard ratio about five compared
people have normal respiratory rates or
no variation versus people have wide
variation during the day and the thought
is that you know when you have fluid in
the lungs you have to breathe you know
more more shallow and faster and then
again if you kind of sit upright and
your breathing gets better if you you
know kind of sleep then you know your
breathing gets faster again so
having these wide variations it's what
what makes it this happen and again very
powerful prognostic sign and how you put
it all together
what actually was a study conducted a
few years ago where several these
parameters were investigated you know in
a in a clinical trial and you know all
these things were collected and what it
showed that if you have you know
positive Diagnostics which in the trial
that you find us to you know it doesn't
matter which two but two of them were
abnormal compared to everything being
normal you actually have a pretty high
chance of being admitted to hospital and
it turns out that you know this sample
is a two weeks three weeks and four
weeks some between three and four weeks
it's actually the optimal time to kind
of you know review this collected data
and I just shared the you know with you
before that we did is in Chicago when we
I was there a few years ago at
Northwestern so he about 1200 patients
that had devices we put them on remote
every three weeks we interrogate their
data and then if three parameters were
abnormal actually my nurse would call
the patient and identified their actual
problem bring them to the clinic have
some intervention and within six months
we actually decrease the hospitalization
by fifty percent compared to the six
months prior to initiate this program so
very simple steps that we did and very
sort of back of the hand around lytx and
then was you know really really powerful
so I think we have a lot of data that
physiologic signaling works if you get
in you know signals process and you know
this is what usual care is today you
know basically daily monitoring its
weight and symptoms which we know
they're very very unreliable and then
you know you have a scheduled assessment
you know see me in clinic every three
months or you know something happens
come to me and I'll see you today and
there's some you know again the visits
are not very comprehensive maybe a few
times a year and then the therapy it's
mostly reactive so I think what the
ideal monitoring should be it's really
having a proactive monitoring of
hemodynamics or physiologic parameters
alongside with weight and symptoms maybe
but actually having less in-person
visits but more data being transmitted
remotely and actually
the the therapy being actively
transmitted remotely back to the patient
in real-time not you know every three
months on the patient sees a physician
in the office well the problem with the
implantable devices they are great will
have to be implanted so you know if you
look at the current devices the
indication for them is really
arrhythmias and only about 10 percent of
the heart failure patients will qualify
for their diagnosis also it's an implant
of implantable device we have a
complication associated the implant and
it's not trivial it's you know five ten
percent they're not you know
life-threatening complications but
nonetheless complications you know
infections bleeding and things like that
and they're pretty costly but $40,000
per device so you know again a lot of
money and a lot of problems you know
there are newer implantable devices now
that the electronic industry is trying
to come up so the companies that make
these defibrillators are trying to come
up with newer implantable devices that
are smaller and just featuring
diagnostic features but again though we
don't know how much will cost and again
they're still implantable so big
complication and then lastly would you
really want to have any implant right
there's not a lot of people that
voluntarily sell just sure give me an
implant now so so I think the proposed
solutions are not implantable but if you
look at the solutions out there they're
pretty funny I mean would you wear this
and you know half an hour a day to mind
to your heart health looks pretty fancy
at a Star Trek convention maybe but not
in a daily life and you have a patch
would you really wear a big bulky patch
you know every day you have straps for
some reason to everybody want straps and
then some electrodes that are kind of
looking puffy and you know under the
skin so you know the idea is to send all
this information you know to the cloud
something gets processed and then the
physician gets notified and the patient
gets notified the problem is all these
solutions they only because of the
amount of data is required then the
really archaic technology they use they
can only sample 10 minutes a day or 20
minutes a day so again it who knows what
those best end needs are right
and was the patient compliance who's
gonna remember oh it's time to put my
collar on you know 10 minutes a day you
know the fitness solution on the other
hand there is no cool that you know
gadgets that everybody wears right and
you know Fitbit and all that stuff but
they don't don't do much I mean they
mind to your heartrate and maybe
respiration and how much you walks
they're really not very helpful for
health care so I think you know if you
think about remote monitoring is sort of
the standard of care today we have these
devices big bulky devices sending
information but that's what I really
want to have right you know something
you know between cumbersome versus
awesome right this is what we need we
need a very good device that's easy to
use that the patients can use very
readily and it's what really the
paradigm should be changed right so you
have the patient that are older now they
have more comorbidities I showed you
that you know the top five percent of
the patients spend 50 percent of the
budget right just because of the Camorra
bilities they are frail if you look at
the admissions only about 40 percent for
instance in heart failure due to heart
failure
the rest are due to not even cardiac
reasons you know older people that come
from the hospital they go home they fall
break a hip they come back to hospital
you know because they have a hip
fracture and we're actually doing a
study at Berkeley with using kinetic you
know in heart failure patients to see if
we can predict from their gauge their
risk for decompensating
you know after hospital admission more
and more patients actually tech-savvy so
we did a study at UCSF and we found out
that 67 percent of the patients actually
had a smartphone even patients as all
those 80 and and or priests have been
using social media and things like that
and a lot of people not want their own
data so I think partly fueled by these
sort of health fitness in industry that
you know people can see their heart rate
they can see how much they run and you
know how many calories they consume that
things like that people really want
their data to improve their health it's
just that you have to give them the
right data to do that and of course the
pairs are very interested right so
imagine if you have a device that will
save Medicare 10% it's two billion
dollars right it's a lot of money and
you know technology I think is there you
know we have cheaper
and and and better Diagnostics we have
you know faster processing we have
predictive analytics we have cloud
computing and I think these things can
in the right frame we put together to
actually deliver you know proactive care
and then the health system you know it's
it's really very interesting because
there's a very limited part of dollars
right now we have fee-for-service we're
moving into paying episodes of care and
in the future actually get paid per
disease she'll have you know you have
thousand Harvard with the ACO s right
you have a thousand half a patient's
you'll be given $5,000 per patient per
year and what you do it's your business
you know you can put the FIB later or
you can give them you know keep them
away from McDonald's or you know give
them a device it's really up to what you
do it that money and I think the
provider now it's really aligned with
the health system it used to be that
most of the providers were sort of
private practices or doing their thing
you know see the patient in the office
patient comes to the hospital they go to
the hospital they can build their but
now they can survive anymore so the
actually big hospitals are acquiring
most of the practices so in fact in
Pratt and primary care I think a
personal products are actually acquired
by hospitals in cardiology sixty five
percent are acquired and they'll
probably hundred percent within a few
years cuz no one can survive on their
own so really have an alignment now
between the providers and the health
system and the payers because pairs will
have you know Edna will go to say well
use yourself you're out gonna be our ACO
in the Bay Area and your heart free care
model is gonna be what we want to pay
for so four million people be just
flying to use yourself to get their
heart fair care there so it's really a
lot of alignment in this but what do we
need I think we need better monitoring
tools first of all we need tools that
collect relevant data okay not just body
weight relevant physiologic data and I
think they need to be you know collected
continuously is that 24-hour continues
or ten hours I don't know but they need
to be more than ten minutes a day and I
think we need to collect multiple
physiologic signals the problem with the
current existing non-invasive tools they
all want to collect one signal the
problem is you know the body it's just
very complex you know network it just
doesn't have one
we need multiple physiologic signals to
be able to to detect change there's no
magic bullet and you have to be passive
the moment you ask the patient to
something that's the end of your product
okay no one wants to do anything it has
to be easy
has to be live transmission to you know
to the physician office processing the
cloud with a predictability can omit the
diagnosis the physicians don't want and
don't have time to spend to try to
identify what these signals mean you
have to give them this is green this is
yellow this is red and then it has to be
a feedback look to the patient what to
do now not in three months when you see
the physician and I think you know it
needs to be non-invasive and unobtrusive
and they're very easy to use system you
can ship it in a box
everyone can you know put it on the
wrists or whatever and can use it right
up the box so I think you know just to
conclude my presentation
you know the admission for harvey are
really common and costly its rapid
increasing number of patients again the
aging population is you know expanding
and one in ten people over age 75 will
have heart failure and we I think we
need to change from the unidirectional
passive remote monitoring to the
bi-directional information exchange
between physician and and patients and I
think it's a very unique opportunity to
decrease these fastest-growing cost in
the Medicare system and be rewarded for
it and I think it's a very unique
opportunity for a you know technology
company to actually combine the existing
engineering skills the data mining
skills and the preliminary takes to to
deliver this product in the 21st century
I think the nice thing for it is I
actually can take this lessons from
Harvard and apply it upstream to all the
cardiovascular problems applying it to
my car information prior to hypertension
but I think the heart is the case Keynes
example because it's so so morbid and so
deadly and and so prevalent so if we can
actually learn something from this and
then take it up so you may actually make
huge indents into primary prevention and
we know preventing you know
cardiovascular disease and cancer my
contact information if you want to email
me or call me thank you
you're generally a beginning sure to
collecting many signals and using
analytics to infer risk from those
things but someone could have given a
similar talk that said that the thing we
want to measure in this case for example
is intracardiac pressure let's put all
of our effort into non-invasive
measuring you actually I'm interested in
that you didn't talk about emerging
technologies for not in this pressure
assessment or things like that are there
are there specific technologies emerging
let's say either or portable treads and
convenience or whatever might be
practical for measuring the specific
signals that you believe to be
interested or if you sort of seen what's
out there and it's not that promising
yeah so so there's really no there's
really no good non-invasive way to
measure intracardiac pressure so most of
the tools nowadays are miniaturized
invasive so you put them in you kind of
leave them there and then they transmit
some data but I think again just
measuring the pressure alone it's not
gonna tell the whole story even if
you're reliable exactly because you can
have pressure changes and none of the
other parameters are abnormal so you
know the best example again you have
this hard you know that's failing right
so the pressure are already high but
let's see have this patient in an
experimental state in the cat lab and
you infuse two liters of fluid in this
patient the pressure will go from 20 to
40 okay but the patient is not in heart
failure because nothing has changed
and that's I think the change doesn't
happen and that's one of the good things
about cardiovascular this doesn't happen
overnight and actually it happens over
time so you have time to react so you're
focused on this kind of multivariate
approach is it just because we can't
measure the right thing yet it's because
there's not know what you're right if
you could dream up all the sorts right
we don't know what the right thing is
that's a funny again I think and I don't
think there's one only one right thing
because the body is so complex and
there's so many interplays right again
if you if you think about pressures part
of the problem of the pressure is that
you know the kidneys don't work they
cannot eliminate fluid right because if
I give you 10 liters of fluid you just
can all eliminate it but someone has
abnormal heart they have abnormal
kidneys and then cannot eliminate the
fluids so you know there are so many
interactions
talk about the this thirst I guess that
consumers are starting to have for data
and the the bi-directional information
flow between patients and providers but
we've noticed a dichotomy and provider
is rare so some providers are really
amenable to this and really think it
helps them through their jobs and others
are you know for lack of a better way of
describing it definitely afraid of it
thinking an ex claiming it handsome
that's a lot of glowing are you sir we
wrestle with this yeah do you have
advice on how do think about that and
what the right entry points yeah it's a
great question I think you know
unfortunately most providers are that
deadly afraid of it and I think there's
a reason for that one is it's perceived
as adding more work someone's already
busy adding more work and I think the
existing technologies have not made the
case actually it doesn't add more work
it actually saves work so I think once
that case is going to be made I think
more providers would be kind of open to
the idea of sharing information and and
being more proactive in that regard and
second I think is something that it's
hard to change which is just a
traditional way the medicine was was
performed and people thought that you
know I'm kind of I'm the physician I'm
the end-all be-all kind of thing so you
know it's changing with generations
you could smell the characteristics of
this device that you would ideally want
that's not implantable but do you see
the mechanism by which consumers get the
device the same like a medium perfusion
the doctor releases it and they're
recommending it right like so you'd see
that yes it's actually interesting right
so I think if you look at Health Care's
three parties right the patient's the
providers and then payers so I think
it's gonna be probably either patient
driven because they'll say well I've
seen these data on a commercial or
whatever and it really looks like is
gonna improve my health and they're
gonna go to the physician say I want
this or the payers will say you know
what this actually really saves money so
if you don't get it I'm gonna increase
your premiums and if you don't get it as
a physician I'm gonna move my business
to a different institution not yet I
mean there's pieces of data but not not
complete yet otherwise we'll probably
all having some sort of mind ring but
it's not there yet I get it the major
isn't people just focused on one single
parameter
let's eat Vidya on obviously a lot of
these fitness devices are oriented
towards step counting 15 being that the
one successful started there and the CBC
is all over 50 right like the data
coming up the CDC is like one walking
better health 52 the ticket ticket I
actually have heard anything to suggest
that has propagated to payers so they
actually has so so yeah it has actually
so there are some actually insurance
companies where you know as a I can't
remember thing maybe Blue Cross I think
in a blue cross to unite were actually
they had a site where where you actually
download your data and you get a hundred
dollar discount a month or something if
you show that you met a ten thousand
dollar 10,000 steps a day fire station
repair or relational payers or providers
that all encouraged or reversed to get
patients to use it's gone a bit
different right no so I mean we we do it
so a lot of us to do it and it kind of
depends on what part of countries you
practice but at least I've seen a lot of
Cardiology action Brett embracing that
and we've known the 10,000 steps a day
for many many years but had no way to
actually get into the population now
it's very easy it's like you were this
you know it's gonna tell you how much
you you walked and that providers are
you're doing that mean it's maybe it's
just a sign of it's time to move away
from certain fee for service based
reimbursement rates or like obviously
that's in the best interest but it
doesn't necessarily enable the next
thing to make its way into practice
because you're not being reimbursed to
recommend it if you try again it's gonna
change right because people are gonna be
reimbursed for that specific thing and
now you know again the reimbursement
it's a very complex issue in the United
States but there's now codes for
prevention where people can actually
build for preventive services so once
that gets mainstream people will be
encouraged to physician will be
encouraged to promote that but I think
you know it's not that physician don't
want to do that because we first of all
we're in the business to helping people
right I think it's if you make it easier
for them right so if I have to like fill
out 20 forms and then get the data
transcribed you know it adds 20 minutes
of you know worked my day for every
single patient I just don't have time to
do it right but if you make it seamless
and integrative and I don't have to do
anything then it's gonna work so for
that cardiovascular disease is something
that happens overnight and apparently
the data yet support any further
application do you think we like to call
them some other applications like other
diseases that sort of thing sort of
thing this would actually meant this
amount of data that is available sorry
you know I think that the project the
one the one disease that has the
shortest sort of change with outcomes is
diabetes right your blood sugar can
change within minutes and then something
bad or really bad happens right if you
brought sugar drops you know you can go
into a coma blood sugar goes up you can
go into a coma so it's one application
people are actually working and it's one
of the diseases that it's most research
because it's very symptomatic right
actually people are interested to
monitor their sugars and they're doing
better you know new technologies you
know the you know again cancer it's one
disease it's a very slow progressive
progressive disease but there's really
not a lot of physiologic signals more
biological signals and again we know now
that cancers are basically just gene
mutations at a different level
and there are companies coming out now
right with technologies you can test and
sample and identify something you know
the colon cancer right so there's a
recent publication showing that you know
testing your your stools for mutation in
a gene it's more sensitive that
colonoscopy so people are using that
again because of very slow progress in
disease and I think in the audience
talked about it by thinking in the end
you know the ultimate
sensor should have some biologic
integration right so some sort of you
know molecular signaling right for heart
attacks we know that things change into
the bloodstream that you know different
cells in into the arteries shed and you
can detect those few days before her
that happens right so integrating that
with your physiologic signals and sort
of having the personalized medicine
approach that we all can aim</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
