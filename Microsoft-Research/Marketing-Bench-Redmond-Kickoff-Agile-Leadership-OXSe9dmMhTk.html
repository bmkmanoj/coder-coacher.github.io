hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
okay now I'm on Mike so it is official
the meeting has reconvened so thank you
all for the morning I saw your
engagement seemed like you had a good
morning learn some stuff with personal
brand you've got some action items
around your personal brand feeling good
about that and also you know it looks
like you guys were having some great
conversations upstairs with the GM so
I'm glad that that seemed to work out
nicely so there's a little snacks on
your table if you get hungry so I'm
going to introduce our afternoon speaker
and and I don't know a speaker is quite
the right word but it will just leave it
at that it is John Sweeney from the
brave new workshop and he's going to
help us all learn about agile leadership
alcohol communication and whatever else
he has up his sleeve so I thought um I'm
gonna just go ahead and hand it over
wonderful you can clap now thank you
thank you so much we are going to spend
the next few hours diving headfirst into
the art form of improvisational comedy
not with the goal of teaching any of you
how to be funny or actually not with the
goal of teaching you how to perform
improvisation but we're going to look at
it kind of in a liberal arts learning
model and we're going to look at the
behaviors and attitudes and maybe even
the cultural norms that exist within a
good improvisational scene which is
truly a group of people who are
listening to their customers and
instantly creating product in an
innovative way and see what we can do to
translate that to the behaviors that
you're working on to improve your skills
and improve your career and I'm pretty
passionate about the necessity of that
practice part so you'll get to know me a
little bit I got kind of a cold today so
I'll probably be less obnoxious which is
good for you guys but I've had an odd
little life at 46 years so I did pretty
competitive college football and then I
did the real world for seven years and
then for the last 15 years I've been in
the world of the arts and I've realized
that in athletics and in art
we practice almost all the time well
beyond ninety percent of our time they
spent practicing we understand what
skills are needed to execute well and
then we spend all of our time getting
coached and practicing and then there's
this world in our world where we
continue to be asked to increase our
skill sets our level of responsibility
our new technologies are new stretching
of who we are so we can accommodate the
corporate mission and increase
shareholder value but I ask the question
why in the world aren't we practising
these things and so today we'll practice
a lot we'll practice the behaviors and
we'll actually do the stuff where you
can practice the behaviors instead of
just saying you know you really need to
be more agile as leader which means you
need to accept different points of view
have somewhat of an authentic chameleon
approach to leadership and make sure
that you're receiving and sending
messages in a way that's most palpable
for the people that you're trying to
maximize great understand words put them
up there and I'm wondering how you're
going to get better at that if you don't
actually start practicing being agile
doing things that make you stretch your
agility my little silly little football
story is when I got to football uh uh
beginning of freshman year they realized
that I was either shorter or slower or
both than name for some reason thought
so they moved me to a new position and
so I had spent my entire life from
second grade until college playing
football on two feet being able to see
the field and being able to really
understand that perspective and now for
the first time ever I had to play
football on my hands and knees and
really go from a field perspective to a
3-foot by 3-foot perspective and I had
to work on new muscles and new high-end
eye coordination and new understandings
of strategy and it was difficult and
this silly little game the silly little
college decided that if I was going to
do that and be productive and add value
to my team they better give me a
specific coach put me on a specific diet
videotape my right arm take me off the
team for a year so I could get good
enough to go back and add value give me
a specific exercise regime have me watch
films of people who did what I did
really really well all that
for a silly little game of football that
by the way three years later I never
played again in my life and think of
what we talked about this morning i
would got here at eleven so i just kind
of got through the wonderful explanation
of a career path or strategic moves or a
nice perspective on career path and
think of all of the things that would be
necessary to do what he did all the
different types of skills all the
different types of perspectives and yet
you didn't hear a lot and so when i
started that job there like we really
want you to do a good job so we're going
to take it off we're going to pay it but
you're going to get a year to get better
at that that's just not how it works so
today we'll push you a little bit
because i'm kind of a big advocate of
you can know as much as you want but you
need to do a lot to get better at at
your career it didn't get better
leadership so one of the things will
first start out with is yet to be great
communicators so i'll push you to
communicate today there won't be many
times as you further your career where
people won't need to know your opinion
and you won't be able to you won't need
you'll have to share that with them in
an eloquent way so i'll ask you
questions I'll ask you to be verbal if
you're shy that's a great way to
practice stretching yourself will create
a safe environment in this room because
we all kind of have the same goal is to
get better at this stuff so that means
the floor rate will be really really
high and that'll be part of the learning
process so you don't have to worry about
being embarrassed or being stressed out
we'll support each other for the next
few hours as a way to take some time
because I got a feeling tomorrow you're
going to have some emails and some calls
and some meetings so we get a gift and
so we'll start with some communications
improvisers have about two to three
minutes from the time they understand
what the customer said they wanted to go
into strategy development and then bring
it to market we do all that in two to
three minutes so one of the things we
really have to be great at is declaring
our point of view and communicating
really sharply so my point of view for
this very moment a couple of things
first and foremost gratitude I'm getting
paid for this a lot of money I'm really
really grateful for the business I own a
comedy theatre with my wife in
Minneapolis Minnesota we'll take this
money and we'll go back and give it to
our 42 employees who are the most
wonderful people you'll ever meet my lot
your life and they'll use it for
frivolous things like
health care and education and rent car
payments so on behalf of all of us I'm
really really grateful to Microsoft I
think this is the six bench so I've done
and this is the hundred and eleventh
engagement I've done at Microsoft
Corporation was in the last ten years so
I'm really grateful for that you help us
keep our theater in our school alive so
I'm grateful I'm also grateful from a
personal standpoint I spent the first
half my life on a dairy farm in
Wisconsin so today I woke up with the
same day and mantra I've had that I when
things don't go great i remind myself of
that mantra was today's Sweeney you will
not milk a cow okay no way you will not
pick rocks out of a field all day long
and well know that next spring new rocks
will be pushed up and you left pick
those up you won't shovel not one
single time today well I have to do that
i might spew some but i will not be
dealing with manure in any way today
that lunch was free and it was awesome
there is hershey bars in that glass
thing right there i can go get seven if
i wanted it's an unbelievable day and
I'm trite and I'm silly but I try to as
a leader of our small little
organization and someone who needs to
bring positive attitude to the people i
work with every day remind himself of
some of those simple things now reminded
to you of now on all right of you may
leave you work for microsoft corporation
do you remember that every day it's a
really really really big deal you don't
sell term life insurance you don't mind
coal you don't sweep city streets you
don't work at a dairy farm you work for
one of the most respected innovative
amazing organizations on the entire
planet you talk about the one-percenters
you're one percenter you get to work at
an awesome place i get to work at an
awesome place i hope you come and see
the brave new workshop we don't have
your scope and scale but I'll rival you
it's a fun awesome place to work and we
are innovative and we are proud of our
organization so gratitude second point
of view humility I'm the reason the bell
curve works folks I I am the dumbest guy
in the room by far but I got a little
bit of energy so I got through college
on that you all do think
and know about things that literally are
above my comprehension so today I don't
have anything to tell you I'd like to
share some things some behavioral things
not even I don't even think I have a
good grasp on the the psychology of what
we do is improvisers I simply want to
show you what I've learned and heavy
practice and make you laugh over
practicing as a way to help that's about
how complicated i get i can't really go
above and beyond that i know that
there's some miracles that I've seen in
the 10,000 students that have come
through our school that this art form
has helped people be their best selves
and so I want to serve you and I don't
want to tell you much because that would
just be ridiculous I also spent a little
bit of time as I mentioned the corporate
world and so I would go to things not I
prestigious things like this but you may
gather people together and they'd pay
some guy and he would stand up and he
would tell you if you followed his
simple five-step plan you'd make a
million dollars and lose 20 pounds and
blah blah blah blah blah and I was
always in the back pretty drunk and
really cynical always thinking well if
it's so damn easy let me ask you a
question fella why the hell aren't you
doing that simple plan and being a
millionaire instead of yappin at us in a
cheap suit all day alright so today I
don't want to tell you anything but I'm
really really excited to share some of
these things about this art form because
you're going to immediately attached to
them and say well there's some wonderful
insights here then the third point of
view I have is just unbridled energy for
a couple reasons I've had four or five
pots of coffee and three ribbons so I'm
ready to go all right I got a little
energy you'll see this all the day long
and then I take the red-eye home I'll
sleep on the plane all right and so I
have it in general this kind of
unbridled odd unpredictable energy
started when I was four I went through
19 years of Catholic education but a lot
of those nuns are dead now so it's going
to be okay and when I was four sister
pedra said why don't you draw in between
the lines and of course I immediately
drew outside the lines so she slapped my
left hand or as they used to call it the
wand of the devil and she gave me a new
piece of paper and had a bear on she
said color in the Bears I colored it in
with blue crayon she slapped me and she
said that's wrong bears are brown and so
I turned it over and I drew a wonderful
picture of a nun with her head on fire
so I don't have the ability to control
my energy a lot and it's pretty sporadic
and it's fun and so that's who I am as
person but then I've learned as an
improviser and maybe as someone who
leads a company and maybe it's someone
who gets to learn from you guys every
day as I'm out there looking in the best
corporations in the world is that as
trite as it seems sometimes it boils
down to a little bit of extra energy and
a little bit of extra passion you've got
all the models you've got all the career
paths you've got all the leadership
things you can take all the courses but
the one thing I find is that people who
are migrating up or or kind of
increasing their value to organizations
somehow find a way to even when things
aren't perfect to find that positive
energy to just maybe wake up a little
bit differently or maybe fake it that
day and so I'll give you energy all day
long until until the time is time to
leave I hope you give it back so those
are my three points of view for
communication we are going to be active
all day long if there is something that
we do that you physically can't do
that's really super cool and we won't
even have to talk about just just decide
not to volunteer if there's something
that we're going to do that you're like
I don't know if that's going to work for
me absolutely go do it right away just
bleep at it jump right at it because I
promise you everything we do today is
being done in our school of
improvisation which is adults like
yourself who live in Minneapolis and
work for 3m or Medtronic or boston
scientific or target or best buy and
they come to use improvisation as a way
to hone their skills to find their most
innovative and authentic self so i'm not
going to push you to a point we're not
gonna do a ropes course i'm not going to
you know blindfold you and tell you to
drink something without looking at or
whatever it is Oh we'll leave that for
the other companies um so I'm going to
push you today but it's going to be fun
so the first thing we need to do is to
stop this sitting with our hands folded
so everyone can stand up and we'll come
over here and you can clap on your way
over here we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
