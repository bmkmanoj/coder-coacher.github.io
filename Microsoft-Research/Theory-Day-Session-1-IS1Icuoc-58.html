hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading

academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
welcome where I'm delighted to start
this theory day and the first speaker is
the Nami son who will tell us about the
borders of borders theorem ok ok so high
so a border with the capital B is
actually a person who has a nice theorem
called border serum that is very useful
in auction theory and this serum and the
more point of this talk is that this
serum cannot be generalized as you would
want and that's why it has borders so
let me start with a very simple problem
and marginal probabilities so what I
have here is the some probability space
that has a separate into four regions
maybe according to two random variables
a rope the rover is a rover calling a
random variable and the column one and
what I have here is the probability in
each one of these pieces so assume it's
so conditioned on being in this row and
this column the probability of some
event is 0.1 conditioned on this one you
get 0.5 and what I'm interested really
in the marginal probabilities here
instead of writing marginal
probabilities I wrote two times a
marginal probability so I'm assuming
everything is uniform in these four
things so the marginal probability of
the event just given that we are in the
first row is 0.3 so I'm writing you're
pointing so we can see that it's just
the sum of these two numbers and
similarly have the marginal
probabilities relative to the second guy
and the total sum of course should
probably be the same the sum of the
average of these marginal probabilities
should be the total probability of the
event and this should work out both this
way in this way okay and the question is
what kind of numbers can you have in
these in the blue rose can you have any
kind of numbers if I give you a set of
numbers in the Rose can you tell me
whether it's possible or not that's a
question okay so it might be seen
completely trivial you surely you should
be able to get any number two in 0 and 1
but the answer is apparently not can you
fill in the matrix here so that the
average of these two margin or possess
this marginal probability is 0.2 so I'm
great
and this marginal probability 1.6 and so
on is that possible or not so thanks so
that's the sort of an interesting
natural question and it's not completely
clear I will prove shortening that it is
not a but what kind of numbers can you
have there so in general is a if you
wish you'd natural computational problem
will be something like that suppo you're
given now we have n different random
variables each one taking em different
values and i'm giving you the marginal
probabilities for every value of every
random variable okay so you get x I of
J's a marginal probability of some event
that we're thinking about when a certain
random variable has a value J and the
question is is that possible is there
any probability space so I'm assuming
that my random variables are uniform
just for simplicity you could have the
same thing with other probabilities is
there any way to set up a probability
space such that within such that the
probability so what does it mean to set
up a probability space you need for
every vector for every profile of random
values of the random variables to know
what is the probability of the event
that we're talking about is there any
way to set it up so that you get these
marginal probabilities so that's a
natural question it would seem to be
very simple a one thing that I should
point out that obviously a the set of
possible values of these marginal
probabilities is the polytope because
it's really just a projection of the of
the linear so if we wish in higher
dimensions dimension of taking into
account all the little x i's here each
one of them is just bounded between zero
and one and we're just projecting onto
their averages in position so this is a
polytope and the question is is this a
polytope you can recognize efficiently
ok seems like a very interesting natural
question so why was i interested in
haste a question on there and variables
well because a a so what ok so why was I
because it somehow came up and as an
action like a problem so let me continue
to say you have where am I trying to go
I'm going to try to say to give you this
is from an auction perspective how do
you get this kind of problem from an
auction thing once we get that then I'm
can tell you about border serum which is
very nice so I'm going to tell you what
it is and I'm going to really tell you
what why it's really so cool and why
lately and I a voicemail and algorithmic
mechanism and design community people
have really been working it out and they
how I would like to generalize it and
then a I would they fix one way that I
would like to generalize the very simple
general more general economic scenarios
that I would like to be able to get a
border like serum for it and I will try
to describe it and then I will start
playing with this problem and looking
what can I can I do anything with that
problem and when I start playing with it
it turns out that it's going to be
translated to bully into a function to a
problem and boolean functions and the
Chow parameter is basically on the low
Fourier coefficients of a boolean
function and this reduction will be very
simple currently surprising but simple
and once we get it that way then we can
actually show it's going to be a sharpie
hard problem and that implies that we're
not going to be able to actually get a
generalization of our serum because it's
too complicated in complexity terms if
you had a nice characterization to be
like an NP cohen PP tues NP something
like that and you won't be able to do
that and that already gives us our bad
result and then also will close the loop
and go back to our original problem
saying why the problems that i showed
you whether you can recognize these
marginal probabilities it also sharply
heart so it's a difficult computational
problem ok because that's the plan if I
just to understand you reclaim your
there is a poly code such that
membership and the sprawling tape is a
sharpie yep
so so it's been like this scaling it
would it be as how they if every
variable on the ethics values yes we're
going to actually show it when I
provided by that's too light so
basically the problem is you have like 8
to 10 dimensional you are putting your
project in these two to 10 dimensional
vector abilities to M value in there and
now you ask if there is a way to put it
here the projection of the quality of
the original photos is easy although
it's exponential many variables and the
projection is small few variables but
yet it's complicated yes so that
everything is going to be very easy but
i think i hope to spin your head a bit
to be growing between market tomorrow
yes ingestion of it so if you're not
straight to develop for videos which are
balanced your own haha then everything
very easy yes that's the whole point of
it sits apologize with the probabilities
are between 0 and 1 that's really the
sad thing ok ok so let me cast that
that's really catch that in an option so
this is original example that I had here
you have a marginal probability of an
event and here you have any of you have
them you have the probability theory of
the marginal probabilities i'm going to
recast that as an auction thing where
i'm going to treat this number as the
probabilities is that is an auction
between two players whereas this is the
probabilities is the first player wins
and then the second player wins is
probability 0.9 so for this example we
always are locate item ok so let me just
switch that to that situation so now i
have an auction and the question and I
so I so the question is is there an
auction if you wish where is the first
player made with probability 0.4 if it
has this type value in this situation
and windows probability 1.4 in this
situation and the second player wins
with probability 1 point 4 if it's in
this situation probability 0.8 with this
situation ok so we're assuming that
there are two players each one has two
possible values and these two values are
iid so you get each one of the four
combinations probability 1 ok so again
what we have here is so what I right
here
the probability the second player wins
this is the probability the first player
wins as 2 times the marginal probability
in the world of options is called the
interim a location of this player okay
so back to this situation a ok so where
we ask the question can you fill up the
marginal probabilities can you fill up
the probabilities to get these marginal
probabilities and in the auction setting
can you find whether probability that
the first player went under this is
tight we're now going to call these
types of the players okay and the second
player wins under this type and so on so
now we translated the same problem into
these question marks and here is the
proof that you cannot do that so the
proof is by coloring the different
question marks and it goes like this
well in this case this player windows
probability 1 point 6 which means that
the to the sum of the red values has to
be 1.6 the sum of the green values has
to be 1.6 now the son of the purple
value so now I've already taken a little
bit of the of the quest some of the
question marks in these B cells I didn't
touch this cell at all and this cell has
probability exactly one quarter or in
terms of actual numbers the relative
probabilities are one so the sum of the
purple question marks is one and then
you see you cannot have because all the
question marks together have to be four
and even without the black question
marks which are positive numbers we
already are beyond 4 ok so that's the
proof that you cannot do that okay so
generalizing this is exactly borders
theorem the border asks the following
kind of question and now let me tell you
I'm doing a little cheat here so for two
players my original problem with
probability spaces in the auction
problem was exactly the same because
anything is the first player didn't take
the second player took now when I have
more players more dimensions then it's
different because in the auction I have
a bunch of different parameters the
probabilities is the first player win
the second player when the third player
wins and that's not exactly the same as
the original problem and originally my
thinking was that that's a very tiny
a shin that we should get rid of but
apparently that's not the case but I'm
now continuing in the auction world okay
so border ask the following problem you
have n vectors each one of them having
em probability these are the interim a
location probability is a marginal
probabilities and the question does it
exist in auction with these marginal
winning probabilities okay very simple
and in a second i'll talk about the
various incentives and things like that
but for now really the question is the
content of border serum is just because
there's a probabilities work out okay
and that's the question now board
approves this serum twice in 1991 he
proved it and then 16 years later he
wrote another paper saying oh by the way
it's just an LP duality okay so this is
that so once you have the recur echt
thing you can prove it with LPL that you
can even actually cast it as a max flow
min cut kind of singles oh it's tricky
and the answer is the following scene so
he says so the following are actually
clearly necessary conditions for this to
work and the necessary conditions that
the file are the funny you take some
subset of values for the first player
some subset of values for the second
player and so on these are the things
that I'm going to basically color if you
wish and I'm going to look at the sum of
the winning probabilities assuming that
the first player has a value here okay
so the first it's a big X I of a subset
of values is simply the sum that is the
sum of the winning probability that he
should get ok so I'm not going to look
at the sum of the probabilities that he
should get here faith each one of the
players should get when he has a value
in Z sub set of items and then I filled
I counted part of the question marks and
the questions works I never I never
touched are the ones that are in the
complement of all of these sets that are
now counting so I'm actually adding the
probability in terms of just the so just
saw if we're talking about uniform over
these values it just saw the size of the
subset in terms of probability and of
course you need all these probabilities
to be at most one so things would work
out and the interesting serum
this is also necessary this is also
sufficient let me give an example in a
two-dimensional kind of thing so you're
getting these oops sorry so you're
getting these a exide capital excise
here and capital excise here and the
question is if that's feasible can you
find an auction in each one of these
cells figuring out the probability that
the column player it gets the items the
probability that the role player gets
item can you fill it up such that you
get these marginal probabilities these
interim a location probabilities and the
point is here the necessary condition
let's look at these two rows it's about
bus probabilities it's a rope with a
role player has one of these two values
and and look at the probabilities is
that one of the column players has these
two venues so you need such a sum of
these three probabilities plus the sum
of these two probabilities plus all this
some it better be less than 1 otherwise
you're certainly not going to be able to
do that okay and the stairs a statement
says that these are the only constraint
that you have that's a very nice talk to
zation of this polytope okay that's
border 0 okay so now let me just say a
few words how to make this a completely
into an auction kind of thing so if
you're not in Krypton options you can
probably zone out but they okay so
really in an auction you may have so I I
first of all I only talked about like a
uniform distribution over these possible
values of that like if I was just
hearing abilities and didn't stop much
deepen see you making the case of say 1
Martinez and say five majin as you can
thanks and sing off like identify and so
actually make it like it I know so will
turns out that there is a big difference
there is a big difference so that's
exactly I want to go back to the one
marginal because that's not my original
problem and i will give motivation from
auction theory for that also that i want
to go back to one and it will turn out
to make a difference so for for very
long time I thought it didn't make a
difference and it didn't work out
exactly
Hawaii okay okay so basically a now it's
not going to be just abstract values
there are going to be actually real
values we want to vm for each one of the
values of the players and these are
really the dollar amounts that perhaps
that this is really the value that they
get forgetting the item okay so now
these are actual values and not just
place all those first row second row
third row okay and we're going to assume
and we're only so everything here in the
auction world that we're talking about
and what's called in the Bajan setting
where you were living with these prior
probability distributions and the values
of the players and all the discussions
that i'm doing is only an expectation to
we're assuming that all the players are
just Bayesian probability maximizers
completely and doing all the
calculations this way okay so each
player basically knows the distribution
of the others but knows its own value
and they I'm doing and by the way border
didn't do it and this only in this
finite case that I'm thinking about it
works also for internet but if you want
to think about computational issues
you'd better make it final so I'm making
everything final final in a border would
not be happy but this it's the same
really and they I'm assuming everything
is uniform on these values again it
doesn't matter border serum extent
naturally nothing user okay now but so
beyond these values there's one other
interesting things in auction needs to
specify how much do you pay when you win
that's another thing that auction really
needs to specify and it turned out that
since we're really talking only an
expectation it's enough to talk about
the expected payment that I have if I
have value certain value and because all
the considerations are in expectation I
can just take that expected value and
say it give it everywhere or something
like that it won't be so there are going
to be the reserve is there is going to
be pij the expected payment of player I
when its value is Vijay so that's
something that an auction will need to
specify to really become an option and
then you have to interest important
constraints for whatever you're doing
one of them is called individual
rationality it means the players should
not lose that is what they pay should be
less than what they again what is this
as a day again well with probability x
IJ they win that's the probabilities as
a
the item over everything assuming that
they have value of VJ and in that case
they're making VJ dollars so this is the
expected gain and did better not pay
more than that and the second which is
the incentive one says that if I have
value J I'd better act like a guy with
value J and I'm not going to gain by
misrepresenting my and misrepresenting
my value and that basically translates
to this very simple inequality saying
that if I have value J and I'll act like
a guy j I'm going to get better utility
which is a mile but I gained from
getting the item minus y taipei then if
i act according to some other value J
Prime okay so for us it's none of these
really enter is very important but it's
all very linear simple linear
inequalities in the X's and in the piece
in the capital access in the marginal
probabilities in the interim a location
probabilities and in the expected
payments okay so why is this border
serum so cool basically because it
allows us to optimize auctions to do all
calculation options only using the
intermol occasion rules rather which are
which are only a polynomially many of
them rather than the whole exponential
size matrix of probabilities ok so the
kind of things we really are interested
in ok so by the way while border didn't
give a polynomial timer goes and just
gave the characterization actually you
it's not trivial to you have to be
clever but you can actually get a
polynomial time algorithm for that and
then you really can just use linear
programming to do whatever you want to
optimize almost anything that you're
interested in in the auction space so
suppose that we want to optimize for
some reason we want to optimize a
certain the payment as 20.7 times the
payments as the first player gives and
thus the utility of the second player x
0.9 then maybe the probabilities it's a
player wins and the revenue of the
auctioneer and the welfare that we get
in the system all of these are just
quantities that are very natural in
terms of the peas and exit there are
just linear quantities in the peas and
axes and then since we can now recognize
the set of recognize the set of possible
internal location rules we just knew me
too
optimization of linear function over up
over a very simple set polytope that we
have all the constraints incentive
controls the constraint so the
constraints are the feasibility ones
that border gives us plus the incentive
a is the incentive constraints ensign
individual rationality constraints that
are come from really from the auction
world which are just linear constraint
and a few of them and everything is very
simple so you can just run your
ellipsoid algorithm and you're happy you
optimize whatever you want that's really
cool so then ok so now but when you look
at it from an auction point of view it's
not easy there are other things beyond
the auction of a single item there are
more complicated things like public
projects they are multi-item auctions
are lots of things you would like to do
get the same kind of the results for and
for that you will just they need to be
able to generalize the you know border
serum to these other scenarios you need
to specify them in the same way and you
could get the same optimization for
anything that you would want to do and
that's been the program that these
people have been doing for the last few
years and this a situation is as follows
if you really want nice mathematical
clean exact extensions of order theorems
very slight generalizations and the
other hand if you are allowing yourself
to be a computer scientist and allow
yourself approximation allow yourself
not clean mathematically nice
descriptions of the constraints but just
the computational efficiently ones then
there are completely almost extremely
almost completely general
generalizations work ok so that is a
situation and which is it really amazing
results because now we're gonna probe
you can optimize anything that you want
really for any good mechanism design
problem if you're happy to be a
computation or approximate guy eh so
what you know I wanted to do the
beginning to not be a computation
approximate guy but to be an exact
mathematical guy and gets the same kind
of approximation but they only very
little was known and the question is can
we get exact results exact limitation
without you know just generalize as a
serum I mean like a mathematician would
and get the exact serum and which first
of all would have a nice mathematical
structures
maybe we can understand and work with
not just this completely and and an
understandable computational issues and
hey do it exactly nice yeah so okay so
computer scientists have learned to love
and think that other things are nice
right still but you know we would like
to get something non approximate if
possible and it seems it the first
problem that are simpler than the
auctions should should be able to do
that right so what was our point is it
no this is basically they did what's
possible so now we really should love it
right okay you can't do much better than
that so basically a unless you know
unless the complexity collapses on our
head there is not going to be a nice
characterization a nice characterization
of the constraints for the border like
polytope for public projects problem for
multi-item options even with unit demand
bidder for essentially any more
complicated problems that we can think
of that was not dealt by the tiny
extension that we said cannot be done
exactly okay and the way we're going to
show that i'm going to show it basically
for public projects and i'm going to
show the following interesting art a
public project setting this is a very
simple mechanism design setting for
which to if you want to compute just the
optimal revenue which is definitely one
of the many things you could definitely
compute exactly if you had a nice border
like serum i'm going to show you the
computing the revenue is char p hard
okay so let me give the problem here is
a problem so this government needs to
decide whether to build a bridge or not
and the government is nice is going to
just ask the or each person in the world
in the country whether he values the
bridge or not okay hey so and it turns
out that the people are completely
independent of this country and they can
each one of them can have either two
values half of the people have no value
whatsoever for the government and half
of the people have a value wi which
depends on the nature of the person and
the government that exactly knows what
this w is how much if I like the bridge
they
know how much I like it according to my
demographic but they don't know whether
I like it or not okay and so okay so
usually the the usual story this is
called the public budget then it's a
boolean public project because there are
only two possible values here and
usually the story is that the government
wants to make everyone as happy as
possible which in this case is very easy
it definitely builds a bridge because
the value is zero even for those who
don't like it but our government really
wants to maximize revenue so they're
going to ask you how much you whether
you want it or not and they're going to
charge you something if you say they
build the bridge and how much are they
going to charge you as much as possible
so they want to design the best
mechanism to actually extract value from
players from all the people in the
country and then get to the decision of
building the bridge or not so they don't
care about to build the bridges people
are happy or not but they just are
interested to get the maximum possible
revenue okay they can charge different
prices from different people okay and
that's the problem what is the best
revenue you can have okay so so one
thing is which is a little strange of
people who come in from this field this
is a single parameter problem Myerson
kills this problem okay but there is a
tiny little caveat in meyerson sirohi
tells you what the optional thing is so
it's very easy to figure out using
Myerson what is the option or optimal
magazine to get most revenue the only
tiny little / difficulty is that the
revenue itself is going to be some kind
of expectation at that point and it
turned out that computing that
expectation is going to be difficult now
as we could do the border kiting of
optimizing we would know also exactly
the value of the expectation and we
could do that so even though Myerson
tells us what is the optimal revenue it
was the optimal mechanism he's not able
to tell us what the optimal revenue is
except by a formula that's not
computable efficiently so sorry
no no no no it's not it's not but the
point is that the bad a bit so the
mechanism so that's that's interesting
we know what's the best mechanism is and
I'm going to tell you in a second also
we're going to derive it without Myers
on we're going to drive it from first
principles so I'm going to tell you
what's the best map map our mechanism is
but I'm not going to be able to tell you
what is it revenue simulating the
mekinese you can definitely approximate
by the way so you can approximate
everything as we said that you can
approximate our nice day is efficient so
you can do I need money and absolutely
and right yes and so in vetting by
itself may not be that that critical but
the point is what you learn from it is
that we were not able to add to
characterize the poly topical if we
could are characterized a polytope what
are the in terms of feasible in term a
location rules here then we all would
also directly be able to actually figure
out exactly the revenue which we can
okay so that's really the the point here
okay so now I'm going to do the switch
and try to figure out from first
principles what is the optimal
mechanisms here and it's going to be the
following thing so for every possible a
so okay so first of all let's find
indicator variables X I which specifies
whether my value is via is w either
publicly known constant or its 0 okay so
X is now I'm going to move to a zero one
situation rather than a 0wi situation
which is good we're getting closer to
boolean functions and for every possible
profile of values of the of the citizens
of the bidders there's going to be a
probability that the bridge is going to
be built it doesn't have to be a
decision yes or no it can be some
probability right we're allowing a
randomized mechanisms to the designer
okay so I'm going to have this boolean
function SI which of course is the
probability so it unfortunately has to
be between 0 and 1 and now let's see
what is my revenue going to be so let's
try to think how much money am I going
to take from a player with value 0 how
much am I going to take from a player
from value WI so a player with value 0
has zero value of the bridges built so
we'd better pay zero I expected this pay
expected payment should be 0 when his
values
euro because I could give him money but
that's not really going to help me it's
easy to see okay so I definitely cannot
take more than zero now suppose that my
value is WI how much money can I take
can be taken from me if I'm expected to
be truthful well let's see what happens
if I say why run rather than zero then
I'm going to maybe increase the
probability that the bridge is built
from the probability of s given that I
said 02 the probabilities that best is
going to be built given that i'm going
to say one where the expectation over is
over what I don't know what the other
players are saying okay so this is the
extra probability that I'm winning by
lying okay and by by saying 1 over 0 and
in that case my value from it is WI okay
so if I'm charged more than WI times the
Delta of these probabilities I'm not
going to want to say one because I'd
rather say zero I don't want the bridge
if you charging me so much so the amount
of money that I can be charged at the
most if I say one is exactly this number
okay so basically we've really reduced
so tiny details missing but this is
really the proof we completely reduce
the revenue maximization problem to the
following interesting problem and it's
almost a boolean functions like a
randomized boolean function is bounded
between 0 &amp;amp; 1 we want to find the
boolean function or the food or boolean
function that maximizes the weighted sum
with wi weights of the probability of 1
minus the probability of 0 function
because it's it will turn out to be a
boolean function but it's not clear at
this point okay so let's how can we
figure this out how can we find this
thing okay so first of all let's look at
this thing so now now we really looks
like a boolean function so walls are you
know parachute and other array hey for
ya now this guy's ratio this is
something we know how to do and this is
how they do it so if you look at the
probability x i equals 1 minus x i
equals 0 it's really i'm just summing up
FX f of x times either negative 1 or 1
according to whether X
the is a positive 101 ok so instead of
this difference I'm really having here
FX x sigh I of X Y is negative 1 to the
power of X I just turning 0 1 2 negative
1 1 ok so why is it so useful and oh and
by the way this thing is really the free
a a the fourier coefficient of I of the
singleton I of this function thump also
called the Chow parameter yes don't know
in advance that this blue divide you
just maximizing Sun know you're excited
vertex of the politico you're maximizing
yeah PDF function over there yes that's
please yes hey mister now keep the
expectation if you also aren't the
randomness of the algorithmic answer
because but you don't need you know you
don't need to argue that good yeah
maxing on my sleeve right except the
political Maxim's have no random 50 so
okay so these are the rules are for your
coefficient so really what are we asking
good we're really asking with the
findings of what is a boolean function
or food a boolean functions as maximize
the weighted sum otha of the Chow
parameters okay after you it was a
single tone for yearn for your
coefficients given the view eyes and yes
else now that's it that's it that's
given w eyes find that this is now a
medical problem because you know maybe
it will be difficult to tell what the f
is but it will not be difficult so so
we've taken what we want to optimize we
wrote it now when this for ya now this
notation which is so very nice because
we can just move the expectation to the
outside and now we take the expectation
outside and in each place we now meet to
optimize this thing but this is very
nice to optimize we can we can do it to
it we can do it term by term because f
has to be between 0 and 1 so how can i
maximize this well if this number is
negative i want to take 0 this number is
positive i want to take one completely
obvious right so this basically what I'm
taking is I'm taking either 0 and 1
according to the sign of this so the
optimal the
function that maximizes this is really
the sign or the 01 sign of your thing
which is really the weighted threshold
function to look at the sum of the
weight of the excise that are one and
compare them to the sum of the weight of
the exercise there are 0 and see which
one is bigger and according to that you
take you build or not build okay and
that's the best thing okay so and by the
way Myerson would also tell you the same
thing surprisingly okay and as you said
they this is a boolean function which is
really nice because it means the best
option is deterministic it's also a
monotone boolean function which actually
means you can make it into and into not
just Beijing incentive compatible also
bullied them don't Dominic strategy and
center woman so it's all very nice and
now the only problem that we have okay
so we know what's often functionally can
we figure out the sum of the weight is a
weighted sum of a of influences or the
way that some of them okay and it turns
out that's very easy to solve that
sharpie heart that's basically known
that's playing with child parameters
figuring out that sharply hard a ok so
our problem is given these w's and you
just want to compute not what the
function is we know what the function is
but just was this weighted sum of these
things is and you can see that I mean if
you just add another it just another bit
to it and see when it when does this
play so suppose I added another I plus
first item with a very tiny weight then
when can it play it can only come into
play if the other guys are exactly
exactly balancing out 20 okay and if
they're balancing out 20 that's
basically the probabilities so his
influence basically if some of weight
will be the probability that they
balance to 0 and you can see that's
almost a knapsack problem so this is
sharp knapsack and you can fill the
details it's very easy ok so that's
charpy hard so let's see what did we get
for boolean functions and then so I say
go back to what do you get for auctions
and I'll hopefully finish on time ok so
we show that it sharpie hard to compute
the W weighted sum of influences so
influences rzz biases or these
parameters this is the difference
between the probability with 1 and 0
that these are really the Fourier
coefficients afza knots of just an
arbitrary thing
of the W threshold function because we
know that's already is optimal from this
i want to say but that also means that
you're not able to optimize arbitrary
boolean functions arbitrary linear
functions / valid Chow parameters
because if you could do that you could
run the same ellipsoid and get the
optimal thing and so also even
recognizing at least under Turing
reductions recognizing whether you're
given a set of possible career
coefficient for the first level
realizing whether there is any boolean
or suitable semi boolean function that
gives you these is going to be Sharpie
hard ok and the same thing what happens
with the auction world ok so when the
option were will ready knows if the
optimal revenue is exactly the answer to
this question which is sharply hard and
in fact it means that because we can't
figure out the revenue for the boolean
public project you can't characterize
you can't do in border kind of
generalization because if you did a
border type journal is a shin where the
inequalities of the new polytope were
reasonably recognizable then you will do
sharpie and reasonable and that's that
ok and back to marginal problems so I
started with a question of a the problem
that I started with was or this is a
slightly special case of problem you get
inputs p 1 2 pn these are the marginal
probabilities of the different end
players and i'm going to assume to a
special case that the total probability
is going to be exactly one half so I'm
going to call that a balance things that
the pro total probability one-half so
the situation for the other one of the
two types is going to be exactly one
half minus p1 okay so this is a special
case so I'm giving these things and the
question does it exist the probability
space was a probable instrument that is
with probability exactly one half of the
event such as that for some other events
words which are also I ID and balance so
these are exactly the to 2,000 different
possibilities a we have the marginal
probabilities a given this way okay so
that's the problem we started with with
for the special case of exactly
probability one-half and now that's
really equivalent to the question that
we already answered and boolean function
because in boolean
we have the cues and the queues were not
the probabilities themselves but the gap
between the probability for one's the
probability 40 so that's really
translating back and forth is completely
trivial and that's the story so the
original problem Sharpie heart so even
though both it's only a single
dimensional variant of the border think
it's harder even though the border think
is easy and I'm done thank you rules are
exact computations you know seems to a
lot even like believe all know me
approximations maybe yes so yes so it's
okay so we do have a partial matching we
do have like like matching results that
can you can do it approximately which
anyway sort of known in the auction
world so it's not nothing new so far
we're trying to get it nicer and more
general but they but basically yes so
what you get in from the auction world
you can do approximation extremely well
one ball on FB toss so you send before
that they say to marginally marginal
problems are significantly others and in
in what sense say these are really hard
no so okay so so in the option thing
when you have a different number for
each player basically then it becomes
easy when you have less than that when
there's a single player a proper number
that you get different marginal than the
same numbers then it becomes the hard
apparently
yes okay if we have the coffee break
until the next up is at one-thirty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
