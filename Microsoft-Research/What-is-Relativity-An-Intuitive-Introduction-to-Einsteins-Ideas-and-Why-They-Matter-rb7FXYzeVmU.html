hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
thanks so much for coming my name is Amy
graves and I'm pleased to welcome Jess
Bennett the Microsoft Research visiting
speaker series he's here to discuss his
book what is relativity in which
Einstein ideas are presented so that
anyone can grasp the basics Jeff has
worked at NASA headquarters creating
research and education programs for the
Hubble Space Telescope and other NASA
missions he has taught at every level
from preschool through graduate school
and has authored several books including
award-winning children's books about max
the dog you could actually look at those
at the back college textbooks and three
other books for general public for the
general public including math for life
please join me in giving him a very warm
welcome thank you very much um it's a
real honor to be here this is actually
my first corporate event ever I talk at
universities and elementary schools a
lot but I've never come and talked at a
corporation before and it's especially
nice to come to Microsoft since pretty
much every word I've ever written has
been done in your software right and my
presentation is in your software and it
do we have anybody here who works on
worldwide telescope not in this crowd
right now but I have a college textbook
in astronomy and we use world wide
telescope as part of the online package
that's available to students for that so
a lot of connections that I'm very
excited but I also have a brother-in-law
who works for Microsoft so but not here
in Seattle anyway um what we're gonna do
today is I'm gonna talk to you about
this question what is relativity I
realize you're probably a fairly
sophisticated audience and a lot of you
may know quite a bit about relativity
already but I'm going to pretend that
you don't and we're gonna just take it
the way that someone learning about it
for the first time might hear about it
and the reason that this is a question
that draws a lot of attention is because
it's a rare thing in science everyone
has heard of relativity and Einstein and
yet very few people know
anything about what it is or what he did
and that makes people curious to know
what is it and what I'm gonna try to
show you today is that you don't have to
be particularly sophisticated with
science and math to get the basic ideas
in fact I think everyone ought to be
exposed to the basic ideas if it were up
to me this would be a standard part of
the curriculum starting in about third
grade and continuing all the way up the
line and I'll tell you why because
you'll see the subtitle here and why
they matter
towards the end I'll give you my reasons
why I think this is such an important
topic that everyone ought to be learning
something about it the short answer to
the question what is relativity is that
it is our modern scientific theory of
space time and gravity so I just think
about that for a moment space time and
gravity and you realize that's kind of
everything so this really is at the
heart of all modern science some of you
may know and some of you may not know
how deeply it is integrated into all the
electronics that we use and I'll talk a
little bit about that there's a reason
why I'm here now besides the fact that I
wrote the book which is tied to this
reason which is that this is a special
year this is the 100th anniversary of
Einstein's publication of his general
theory of relativity and as a result of
that there are events going on around
the world the United Nations actually
designated this year as the
International Year of light because
light isn't a critical part of
relativity and so I thought well what
can I do for my part of these
International Year of light activities
and I decided since I had a book and I
like to talk to people I would just go
out and talk to people so I sent out
emails to people I enough knew and said
would you like to have me come talk I'll
even pay my own way and I've had a fair
number of takers here so you might
notice that I don't have anything lined
up for next fall so if you know people
in other places who would like to have
me come talk have them send me an email
and I will be happy to do that my email
is down there Jeff at vid kids science
comm in addition to this being the
hundredth anniversary of relativity and
making it a good time to talk about
relativity it
also been on people's minds for another
reason how many of you have seen this
movie interstellar okay good so the
movie interstellar is actually very much
about relativity Kip Thorne Caltech
physicist who's one of the world's
leading experts on relativity was an
executive producer on this movie so it's
got a lot of good science in it and if
you want to know which part of the
science is real rich part is speculative
and rich which parts are not real I did
write write up a little blog post on
that that you can find on my web page on
my blog so I'd encourage you to look at
that it doesn't have any spoilers so if
you haven't seen the movie yet it's
actually a good idea to read the post
first so that you'll understand some of
the science things that are coming out
there what I'm gonna try to do now with
the rest of our time is go really fast
through a little bit more of what
relativity actually is and what it means
I'm gonna go really fast cuz I usually
do this talk in an hour but I'm gonna do
it in 30 minutes for you today so we're
gonna blast our way through one of the
key ideas that comes out of relativity
and one of the most famous parts of
relativity are these things called black
holes everybody's heard of black holes
and so I like to start talking about
relativity with a multiple choice
question imagine that the Sun magically
collapsed into a black hole retaining
the same mass what would happen to earth
so you can see your options on the
screen I won't read them off you don't
have to commit to an option but you
probably are aware that if you ask the
average person this question including
the average kindergartner they will all
tell you confidently that earth would be
sucked in to the black hole now I want
to analyze that and see if that is or is
not the correct answer
and the way we can do it is by thinking
about gravity now I told you that
Einstein's theory of relativity is a
theory of gravity general relativity is
a theory of gravity but it wasn't our
first theory of gravity we had a theory
of gravity before that that came from
Newton so you might be thinking why did
I sign create a new theory of gravity
well the reason is because Newton's
theory of gravity it works really really
well it works it explains why things
fall to the ground that explains why the
planets orbit the
son we can use Newton's theory of
gravity and nothing else to send a
spaceship off and land on other planets
that's pretty amazing it works great but
it turns out there's a few places
particularly when the gravity is really
really strong where it sort of starts to
break down and so we needed a broader
theory that would put all that together
and include those other areas but out
here where the Earth orbits the Sun
we're pretty far from the Sun gravity's
not particularly strong there's nothing
wrong with Newton's theory of gravity so
we don't even need relativity to answer
this question we can just use Newton's
theory of gravity and Newton's theory of
gravity tells us how objects orbit under
the influence of gravity generally when
you think of orbit you think of ellipses
like this that go round and round and
round technically an orbit is anything
governed by gravity and it's also
possible to have orbits where things
come in from afar go back out and don't
return again and those can be in the
shapes of parabolas and hyperbolas so
this is what Newton's theory of gravity
tells us about orbits you will notice
that sucking is not on the list of
orbits which brings us to an important
key point about black holes they don't
suck back they're really kind of amazing
if you read the book which I know a lot
of you have now in the first chapter I
take you on an imaginary voyage to a
black hole where you see the effects of
relativity as they would happen to you
on your journey and when you get there
and what you observe and so on today I
just want to focus on what is relativity
so I won't have time to answer that
question or to go into all of that but I
do very briefly want to mention the
movie interstellar again again not a
spoiler here in the movie interstellar
they actually did a nice job of this
they go to this supermassive black hole
in another galaxy and what do they find
there they find planets that are
orbiting the black hole they're not
getting sucked in they've done it
correctly same thing with the spaceship
they're in their spaceship they orbit
around they don't get sucked in and the
only place in the movie where they make
a minor error is when the Matthew
McConaughey character I forget what he's
called in the movie
when he goes diving into the black hole
one of the other people says something
about he got sucked in that's not really
true and the way you can understand why
it's not true
that he got sucked in is if you imagine
that you're in a kayak and you're
paddling down a river and there happens
to be a waterfall ahead of you and you
see it and then you paddle harder and go
for it and go over don't blame it on the
pool at the bottom it didn't suck you
down it was your own fault
for paddling to the waterfall right same
thing here if you get in a spaceship and
you dive into the black hole you're
going in not because you got sucked in
you chose it so what is relativity we've
got a little bit of an intro there that
it's gonna tell us a something about
black holes
besides the part that we already have
learned that they don't suck relativity
actually has two parts we usually say
the theory of relativity but it was
actually published in two parts by
Einstein the first was in 1905 his
special theory of relativity 1915 our
hundredth anniversary year general
relativity why why did he published a
theory in two parts there's a there's a
couple of reasons but one reason is that
this first part special and by special
we mean the special case in which we
ignore gravity was easier than to
include gravity mathematically it's much
much easier but more importantly he was
actually trying to solve some
fundamental questions in physics that
had already come up with the laws of
electricity and magnetism his paper on
rail at special relativity was actually
called on the electrodynamics of moving
bodies so he was solving these known
problems in physics when he went on to
general relativity he was doing
something a little bit different and
historically it's kind of interesting
because historians of science generally
will tell you that if Einstein had not
published special relativity when he did
in June of 1905 it's very likely that
someone else probably punk Ra would have
published basically the same thing the
same year people were so close to it
because it was an idea whose time had
come they needed it to understand these
existing problems and physics general
relativity Einstein really went out
ahead of everybody a lot of historians
will tell you that if he had not
published general relativity in ninth
fifteen it might have been decades
before anyone else came to the same
ideas what was different in the way
Einstein thought about it the difference
was even though he was solving these
known problems in physics he was
thinking about it in a little bit
different way going back to when he was
a teenager he said that when he was 15
16 years old he used to try to imagine
what would it be like to ride on a beam
of light and when he started to think
about that hard he started to come
across all these paradoxes things that
weren't quite making sense and so he was
trying to make sense of them and special
relativity did make sense of most of
them but not quite all of them and
therefore even though the other
physicists were like hey you solved all
the problems in physics he needed to
keep going to resolve the rest of the
paradoxes the words theory of relativity
have two unfamiliar words in them for
most people theory and relativity so I
want to explain those briefly theory in
everyday life a lot of people think it
means kind of a guess but in science it
means something that's been very well
established and tested and in fact I
would tell you that a scientific theory
has been so well tested that really it
can't be wrong
it could be incomplete not the whole
story but you take Newton's theory of
gravity for example it works really well
we can land spaceships on other planets
with it it's not wrong it's just not the
whole story
Einstein's theory broadens that story
and it's very likely that in the future
we'll have another theory of gravity
that broadens it further than what I'm
Stan's does today but Einstein's theory
will still be right in the sense that it
works really really well the second part
of the term theory of relativity is the
word relativity a lot of people have
this misconception that Einstein said
everything is relative he did not say
that the word relativity is talking very
specifically about relativity of motion
from relativity of motion we will derive
as we'll see some consequences to
relativity of time and space but motion
is the key what do we mean by the idea
that motion is relative what we mean is
that you can
you can see things moving and say how
they're moving but you'll get different
answers depending on how you're looking
at it so I'll give you a simple example
imagine that you get into an airplane in
Nairobi Kenya and you take off and you
fly at a speed of 1670 km/h because I
like that speed and you fly and you land
in Quito Ecuador how fast did you go
well you're thinking you just told us
you're going 1670 kilometers per hour
yes you are but what if you're watching
from let's say the moon like it would
kind of look to you in this picture from
the moon you'd be looking at the earth
and you remember the Earth rotates and
the earth actually I picked this on
purpose right the Earth rotates in the
opposite direction that you're flying
and it rotates at exactly the same speed
that you're flying therefore what would
you see as you watch this plane trip
from the moon you would see the airplane
lift off the ground in Nairobi and just
sit there while earth rotated underneath
it and when Quito arrived
you'd set down so according to you from
the moon the airplane goes a speed of
zero it goes nowhere the Earth rotates
underneath it which answer is correct
did you go 1600 and 70 km/h or and you
go zero both are equally correct as long
as you specify what you're measuring it
relative to if you don't say what you're
measuring relative to then it's not
going to have any meaning so it's
relativity of motion that gives the
theory its name in fact the real heart
of the theory comes not from the
relativity of motion but from two things
that Einstein said in that 1905 paper
are actually absolute in nature in a lot
of ways there'd be a lot less public
confusion if the theory had been called
the theory of the two absolutes rather
than the theory of relativity what are
those two absolutes the first one is
that the laws of nature are the same for
everyone you will measure the same laws
of nature discover the same laws of
nature here in Seattle as we will where
I live in Boulder Colorado or someone on
another planet around another star the
laws of nature the same for
for everyone in fact this was not new at
the time Einstein asserted this it was
generally assumed since the time of
Galileo and part of the reason he had to
assert it is going back to you remember
I told you that it had to do with
electricity and magnetism those laws
seemed like when you played with the
equations they've changed and were
different depending on how people were
moving and part of what Einstein did
with special relativity was restore
Galileo's idea that yes indeed no matter
how you're moving the laws of nature are
the same but other than that little
caveat this is not a surprise and most
people accept it pretty easily it's the
second absolute that's surprising the
second absolute tells us that the speed
of light is the same for everyone why is
this surprising imagine that I'm in an
airplane right now and I'm flying by you
at 500 miles per hour and I have a ball
on my hand and I toss the ball to a
friend a few rows up at a speed of 10
miles per hour what will you say from
the ground the ball was doing well
before I even throw it you say the ball
is going 500 miles per hour I throw it
at 10 now it's going 510 miles per hour
as you see it makes perfect sense but
what if instead I have a flashlight in
my hand I turn on the light I would
measure the beam of light going out in
front of me at the speed of light
300,000 kilometers per second you would
expect that on the ground you would say
the speed of light plus the 500 miles
per hour for the airplane but Einstein
said no you will still see the exact
same speed of light why would he say
something like that well for him it goes
back to that vision of riding on a light
beam he recognized and I don't have time
to go through it but in the book I'll
lead you through the thought experiments
that show you why actually the world
doesn't make any sense unless this is
the case that the speed of light is the
same for every one but more importantly
in science you know we like things to
make sense but they don't always
it's what's more important is
experimental evidence and experimental
evidence demonstrates that the speed of
light really is the same for everyone it
is not affected by motion the first
demonstration of that was actually done
a couple decades before Einstein
publishes theory the Michelson Morley
experiment they just didn't quite
realize the implications of
they were seeing Einstein realized it
but it's been measured since many many
other times and in fact if you just
think about telescopes even though we
don't do this routinely we have light
entering our telescopes from stars and
galaxies they're all moving relative to
us some of them distant galaxies are
moving away from us at very high speeds
close to the speed of light and yet if
you take the light entering any
telescope and measure its speed as it
comes in no matter what galaxy your star
it's coming from you always find the
same exact speed of light it is an
experimentally measured fact and it is
from this surprising fact that you can
derive all the basic consequences of
special relativity just with some simple
thought experiments I don't have time to
go through all of them but I want to do
one for you and I'll pick the one that
is everyone's least favorite consequence
of relativity probably seeing shirts
like this right 300,000 kilometers per
second not just a good idea it's the law
you cannot go faster than this why is
this everyone's least favorite
consequence of relativity because we're
human we don't like being told what we
can and cannot do so we want to go
faster than the speed of light so I'm
going to let you for the moment imagine
that there is no limit on speed you can
do anything you want as long as you know
you're consistent with Einstein's two
absolutes so I'm gonna imagine I'm in
this spaceship and I have a spaceship
that can go as fast as any one can
imagine possible you might think that
would be any speed but imagination might
have limits let's see so I get into my
spaceship and I go really really fast
you know very close to the speed of
light and then I put in a second year
and I go even faster and third here and
boom I'm going so fast you can barely
imagine it right I better not be on the
earth because if I'm going anywhere near
the speed of light
I'd crash into something really fast so
I have to be out in space in space it's
dark I don't want to crash into anything
I'd better be able to see where I'm
going so I better have headlights on my
spaceship if you don't like the
headlights you can just go with the
infrared radiation that my body emits
anyway but what
use the headlights so I've got
headlights so that I can see where I'm
going I look at my headlight beams
they're going out ahead of me how fast
speed light 300,000 kilometers per
second great you're watching me from the
ground what do you see you see me going
as fast as you can imagine possible with
my headlights shining out in front of me
how fast are my headlights going
according to you same speed light and
what are my headlights doing going out
in front of me they're beating me
therefore I'm going less than the speed
of light you cannot get around this
logic I know some of you are trying you
can't do it you cannot if the speed of
light really is the same for everyone
there is not a logical possibility of
getting up and going to a faster speed
than that or even reaching it because we
always have to see the same speed of
light no matter how we're moving so this
is so clear for people who've looked at
it and have tried to go through all the
logic arguments that you will notice not
even science fiction writers try to
break this rule you won't find science
fiction writers or movies where they try
to go faster than the speed of light
through space what they do is they look
for loopholes they try to bend the
universe with warp drive or go into
hyperspace where they leave the universe
and pop back in or go through wormholes
those don't involve travel through space
at a high speed because you can't do it
as I mentioned you can do the same kind
of thought experiments to derive all the
other famous consequences of relativity
I don't have time to go through them but
I'll just give you a couple examples if
you were taking a trip from Earth to a
star that's 25 light-years away imagine
that you could do that trip at 99
percent of the speed of light the entire
way no of course this would be very bad
to do because if you accelerate from 0
to 90 99 percent of the speed of light
you know real quickly and leave an earth
you'd be smooshed at the same thing when
you turn around you'll be double
smooshed right so not a good idea to
actually do this but if you could what
would happen well from the point of view
of people on earth your
taking a 50 light year round trip and
you're going almost as fast as light
does therefore it'll take you a little
bit longer than life does light does
about 50 and a half years for the trip
so if you leave this year 2015 you'd be
back in 2065 you get into your spaceship
instantly up to 99 percent of the speed
of light what will you see oh you
thought it was supposed to be a 25
Lightyear trip but now what you measure
it again it's actually only three and a
half light-years to the star therefore
since you're going almost the speed of
light only takes you about three and a
half years to get there three and a half
years home and you're back in seven
years if you have seven years worth of
meals seven years worth of supplies
you'll be totally fine you'll have seven
years worth of heartbeats if you're
thirty years old right now you'll come
back aged 37 but it will be the year
2065 that is not an illusion that is
real how do we know well well first of
all sorry I sort of mentioned this first
spit what we're seeing is that space and
time can be measured differently by
different observers depending on how
you're moving this is what's relative
about space and time however they're
entwined together as this
four-dimensional thing that we call
space time and space time the
four-dimensional space-time is the same
for everyone it's just the different
observers see different parts of the
space and time depending on how they're
moving and that's how we get results
like this what makes us think this is
true well in science it comes down to
experiments we cannot travel at speeds
close to the speed of light but we can
make particles do it subatomic particles
and colliders like the Large Hadron
Collider and one thing you'll notice
about these if you know anything about
colliders like a Large Hadron Collider
this year it's coming online with a lot
more energy than it had a couple years
ago and that has a lot more energy than
what previous colliders had and so on
and each time we dump way more energy in
how much faster the particles go well
they were already going decades ago
99.99% the speed of light now we get a
few extra nines
on there we never get all the way to the
speed of light
why not because it can't be
you just get closer and closer sometimes
some particles will fall apart decaying
characteristic lifetimes when you make
them at very high speeds they last
longer than they do at low speeds okay
showing that and we have lots of more
evidence equals mc-squared
is part of the theory of relativity and
we know that's true cuz it explains why
the Sun shines nuclear power and so on
and I mentioned that relativity is
involved with electronics so really
every time you turn on your radio or
your cell phone you're testing special
relativity it works and the only hard
part about understanding any of this is
that when you first encounter it it
seems like how can that be that
different people will measure space and
time differently the complaint that most
people have about it is that it violates
your common sense but it doesn't it
doesn't violate your common sense and
the reason it doesn't violate your
common sense is because when it comes to
these ideas you sorry to say have no
common sense why do I say that because
common sense by definition means things
that you commonly experience and you do
not commonly travel at speeds close to
the speed of light where these effects
are noticeable the fastest spaceship
we've ever built the New Horizons
spacecraft on its way to Pluto that'll
go back past in July 50,000 kilometers
per hour that's really really fast but
it's only 120 thousandth of the speed of
light we don't have any common
experience the problem is you're trying
to take your common experience from low
speeds and assume it should work for
high speeds too but it doesn't you just
have to get used to that and you will
get used to it if you try and you think
about these ideas long enough a lot of
people think that's going to be hard so
I like to point out that as hard as it
might be you've done it before
successfully so there's no reason you
can't do it now how have you done it
before
so here's audience participation
everybody point up everybody point down
that's common sense right it's good
common sense it explains why you
shouldn't jump off the roof of the
building and it allows you to play
basketball but one time you probably
don't remember too well but if you think
back and we're first or second grade
probably this common sense created a
crisis and the crisis was that the
teacher showed you a globe you applied
your common sense to it and you
my gosh those poor people are gonna fall
off so what was wrong the problem was
you were taking your common sense that
work came from your common experiences
in small rooms and assuming it should
apply to the whole world but it doesn't
you developed a different common sense
for the whole world and in the same way
you've got common sense that's perfectly
fine for low speeds but for high speeds
you're gonna need to develop a different
one and that is all I will say about
special relativity because I want to go
quickly to general because I'm taking
longer than I expected and I want to get
to the end part so I'm gonna have to go
really fast
Einstein why did he keep going to
general relativity number of reasons but
one was you can ask this question this
Newton's theory of gravity make any
sense you've got for example the Sun
here the earth here
orbiting each other because of gravity
but there 150 million kilometres apart
they have no eyes ears noses how do the
Earth and Sun even know each other are
there in fact you might say something
like this that one body may act upon
another in a distance through a vacuum
and force may be conveyed from one to
another is to me so great an absurdity
that I believe no man who has a
competent faculty in thinking can ever
fall into it so here we have the speaker
saying that Newton's theory is
completely absurd and you might be
saying well Einstein that's great that
you came up with this new theory but did
you have to be so rude about it but it
wasn't Einstein who said that it was
Newton himself who said that about his
own theory why well let's take a little
example of how you mean we already
planed ye let's take an example to see
how Einstein solves this problem imagine
you live a long time ago you think the
earth is flat you hire two explorers you
say let's do some exploring you go that
way you go that way don't come back
until you find something really amazing
some time later they both come back what
do they tell you they discovered they
ran into each other if you really think
the earth is flat you would be shocked
right they went off in opposite
directions are we shocked no we're not
shocked
why not because we understand the earth
is not flat it's curved you're gonna
meet on the other side imagine that
you're floating out in space somewhere
and you send off two probes and opposite
directions one that way one that way
suppose that some time later they run
into each other will you be surprised
you shouldn't be we don't do this
regularly but we could imagine that
you're floating in the International
Space Station you send one probe that
way one probe that way what are they
gonna do they're gonna orbit around the
Earth and meet on the other side okay
why because of the magical force of
gravity in essence Einstein looks at
this he says wait a minute
a moment ago you showed me a picture and
you said the reason that they met was
because earth is curved now you're
telling me it's because this magical
force that makes no sense is involved
why don't you just say they meet because
space is curved and that is what
Einstein said gravity arises from
curvature of space-time
we cannot picture the four-dimensional
curvature of for the curvature of
four-dimensional space-time because we
live in only three dimensions we can't
picture it we can use two-dimensional
analogies like this and here you see if
Earth is curving space-time changing its
shape you send one probe that way one
the other way of course they're gonna
meet on the other side not because of
any magical force just because that's
the actual shape of space-time again
general relativity has been very well
tested here we see examples of how light
is bent by gravity because gravity
curves space-time grat time runs slower
in gravitational fields these things
called gravitational waves are emitted
when objects change like collapse into a
black hole or two objects orbiting very
fast around in one another and you can
curve space-time so much that you can in
fact do the equivalent of poking a hole
in space-time and that is what we call a
black hole and I would love to tell you
way more about all of these things but
you'll have to ask the questions
afterwards because now I want to very
briefly tell you the four reasons why I
think this is important for everyone to
know first the science reason if this
since this is our modern theory of space
time and gravity if you want to
understand modern science you're going
to need to know something about it it's
practical it explains nuclear power of
the sunshine it also is used in your GPS
and navigation systems those Corrections
because time runs different for those
satellites than here on the ground must
be taken to her account into account or
you would actually be lost second reason
well
all of us want to believe that we have a
perception of reality that's at least in
some sense accurate if your ideas about
the universe are based on a belief that
earth is the center of the universe well
these days that's probably not a very
good way to be going about thinking
about your place in the universe because
we know it's not the center of the
universe in the same way if you're
thinking that space and time are
absolute the way most people think about
it then you do not have an accurate
perception of the reality that we live
and I think most people would want to
have that third reason human potential
relativity is really an amazing idea
when you think about it particularly the
fact that Einstein came at it almost
from a pure thought perspective before
the experimental evidence showed that it
was really correct it shows what we are
capable of as human beings when we put
our minds to the positive instead of to
the negative and I think that's a good
thing for everyone to realize and the
fourth and last idea one's a little bit
more subtle but remember I told you even
though space and time can be different
for different observers depending on how
you're moving the space-time reality is
the same for everyone if you could
imagine hypothetically some kind of
being four-dimensional being that could
move through space-time the way we can
move through just plain space then you
could in a sense go to different points
in time in the movie interstellar at the
end that's what he's doing in that book
case like thing moving around through
time as well as space if any of you have
read Kurt Vonnegut's novel
slaughterhouse-five he talks about his
four dimensional beings who can do this
you all look like very nice people but
maybe when you were young you had a
little bit of a mean streak going you
know save maybe in first grade you whack
the kids sitting next to you one day
terrible terrible thing but the good
news is even though the kids scream
t-shirt said what's going on you said I
have no idea and you got away with it a
four dimensional being could in
principle at any moment whatever moment
means two four dimensional beings I
don't know but they could go to that
point in space-time right there oh there
you are whacking the kid
you didn't get away with it you just got
caught because it's permanent it's part
of your permanent record every action
you've ever taken is there permanently
in space-time so I will close out with
the last few sentences from my epilogue
your life is a series of events and this
means that when you put them all
together you are creating your own
indelible mark on the universe perhaps
if everyone understood that we might all
be a little more careful to make sure
that the mark we leave is one that we
are proud of
so maybe I'm being a little naive but I
actually think that if everyone learned
about relativity we'd treat each other a
little bit better and so with that we'll
be just about ready for the questions
but because I like this other project so
much even though it has very little to
do with relativity I'm gonna tell you
about it so a few years ago I got a
phone call and they told me about this
idea they had imagined astronauts
reading stories from space the children
and families around the world and a
program that combines literature and
science education so what's actually an
astronaut on the phone and he said they
had this idea they wanted to read some
books from space why you calling me they
found my books that you see in the back
of the room and decided those were the
ones they wanted to read so last January
a little over a year ago my five
children's books were launched to the
space station I have a clip for you the
astronaut Mike Hopkins on board the
International Space Station and it's one
of my favorite times it's story time
from space now today's story is max goes
to the moon a science adventure with max
the dog so the videos eventually
curriculum materials and our things are
all being posted at WWE time from space
comm if you don't mind a quick plug here
the reason that the curriculum materials
are coming eventually and some of the
videos aren't up there yet because the
program actually has no funding and they
are running an IndieGoGo campaign right
now so if you go to story time from
space comm you'll find the indiegogo
link and I'm sure they would very much
appreciate anything that anyone does
they have some cool perks too so you'll
like that those are the five kids books
that I have we have some Spanish
editions this one's coming out in
Spanish this summer these are my college
textbooks
and there's the book we talked about
today I also have a book about teaching
science how to teach science math and
how to teach math and this one is about
the search for extraterrestrial life
thank you and I only went over by two
minutes all right I'm ready for
questions Thanks yes so I've always said
to teach kids complex things before they
realize it's supposed to be hard right
my nephews my kids so I love the first
page of your chapter for you said in
teaching it to kids you realize that
it's not the relativities hard is that
it's almost as adults because it goes
against what we were taught as kids we
think it's hard so we don't want to
share it with kids but if you go
straight to the source all of a sudden
it makes sense for them right so can you
expound a little bit more as an educator
is this just on science do you also
think computer science perhaps getting
more gender into into stem or into you
know these other things I'm gonna I love
that point how I'm getting that reaction
that's part of your tour yeah
absolutely I do think it applies to
everything and there's there's a couple
different things going on there with
relativity one of the things that you
run up against with adults that you
don't have as much with kids is that
we've solidified this on what we think
is our common sense understanding you
know kids that that Earth example that I
gave you of up and down they just that
just happened to them recently so hey
another thing that's not the way you I
thought it was no big deal but by the
time you get to be an adult it seems
like a bigger deal so kids actually do
absorb these ideas I think I think
something a lot better because they
don't have as many misconceptions to to
come over but more generally I do
believe people are capable of more than
we usually think we need to set high
expectations and help people meet those
high expectations without getting too
far off topic I mentioned my book on
teaching science I did a talk on that
yesterday and what I always tell people
and the fundamental thing in that book
is that there really is one key to all
learning and the key to all learning is
that it requires study and effort
that's so obvious that we forget to say
it but there's a consequence to
forgetting to say it which is that it
gets left out of the discussions so you
have for example now Common Core next
generation science standards which
personally I think are really good they
set a higher bar I think they set a
realistically higher bar but if you're
going to set a higher bar you need more
time for studying and effort and nowhere
do you see anyone discussing how they're
going to provide teachers and kids with
the resources to do the additional study
and effort needed to meet that higher
bar and as a result you get pushback
from parents from teachers and everyone
so I think we do need to keep that in
mind we can expect a lot from kids but
we have to provide them the resources to
meet those expectations yeah so one
question I think relations where I would
assume that there is until the end come
on like envision being or human being
for some kind of speci who cannot see so
the maximum speed they can actually
object with through listening so sounded
or like the maximum the fastest ship now
would they have a theory of relativity
where sound interruption limit how would
they like the world differently um it's
so the question is whether whether sound
you know if you didn't see if you had
species that had no visual sense would
sound perhaps me in a similar thing the
answer is no and the reason is because
light is different sound is a wave that
moves through material right you have to
have atoms and stuff in motion light is
not light travels through empty space
through a vacuum that is actually what
threw off the Michelson Morley Michelson
and Morley when they did their
experiment they assumed there had to be
this ether thing out there for light to
travel through but there's not and
that's why they didn't get the correct
interpretation of their results but so
light if you could get more technical
about it the reason light travels at the
speed of light is because it has no mass
it's a massless particle so other
massless particles for example
gravitational waves I mentioned
in principle by these particles called
gravitons they also travel at the speed
of light because they have no mass but
anything that has mass cannot ever reach
the speed of light typically when you
read the explanations
the classic thought experiment is is the
you know two observers passing each
other and one of them sees the length
dilation the measuring sticks like
example so my question is do they both
perceive the others measuring stick as
being shorter or does one perceive it as
longer yes through this shorter a ladder
or the four so as I go through in the
book I have this experiment you know you
you have one spaceship racing by or
you're floating weightlessly they're
floating weightlessly and you look with
your super telescope and you watch them
and you see their time is running slow
and your measurement is different right
and so you send them a radio message hey
why is your time running slow over there
they are in their spaceship they got
their super telescope they're looking at
you they say it's your time running slow
they see your time ring so so they radio
back and they say no it's it's not us
running slow it's you running slow but
wait a minute
when you play the radio message back
what are you hear you hear them going no
it's not right they clearly are running
slow and yet they're claiming that
they're not so you got a better idea you
could take a video of them and you take
the video that shows that their time is
running slow compared to your time you
put it in a really fast rocket so it can
catch up to them even though they're
going close to the speed of light and
you figure when the rocket gets there
they'll pull out the video they'll look
at it and they'll see ah yes it is our
time running slow great plan just after
you send it off guess what happens
a rocket reaches you coming from them
you pop open it up there's a video in it
and what does it show
so is you're the one with the time
running slow from their point of view
why does this bother you
because it seems different right where
you want to say common sense but but
it's not and you know it's the same
thing okay you right now look outside
the sun's out
so you get on the phone and you call a
friend the sun's out it's great and they
say no it's not it's nighttime are you
surprised
not if they live in Australia we
understand it can be different from
different viewpoints there's not a
disagreement we're just looking at the
same thing in different ways and that's
exactly what's happening with relativity
if you got together then your clocks
would agree but of course then you're
not travelling relative to each other
anymore but it's just curious to me that
it is I see an asymmetry in that there's
a dilation but there doesn't seem to be
a lengthening like it's a lot but so so
it's the space that's getting shrunk and
the time that is expanding so it's
remember in four dimensions space-time
all four dimensions are equivalent time
is not the fourth dimension it's one of
the four dimensions and therefore it's
your motion that determines how much of
the space part and how much of the time
part you see so that's why space-time is
the same for everyone so I'm gonna go
back to Nairobi Kino thing huh so it
seems to me if you are travelling in
same direction then I would think you
would see that you're just hovering that
you would see this motionless but in the
example you gave where the earth is
train the opposite direction
why does it appear that you're going
twice as fast think about it again
you've got the opposite way around if
you were going the same direction with
Earth's rotation then you can go in
twice as fast but because you're going
the opposite direction relative to what
you're covering your you are going twice
as fast but you're covering the same
spot if you're traveling into the
equivalent speed aren't you so so you're
not making progress yet here's here's
Nairobi here's Quito okay so if you're
going this way okay so you go like that
okay but from point of view of the moon
lifts off right and now it lands so I
didn't have to move at all
if I was going the same direction that
we were rotating so if I'm going this
way then you'd see it you know until it
catches up it's going twice as fast
it's fun to think about those things
when you're on in international airplane
flights because they'll explain why
you're getting day and night when you do
you said you you think there'll be
another theory of gravity after
Einsteins do you see any hints of that
and what circumstances would make it
happen
so the key the key behind this there's a
couple different ways of looking at it
one is that we have general relativity
which explains large-scale universe
really really well strong gravitational
fields we also have quantum mechanics
that explains that subatomic very very
well there's one known place where the
two do not meet well and that is the
singularity of a black hole because the
singularity of a black hole is very very
tiny so quantum mechanics should apply
but it's also infinitely strong gravity
so general relativity should apply and
the two basically give you different
answers about what should be going on
there now of course we can't actually
test that because we can't see it right
now but the fact that our two very
successful Erie's give us different
answers for the same thing tells us we
must be still missing something okay
another part of it is that gravity has
some kind of different properties from
the other three forces strong weak and
electromagnetic that people are trying
to unify together so if you saw Stephen
Hawking's the movie about Stephen
Hawking theory of everything the theory
of everything is the theory that would
in principle pull all these things
together as the movie showed people like
Hawking many others have been working on
this but so far without any clear
success this is no one Einstein was
working out on his deathbed he was
trying to you know people have been
working on this one for a long time so
somebody asked me last night whether I
thought it would be answered by the end
of the century and the only thing I
could say was I have no idea
hope so but what are your expectations
for the Large Hadron Collider running at
higher energy is there anything that
you're looking forward to being able to
discover it's the Large Hadron Collider
going to higher energies is not going to
tell us anything new about relativity
we've already tested all these
predictions of relativity to 15 decimal
places
so going well faster is not gonna change
that it's more in the subatomic physics
realm that it's changing things so the
Higgs boson was discovered back in 2012
and the higher energy should give us
more information and answer some of the
questions about that it's not an area
that I know much about but I do highly
recommend a movie I watched recently
called particle fever which traces the
discovery of the Higgs boson really well
done well it's slightly related so a
question I want to ask you is from a
friend actually
so you said mass bends space-time
resulting in gravity but mass comes from
the higgs field so does the Higgs field
is the Higgs field the reason for
gravity that is an excellent question
that not only can I not answer but I
don't think anyone can answer because I
think that would bring us into that
place where quantum mechanics and
relativity have not been brought
together yet so tell him to keep working
he's got a Nobel Prize in his future and
earned ages by 50 years in the spaceship
doesn't so if you imagine you're a
little alien living on the surface of
the spaceship in between the surface and
their force fields we'll say because of
course the force field oh and what you
see you look out your window and you're
standing on ground and you see the earth
flying and the other direction you see
you start funk about you and you get it
so so this is the famous twin paradox
okay so the idea behind the twin paradox
is so you get out into your spaceship go
off 99% the speed of light to that star
come back and it's your time that was
slower cuz you took the trip but why
can't you say no I didn't go anywhere
earthen the star flew off and the star
came to me and then they flew back so
was then moving at 99% the speed of
light that that it's called the twin
paradox and it troubles a lot of people
but it really shouldn't there's not
anything really paradoxical about it
once you understand it special
relativity
what tells us that time is different for
movers in equivalent reference frames if
you're both but general relativity comes
into play when you're not in a free
floating weightless reference frame so
whenever you're accelerating and this is
what's called the principle of
equivalence it's really the heart of
general relativity grab Einstein said
that gravity and acceleration are
actually the same thing so basically how
do you know if you're being affected by
gravity or acceleration because you'll
feel a force I'm being affected by
gravity that's why I'm standing on the
floor but if this room was accelerating
through space with the same 1g of
acceleration then I'd feel exactly the
same acceleration and gravity you can
you know you're experiencing them when
you feel a force instead of floating
weightlessly and so the difference is
when you travel off to that space that
distance star and back you're the one
who feels that force squishing you when
you accelerate up to 99% the speed of
light you're the one who turns around
and feels the double force as you go
around so the the resolution is yes you
are allowed to say I didn't go anywhere
it was earth in the star coming back to
me but in the earth point of view you
feel this big acceleration and your
point of view you feel this strong force
of gravity and either way general
relativity tells us that time runs slow
and strong or gravity either way
it's you who make the trip that comes
back younger and you expand us a little
bit more but gravity waves and the
difference between gravity and gravity
waves yes
so gravitational waves are the
gravitational equivalent of
electromagnetic waves photons and the
idea is that you know you get photons
emitted when charges accelerate so when
there's a change in the distribution of
charge and it's the same thing for mass
you just from sitting there there's no
gravitational waves but if an object say
collapses into a black hole or you have
two objects if you think about that
two-dimensional analogy like imagine two
neutron stars orbiting around each other
in a rubber sheet they're gonna be
making that she
you know have waves go out through it
and they're gonna propagate outward so
it's kind of the idea of if those two
objects are moving around or if it's the
star collapses into a black hole how
does the rest of the universe know what
happens it knows because that
information moves out through space-time
in the form of gravitational waves so
that's what we're looking for the reason
that they're so difficult to detect is
because gravity is so weak compared to
the electromagnetic force 10 to the
forty-third times weaker and so we've
never detected gravitational waves
directly we know indirectly we've
measured the effects of the energy loss
from them being emitted but directly
they've never been detected but this
year advanced LIGO laser interferometric
gravitational observatories coming
online one branch I believe is here in
Washington and the other in Louisiana
hopefully within the next couple years
that will make the first direct
detection of gravitational waves which
is there's a lot of distrust of science
how can we as science enthusiasts help
improve the situation of the general
population
ah very good question so what I would
say is that we need to explain what
science is and what its purposes are and
the purposes that I like to focus on for
science is they give us a way of
distinguishing possibilities from
realities you know here this is a nice
possibility another nice possibility is
that space and time are always the same
for everybody
which one's real science by looking at
it the evidence measuring we can figure
out which possibility might be real and
which ones not secondly before Einstein
this idea nobody would have taken this
seriously and yet it was accepted very
very rapidly after why because the
measurement evidence the evidence was so
overwhelmingly
overwhelming that unless you just
wouldn't look at it it was pretty clear
that what Einstein had done was correct
so science gives us the tools for coming
to agreement on things which we might
not have been able to agree on before so
science is often thought of as the
source of discord in society like the
questioner asked but in fact it's a way
of bringing us into a green
and I think once people understand those
basic ideas they'll see that science is
not a threat to anyone it's something
that we can all look at together in a
rational objective way and once the
evidence becomes strong enough we'll all
if we look at it honestly see the same
conclusions I steal a vehicle pre-done
or twin paradox is actually very first
to go to speed of playing and then you
cannot accelerate so that party will not
experience any force so there is no kind
of contract be done anything right so
does it mean that you will be affected
by the time dilation for the initial
part and not in the uniform sweet spot
yeah actually when you when you analyze
it carefully it's that initial part but
even more importantly the turnaround
part so it works out very nicely because
the mathematics of general relativity is
very complex luckily it works out that
whatever your average speed is for the
trip you can just use the simple time
dilation formula from special relativity
which is just you know a square root
it's really easy to calculate to get
what the time effect would be thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
