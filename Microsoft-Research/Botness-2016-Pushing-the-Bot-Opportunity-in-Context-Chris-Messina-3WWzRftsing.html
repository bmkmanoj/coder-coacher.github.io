talk and you guys probably already know
all this stuff so the idea was that I
could do something very easy that's
achievable for me at my level of
cognition to basically put all this into
context so to do that I'm going to start
in 1994 which was a very good year for
both rock music and revolutions
particularly this product was launched
then which is netscape navigator how
many of you guys ever used this product
okay how many of you guys used internet
explorer less less okay I like this
audience no offense Microsoft but so the
amazingly about Netscape and the web of
course at that time was that it gave
millions and now fourth billions of
people the ability to access share and
publish information in a way that had
basically been unprecedented up into
that point I've been very slow very
costly and so on and this revolution of
course started in the 60s but I'm sort
of fast-forwarding 30 years or whatever
to get to this and actually I have some
audio let me see if it's gonna work I'm
gonna hope for the best I don't know how
this going to work with a mic but we'll
see so in 1994 this is actually a clip
of Steve Jobs talking about actually 95
talking about something that turned out
to be pretty pression let's see if this
works oh hold on wait
restaurant
well you know I think the internet and
the web there are two exciting things
happening the software in any computing
today I think one is obvious but the
other one is the web the web is
incredibly exciting because it is the
fulfillment of a lot of our dreams that
the computer would ultimately not be
primarily a device for computation but
metamorphosize into a device for
communication and the with the web
that's finally happening and secondly
it's exciting as Microsoft doesn't own
it and therefore there's a tremendous
amount of innovation so I think that the
web is going to be profound what it does
to our society as you know about fifteen
percent of the goods and services in the
US or sold via catalogue to open
television all that's going to go on the
web and more billions and billions soon
tens of billions of dollars worth of
goods and services are going to be sold
and wet if you any way to think about it
is it is the ultimate direct the
customer distribution channel another
way to think about it is the smallest
company in the world can look as large
as the largest company in the world on
the web so i guess i think the web is we
look back 10 years from now the web is
going to be the defining technology the
defining social defining social moment
for computing and i think it's going to
be huge i think it's breathed a whole
new generation of life in the personal
computing and he's a huge so what's kind
of amazing about this quotes so weird um
you know this is 1995 and he's like 10
years from now we're gonna think the web
is amazing that was in 2005 now here we
are 10 years later and the thing that's
kind of amazing is that what I think he
was actually getting out and talking
about we are now actually on the verge
of doing so it sucks to be early
sometimes but eventually these things
play out so if you think about what
defined a personal computer back in what
is this 2004 is shown on a 29 99 1998
this was sort of what they thought of
moving away from mainframes into this
style of
sheen but the thing is this design was
influenced and controlled by a very
corporatist kind of agenda in other
words if you had a top-down hierarchical
hierarchical model of your business and
this is how you actually gave your
workers the ability to do more work that
was controlled sort of centrally
eventually we decentralized to a smaller
personal computer but of course it only
did a few things and without sufficient
network capabilities with without
sufficient battery life without the
ability to have software to extend it it
was not so great and so this was sort of
extending you know the power of the
workforce out into the world but it
really wasn't about personal empowerment
yet and so things started to change in
2007 and so this happened to be a very
important very good year for technology
and i'm going to play another clip this
is not all about steve jobs but i think
it's relevant to show where we've come
from and where to basically give some
insight into where we're going so this
is actually the announcement of the
iphone so here it is it's a little bit
long but but watch there's a bunch of
really great stuff in here what we want
to do is make a leapfrog product that is
way smarter than any mobile device has
ever been and super easy use this is
what I focus okay why do we need a
revolutionary user interface I mean
here's for smartphones right motorola q
the blackberry palm treo nokia e62 the
usual suspects and what's wrong with
their user interface as well the problem
with them is really sort of in the
bottom forty there it's it's this stuff
right here they all have these keyboards
that are there whether you need them or
not to be there and they all have these
control buttons that are fixed in
plastic and are the same for every
application well every application wants
a slightly different user interface a
slightly optimized set of buttons just
for it well how do you solve this hmm it
turns out we have solved it we solved it
in computers 20 years ago we solved it
with a bitmap screen that could display
anything we want put any user in
face-up and a pointing device we solved
it with the mouse right we solve this
problem so how are we going to take this
to a mobile device what we're going to
do is get rid of all these buttons and
just make a giant screen a giant screen
now how are we going to communicate this
we don't want to carry around a mouse
right so what are we going to do Oh a
stylus right we're gonna use a stylus
know who wants a stylist you have to get
them and put them away and you lose him
yuck nobody wants a stylist so let's not
use the stylus we're going to use the
best pointing device in the world we're
going to use a pointing device that
we're all born with were born with 10 of
them were to use our fingers we're going
to touch us with our fingers and we have
invented a new technology called
multi-touch which is phenomenal it works
like magic yeah so you can sort of see
how the state-of-the-art back in two
thousand six was further be these
hardware keyboards and now fast forward
11 years 12 years not only do we have a
plane of glass to provide our services
through but now we have keyboards that
you can swap out to actually change the
way that we actually express ourselves
to computers so if you all the way back
in time to the early 60s when the Cold
War was funding the development of
computers it was really about allowing
soldiers and infantrymen to be aight
well not infra meant to be able to
communicate more effectively commands
based on the battlefield now we're
moving into a space where it's more
about person to person and Social
Communications and 2007 was really the
big break from that era into the modern
era of computing so the thing that's
interesting about the iphone
specifically was that it was a very
personal computer in a number of ways
that were I think someone revolutionary
it gave you access to music and
entertainment it gave you access to
voice and the ability to call and a
modern operating system that was
completely visual the thing that's
really interesting though
that at the time Google had solved the
distribution problem for documents and
pages but there was no solution for
distribution for apps and so in fact
when jobs announced the iphone there was
no way to actually install apps besides
the web the web was going to be the
distribution channel and model for
extending the phone however and it's
curious that of course today is w WC
owing to that community's complaints a
year later jobs relented and finally
actually adopted and released the app
store as a primary vehicle for
distributing applications conventional
applications to the iphone the same year
2007 facebook opened up its platform and
so it used the social graph as a means
of distributing content information
ideas and applications and meanwhile
some of the things were happening with
whatsapp basically making smsfree used
to have to pay per SMS what you still do
and they said well look we can do this
with IP telephony and so therefore we
can make it free and so they rode the
wave of that and skype started offering
video chat as a way of essentially
getting around the carrier's so this was
a huge moment in the mobile computing
platform I guess paradigm and of course
we're now and have been seeing a lot of
changes since then so we fast-forward
through a number of things that happened
basically between this period Facebook
identity one I was part of the identity
Wars we lost on the open web oops
payments became something that people
actually were willing to do on the web
whereas prior to this period people were
really afraid of the web and it really
wasn't a secure place to do business we
chat of course open up its platform and
offered official accounts which of
course are in some ways one of the sort
of driving interests for I guess the for
our world in terms of bots and agents
and stuff like that because of the rise
of this stuff in China and meanwhile
Facebook started decomposing its core
application into a number of component
parts and so now you can see that
Facebook has four of the
top 5 apps in the App Store based on the
rise of social computing meanwhile
people started to move away from the
desktop environment as being the primary
place where they store their files so
they started putting their files and
other people's computers and then
accessing them remotely through more
mobile devices and slack as we know of
course is recomposing the way that work
is done workers can now work anywhere
wherever they want be in touch with
virtual offices in in the chat context
we've also seen people learning to talk
to their computers through Siri which is
of course an extension of the existing
phone ecosystem and we've seen the rise
of a new classic computer which is the
room computer which is an eye free
computer which allows you to just speak
utterances and have things happen and in
the mix of all this we've had special
applications that have been created to
help you navigate the chat context and
have conversations with with software so
we've seen this sort of trend from again
a world that's very declarative and
based on a view of the world that was
more hierarchical to one that's more ad
hoc more on the go more on the fly more
mobile and much more personal in the
very real sense of people communicating
to people as opposed to just businesses
being the sponsors of those behaviors so
here we are six months into this year I
wrote a post in January calling this
year the year of conversational Commerce
I don't know if I was right or not but
there have been a number of things that
happened since then that have I think as
evidenced by this room here that
suggests that conversational software
and that paradigm is going to be a
defining one going forward one of the
reasons why I think this opportunity is
so huge and why I get so many people
sort of telling me well you know this is
dumb i don't want to do stuff in chat
it's so much slower my point to them is
well you are not the actual users of
this and there are two billion people
online today there's a smaller number of
those people who have learned and grown
up with google who have learned to type
a lot of things to get work done who've
learned to do a lot of work to get the
computer to understand what it is that
we want the computer to do but there's
four billion more people out there in
the world
that will come online in the next 10 to
15 years who's first computing
experience may be entirely voice driven
may be entirely touch-based may be in a
car these are the people that
conversational software should be
targeted at and these are the people who
have a blank slate for understanding and
bringing preconceived notions of how
computing should work to the table so
when I define this essentially my
high-level insight is just saying look
there's a huge amount of behavior in the
conversational space around messaging
chat and so on and wouldn't it be
interesting if our applications started
to actually show up in those spaces as
well and what is the work that we need
to do to help bring all of the people
who I just talked to her you know
critics cynics or don't understand this
change into that world so they can
actually be part of it as opposed to
resist it in general I believe that
we're at a symphonic tipping point there
are so many things happening all at once
whether it's AI whether it's machine
learning whether it's chat whether it's
messaging whether it's whatever whatever
whatever whether it's a fatigue that a
lot of the people in this room have an
opportunity to really define what this
industry is going to look like going
forward and how it's going to be open or
not and what those patterns are going to
be that engage and enrich and diversify
the number of people who can actually
use the power of computing now you guys
have all seen this chart I had to show
it basically it's showing the rise of
messaging vs social networks but given
that I'm putting this on context I had
to put it in here because it'll probably
come up later on but again this sort of
shows what's going on in the space one
of the things that I think is so
interesting as well of course is that
everyone's talking about like the
downturn and you know bc's all the money
in the wall was drying up there's
nothing to spend money on anymore we've
solved all the problems robots great but
in this case actually suddenly they're
like oh wait actually there's a whole
new opportunity here to both create a
market grow market and have a lot of
first movers so it's really exciting to
see I guess you know not only like
obviously all of our sort of geeky nerdy
original interest in this but there's
also going to be money flowing into this
and then we can shape how that how that
happens so we all know that it's early
but the interest in the space I think is
real as evidenced by all the
entrepreneurs who are moving into it we
know that bots are not going to be the
be-all end-all solution but
conversations bots all those differing
complement the existing apps that we
already have and allow them to break
into more moments of our lives to become
more useful and more tailored to our
experience all of these things though
ultimately augment and enhance the human
experience and I think that should be an
underlying theme for the things that
we're talking about today and so welcome
