hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
welcome to well we've had some arguments
of whether this is the 9th annual or the
10th annual symposium we know it's been
going on for 10 years we're just not
sure if we've actually had 10 of them
but regardless we started this in 2003
and 2004 was the first one so and and it
has continued to be very much the format
that we have right here which is we try
to split this evenly between people from
industry and people from academia but
almost everybody is someone who lives on
the border of those spaces people who do
a lot of thinking about the the work
that they do in the way that impacts the
the organizations and the people around
them just out of curiosity I mean I
actually know the answer to this that's
not curiosity for me but for other
people how many of you have never been
to one of the social computing
symposiums before so this is not and and
that's pretty much the common theme we
don't want this to be just a gathering
of people who all know each other and
have all talked to each other and have
all heard the same stories over and over
again we want people to be learning from
each other as a result there's not going
to be very much of the people standing
up in front of the room and talking at
you there's going to be short
presentations that give you a chance to
think about big issues and then lots of
time for us to have conversations either
here in the big room or in breakout
rooms depending on the session so
there's also plenty of break time built
in and plenty of social time built in
because what generally happens is that
you get this many smart interesting
people in a room together and what they
really want to do is talk to each other
not be talked at and we're going to try
to facilitate that as much as we can
there's sort of two rules for getting
invited to this in general one is that
one of the people organizing it needs to
think that you're one of the smartest
people they know in the stuff that you
do and the others you need to not be an
asshole and and that second one is
really important now stop
it's important because you know this is
a group of people who are inquisitive
and curious and genuinely interested in
what the people around them have to say
these are people that want to hear what
you're doing that want to talk to you
about what you're doing so take
advantage of that while you're here you
know I should say thank you as always to
Lily who makes this happen every year we
could not do this without her and you
may you probably met Sarah when you were
walking in she can't hear us right now
but Sarah and Karen are the admins who
make all of this run so smoothly they
make me look good everybody thinks I'm
this amazing organizer that I you know
and in fact I am totally relying on them
to make me look this good so so when you
see them be sure to tell them thank you
for all the stuff they do to make the
the details of this work in Where's
George it's George here yeah it's all
right so George a godot who's the
administrator here at ITP make sure that
we have the space and that it's set up
and that you know if there are things
that we need are there issues having to
do with the space he's the person who
makes all that happen so that said what
we're going to do now is I'm going to
pass this round and everybody's going to
do a very brief introduction note there
are a lot of us make it a very brief
introduction your name where you're from
and if we did what what's the talk that
you would like to give okay and if you
don't want to give a talk you can pass
on that you are not required but if you
you know I sent the email out and said
think about something you're passionate
about that you'd like to talk about
doesn't have to be work-related it
doesn't have to be related to the theme
of the symposium you should take out a
piece of paper or at least take out an
electronic document on which you can
take notes on what the various talks
that sound interesting to you are and at
the end of this I will ask you to write
down your top five choices we will
probably pick more than five but it's
easier to collate the votes if you only
vote for 5 and x
lunchtime we will have figured out who
the people are that will be giving the
talks this evening when we get to the
torch club okay all right so which
corner of the room should i start in Who
am I gonna pick I am going to start with
Tom hello Jesus hello New York there we
go I'm Tom coats i work for products
club a new company i have to start it
and i'm not going to talk about anything

Mexico hey I'm gilad I'm a data
scientist at a start-up in new york city

a talk i would talk about buying
audiences so how do people buy followers
on twitter and what they get from it hi
there my name is phil gramm when I was
actually asked by George to come down
today I'm from ITP so I'm currently
studying here on this master's program
and we just got a social game running on
the back screens here so it's for a live
audience to participate in a game in
real time we can support 120
simultaneous players on the screen so if
you get a chance to check it out thank
you
hi I'm Jessie Lingle I'm in the ph.d
program at Rutgers in library and
information science and ah how many
people are library users rip broad right
there's actually more libraries in this
country than McDonald's so I would so we
could talk about that and what I'd like
to talk to you about something called
weeding or D accessioning which is when
you take books out of the library so
normally I would talk to you about how
we do that and then we would all
together come up with a better way of
doing that how would we take books out
of the library and do awesome things
with them hey everyone I'm i canna me
I'm a faculty member at USC in the
communication school I was going to talk
to you so last week and I actually went
on a tour of one of San Francisco's
wastewater treatment facilities there's
sewage plant so I was going to talk to
you about that as infrastructure because
I think a lot about that but I didn't
put it together so honestly all I have
is a bunch of pictures of to show
you so I could I could do that if you're
interested but that's about it oh my god
bucks and um I'm Mary grey I'm a
senior researcher at Microsoft Research
New England and faculty member at
Indiana University I work on politics of
visibility in queer youth in rural
United States I don't want to talk I
want to listen so I'm not proposing a
talk oh hi my name is sandra's monroy
understand I'm a researcher in microsoft
search in few slabs and I didn't prepare
anything but if there was something that
i will talk about is something that we
did last week we had a maker fest in MSR
and one of these we did was make
tangible and tactile and an edible
representations of big data so so some
of the things they did hi I'm Annie
Phelps I run the school of interactive
games of media at RIT I didn't prepare
anything but I've been thinking a lot
about the games that my kids are playing
and why they're playing them and how
that's changing our entire family
damn i thought i was going to get out of
talking i'm kathryn isbister I'm the
research director of the game innovation
lab done it in why you Polly and I'm
also on faculty here in tisch been in
the game center which is newly formed
and I to have no interest in giving a
talk and I'm happy to listen I'm Karen
levy I'm a PhD student at in sociology
at Princeton University and today is
actually my first day back from
maternity leave after just having my
first kid so I'm probably not
intellectually a student off right now
to give you guys a good talk but if I
were to give you a talk it would
probably be about baby which is the
thing I'm most passionate about at the
moment I'm Joshua corpsman I work in the
private sector as a security researcher
for hackers for last ten plus years and
you already have to listen to me on
Friday about anonymous and hackers so
I'm not going to punish you a second
time hello I'm Gabriela also known as
biela I'm a professor at McGill who
works on computer hackers and i'm also
on the panel anonymous and i will be
using a lot of aphorisms from Nietzsche
to talk about the aphorisms of anonymous
my name is Brian knappenberger I'm a
writer director of documentary filmmaker
I made a film last year called we are
legion the story of the hacktivists and
i thought i would say for my five-minute
talk talk a little bit about kind of
lessons problems potentially learned
from distributing that film
independently last year online including
lots of piracy
i I'm Eden lid I'm a PhD student at
Northwestern University in the media
technology and society program and I'm
totally going to be selfish and not give
a talk I'm Becky Vermont I'm here from
the Rhode Island School of Design I
recently moved out of the city into the
country and could talk to you about the
politics of the backyard birding
community in my new backyard I'm Colleen
Estrada I'm a designer and if I were to
give a talk and with these labs and I
would talk about the power of gut
feelings and how almost like it's like
an anti data thoughts we're all obsessed
with how data can make us decide
everything but gut feelings are really
where it's at and i want to remind you
guys of that i'm on and gurdas I'm a
writer I write a column in The New York
Times and right now a book about Texas
on going and I am NOT gonna give a
speech today but I look forward to all
of your speeches about i'm tricia
Wang and I'm a sociologist and my home
institution is UC San Diego but really
where I've been over the last seven
years is traveling around the world
trying to research what youth are doing
online with most of my time being spent
in China and I would love to give a talk
today about my research because well
about what some of my findings since I
just returned from the field and
primarily most you most research on
Western youths shows that they're online
practices are more or less consistent
with their offline lives and I have
found something totally different and I
would love to tell you about that but
you won't know unless you vote for my
talk
all right I'm baratunde a thirst and I'm
here to threaten you and to voting for
my talk I'm a comedian and author i
wrote a book called how to be black i'm
the founder of a company called
cultivated wit a creative tech startup
focusing on humor and digital
interaction i have no talk because I
spend all my life talking but I'm
recently back from maternity leave
myself I gave birth to a little baby and
I want to talk about the miracle of that
happening to me Wow um I'm Belinda
Thurston and I'm the sibling of said
baritone day I am a twenty retired now
twenty-year journalist who has created a
donation-based yoga studio in Lansing
Michigan the state capital Michigan and
also the executive director of a
nonprofit that will extend yoga services
to the homeless domestic violence
victims those who are in substance
recovery and at-risk youth if i speak i
guess i would like to talk about the
role that we play connecting services
and systems that you might not have
thought can actually serve community
that are desperately in need so maybe
give you a different view of what yoga
can do I'm Liz Liddy Dean of the high
school at Syracuse and the thing I'm
passionate about a student startups I'm
interested we have decided we don't
teach entrepreneurship we do
entrepreneurship so be glad to share
some of our story with you I'm Carrie
karahalios at the university of illinois
area of social computing one of things
that I'm interested in more disgusting
than speaking about is how to be a happy
and productive introvert in social media
you're done I'm Lee Rainie director of
the pew internet and american life
project you'll hear enough for me later
on and asterisk asterisk ascaris is one
of the seven banned words at pew so i'm
happy to hear from you all of the s
asterisk asterisk asterisk stuff that
pew should do but we can't say that word
my name is Jeff Hancock I'm at Cornell
University I say a psychology of social
media I've been thinking a lot about how
many humans have lived while we've been
speaking and talking and it's a
surprising number and if you'd like to
know more about how long and how many
humans have been talking we could talk
about that now my name is cliff lampe I
am a professor at the University of
Michigan School of Information i would
like to talk about babies because i also
have a newborn and i did not deliver him
like like others did them so but what I
would really I've been thinking a lot
lately about how to get the ivory tower
broken down how do we get academics out
of academia and out back into the real
world and there are some challenges to
productive town-gown relationships and
academia industry relationships so I'd
like to talk about that more hi I'm
Linda stone I'm a generalist X Apple x
microsoft and now doing a combination of
writing and speaking and advising there
are two different areas that people talk
to me about last night that I'd be happy
to talk about either one is the
importance of self-directed play and
something I just wrote is up on Boing
Boing about that mass murderers for
example in their play histories
childhood play histories have no self
directed play experiences that they can
describe so there's a lot of really
interesting work by play scholars and
then other work that I'm doing is in the
physiology of computing some of you have
heard the term screen apnea or email at
Nia or continuous partial attention
that's my work and the latest stuff that
I'm doing there has to do with lymph and
lymph stagnation when we sit because our
major lymph ducts are here and here and
I believe but I cannot prove that this
is potentially related to the increase
in cancer
I'm Andrea forte I am an assistant
professor at the high school at drexel
and I'm totally unprepared to give a
talk in this but I have been thinking a
lot about the construction of family
identity and there's a long history of
families having an identity in
communities um how does that happen
online how do we construct family
identities online there's a lot about
groups there's a lot about individuals I
have a student who's working with me
looking at how people construct family
histories in places like ancestry com
family index findagrave.com if you've
ever looked at that one and are
interesting things happening in these
places that I think are going a little
bit under the radar it's also a huge
business and so I'm totally unprepared
to talk about that but it's what if I'm
thinking about I'm Sarita yardi I'm an
assistant professor at the university of
michigan school of information and i was
originally going to talk about why Jeff
Hancock stock would be boring and wrong
um but I didn't know about the don't be
an asshole role yet so I'm not going to
do that I can instead I'm going to talk
about if you ask how I am at my husband
at microsoft research which was totally
under the radar and true story hi i'm ty
aweis I am a professional wingsuit
skydiver and a hobbyist BASE jumper aka
the little videos you guys have probably
seen of people in the bat suits jumping
off cliffs and flying around clouds and
stuff that's what I do yeah so I'm not a
panel later i'll be talking about that i
think we have some video to show but if
anyone wants to hear more about why the
hell anyone would leave a perfectly good
other career to do that i'd be happy to
talk about it hey I'm Kevin slavin after
many years and whatever the opposite of
academia is in two weeks i start a new
lab at the media lab called playful
systems which is official but not yet
announced so don't announce it
yeah I think I think it might get an ads
before I start in two weeks and and I
talk a lot so I'm just gonna listen
today hello my name is Matt bit off I've
also along with Tom coats just started a
small company in San Francisco called
product club thank you Tom yay we're
very big fans of each other's work I'm a
software developer kind of data guy I
was going to give a talk I talked about
a bit of a side project I've been doing
recently data mining a sort of a couple
hundred thousand million article archive
of the Guardian with machine learning
algorithms and trying to look for what
words most indicate what topics and does
that show any inherent biases or
interesting elements of how journalists
write in The Guardian in the UK I'm
David Weinberger I work in a Harvard
library innovation lab and at the
Harvard Birkins had deferred interest in
society like Andrea I'm completely
unprepared to talk but there's a topic
that I'm interested in would like to
talk with people about which is as its
brought in in Kuwait which is what the
internet is what time looks like and
especially the future looks like on the
internet I don't mean in terms of
predictions but sort of the nature of
what it means to have a future
hi my name is Shelley Farnham I'm a
researcher microsoft research in a few
slabs I've been thinking a lot about
community I'm a big community advocate I
believe in it I think it is the key to
our personal happiness but also our
success as a human species and so I've
been really immersed in how we as
technologists can promote community and
be in particular the hyper local level
your neighbors how can we get you
connected and in a position to respond
effectively to all of the crazy things
that are happening in our lives hi I'm
Elizabeth Churchill I just joined ebay
um yes very excited anyone who knows me
knows I liked people I liked technology
and I love shopping so this is like
ideal I don't want to do at all but i
will be seeking recruits for a field
trip to go and find out what good
shopping there is around here so yay
hello my name is kellen I'm the CTO at
etsy I spent a lot of time thinking
about how you make large groups of
people not hate each other and work well
together you know we have a team that
went from 25 people down to five people
up to 170 people over the last three
years so I would be talking about
something Ron on those topics I would
employ a lot of work from just culture
and resilient engineering recently so
something about that I'm trapped sorry
um hi my name is Heather Ford I am a
dphil student at the Oxford internet
Institute that's the same as a PhD and I
study who gets banned and what gets
deleted on wikipedia and I'm going to be
talking just now so and i'm way too
serious for you people so hi i'm steven
levy a wired magazine and an author um
rather than you know take time from some
of the other great talks on I'm hearing
here i'll give you my talking in one or
two sentences in 10 years most video the
people watch will be live because the
fact that you know these things can be
live video to the world
old and cameras are everywhere and
people will have persistent video links
it's going to just make a lot of big
changes so rather than just
world now you fill in the blanks so i
did a column about this somewhere you
could find and i think it's under spoken
about I'm Alexa clay i'm the author of
the misfit economy and i'm interested in
hearing all your stories about deviance
and illicit activity and I could talk
about Hermits this is something I've
been thinking a lot about recently and
maybe we could do an exercise around
designing technology for hermits which
would be kind of an oxymoron but could
be productive hi my name is Harper read
I just got done doing something really
crazy where I was that the CTO for
president obama's campaign and luckily
we won which makes this conversation
much better and I'm currently very
excited about decompression
disconnection and building teams and
starting from zero hi I'm a gina trapani
I'm an app developer and right now I'm
working on an app called think up just
open source platform for giving you
insights into your social activity and
after trying for many years my wife and
I just had a baby so I wanted to talk
about how much social media sucks when
you're having trouble having a kid I'm a
nail dash I'm a genus co-founder think
up and blogger at Dash is calm for the
last 14 oh god 14 years and what I'm
sort of obsessed with is how we can
bring lessons from the physical world
especially urbanism to online
communities and in particular how we
recapture some of the values and ideas
we lost around web and web communities
over the last decade
hi there in Morgan Ames I'm a guest
computer scientists computer scientists
turned social scientists I'm a PhD
student at Stanford the Sanford
communication department and I spent six
months in South America studying One
Laptop Per child and in doing the lit
review for one laptop per child I did a
big lit review of tech utopianism and
was amazed at what I found from the last
200 years and so I collected up a whole
bunch of these quotes and I want to play
my little pony or porn star tech
utopianism for my talk hi there my name
is panthea Lee I'm with a company called
reboot we do program design in
international development largely um I
don't need to talk about this to the
group but I'm stuck on a project and so
if people could help or have ideas we're
working on a project in the tribal
region of Pakistan focused on improving
information systems there it's a really
sort of unique contacts with highly sort
of restricted media ecosystem so if
anyone wants to talk to me about that I
would love any input hey everyone my
name is Mark kaggwa and um yeah I came
all the way from Nairobi Kenya just to
be here yeah so yeah so please forgive
the eye bags but my my talk Oh Who am
first I guess I'll be up in a minute on
with Trish's panel but I'm a blogger and
technologists based in Nairobi from
where I write create hack and get up to
all sorts of interesting things I should
hope and what I would talk about if
given the chance if you've not had
enough of me after the little session we
do is how a boy about this high
half-naked in an Indiana Jones
production went from that to creating a
video game for winner brothers in Kenya
in Africa my story Thanks hi I'm on
shamina I'm you can call me on I'm an
artist designer and writer and
I'm starting a new site called the civic
beat about the role of internet memes
internet humor internet culture and
social and political expression places
like China Uganda Philippines and the
United States recently wrote about some
of the similarities between the Trayvon
Martin hoodie meme and a chung chung the
blind activist lawyer who's studying law
here at nyu and some of the similarities
between those memes i wrote about that
in the atlantic i'll be presenting some
of my emerging research in uganda and in
Trisha's panel but i'd love to just chat
with people i'm not as a presentation
but if any of you are familiar with
other internet memes in a global context
i'd love to talk to you thank you hi you
all know who I am things still on ok um
hello if it's quieter now so I'm not
going to pitch a talk but Alice marrek
couldn't be here this morning she will
be here later today and she asked me to
pitch her talk on her behalf so I will
do what I hate to do which I will read
the text that somebody else gave me the
hot single thrift shop by Seattle
rappers Macklemore and Ryan Lewis extols
the virtues of buying your granddad's
clothes at the thrift store down the
road as a lifelong thrifter Ellis will
talk briefly about the business of
thrift stores the recycled textile
market and is placed in the global
economy and end with some hot tips for
thrifting fabulous clothes at your local
Goodwill or value village i am taylor
owen my own work is on international
relations the intersection of digital
technology in international relations
but I've recently moved to the Columbia
Journalism school to start as the
research director of the new tau center
for digital journalism and we are in the
process of rolling out a couple million
dollars of grants looking at innovative
practitioners in the journalism world
intersecting with innovative researchers
in the academic world and I'd love to
tell you how we can give you some of
that hi I'm Lily I am NOT going to do a
talk but one thing that I'm interested
in is every year we I run a research lab
at Microsoft and we have interns and
things like that for the academics and
the crowd I'd be really interested in
hearing ideas on how we could do really
different
for the ways we interact with students
so hi I'm red Bruins I'm part of ICP and
I couldn't resist it I'm on sabbatical
and I'm still here I me meto I'm an
anthropologist I study geek culture and
learning I guess if I was going to do a
talk I might talk about wow what is like
to start learning how to surf in your
40s the role of the Internet in that as
kind of parable for how online networks
mess with cool but highly exclusionary
niche subcultures hi I'm Tom Laird
McConnell I've been developing software
for over 30 years and last five years
with Lily making social experiences
infused labs microsoft research and as a
developer we are never asked to talk and
so I was a bit terrified by this
prospect and I was just like oh I would
just make some up and then that
made me think well how do I make up
and so my talk if I was forced to talk
and it would be not a good talk would be
how I learned to make up by taking
piano lessons hi I'm John Boy Ric from
bed works um I I prefer to listen today
but if I have to talk there's a there's
a story which I read yesterday morning
which I've been thinking about for two
days which is somebody wrote a short
story about as its it's written by VAT
to just got back from I think Iraq and
it's it's called to thank you war and
it's about it at that broad level it's
about how you see how authentic
communication happens on social
platforms specifically it's about the
tendency people have to say to him thank
you and how he hates that you could find
it if you're interested at it it's a guy
called Elliot who wrote it and it's at
bit ly / Thank You war so so if people
are interested I'd love to talk about
that because
I think that as the speed and scale of
communications increases we tend to take
sort of the most superficial social
gestures and scale them and they also
sort of rip out a lot of the
authenticity out of language and about
out of social connections so hi my name
is Dana Boyd I'm at microsoft research
um I'm not gonna really talk today but
uh I actually did something really funny
this weekend which is with Quinn
Norton's amazing help aya managed to
actually finish a draft of my book which
for those of you who have known me for a
very long time this is kind of a miracle
um if anybody is sick and twisted and
actually wants to look at it I give me a
feed bag you were more than welcome but
hopefully will actually be coming out
this year hi everybody I'm Dan
O'Sullivan from here at ITP I'm a
developer to heart so I'm not much of a
talker but I would lobby for any of the
talks around previously mentioned about
disrupting education thank you i'm also
an interloper here a researcher at ITP
my name is sean vann every i'm working
on live video prototypes from mobile
devices looking at stephen there but I'm
