big data is certainly in the news today
but you don't often hear about how data
scientists go about doing their work
that may be because it's not pretty data
scientists will submit queries and then
they'll often have to wait overnight to
see results I want to show you project
tempeh which is a new prototype for
microsoft research that makes this a lot
better what you're looking at is a kind
of living research notebook let me start
analyzing some sample data so let's just
pull in some stock prices when I look at
my stock prices tempeh shows me a
summary of my data and already I noticed
something strange which is that the
prices themselves are all kind of
clustered at the bottom end but I have
some outliers and this is very typical
of data science where the data comes in
dirty and you sort of have to clean up
the mistakes i'm going to enter a query
that's written in a notation that would
be familiar to most dotnet programmers
and this query basically filters the
data to eliminate those stocks whose
opening prices are way out of range and
then i just want to double check that
i've actually cleaned it up the way I
expected so I'll take a look at how the
stock prices that i filtered are now
distributed and now i'm starting to see
a distribution that makes more sense
notice a couple of things here one is
that whenever i type in a query i get an
immediate response and that response is
progressive that is the data will sort
of update itself as more and more of the
data is analyzed this is the kind of
thing where data scientists would wait
overnight today and we give an immediate
and progressive response finally I'm
sort of curious about those stock prices
that have done consistently well that is
the stock has gone up on a day on day
basis so now I'm going to define a new
feature which is those stocks that have
had up days days where they've closed
higher and I'm going to take a look at
which stocks have done the best so I
have a little sorted top 10
and here they are so this is a demo of
our project tempeh in contrast to the
way people do data science today which
is issuing queries and then waiting a
long time for responses project tempeh
is all about interactive data analysis
people enter their queries they get
immediate and progressive responses so
basically it makes it easy for them to
go wherever their curiosity takes them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
