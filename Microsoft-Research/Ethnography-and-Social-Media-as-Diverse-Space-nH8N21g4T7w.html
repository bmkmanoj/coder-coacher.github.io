every five minutes I thanks Dana for
getting me involved in this I remember
two or three years ago when i started
doing research or seven years ago I
heard about the symposium I have friends
who come today this is the place where
show I share ideas and then years later
and then this idea what turn into the
club or turn into a more public talk and
I was like wow i wish i was at philly
community does I don't have that in my
department I want to play for this one
by friend an idea
people that feel stage and feel like
they're we great feedback without so
we're giving you know he liked roster
size so I really like you know to be
here in seconds
giving you all the things
so as I think earlier I've been doing
some intense
the last few years also understand how
what it is like to come of age you know
super it digitally connected under an
authoritarian regime and I've been
finding out some things are really
interesting that really chocolate some
of these
count 11 with
Chinese Western news passes online
practices are pretty
when they're off my gosh is why the
great research has come out from you
know meetings work and Alice's where the
datas work and many other researchers so
what I found is that something
completely opposite so I wanted to look
just a little
did but what I wanted move on to some of
the mechanism for wiping this is
happening and how this actually gives us
insights for how we use hell people how
you do social media outside of time
the u.s. to happen we I
things about lighting we don't really
have a language to talk about what
happens online with
one way but we actually died in to what
you know people what team
it's a crazy world so it odd way I
hadn't go all the way to China this you
know we replaced and to come back as CEO
pay the taxes is therapy extreme but
they give us a lot of insight to
understanding what these are doing here
so some of the stuff I was being with
that there has been a what I was talking
to a lot of youth in my fieldwork I
found out that they were not doing
things that were consistent over online
but I actually talked them I think
they were spending a lot of time online
with strangers lots of me that is what
they wanted to do and that is when
things but most their time on i doing so
during my fuel or chinese use often told
that they were most comfortable sharing
their emotions online what people they
didn't personally know they had multiple
like 20 to 30 instead message
to handle all their identity and
interesting they were also also most
emotionally closed when people they
didn't know and it never met now this
poverty sounds like any other youth who
is you know socially or geographically I
played into s so it may not seem that
special but their political social
contents are trying to ask to make a
very special because Chinese in Chinese
society there are such low trust that is
too risky for anyone including you to
share their emotions with someone they
already know so I don't want to get into
the history of why that is but I want to
go into some of the resources wet pipe
out and so given all these conditions of
you know like 30 40 or 50 years and
communism and thousands of years of
really strong social description forms
around emotional expression the sudden
availability of availability of an
Internet combined with open market
capitalism over the last decades has
created this new social space in China
where individuals
connect with each other under very
quality an occupation so this is not
political space and the most scholars
their second China they're saying well
the internet is going to bring about you
know political revolution people can now
share ideas about the government openly
but that's not what people are doing
1albums that's one of the things that
we're about a lot in the West but think
that is most important for young people
that they can express their emotions
openly and it's initiated an impression
of self-expression they are in a path to
release emotions in this expressive
space and this momentum of collective
self expressions being amplified with
social media which is made it possible
for a new self divert and what I'm
calling animosity stuff so I just want
to kind of share my idea that the
language i'm using to discuss it left
itself i really would love your feedback
and this is thank you
ok kool and the last so the last itself
is both a feeling that once my identity
is flexible and actually a trying on
different identities there are beyond
the realm of the prescribed self so
prescribed self is composed by the
thieves are given by lies existing
social structure like you know your your
gender or your family your ethnicity so
the prescribed self emerges on in one
existing ties whereas the lastest self
emerges out of view ties so what the
internet does is that it augments be
catalyzed in VA says elastic self to
release and collect the tides of the
social media like Twitter or an online
community like an anime fandom room or
it could be an Internet friendship so in
the context of trying that self that
actually exists outside of the
traditional types of family and the
collective and size of state is
absolutely unprecedented so one of the
things I'm really interesting is that
when we look at
have said a lot of research on physical
place that gives the language in a way
to think about virtual experience so we
know that built environment affects our
behavior so formal spaces pretty small
identities like we walk into a room and
we see Rosa that's lined up your notes
you accent you know started and then
contrast informal spaces Greece informal
interactions so but we walk into a bar
we just see like people has to be
standing around we know that we can you
know act freely without having to
respond to and 40 bigger so in the same
way software environments also affects
how we present ourselves online in the
way I've been thinking about it is that
it was whether intentional or not social
network search particular kind of
identity and interaction and broadly we
can categorize social media into two
kinds of spaces when it comes to
identity formation it kind of operates
on a spectrum this way
my head you know one and there's
family's faces the spectrum on the other
is unmounted so these two faces have
very different from whole dynamics so it
is not about a social media site social
interactions hence Amir or extend
existing social interactions because
people socialize people they already
know and so they face book and found it
is prescriptive singular and his three
identities and an unbounded social media
site sociality veers towards that
exploratory performative and even
fantastical because people tend to
socialize with people they don't know so
consequently you know I'm found in
social media sites tend to produce a
wider spectrum too much blood supply
identities in Twitter and Tumblr and and
sew the elastic self flourishes and hunt
down his face because the presence of
strangers individuals who are
ready to try on different agencies
without the pressure of having to commit
to any single one individuals combining
other quickly informed immediate one and
it's just trustworthiness in a very
virtual space and they treat what I call
network trust and they can do this
because LaVon so the most ideal of
madness we have a combination of several
of these conditions from permanence
flexibility and identity and in
formality and these all shows what
happens to be the conditions that
describes the social media apps that
teens love right now that we are
probably come down to by 80 kids of
Instagram snapchat and tumblr so with
the availability of all of these news
absent services such a surprise no
recent olive treats it all is one
homogenous place now where they wouldn't
that was true pre-2008 110 is actually
diversity of purposes and used it and
it's much more awkward to talk about it
as the spectrum but this is not a market
a spectrum that's not universal because
a spectrum just different for each
person
that later so on pretty much during my
fieldwork an overwhelming majority of my
youth would tell me that it's but most
are trying to online spaces and
strangers because these are the spaces
that they're most far from their friends
their family and the people they know
and these are the things that were
perfect for it exploring inelastic stuff
so what opposed to summary
knives on that site that I run with
Heather and Jenna the view of
ethnography and we also
we have all the articles are taught
summary smart session this morning we're
going to post a summary of each session</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
