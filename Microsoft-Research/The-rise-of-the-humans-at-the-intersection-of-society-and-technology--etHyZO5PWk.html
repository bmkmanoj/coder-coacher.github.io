hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
good afternoon everybody and welcome to
the 2016 camry science festival it's our
22nd year as a science festival and
we're absolutely delighted to be able to
host this event with Microsoft Research
and just a quick bit of housekeeping we
haven't got a fire alarm planned and so
if it does go off for those of you in
the front the fire exit is through the
doors here for those of you at the back
just outside the lecture theatre here
and outside the door straight ahead of
you and we're delighted both to welcome
Dave Coplin and also professor John
Norton to this event John is one of our
Science Festival patrons he's a fellow
wolfson college university of cambridge
and is written extensively on the
intersection of science and technology
and society and so it provides an
absolutely perfect chair for this event
can I introduce John thank you good
afternoon folks thank you for coming
welcome to one of the nicer buildings in
Cambridge it's even nicer than you think
but you have to be loud upstairs to see
but believe me it is it's my pleasure to
introduce Dave Coplin who has an
absolutely fantastic job title he is the
chief envisioning officer for Microsoft
UK how about that and he's an
established leader in the role and
thinking about the role of Technology in
our personal and professional lives he's
worked across a wide range of industries
and customers providing strategic advice
and guidance around the intersection of
a modern society and technology both
inside and outside of the world at work
and on the sixth day he rests he's
passionate about turning the base metal
of technologies he puts it into valuable
assets that affect the way we live work
and play and in so doing move the focus
from the technology itself to the
outcomes it enables which i think is the
focus of what he wants to talk about
today his first book entitled business
reimagined provided a view of new
working environment based on a
collaborative and flexible working his
latest
look the rise of the humans provides a
further call to action for both
individuals and organizations to harness
what he calls the digital deluge to rise
up and take back control of the
potential that technology offers our
society so ladies and gentlemen allow me
to introduce this revolutionary Dave
compline thanks John well hi everybody
what's going to be a long afternoon hi
everybody there we go to hi my name is
dave i work for microsoft and please
understand i have a comedy job title
because i am check me out I am Microsoft
UK's chief envisioning officer come on i
work in IT job titles are all I've got
right and the thing is i chose the job
Tyler specifically because I have a
really interesting angle on what's
happening in the world of technology i
work for an organization that you will
well know loves to talk to you about the
technology and the products we make we
love talking about that stuff but what
we don't do enough of for my money is
not to talk about the technology but
talk about the human beings that use it
so my job is essentially to project out
into the future and try and understand
how a human beings going to want to live
work and play because i think if we
understand what the humans are going to
do we can be a lot more mindful about
the kind of technology they're going to
require so understand then at a certain
level my job is essentially about the
future of humanity right and i just
figured if I'm gonna have a job about
the future of humanity I deserve may I
demand a job title with a certain degree
of pomposity because say I've achieved
that I also chose job title because when
I was a kid I said to me Mom I said mom
one day I'm going to be CEO at Microsoft
you just want and for years I've got
away with that because I never had to
tell her but she's actually sat in the
fourth row so she's just found out I
never got the job sorry my um I also
have to take give a bit of background
about me I stand in front of you an
individual who's dedicated his entire
career to the world of IT I spent 25
years inside the second smallest room
inside most organizations these are the
rooms with no natural daylight just the
blinking of the LEDs in the wearing of
the fans to keep me company I've chosen
to work for one of the world's largest
technology companies I have gone to the
extremes of personal groomer
to grow a beard and a ponytail that's
how coming today I'm a guess what I also
quite like Star Trek man alright this is
my eighth birthday party it's my mum and
my auntie Mabel stick with me I'll make
it relevant right the thing is when I
was a kid Star Trek talking this really
important less and it taught me that
technology is supposed to be a force for
good in our society it's this thing that
enables human beings to rise up and
achieve more than they ever could do on
the run this is the point of Technology
it's the gift the technology offers our
society but my problem my problem is
those 25 years in IT because I look
around at how we all use technology
today and I don't see this liberating
force I see a prison I see something
that constrains how we work controls how
we think and quite frankly I refuse to
accept that as our future so a few years
ago I set out on a different journey I
wrote a book called business reimagined
John talked about which is essentially
about how the way we work today doesn't
work and it's based on a few obvious
principles the first one is this we live
in an incredible time could you human me
could you put your hand up if you have a
computer at home right that's number one
right number two is keep your hand up if
the computer you have at home is better
than the one you use at work or the one
you have access to at school oh what a
surprise it's almost everybody it's a
question I ask every audience because
it's a really important question I love
it if it's folk do we have anybody from
the public sector in the audience today
few people I love it when the public
sector because it's like shooting fish
in a barrel right that question at that
point but the reality is it doesn't
matter what industry you're in what size
of the company that you're in what you
do the answer to that question is always
the same people have a richer experience
of technology in their personal lives
than they're allowed to in their
professional lives and that's just mad
we have grandparents skyping their
grandkids you guys know this you live
online you shop online you plan on your
this amazing experience of technology in
your personal I've does amazing things
for you and then you're going to work
we've got a school and this is how much
people feel about technology in those
environments and you're greeted at the
door by some long haired barely get like
me and I tu just loves just loves to say
nah you can't do that and I don't
understand that because I've spent the
majority of my career chasing people
down corridors like some bizarre
freakish stalker just trying to get them
to care
about what technology might do for them
these days that chase still happens but
it's the other way around you guys chase
me down the corridor wondering why you
can have such a rich experience of
Technology in your personalized and yet
you're constrained in how you work and
we have to change this but the real
issue of how we work coming down to
something that's much more insidious
it's this thing that's supposed to be
the savior of how he works this thing
called productivity but our problem as a
society's we've forgotten what
productivity means the way we think
about productivity today was defined by
the Industrial Revolution it has become
a cold economic formula it is output per
unit of input and for the last 200 years
our society has been fixated on
productivity being all about the process
of work it's about efficiency rather
than the product of work the
effectiveness of what we do and the
issue of that focus puts all of the
effort all of the energy in the wrong
space it gets us to use the tools to
work in old-fashioned ways Microsoft did
a survey of the UK workforce we asked a
representative sample of the UK work was
what constitutes a productive day at
work seventy-seven percent of the
respondents that a productive day at
work was clearing their email inbox this
is not good and if you have a problem
with why that's bad let me remind you
that email is the process of work it is
not the actual work you're supposed to
be doing so we have to change this and
also this belittles the potential of
Technology because it constrains us to
working practices the working practices
and processes that define our businesses
but these are processes that were
fundamentally defined in the 19th
century by our Victorian forebears
people who are wanting to create the
first ever organizations and all we've
done with technology today is we've
taken those old Victorian working
processes and we've kept them intact
it's just that now we use technology to
make them a bit quicker or a bit cheaper
this belittles the gift that technology
can deliver we have to change that and
then the final piece of the puzzle is
you guys the people who enter the
workforce the people who are in work
because the reality is that most people
are not engaged in what they do I cannot
get the workers to work harder because
they simply don't care workplace
engagement is a massive problem that
faces us
pretty much around the globe the numbers
in the UK will tell you that
eighty-three percent of the UK workforce
is disengaged at work not really that
bothered about what they do same numbers
around the u.s. in the u.s. it's 71
percent so unless we can get the people
who are in our organizations to care
about what they're doing they're never
going to want to change they're never
going to want to use the technology in
the right place and here's where the
second part of the story comes in and
this is where the second book called the
rise of the humans and this is really
the story I want to focus on today
there's a couple of things I should tell
you about the books right the first
thing is I'm a cheap date right so if
you're interested in these books you can
get them for free you can get them for
free from amazon if you have a kindle or
kindle app or if you don't have a kindle
just tweet me or email me whatever you
want i'll send you a download code the
second thing i have to tell you about
these books and i'm not really proud to
have to admit this in public but there
was a period in my life where i was
pretty much down on my luck and i needed
money and you know i did some of the
things that i'm not terribly proud of
him and i was a management consultant
and as a result of being a management
consultant you will find no answers in
these books because lady gemini was a
good consultant these books are just
provocations they are a poke in the ribs
for us to think differently about our
technology but let me take you through
the story so I believe we live in a
place i call the digital dell use this
is a world where we are surrounded by
too much information and interestingly
we complain about it like it's a new
thing and we thought I can never find
out here is all too much here but I
would argue that since the invention of
the printing press our society owes
access had access to more content than
any single individual could consume in
their entire lifetimes the fact that
today thanks to the internet and
computers we have ten times more a
bazillion times more doesn't matter we
still have more but what really makes
the problem special today what really
makes it a cute today is these things
these beautiful lovely engaging personal
devices that are with us from the minute
we wake up until the moment we go to
sleep now be honest who amongst you
first thing this morning when you woke
up you check your phone last thing at
night and this is the problem right
because we now have access to the slip
wherever we are whatever we're doing as
a result of all the incredible things we
can do with mobile technology most
people are still here quick random
sample of this audience who amongst you
does not get enough email
right I don't even have to write a
punchline to that joke we get the pic
this was not the gift of what we were
supposed to deliver with technology this
is the problem of where we are with how
we use technology now ever really simple
philosophy for how you predict the
future and it's basically if you want to
predict the future the best way to
predict the future is simply to better
understand the past and it's based on
that philosophy that I would like to
place all of the blame for our current
problems with technology all of the
blame rests with one single individual
one persons responsible for the problems
we face today it's a Scotsman and it's
Alexander Graham Bell what a bastard eh
here he is he has this amazing invention
right in eighteen seventy five if you
wanted to communicate as human beings
and you were separated by geography the
only choice you had would be to engage
in machine-to-machine communication the
only choice you had his invention in
1876 turn that into a human experience
human beings could for the first time
ever engage in something that was very
natural they could talk to each other
even though they were separated by
geography but we didn't stop there we
carried on and on and on we live in this
amazing world where thanks to these
devices I can stand pretty much anywhere
in the world and i can connect and talk
to anyone else anywhere else in the
world but a really interesting thing as
i started to happen because as the
technology has become more and more
pervasive in our everyday lives we're
starting to see a dark side emerge
because as good as the technology is
that connecting people who are
geographically separated increasingly
it's disconnecting people in the same
physical space and you'll see this all
around you only if you work in an
open-plan office right and technologies
really problematic because what
technology does in an open-plan office
is it disconnects people from each other
how many times do you catch yourself
sitting in your open-plan office at your
open plan desk with your open-plan
laptop and your lucky gunk and you're
emailing the person who sit next to you
you know what I'm going for lunch I
don't know where we're going to go what
I know then they just talk to them we
don't do that technology disconnects us
it happens at home if you have kids
you'll be familiar with this picture let
me tell you about family time in the
copland household we will once in a
while from time to time said you know
what wouldn't it be nice let's all sit
down together at the table
all for dinner as a family quality
family time right and I'll sit down my
son sits down my wife sits down within
minutes my work phone is out I'm
checking my email my son sees that is
that iight game on he brings out his
nameless tablet device think about it my
wife's looking at the turbo she's
thinking well you know you can't beat
them join them she's on facebook at this
point nobody is talking we are locked in
our own individual little digital worlds
well sit and watch a movie as a family
on the weekend I guarantee you when we
watch a movie as a family on the weekend
there will be two out of the three of us
looking at the small screen in elapsed
rather than the big one right in front
of us technology is disconnecting us it
happens in real life how many times do
you go to some big public event I don't
know New Year's Eve in Trafalgar Square
a concert only to see hundreds if not
thousands of people enjoying the event
from four inches behind the glowing
wrecked what is that about I wood up to
up like I said what are you doing it I
saw I I got HD camera my phone right and
I'm like yeah syllabi it's called my
eyes bizarre the thing is what we got to
realize is that we are all just the
first generation of the other we are the
first digital society the first
generation of a digital society we're
still figuring out how this stuff
actually works and because we don't know
how it works and because we don't know
how it actually could add value to our
lives we've invented a series of coping
mechanisms that we think help with a
world of too much information but in
fact hinder what we're able to do when I
talk to you about three of these coping
mechanisms the first one is something i
call skimming and this is where we skim
across the surface of the ocean of
information without ever taking time to
dive deep and you'll come across this in
a number of different ways you can come
across this at work and you come across
it in the email that you send your boss
and you get a response that basically
says don't send me a long email if you
can't summarize it into two or three
bullets it's not worth saying or maybe
you've got some Millennials and they're
a few here today in the organization and
you send your long email and you get a
response back that simply says TLD are
anybody had that yet too long didn't
read the bloke at the back I'm having
that yeah
and the problem is right i'm not saying
that we shouldn't be focused and i'm not
showing that brevity isn't always
important but the reality is you have to
recognize what you throw away when you
get those messages and you make them
shorter as you throw away context and
without context you make you massively
increase the risk that the decisions you
make based on that information will be
wrong and what you need to do is you
need to make a positive conscious choice
about whether that context is important
now skimming is supported by another
coping mechanism i call snacking and
this is pretty much down to these
devices because thanks to these devices
i can fill in every nook and cranny of
every available moment of my waking day
to skim on more information and you see
this happen all around you i work in
London a lot you see it classically on
the tube it takes 45 seconds to get from
the bottom to the top or the top to the
bottom of an escalator what you'll see
in those 45 seconds is thousands of
commuters using that quality time to
catch up on their email you see it in
other ways i'll give you another
personal example when i was right in the
book I was aware I had this really
terrible behavior because I would be
putting my son to bed and I love to give
him read him a story when he goes to bed
and I found that in the proceedings I
was starting to become absent because
what would happen there's this little
window of time right between when he's
getting into his pajamas and when he's
actually in bed waiting for his story in
that window of time he's offering the
bathroom brushing his teeth there is
nothing I can do at that moment to help
him and that's like two minutes so what
do I do with two minutes well I do with
two minutes what any busy working parent
does with two minutes I stuff me and in
me pocket have a quick look at me if I
know I just see what's going on at work
now the problem it's not so much that
I've done that it's the impact on my
cognitive state because the minute I
look at my working mail mentally I am no
longer at home all of the baggage all of
the stress all the chaos of the office
comes flooding right back now best-case
my son gets into bed and he has a story
from a slightly distracted dad worst
case I get one of those emails and we
all get one of these emails from time to
time this is the email from your boss or
your colleague or the coin whatever it
may be let's change you into a froth oh
my god believe they said that if I get
one of those emails he can forget his
story i'm off our bug fixes right now I
feel good the point is there are always
times in our lives when we need to check
car phones right maybe you're working on
a busy project and it's that critical
moment before the project goes live or
maybe just maybe you volunteer for the
emergency services in your spare time
and for that night and that night alone
you are on call and it truly is a matter
of life and death but my argument is
that it's not every night it's not all
the time and yet what do we do as human
beings we drift into that experience we
catch ourselves doing it you'll be sour
home watching Coronation Street and
occasionally very rarely Coronation
Street it's a bit rubbish and what you
do in Coronation Street is a bit rubbish
well typically today you don't get up
and switch it off or find something else
to do you just lean forward and you grab
the nearest digital device on the coffee
table and then you start messing around
on facebook right and at this point you
are neither engaging in Facebook nor
watching the television you wake up 30
minutes later the meerkats are on you
thinking my god what happened there
there was no choice made there was no
positive conscious choice you drifted
into that experience so again we've got
to start to reassert our relationship
with technology but the final coping
mechanism I want to talk to you about is
the one that we really have to focus on
because it's the worst of all of them
and this is about the lie of
multitasking we're taught to be
successful in the 21st century even as a
male of the species I must be able to
multitask I must be able to do more than
one thing I want now the interesting
thing is what we've forgotten is that
multitasking is not a human trait
multitasking is a concept from computer
science that was invented in the mid
50's by a bunch of people in white lab
coats who wanted to get central
processing units to become more
efficient all that happened is we looked
at it with envious eyes and we thought
oh yeah that looks good let's do that
now we've done studies we don't studies
with other people we've looked at other
people study we all agree the average
human being male or female the whole
gender thing is a myth is a third less
efficient when they try and do more than
one thing that wants a third less but it
gets much worse because it takes us time
as human beings to switch between
contexts we wanted to understand that at
Microsoft and when you're an
organization like Microsoft you can do
some pretty interesting things so we ran
a bunch of experiments on our own people
right brilliant and what we found is
that there's this really interesting
chemical and cognitive process that
prevents people from being able to
switch tasks quickly because our brains
are wired on a reward mechanism we're
wired on this hormone called dope
mean every time you do something that
your brain feels contributes towards
your future survival you get a little
hit of this hormone called dopamine and
it's quite nice and the thing about
dopamine is once you get one here like
another thanks very much but the real
issue presents itself in the fact that
our brain thinks that it's more
beneficial for our future survival by
clicking through more email clicking on
more links looking for the next week
then it is going back to the hard work
that we were doing before we got
distracted so when you're in the middle
of doing something creative and you get
distracted that process kicks in and
what basically happens is you finish the
distraction and before you go back to
work the process kicks in this is hey
hang on a minute before you go back to
the hard stuff when you don't check your
email out let's see what's going on on
facebook check the footy scores and we
meander our way back to work the average
time delay between the completion of the
distraction and you're getting back
mentally to where you were before you
were distracted is 23 minutes for every
distraction now think about that add
those two things together on one hand we
have this thing that makes us a third
less efficient and it's compounded by
the fact that every time we get
distracted it introduces a massive time
delay into how we work my question to
you guys is how long do we allow this
insanity to go on before we start to
realize there must be there has to be a
better way for us to work and the
challenge with all of these coping
mechanisms is they combine and I would
argue they leave us in a place where
technology is actually disconnecting us
from ourselves we are losing the ability
to think in a way that is befitting of
human beings never mind the fact that
we're also not getting to the point the
true potential of what technology can
offer but the great news in all of this
is this is happening simply because
we've just got it the wrong way round we
walk around complaining about a world
world of too much information but we
know in our hearts that that information
holds the keys to our future success our
ability to be successful either as an
individual or as an organization
entirely rests on our ability to use
this amazing information that now exists
we just have to start to see it in that
light we have to start to see it as
something that we can do and it starts
here starts with a world of data and
data is really funny right because I'm
one hand date is like a really boring
topic it's just a bunch of numbers and
stuff and long god it's boring
but then the real challenge with data is
we've never really valued it data is
something that we typically generate as
a byproduct of the process that we're
doing it's a byproduct with our business
we run our projects we create our
products we run our advertising
campaigns they generate data at the end
of the project once we've created the
product when we've delivered a campaign
only then do we look back to the data
when we use the data to reflect on what
happened this is not the purpose of data
data is the fuel of our future your
ability to be successful as an
individual or as an organization rests
entirely on your ability to see data as
this sort of entrepreneurial force that
changes what you can do as a human and
changes what you can do as an
organization and we're moving into a
world of lots of data lots and lots of
data and when you have lots of data
interesting things start to happen the
first is when you have access to more
and more data what's interesting is the
answers to the questions you've been
asking yourselves for years start to
fundamentally shift now this is my
favorite example here's his two vehicles
we've got a Toyota Prius and a land
rover defender which of these two
vehicles would you say is better for the
planet more environmentally friendly put
your hand up if you think is the Toyota
Prius put your hand up reading is a
trick question and it's the Land Rover
Defender we end up if you want to be a
management consultant and you know the
answer is well it depends right because
it does depend it depends on how broad
of you you take of the data we take a
narrow view and this is typically what
we do today as organizations and
individuals we look on the little bit of
data we've got let's look at fuel
consumption one of course when you look
at fuel consumption the best of these
two vehicles for the planet is the
Toyota that thing runs on water and
pixie dust hugs trees when you drive by
not like that different drinks diesel
well back in 2008 the Americans took a
different approach to this question they
took us what they call a systemic view
which is basically amassing all of the
data they looked at from the creation of
the components that go to make the
vehicle through to the point at which
the vehicle is thrown on the scrap heap
the best of these two vehicles so the
planet is actually the land rover
defender now why over sixty-seven
percent of every land rover ever made
over the last 60 odd years is still on
the road you cannot break these vehicles
trust me I tried
several times and if you do manage to
break them you can fix them at the
roadside with bubble gum and baling
twine now look the point of this example
is not to advertise Land Rover cars
although if you do have connections and
they're looking for sponsorship
opportunities obviously I'm interested
the realities look what happened to the
question when you had more data the
answer fundamentally changed this is
your job now whatever you're doing in
life your job is to seek out as much
data as you can find you should smother
yourselves in data because when you have
that only then can you take a systemic
view only then can you see the big
picture but you must be careful because
there are massive dangers that happen
when you start to connect data in this
way the data has to be related if it's
not you end up in a very dangerous place
this next example is one of the reasons
why I love the internet because a proper
grown-up academic was so worried about
this problem he dedicated a lot of
research to proving the problem he took
two really really important data sets he
took the changes in the average
temperature of the earth and he
correlated them to the number of pirates
operating in the Indian Ocean and what
you'll see ladies and gentlemen over
time is that as the number of pirates
operating in the Indian Ocean dwindles
the average temperature of the earth
increases yeah so here on the basis of
this evidence I would put it to you
ladies and gentlemen we truly want to
save the planet it's not renewable
energy we need it is neither so learn or
wind farms it is simply more pirate arrr
this is the danger of spurious data
correlation the data has to be related
we have to find a connection otherwise
we end up in this dangerous place but
the real gift of data is yet to come and
this is where the data that we have
access to enables us to move out of a
world of reflective data use into a
world of predictive data use now when I
talk about prediction I'm not talking
about some half-baked down the pub on a
Saturday afternoon who's going to win
the 320th chepstow prediction I'm
talking about properly statistical
significant prediction Microsoft had
been doing this for the last couple of
years we predicted the outcome of the
last football World Cup we got 15 out of
16 games right we did the Scottish
referendum in the UK we've got that
right within two percent of the public
votes we're a consumer company we've
xfactor we've done pop idol and even
highlight of my own personal career the
Eurovision Song Contest oh yes right and
we're getting it right better still
we're making the algorithms that power
that kind of prediction available to
everybody it's just a service that you
call through our cloud service through
as Europe and basically the question I
need to leave you with here is how would
you run your lives run your organization
run your businesses in a world where you
can predict what will happen rather than
reflect on what has happened and you
have to answer that question soon
because the capability for everybody to
do this is just around the corner what's
making this possible is what I like to
call a technological Copernican shift
because like many of you I probably
spend far too long and Wikipedia but a
Copernican shift is basically in 1534
Copernicus he rocks up to his academic
buddies he says you guys have got this
all wrong right it's not the Sun that
goes around the earth it's the earth
that goes round the Sun and in that
instant everything we knew about the
world around is everything we knew about
science got turned on its head we're
about to go through the same experience
again with our relationship with
technology because think about it today
human beings we we evolved around
technology we gravitate around
technology every time you want to use
technology you have to go to it you have
to pick up your phone you sit in front
of your computer you sit in front of
your telly you sit inside your car we're
moving to a world a world of ubiquitous
computing where the technology will
surround us every floor tile every light
bulb every wall every surface every
window will be a device that is
connected and spewing out data about the
world around as the floor tiles well no
not just how many times they've been
stood on but how many times I've stood
on them versus how many times you've
stood on it and if you take to that
world of data that cacophony of data and
you add to that a layer of what we call
ambient intelligence these are
algorithms who work on our behalf to
make center that data you start to get
to some really interesting results now
this stuff is already available it's
already happening most of this is
already in your pockets if you have a
iphone you may be familiar with Siri and
series powered by Microsoft Bing if you
have an Android device you'll be
familiar with Google now if you have a
Windows Phone you'll be familiar or
Windows 10 you'll be familiar with
Cortana these things are all examples of
int intelligent agents who work on our
behalf let me give you our examples talk
about Cortana briefly Cortana knows
where I am because that's where my phone
is crucially she knows where I'm going
to be next not because she's psychic
because she looks in my calendar and
what she'll do is if she sees that the
two locations are different she will
then start to monitor the traffic
outsider and if the traffic builds up
she will tell me I need to leave earlier
than I then I plan for think about that
and extrapolate this up in the future
I'll be able to get an email from the
client basically say Dave we need to
meet with you next week next Tuesday
10am New York City well Cortana knows
where New York is she knows who the
client is she knows which airlines I
like to travel she knows I'm a bit tight
so I don't want some trendy Manhattan
boutique hotel i'm in a Holiday Inn on
the outskirts and at the same time I get
the email from the client Cortana has
already stitched together that
experience she's booked my flight I've
got the hotel I know exactly what's
going on this is a world of ambient
intelligence powered by ubiquitous
computing but we can go a step further
we can start to bring this life a bit
more and what I want to do is to show
you this is a project that Microsoft
Research have created that illustrate
the power of ubiquitous computing and
ambient intelligence you know it's a
research project because it has the
catchy title of situation or interaction
mark free right and this is a world
powered by sensors connected devices and
algorithms interpreting the data from
those devices and i'll let the video
play out and then i'll explain it a
given example how this might play out in
the real world so what you'll see here
in a minute you'll see two people
approaching elevator because this lab
has been equipped with sensors and
cameras not only do I know that two
human beings are approaching the
elevator I also know specifically who
those human beings are I can do facial
recognition now I know who they are it
means I can look in their calendar I can
see that they're both going to meeting
room 5.13 which is on the fifth floor so
i can send the elevator to the fifth
floor they never have to press a button
they just walk into the elevator this is
the technology in action now what I want
you to think about is a much more
different application more real-life
application and to illustrate this or
talk about a hobby of mine that I call a
tube shuffle right you'll have a
different name for this hobby but I
guarantee you you will have experienced
this for yourselves if you ever work in
a big city at some point in that time
you will have engaged in a process i
call the tube shuffle and it's basically
when you're
travelling somewhere in that city and
you know roughly where you're supposed
to be but you don't know specifically
where you're supposed to be i'll give
you my example in our used london right
so I'm traveling to see a customer I've
never seen before I know I'm roughly in
the right place because i'm at the right
tube station but as I emerged from the
tube station I don't know specifically
worms but what do I go from the exit
from the tube stations what do you do in
that situation I will you stuff your
hand in your pocket your type in the
postcode of the office and for the next
five minutes you're engaged in what I
call a tube shuffle right which is you
walking down the street like this right
this way it's this ah no no no no hang
on it's this way no maybe it's this and
because my gaze is down here I'm bumping
into people I'm stepping in dog but all
of this that's happening because the
technology has me sucked in in this
world it's fundamentally different
because as I emerged from the tube
station little spring in my step
whistling a happy tune the first digital
billboard I pass knows it's me knowing
it's me it can serve me an ad that's
contextual to who I am in the persona
that i'm using at that moment in time
and crucially knowing it's me it can put
a little green arrow in the bottom of
the ads well done day the office is just
down here two doors on your left this is
a world of ubiquitous computing and
ambient intelligence now we've got lots
to do to get ready for this there are
lots of issues around privacy there are
lots of issues around how do we build
the infrastructure make this possible
but this is the world that we're going
into what makes this possible is
probably what I would argue is the most
important technology that anybody on the
planet is working on today is the
technology called machine learning some
people call it artificial intelligence
it's not just microsoft we're all at it
facebook google you know we're all
invested in this technology but all it
is is it simply statistical based
pattern recognition how algorithms are
made and i would bet that you will all
be familiar with the first time you ever
became aware of that technology because
i will bet it was when you were typing
in a query to a search engine and before
you'd finish typing the search and you
had finish the sentence for you and if
you were like me or like well that was a
bit weird i'm looking over my shoulder
see who's watching me simply statistical
based pattern recognition all that's
going on is the search engine is saying
based on the characters that you've just
typed in and against the billions of
other queries that have been typed into
me today the statistical probability of
you going on to complete the sentence
like this 99 percent so I'm going to
suggest that as the first option that
basic ability to spot patterns in lots
and lots of data enables us to build the
most incredible services services that
will not just change how we interact
with technology but will change how we
interact with each other I would argue
in the fullness of time they will also
change and challenge what we think it
means to be human this is my favorite
example of this this is a technology
that is already available today you can
try it for yourselves it's in public
beta and it's using the power of machine
learning to deliver real-time speech to
speech language translation now we
demonstrated this a couple of years ago
we had a gentleman speaking German
connected to a lady who spoke English
via Skype it's powered by being
gentlemen speaks German lady his English
lady speaks English gentleman his German
real-time no human being involved just
some algorithms doing some pretty smart
stuff spotting patterns in lots and lots
of data and need you to think about the
transformation capability of this kind
of stuff because it changes our world I
think about it all the time I think
about this in the context of my 10 year
old son on the basis of this technology
do I bother to get my son to learn a
foreign language of school because the
reality is by the time here does his
world of work it will be a redundant
skill I get that provocative I get there
are lots of reasons why we learn foreign
languages at school and of course my son
he'll learn one or two languages just
like everybody else but as a result of
this technology when he emerges from his
education he will be able to speak
another hundred and fifty two languages
fluently he will be able to travel the
world communicate with locals as if he
were a local which will fundamentally
change his cultural experience in life
this is the kind of power that machine
learning is offering our society and we
have to get ready for it if you want to
understand how the algorithms work this
is a lovely example it comes from some
research from Cambridge University that
basically says if you speak English as
long as I keep the first and last
characters of the word in the right
place I can mix up all the other
characters i can even misspell the words
and you'll still be able to read that so
true can you read your text there are
two reasons why i love this example
right the first is because it's
completely contradictory to the way that
we're taught language at school because
when we're at school we thought that
language is logical we're taught that
language follows rules we're taught
things like i before E except
to see what they don't teach us is that
there are nine hundred and twenty three
exceptions to the eye before there are
more exceptions to the i before e rule
then there are two the bloody rule
itself language isn't logical it doesn't
follow rules it follows patterns and we
innately know this as human beings
because from the day we learn to read
until the day we die we create curate
and tend to our own personal pattern of
language every time you read something
you are making your personal pattern of
language slightly better now the second
reason i love this example is it also
shows you the limitation of machine
learning because the algorithms are only
as good as the patterns that they're
provided with what do you think happens
when i show this slide is someone who's
just beginning to learn to speak english
or if i turn it to my son I don't know
maybe six years ago when he was just
forming his own language skills at that
point those individuals haven't
established enough of the Pat this is
nonsense and they can't read it and this
slide this example is the reason why for
the foreseeable future for the next
decade or so the algorithms will not
take our jobs the robots will not
apprised because somebody has to create
the patterns and that somebody is all of
us we have to create the patterns we
have to connect them but in order to get
the algorithms to do what they need to
do so what can you do with all this
stuff well there are first few things
that we've got to think about we want to
get our relationship with technology
right if we want to get the true
potential of what technology offers a
modern society we got to do a few things
the first thing is we've got to
recognize that we have all become
ensnared by technology technology in the
way we use it is the thing that
constrains us but then we have to
realize that the real issue about that
ensnare month has got nothing to do with
the technology itself it's got
everything to do with what my dad calls
the interface between the keyboard and
the chair us the fact that you have too
much email has got nothing to do with
the email system it's the people that
send it that's the problem right and
this is the issues we have to remember
that we're the people who push the
buttons now that we understand that
technology is ensnared us I would argue
it's time for us to reinvent
productivity we have to think
differently about productivity in a
digital society because what we've
forgotten in our current definition of
productivity is that it is not about it
Chansey it's about effectiveness you can
be as efficient as you like but if the
services you deliver are not loved by
your customers or don't fulfill the
objective I would argue while you're
doing them at all let me give you an
example if I'm a nurse right I can be
the most efficient nurse in the NHS I
can deliver more I could administer more
injections than any other nurse on the
ward I would argue though in doing that
my quality of patient care is probably
not as high as it should be and we've
seen this example right around us so
what we've got to do instead of thinking
about the process of work we've got to
start focusing on the outcome of what
you do and this is where we come in this
is when Microsoft comes in because this
is our job and you can belittle this if
you want somebody's one of these trike
mission statements from a big American
software company we want to empower
everybody to achieve more I would argue
for the last 40 years this has been at
the heart of what Microsoft's trying to
do we want to create a platform that
enables people to achieve more in their
lives whatever you choose to do whether
it's a computer scientist or not is
actually irrelevant I just want to make
sure I don't care who you are and ok
what vocation you choose I want to make
sure that technology can be used or you
can use technology in your eyes to
deliver a positive outcome that's why we
exist we're building the platforms that
make that possible and the best bit is
because we've been doing this for two
years because we have incredible teens
like the ones that Microsoft Research we
get a little glimpse into the future
before many other people we see the
things that are coming and based on what
we know are coming we know that we've
gotta work to do to help people get
ready for that work in that world as
it's coming towards us to give an
example of that world I need to take you
to another team inside our organization
who are true envision errs and what they
do their job is to create a tangible
vision of the future and on the surface
this is predominantly science fiction
right they create these videos that are
predominantly they're made up they're
very slick they're done by the team who
used to work at Industrial Light &amp;amp; Magic
so lovely special effects but I want you
to remember when I play this video just
one thing the guys who put this video
together they have one single design
premise is that they're not allowed to
show a technological concept in this
video unless it already exists
in our labs so what you may not see
products exactly like this the
functional principle that they will
offer us humans already exists today so
I'll run the video and then let's talk
about that
you
you
so again I need to remind you that
you're not going to see products that
look exactly like that but the
functional principle being offered
already exists today this is the world
that we have to prepare for we have
amazing facilities in our labs we've
created and you can imagine how much i
love this right we've created a working
replica of the Star Trek holodeck I can
walk into a room not only in the room we
can figure around me I can project
objects in three dimensions that without
a dorky headset I can pick up and
interact with this stuff is coming and
we have to get ready but if we're still
working like Victorians we're never ever
going to get to the potential it offers
so how do we do that well actually is a
really simple thing if we want to
deliver transformational experiences to
the people we care about we've got to do
two things number one we have to
establish a culture of transformational
people every single person in the
organization needs to feel like they can
make a difference they need to be
empowered to question to challenge to
think to come up with new ideas and if
you're lucky enough to have that culture
then you have to understand that those
people will only ever be successful if
they have access to the tools that
enable them to work in transformational
ways you will not be I promise you no
matter how hard you try you're never
ever going to be transformational over
email right not even as an attachment
right it's just not going to happen so
when you've got the people working in
the right place then you've got to start
focusing on the outcome of what you do
rather than the process of what you do
and it's funny because as I was coming
here this afternoon as i was walking
just outside the station i saw a bloke
with the hive is coat on he's walking
down the middle of the road he's
dropping little spots of white paper
white pets up there white powder in the
middle of the road and I woke up what do
you what are you doing and he looked at
me as it's all right I'm putting down
elephant powder elephant powder what are
you doing that for he looked at me keeps
the elephants away but there aren't any
elephants in Cambridge and he turned to
move is it yeah I know it's good stuff
in it right I'm here all week right and
the thing is our organizations are
filled with elephant powder it's the
stuff you do that is completely
irrelevant or redundant in a modern
digital society our job now is to seek
out that elephant powder and to get rid
of it to find it in our organizations
find it in the process
the things we do in the way we live our
lives and eradicate it because it's
holding us back it's the thing that's
stopping us from being successful we
have to think differently and this is
really hard for human beings because we
have to think very differently about the
future as humans what we tend to do is
we assume that the future is a straight
line and it's a straight line
extrapolated from where we are today
from where we used to be in the past but
the future is never a straight line it
bounces around like a pinball and the
problem is when we think the futures of
a straight line it constrains our
thinking I'll give you an example from
the UK at where this thinking is being
constrained right now and it's in a
world of autonomous vehicles now don't
get me wrong autonomous vehicles are
incredible feats of technology there's
amazing technology goes into them but
broadly speaking it's an industry who is
locked into thinking that the futures
not really going to change because when
you start to look at the numbers you
start to realize that it won't be until
2040 that fifty percent of all miles
driven will be driven autonomously that
number doesn't hit a hundred percent
until we get to 2070 do you seriously
want to tell me that by the time we get
to 2070 we will still think the best way
to transport human beings around the
local environment is inside at in
robotic box that cannot be the case
because if Amazon is preparing to
deliver packages to my house using the
drug am I not albeit a bigger and
significantly heavier package but be the
automotive guys they can't see that
because they're locked into this
thinking but there are other problems
with this thinking regulation
legislation is locked into this kind of
thinking we're lucky if the regulator's
regulate for today's world typically
they're regulating for yesterday's world
Jordan okay amount of time okay give me
two minutes and then I'll be right with
you John he's tough right Johnny know
what the first of all that the UK's past
with the provision of autonomous
vehicles on UK highways is that there
must be at all times a human being
inside the vehicle I don't know let's
call them the driver right whose job it
is to monitor the controls the real
problem is thinking however is the
opportunity cost of that thinking
because for every moment and automotive
engineer is thinking about the future of
Transportation being this nobody's
thinking about these things or more
importantly nobody's actually thinking
about this which is what we all want so
I have two requests as human beings I
need you to do too
number one I need you to be mindful
about what you're doing and I'm not
talking about the West Coast us
definition of mindfulness where it's
about meditation and Zen Buddhism if you
want to do that up to you right I want
you to think about the british version
of mindfulness which is about just being
pragmatic so if you're the sort of
person who sits in a meeting with your
laptop open taking notes oh you're in
the pub or the cafe with your friends
and family checking out your Facebook
stop that technology offers you nothing
at that moment in your life you have to
as a human being make a very simple
choice at any moment in time can
technology help what I'm doing right now
yes or no if the answers yes fantastic
fill your boots engage if the answer's
no turn it off put it down leave it
alone secondly I need you to think about
creativity we will get nowhere in this
society if we squeeze out all of the
time or the capability for us to be
creative I would argue that we've lost
space for creativity we've lost the
mental space who have lost the physical
space we have to claw that back create
some time in your day where you can just
think create some time when you can be
bored because that's when you're a most
creative create a physical space where
you can go to do work without being
disturbed and I'll leave you with this
this one final thing that puts
technology into perspective and it's
from a quote from a wonderful guy called
Pablo Picasso fantastic quote in the
mid-60s is being interviewed by an arts
magazine basically asking him what do
you think about computers today why
they're asking Pablo Picasso this I'll
never know but the genius of his answer
is that even though computers today are
fundamentally different to the computers
he had back in the mid-60s his answer
was perfect because his answer was this
Computers Computers are useless all they
can give me answers what I need is
something that can ask the right
questions and ladies and gentlemen that
something is you that's your job
whatever you're doing if you can be
crisp about the question that you need
to answer if you understand the outcome
the objective of what you need to do we
all know the technology will make short
work of that so be crisp about the
question get the technology in the right
place remember that you're pushing the
buttons if you do that I guarantee you
then and only then will we as human
beings be able to rise up and achieve
all of the potential the technology
offers our society ladies and gentlemen
thank you very much thanks John
thank you very much and Dave for that
stirring and beautifully delivered
sermon wii u injunction at the very end
was was 22 to invite people to ask sharp
questions okay we have a few minutes and
we have we can take some sharp questions
who wants to go first so Cambridge has
some very big problems what can
Microsoft Research day to crack them
cycles go missing all the time in the
city and still it's not a standard thing
for bikes to have gps tracking in I know
that there will be a devices coming soon
but it's you know some things in
technology is just too slow we know that
you could have that kind of technology
cheaply and in every bike and they would
smash the thieves where it hurts why is
it not here um why do you saying I
should work harder it's basically there
um well i think is it there's a
different way to look at this one of the
things i think you'll see happen and
this is really down to a world of
artificial intelligence the machine
learning is we're already in a place now
where we can start to predict crimes
before they happen so we've got police
forces in the UK actually in cambridge
here we've also got police forces in
places like New York City who use
artificial intelligence based on the
data that they've generated over the
last few decades to be able to predict
the crimes before they happen so in the
case of your bike theft ide know that
this is a certain hotspot I could send a
squad car out there at a certain time to
prevent that from occurring they're the
things that we can affect we can create
a platform that enables other companies
to generate the GPS devices or whatever
in this instance I think for us what I'd
rather see is something that would
resolve Cambridge is traffic flow God
you know the benefit to the world and
that would just be wonderful
in the world who in visit we're always
trapped and walls can spot becoming have
the opt-out I'm all for it yeah well it
was yes so we need to do a few things
right so first of all we need to rebuild
trust right and Trust doesn't exist in
multiple levels today we don't trust big
companies like Microsoft and Google we
don't trust the government we don't rust
the health service we don't trust the
media we don't trust anybody and and we
kind of got ourselves to blame for that
so what we need to do in this kind of
world first of all we need to be open
and transparent so we need people when
we start talking about data exchange I
need to be really if you give me a data
here's what's going to happen see that
guy over there is an advertiser and I'm
going to give him that data and you're
going to see great adverts the second
thing I have to do is I have to make it
really really trying to explicit about
the value you'll get as a result I can't
me that you see bad advert and then the
final thing I need is to do you can
decide you decide whether you want to be
part of this or not if I guess the
question really how do you set it also
this is fundamentally build in from the
start so I see a lot of people thinking
about how to make this technology work
what's the barest overcome we'll have to
think about privacy only opt out of a
world with the Internet of Things how do
you opt out of it well there's a lot you
can write there's no opting out of this
there are ways and mate so let me give
you an example of something that's
happened with microsoft research in this
building actually or this part of the
organization we uncovered a problem in
privacy called differential privacy
which is I can take two big data sets
both anonymized and I can use some
pretty smart math studion onam eyes the
data because we know that principle I
can now start to do things about it in
fact a team here has been working with
the utility companies around the world
to make sure when they deliver your
meter that enables them to micromanage
what consumption you are but they don't
also betray your privacy because those
smart meters betray what time you get up
when you're at home when you should be
at work so it's a cat-and-mouse game
then I'm really I guess I want to
respond to your point with is this is a
conversation that our entire society has
to get involved in and it can't be down
to governments and it can't be down to
tech companies like Microsoft and Google
we all have a part to play but again the
part of this is that we need
spell out what's on offer we need to
show you that what I'm offering you in
this world is not a world of rubbish
advertising this is not a world of more
spam it should be a world of Greater
service and if we understand that then
we can build a principle that keeps the
people say and I think we're at a
pivotal moment moment in our society
we've got things from the extremes of
Edward Snowden to what's going on with
Apple and the FBI to all of the stuff we
know going this is a really really
difficult time because it's the real
pinnacle of this stuff coming together
and we've got to figure out together as
soon as I think that's the attitude
might persuade the benefits know people
want to opt out so don't worry about it
just keep hammering the benefits and
Isaac I let me let me just counter that
quick sorry I saw you should know you
talked about this connection from people
locally and then the examples coming out
of the tube and the am here technology
surely coming out with children asking a
human being hi where's this building
there are two problems for that
statement right number one I'm a bloke I
ain't asking nobody for directions right
let's just get that straight number two
how do I know I had this today coming
sensations when he was trying to park
today do you know where is a cop don't
know not from round here and so there is
this part where I as a human we wanted
so if we're not taking that choice away
from you but actually building a service
that enables you to do that we should
also this is the sort of dichotomy faced
with technology is I want to free your
time up so you can go and have more
human interaction I don't want to free
your time up so you can go and do more
email but you have to choose to do that
as a human being and that's the magic
right because this is where we have to
do is you have to remind human beings
that they can engage with each other
that they can ask questions and that's
the piece that in all of this we've got
to get to is to balance the humans and
technology out one more when will
include a skin the right questions that
is a lovely lovely question what you're
talking about so is what some people
call the singularity so this is when the
machines they create their own patterns
they have become sentient I did some
anecdotal research for this for the for
the book and basically I looked at all
of the estimates that people from
science fiction writers to be from the
technology industry to come up with
if the average date is 2040 so there are
lots of people are going to think that
happened sooner lots of people going to
happen it later microsoft also nice
mario's who are involved in a project
called the Hundred Years Foundation
which is a hundred year project looking
at the challenges that a I'm a place to
our society so you know it's an
impossible question to answer I think
personally we're decades away from it
being at that point but some people
would say maybe soon I some people say
later elephants they could be they could
be okay we have to stop at their I'm
afraid I have a feeling that we could
have gone on for another 40 minutes um
thank you very much for that very
elegant presentation I was very moved by
one thing you said which was that one of
our coping strategies is multitasking
okay and and we're not very good at it
that's my problem and I once said to one
of my techie friends my problem is that
I have I'm a multitasker with the wrong
algorithm and my engineering friend said
to me don't worry we can have you
reflashed gentlemen let's thank him for
it and thank you John thank you thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
