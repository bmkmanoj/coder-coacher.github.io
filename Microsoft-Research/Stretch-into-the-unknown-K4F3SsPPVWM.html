if you can't take risks Europe you're
not gonna be useful okay it's engineers
I'm an engineer and if somebody says
that was a nice bridge you designed I
really like it
design me another one exactly like the
first no changes at all you don't need
me for that you know you just follow the
blueprints what what engineers do is
they take what's already been done and
they stretch it they add something to it
they make it cheaper or faster or better
or you know they put it in a more
difficult location whatever it is every
time you do that you're you're into the
unknown you're you know by definition
you're in some area of design space that
no one's been before and so it's someone
has to make the intelligent decisions as
to how much risk to take because he the
way I always looked at it at Intel was
if you don't if you're not aggressive
enough and your competition does a
better job than you they're gonna beat
you but if you're too aggressive you
beat yourself you take on so much
complexity you can't do it independent
of whether they can beat you or not so
you've got to find that sweet spot and
it's only experience that teaches you
where it might be even then you could
get it wrong but but I think that's the
you know it's it's having failed as what
teaches you where the success might lie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
