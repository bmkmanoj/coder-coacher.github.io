you
this first question is from himanshu
singh to two people in the audience that
are either of indian origin or have
worked with people from india which is
pretty much all peoples in India there
are so many engineers in computer
science and there haven't been sort of
like big successes like say Google or
Microsoft that have come out of India in
the past what are the things that you
think need to change in order to create
large big successes at that scale come
out of India actually this trend will
change and in fact you know if you look
at the way Indian Industry focus is
shifting it was it is actually shifting
from the you know i'm going to spoke
speak only about the tech industry so
because of this i don't know much about
focus it's shifting focus from IT
services sector which is primarily based
on leveraging you know human capacity or
ability to be smart programmers and do
it at a low cost to a case where now
either is a huge startup scene you must
have read articles recently about the
amount of venture fund that's going into
cities like bangalore granted many f it
is not exactly for technology innovation
but there is enough of that i think
there are a new generation of companies
that are looking at new market
opportunities very much a domestic
market not export oriented services I
think this is where the trend will
change and it's entirely up you and when
you think about your future rather than
thinking about going and working in a
big you know IT services company like
you know the major ones which I think
will give you great jobs and interesting
opportunities think about how you can go
out there and in the startup scene how
you can now go out there and do solve a
problem or work on something that's more
innovation oriented less services
oriented this is a tendency I think that
you will see grow my prediction is
within the decade we will see you know
more than 100 billion dollar worth
Indian companies that are in the IT
sector
so following on that in terms of
creating new technical capabilities
there are a couple of questions from
himanshu singh our JV and sort of seeing
that all pu prefers already they're all
sort of talk about this whole buzz of
wearable computing smart glasses some
have failed somewhere still in progress
watches drones all these things what are
some of the aspects given your your long
exposure to how things have changed from
vacuum cubes all the way to here what
are some of your thoughts on what
aspects need to change in order to turn
these into the next next big thing that
will really impact Society in a positive
way people basically is this on ok
wearable computers should become
invisible computers they should not be
intrusive namely if I'm wearing a camera
on my you know a pendant or glasses or
something people I'm talking to will be
nervous they'll wonder why you're taping
everything that you say so I think if
they've been visible it turns out you
should be nervous now because in
bangalore every street corner has a
camera so you have anywhere there that
your picture is being taken so it's not
a big deal if i'm taking a picture of
you while i'm talking like my friend
Gordon Bell has been trying to do in
with an experiment but people are in
general not very comfortable though
something so I think we need to design
invisible variable systems if if they're
there you know if if you can't quite do
that how many of you seen the movie her
h er if you haven't it's our available
on the on the web you can download it
and watch it it's it's bootleg and so
you might be you might be doing
something illegal but
you know that's what what happens in
India and China anyway so so but if that
what that says is it probably hasn't
been released yet even it has been
released here most people think it's an
early movie so you don't want to see it
has a very whole set of lessons and how
average people you know might actually
use these things that you know this guy
has a camera the smart phone in his
pocket except we made this pocket short
enough so the postpone is sticking out
the camera is looking at you and so
there are all kinds of ways these things
will happen so the venerable computers
is where it's going to be where they're
variable invisible or and on your
clothes or whatever that's the secondary
issue second the most important thing is
what you signed that in the movie if you
think of people and agents helping you
to do your job so you need to think in
terms of how will all they interact how
will they work what will they do
ultimately everything will be
specialized but somehow as with the
specialized agents you create a
ecosystem like the white house or CMO
here are p.m. on the day and they do the
work so that's my view of wearable
computers I'm just going to add that one
more thing that has to happen is that
the installation and configuration and
management and use of these systems has
to be just as transparent and invisible
as the system's themselves these days
you know I have like most of you a
number of digital control systems in my
house but I'm at best I'm the only
person who can deal with it if something
goes wrong and at worst I can't deal
with it either and you know now that
it's my music system and my thermostat
and a variety of other things you know
I'm in some sense a full-time sissa
person at my home and this has got to
stop
and you know you don't want to be using
a stylus or a keyboard you want to be
communicating with your with your
systems in ways that involve voice or
gestures or in the future honestly brain
to computer communication which is going
to happen sooner than any of us think so
this this notion of invisibility is not
just the things physically fade into
your environment but they have to
operationally fade into your environment
as well just be something that's there
and that you don't have to think about
as opposed to rebooting and updating and
all of the stuff we deal with the day so
there are plenty of opportunities to
make things better because they're
plenty bad right now so let me just
really quickly you can add so this great
work that's going on you heard from Raj
you know he's the father in some sense
of the eye and the kind of things he did
ed Jennifer Chris they all do tremendous
work in things like machine learning in
AI and they have this concept of what
the computer does let me tell you what I
do what I do is the plumbing right so I
sort of work on systems i try to the the
thing that Raj was complaining about
that the screen goes like my job is to
make sure that doesn't go that fast
right so I think if you look at Google
glass which was a nice attempt I think
part of the reason it failed is of
course it was the you I was sort of
messed up in wearing it invasive but
more than that it also didn't provide
enough functionality because we actually
are not there we are not there in terms
of the energy consumption we are not
there in terms of connectivity we are
not there in terms of processing in
being able to provide it so I think
there's a lot of work still left and
many years actually left of work to do
to get to the point where we can use all
these great algorithms that are
available in in computer science and you
know cloud computing for example to be
able to bring it to hand hills and
variables and things like that and once
we get there these things will light up
and when they light up then they will
evolve and get better because we will as
we try them out we will learn what works
what doesn't work and will iterate over
there but i think the system's prime
frankly is just not there
that's why I want to not disagree but I
want to kind of present a different
perspective let us say we had a perfect
google glass and it didn't have any
battery problems it didn't have any
memory problem everything was perfect I
still don't want the distraction of
something blaring into my all the time
of something that it thinks is important
and when I want some something to be
displayed I wants to press it on the
wall maybe my phone will become the
projector that would be just as good
when I want to see it it must be me I am
in charge not the google glass that is
the difference that's fine is another
angle to all this which is a privacy
angle in fact so actually that's a great
leading to the next question but I just
want to say one thing which is that
Victor said he does the plumbing and I
don't want you guys out there to think
oh I want to do this theory I don't want
to do the plumbing without real deep
innovative changes in what Victor called
the plumbing we are never going to
realize the promise of all this theory
the promise of all this data science the
systems that we have today are not
properly engineered for the promise of
the movie her and so those of you who
are more hands-on really need to be
working very much with the theorists to
understand how the plumbing as Victor
said okay that is that is probably the
most important piece of the puzzle today
so don't let him put himself or the
whole field down okay right so do
continue on Victor spun so there's a
question from Gotham JM and he touches
on many of the things that you guys
already mentioned that with this sort of
invisible computing
there are lots of people that are not
comfortable with it their privacy their
security issues about all the data
that's been collected so what can you
guys talk about sort of the next big
grand challenges in this space of
security and privacy and so i'll start
with victor than free rom and then
perhaps even professor roger after i
since i haven't had a few seconds to
think about it i will just go with my
last statement which i think part of the
issue is his privacy is a huge issue so
let me take 30 seconds to tell you some
of the things that I'm really excited
about right now that I'm working on I
mean besides I do work on connectivity I
work on enabling more and more people
are to have access to all the
information so bandwidth delay energy
all this is good but what has happened
is as as we try to push the connectivity
paradigm deeply we have sort of realized
that that we need applications that will
compel people to to use them so one of
the areas that I have started to work on
is using vision algorithms to believe in
and this we started doing this before
all the terrorism and things happen
which is to build wireless surveillance
systems and as we build these wireless
and the idea they're being that as was
pointed out bangalore has camera so most
cities in the world now have more and
more cameras i just came from London
we've got you know thousands of cameras
on the city of Paris says it as well but
they're all wired and they need power so
my challenge is to sort of make them so
that there is no wiring there and so now
the idea is to put computes right at the
camera to decide what image is
interesting enough to push back into the
infrastructure versus not so that you're
not constantly streaming because you
just don't have enough bandwidth now
even as I do the system and I look at
all the vision what vision people have
done and what I can apply and how I can
use my systems I constantly come up with
this whole notion of privacy because now
I'm taking images or you know the system
saying images pictures of people and
people don't like it and so how do you
balance the fact that you're trying to
protect and you're trying to do
something good and versus you know
engaging in creating the 1984 scenario
where you're sort of you know
I know where you are I can figure out we
went I mean you know what you're I don't
go into things but bad things you do so
so I think technology has a role to play
and we have to think through these
policy issues regulation issues privacy
issues quite deeply to be able to enable
them to the point where they are useful
to us and but not cause problems for us
later on in life and I think that is a
huge challenge for us and I don't think
we really know how to solve that one yet
let me add a couple of things about
privacy and security both are topics
that I've been working on for the past
few years now both in the context of
more sort of data centers and sort of
the new kinds of software the people are
building in terms of privacy and I I had
a good fortune of working at psychic who
is a real expert in privacy himself so
you should find him you might know that
you know all online services you know be
it facebook being Google they all
collect your information and if you go
look at the fine print in those web
pages they offer contracts on what they
do with your data and what they don't do
with your data and if you think about
the programmers that work for these
companies that like these programs and
wonder whether these programs really
respect those contracts that these
companies want to respect it's a very
difficult thing to do and the reason why
it's very difficult to do is that it's
really hard to write programs that do
what you want them to do because
programs get very complicated and it's
very hard to ensure that you know if
maybe if two smart people work on
something you know you can have some
confidence if you have 500 people are
thousand people building a system it's
really hard to ensure that the system
that's what you want so you can actually
use systematic techniques to actually
check whether data that these companies
collect really conforms to policy and
that's that's very interesting problem
another problem that's again you know it
came back to verification for me is that
the way you sort of think about trust in
these kinds of systems is also
very very different right when you look
at your laptop or your desktop right the
way you keep that machine secure is that
you don't download in all kinds of you
know software in it you put a virus
checker in it and you know you always
know download updates and keep it
updated and so on and you will trust
ground up and then you sort of protect
your system you know using a firewall
and all of those kinds of things and
then your system is secure good thing
I'm even that is not perfect but that's
how you think about it right but when
you think about the cloud you want to
run your cord on somebody else's system
and you really don't want to trust that
system but you still want to have trust
that the code that you run that's what
you want and and and people don't you
know are not spying on you people are
not stealing your secrets and it's an
extremely fascinating problem so if you
have you know that's probably I've been
thinking about for the past couple of
years and I know I I the solution is too
long for me to describe but it's very
interesting thing to do right how do you
get trust by running code on somebody
system without passing their system you
have got it's very interesting call okay
emphasizing quickly something that uh
sorry victim in me and then i would
expect jennifer actually to say maybe
she was about to say it and that is
something important about security and
privacy is these are areas where there
are no solutions that are purely
technological right so its a mix of
technological legal economic
sociological and if you're missing any
of those components you're not going to
come up with a workable solution and so
it's one of the great things about this
field that is the opportunity to
interact with people in other fields to
come up with solutions that really meet
people's needs that's exactly what i was
going to say but he did it when more
eloquently i think chris wants to say
one thing I just don't say one thing
very very quickly because there's a
little counter point so um privacy is
very important but we we need a balanced
because an extreme view simply locks
down everybody's data is sort of extreme
privacy viewpoint and the point I simply
want to make is a bit of a machine
learning perspective and
is that there are benefits to making
data available i give you a specific
example for the last few years in
microsoft research we've been
collaborating with University of
Manchester to try to understand the
factors which influence the development
of asthma in children and the only
reason that we're able to do that
research is because 2,000 parents have
agreed that data from their children DNA
data environmental data and so on is
made available to this study so they've
agreed on behalf of their children to
forego privacy of a certain kind under
certain controlled conditions in order
to make that data available for the
benefit of society and I think we're
just scratching the surface i think if
we look at the data from millions of
people including genetic information
including environmental information
disease information if we can do that
while preserving appropriate privacy's
then there can be also enormous societal
benefit so I think we have to be wary of
positioning ourselves at one end of the
spectrum we need to find the correct
balance so right so changing crack the
question for you prafulla laska it's
convenient that well two people one who
didn't read the name had exactly
complementary quit what would be one
little about MOOCs what would be one
aspect that you think work fantastic and
one aspect everything needs the most
work when it comes to MOOCs it moves are
massively online coursework so right so
this is massively online open courses
and I really believe they are
transformational so when I think about
the benefits it's just in time learning
of a great depth right you have access
to the best courses from the best
instructors around the world when you
want it when you're ready for it and I
think that the the that's up just a
really a revolutionary capability and it
brings this level of instruction to
people who for reasons of geography or
finance or something like that wouldn't
otherwise have access many aspects of
MOOCs reinforce things about education
that we've known for a long time but
don't practice in our classrooms okay
and
that is that me standing up at the front
of the room and talking for 50 minutes
is not a very good way for me to teacher
for people to learn the notion that you
have small snippets with with
interaction after those snippets that
helps you understand whether you've
mastered the material that you can
individualize instruction and patterns
through curricula for individuals all of
this is great here's my my two big
concerns about it one is that there are
things that I think so far we don't know
how to translate into this scalable
world part of what makes our students
desirable to companies like Microsoft is
that they have a lot of experience
working in teams with mentoring and sort
of learning to collaborate and learning
to design and build and debug
large-scale systems and this is
something that I think we haven't yet
figured out how to put online that is
how do we create the people who are
really capable of designing and building
novel systems and teams the other thing
is there are in the US and around the
world huge disparities in education and
I think some of these will be reduced
through MOOCs that is education will be
available in parts of the world where
it's not education where it's not
available now part of us going to get
worse all right that is in the US for
example MOOCs are I think great for
students who are extremely well
motivated and lack access in the US the
problem is less lack of access and I
think more lack of preparation and
motivation in the sort of home life that
makes you a good student and MOOCs are
going to help with that I know we're out
of time but I love MOOCs right don't get
me wrong but I'm drowning in information
I don't have time so for every course
that is there I would like a one-day
version and a one-week version and a
full semester versions
yeah so I I want to put in a quick plug
in the afternoon after lunch we actually
have a talk which is very related to
this question it's called mech massively
empowered classroom so please come and
hear what we are doing to make learning
online learning more accessible and more
effective in Indian and one last
question in the remaining minus one
minute and this is this is 2h undo
what's the one next big thing MSR has
planned for India and whom are they
focusing on ah that's actually two
questions let me deal with the focus
there's an old saying in computer
science that you don't build a bridge by
looking at the guys who are swimming
across the river so targeting is a
little dangerous but let me take this
time to tell you how we actually do
projects in microsoft india the best
thing we have the greatest asset we have
are our people so we hire the very best
minds we can find and we let them do
curiosity based research so it's not
about directing research it's about
directing getting the right talent on
board so what is the next big thing come
I don't know if I did you know I would
not be here perhaps you know I might Big
Bill Gates next time that's not how
research is done we pursue ideas based
on our best guest on what would be
important and some of them plan out some
of them don't pan out but we
reinvigorate ourselves and try more so I
don't really have a question answer to
your question directly are we targeting
people yes absolutely we are targeting
every user of a computer that is what we
do be also talking about targeting
people who don't have access to
computers like many of us do we target
societal projects that have a societal
impact we target projects that can have
a significant bearing on on life in
India and in other parts of the world so
I actually want to follow up to chandu's
comment which is rather than looking at
us or emisora whatever
for the next big thing is an opportunity
if you you know focus on research learn
the subject and become an expert you
could be the inventing the next big
thing so i would rather encourage you to
do that then be looking for the answer
from us and that's really sort of being
a research I think that's a perfect note
to end this Q&amp;amp;A session on thank you so
much for the family
each year microsoft research helps
