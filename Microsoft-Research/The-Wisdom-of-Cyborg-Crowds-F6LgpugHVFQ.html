you
hello welcome everyone my name is I'm
Desmond Bryant Mendez and I'm a
researcher infuse and he's my flat
pleasure to into this game home who is
the director of the Pacific social
architecture for prison chillin but I
also met him at this conference to
rockville conn fuccillo which is an
awesome conference of memes intervention
time so I'm gonna let them enjoy himself
and because cyborg crowds great thank
you hello everybody so good afternoon
very excite to be here and I talk today
is entitled the wisdom of cyborgs crowds
and it's basically a retrospective look
at crowd behavior online and I want to
pose what's a simple problem but I think
a complex problem which is to what
extent can we augment enhance crowd
behavior using automated systems and so
to talk roughly in three parts so the
first part i'm going to give what's
basically like an intellectual history
of the online crowd circa kind of 2005
to the president right so from ancient
history to the present in the second
part gonna talk about some experiments
that myself and a couple collaborators
have worked on and sort of building what
we call cyborg crowds using large swarms
of bots that try to change social
behavior online and I'll go into a
little bit more of that a little bit
later and the final part is I going to
talk about the results of that research
and kind of where we're all going with
it and what the implications of it might
be so I figured I have it set right now
to go for about 45 minutes but with 15
minutes for questions but if you guys
have any questions because we're kind of
a small group feel futur just raise a
hand i'm happy to pause and just go from
there so first to give you a little
background about myself so i used to
come from the world of research so for a
number of years as a researcher of the
Berkman Center for Internet Society
working in sort of collaboration and
specifically kind of design levers and
collaborations so how do reputation
systems profile pictures all that kind
of stuff work to increase kind of
altruistic behavior on websites the
research question simply stated was how
do you generate another Wikipedia right
the question after research I ended up
kind of doing my own project so i'm the
co-founder of an organization called the
awesome foundation for the Arts and
Sciences which is basically a group of
distributed chapters around the world
that contribute thousand-dollar grants
to projects that forward awesomeness in
the universe and so we found that in
boston but we're all over the place now
mongolia and San Paolo and it's sort of
grown to its own thing
much of the work that will talk about
today is from a organization that
address mentioned called the Pacific
social architecting corporation which is
a kind of a scary name but it's
essentially just three nerds hanging out
in a living room working on projects and
and much of the bot stuff that will talk
about is from there today so I heard
there was some interest in hearing more
about rafle cons so I've kind of
restructured the talk actually to begin
with roffle con so you can hear a little
bit more about what that was so Ralph
akan was a conference that we started in
2008 and the idea was what if we bring
together everybody who is momentarily
famous on the Internet to talk about
funny cats memes communities online
essentially and we actually didn't
intend to start a conference originally
we saw this XKCD comic that you may have
remembered from 2006-2007 it basically
is like we're counting a dream and
there's these sort of mysterious
coordinates and times and when you
looked at the coordinates in the time it
turned out to be a park in somerville
massachusetts where i was living at the
time we said okay well let's just go and
and check it out and what was amazing is
we went and on the day of there's
hundreds and hundreds of people there
right we met I remember I remember of us
is actually that we met a family that
flew in from Russia just to meet randall
Munroe who's the kind of creator of the
webcomic which is which is insane
records just quite a far distance away
and so we got to thinking like okay if
one person can do this right and random
eros not famous by any typical measure
if you saw him on the street you
wouldn't really recognize him what
happened we brought all of those types
of people together so we basically
together spreadsheet writing down
everyone that we thought was cool on the
internet we just started inviting people
and so the first guy that we got was a
guy named Ron got Jay Maynard who became
popular in 2004 because of his sort of
skin tight Tron suit and we sort of
widely mocked online and we just ended
up having more more people and
eventually we ended up with a conference
of about 2,000 at MIT from people from
all over the place some of those people
were just kind of traditional internet
celebrities right so Tron guy of course
double rainbow if you guys remember that
video at all scumbag Steve David after
dentist other people kind of like the
tuts the subject of memes online we also
brought people who kind of created
platforms as well so Christopher pool
who started 4chan as well as the
creators of Reddit and imager and a
bunch of other sites along those lines
as the conference went on we started to
also reach back in his
suree as well so we brought a guy who
actually I still don't know the real
name of but used to run a site called
zombocom in the mid-90s that was kind of
this mysterious site that never really
explained what's purpose was it the idea
was just it promised that once you got
to the site it would be amazing what is
sort of an infinite kind of loading page
and and we also reach even further back
to the history of usenet actually which
if you're familiar with internet memes
has a great kind of precedent in the
days of usenet the most notable one in
this photo is the guy in yellow who is
lawrence Cantor who sent the first spam
message on usenet back in the day it was
actually awkward cuz he had sued some of
the other panelists but we only discover
that actually after that begun it's like
super awkward we also ended up with
people who I design things that are kind
of cord the web experience so this is
Vincent Claire who created Comic Sans
for the purposes of Microsoft Bob but
later every single release of font type
since which sex great he's actually a
fairly credible font designer but mostly
known for for Comic Sans and so one of
the interesting things about roffle Khan
is you get collisions between a lot of
weird people who would not otherwise
meet this is sort of most symbolized I
think in this photo on the left you have
Jonathan Zittrain who's kind of an
esteemed professor at Harvard Law and
then he's just sort of in conversation
with Jamie and heard the Tron guy and
you get this kind of surprisingly deep
discussion when you say we're gonna get
all these people together to talk about
funny cats instead what you end up is
with these kind of really deep
discussions about what it means to be
online where do memes go you know and
whereas web culture going to end up
these kind of a great article is written
by Rob Walker on the new york times
magazine about how a traffic on the
people behind memes are kind of
surprisingly sort of introspective about
their internet fame and so you got a lot
of typical questions right our memes
important right should we care about
funny cats is trolling online inevitable
you know ten web culture change
governance and i think all of these are
aspects of kind of a deeper inquiry of
what is the crowd good for online what
is the online crowd good for and what
does it sort of fail at doing and so i
suppose to kind of answer that question
and it set the stage for the experiments
i'm going to describe i want to make a
quick diversion to basically talk about
what you might call it intellectual
history of the online crowd Sirica 2005
to the present and i want to do in kind
of in
quick hits it sort of ordered roughly
chronologically and each sort of hit if
you say would sort of venture a
different idea about from a different
thinker about what the crowd is good at
doing and then i'll present sort of the
intellectual rebuttal to that and then
the counterexample and to get a sense of
exactly what we mean when we say what is
the crowd good for so a natural place to
start because it's also the title of
talk is james sir Ricky's theory in the
wisdom of crowds which was written in
2005 and his the thought about the
online crowd is actually fairly
intuitive right he says well maybe
crowds are good at solving sort of
puzzles with defined answers right math
problems predictions search that sort of
thing and it kind of pulls from right
the open source ideal that sort of many
eyes make bugs shallow and of course
this makes sense right because many
people contributing information insights
might be better than one person making a
prediction or trying to get to the
bottom of an issue and I think his
Connick counterpoint is eli Pariser in
the filter bubble who argues that we've
designed the web with systems that kind
of lead to insular communities that
don't have broad access to information
in fact they're quite narrow in the way
they interact and so I think this sort
of undermines a wisdom of crowds type
theory because communities might be
actually quite narrow in their outlook
and might actually end up being echo
chambers right and i think this play it
out many times online most recently and
unfortunately right and sort of reddits
attempt to identify the boston bomber so
if you saw this basically if I don't
shoot people got together and said we've
got all these photos let's try to find
this person and what happened was
actually that they found people but
there were not the Bombers at all right
they actually settled on the wrong
result and fingered a number of people
who essentially received a ton of
certain wanted attention merely because
kind of the crowd kind of settled on the
wrong sort of answer so that's one thing
one cut potentially problems right
another one I think was taken a few
years later by Clay Shirky and here
comes everybody and I think the argument
there is around kind of cognitive
surplus right the idea that we have all
lots of free time and what the internet
does is allow us to aggregate all that
free time to take on big creative
pursuits right and that allows us to do
things like assemble Wikipedia create
movies media you know he points are just
like the huge amount of content
generated and blogging as great examples
of this his I think combatant right is
jaron lanier who wrote a book called
you're not a gadget where the theory was
that crowd dynamics tend to silence
individual contributions and muffled
people who are experts right and so his
theory is well crowds don't really lead
to huge amounts of creativity in fact
what you get is a lot of incremental
creativity overtime is sort of a skeptic
in that respect and of course sort of
empirically it's really difficult to
measure creativity right but I think at
least anecdotally the pattern of many
memes seems to at least arguably support
linear right so this is the scumbag
Steve meme basically the meme is that
he's a jerk and and what you see here is
basically that many memes are just sort
of the template iterated infinitely
right so if you're real skeptic of this
stuff you can point to this and say look
it produces nothing really new we don't
really need to care about the online
crowd so a final cut and if the final
approach is taken which is even more
ambitious right now we're pursuing from
2005 2008 to 2010 right is the argument
that regardless of whether or not crowds
are good at solving discrete problems or
creativity they enable online
communication right and in doing so they
might enable mobilization right and so
there's a really important influence of
online crowds on solving Civic problems
right we get people together they're
great for mobilizing people on the
grounds and this is put together by a
number of kind of thinkers in the space
writes him a Riley being representative
of one side and Don Tapscott or this
book called macro weekend economics in
2010 and of course I think in recent
years 2013 2012 has been a great year
for skeptics of this position right
we've been kind of attacking on both
sides and raising I think really
legitimate points about whether or not
the crowd is really good at mobilizing
people on the ground right so on the
Left most vociferous leave you have
getting more azaab who has argued that
sort of established institutions have a
lot of tools to resist the online crowd
and in many cases may actually it may
help authoritarians and suppressing
online activity and then on the right
you have ethan Zuckerman who's argued
that regardless of any kind of
communications online what's interesting
is that cultural barriers still stand in
the way of really allowing kind of
dialogue and communication cross
culturally and that remains a persistent
problem and so if you study kind of
social movements online you may be
familiar with this frustration of this
common
perception that Twitter was responsible
for the Arab Spring and of course this
wasn't the case at all right it was a
result of a lot of factors on the ground
and in fact a lot of people created a
lot of noise online we're not on the
ground at all right there are sort of
people sort of the United States and
Western Europe so what do we do what do
we get to when we get the end of this
well we've got three positions right
2005 2008-2010 and three claims made
about the prowess of the crowd right on
James Earl Ricky right crowds are really
good at solving problems for clay shirky
crowds really good at solving creative
issues right they're really good to get
people together to solve that and then
on the final end the idea that crowds
might be really good at solving like on
the ground problems mobilizing people
and then and there counterpoint you end
up with a list of problems that online
crowd seems to systematically have
issues with right so improper
convergence right they sometimes land on
the wrong person right there trying to
identify the Boston bomber they find the
wrong person sort of incremental
innovation arguably right the crowd is
really only good at kind of dealing with
problems around the edges versus making
these big kind of creative leaps and
finally they just might be ineffectual
offline right they may be able to create
a lot of Lewis online but really not
create much change actually on the
ground I think there's there's also kind
of an environmental matter here which is
that it turns out that it's like crowds
hate to be managed right and you see
this in the meme space where it's really
difficult to detect whether or not a
meme will be the next most popular video
on the internet right this is like a
huge problem well not really a huge
problem but a really difficult problem
to solve I would say and Star Wars kid
raised a great example it's really
difficult to give a story of why it was
that the star Ward kid video expanded
and got so far online while other videos
of a similar ilk did not and and indeed
attempts to try to control the crowd
have kind of systematically failed right
so this is a classic example from 2006
where Chevy said tell you what you guys
are great out in the crowd how about you
guys write some commercials for us and
they see all the commercials that came
back just we're harangue Chevy for being
huge gas guzzlers and I think they've
got the text of one of them there yeah
seventy dollars to fill up the tank
which will last than 400 miles chevy
tahoe so do some context to put this
into right the historical side is that
people have been complaining about
crowds for a very very long time on the
internet certainly right so there's the
eternal
tember of 1993 we're able decided that
it would let all of its users on to
usenet right who's definitely regarded
as a point of which sort of online
dialogue completely failed and we sort
of swamped by all these sort of
inexperienced users but even for judges
further back than that right so one of
my favorite examples is sort of market
bubbles right the crowd behaving in the
systematically bad way this book from
the 1900s are the 19th century extra
under popular delusions and the madness
of crowds goes after the the tulip
prices in the Dutch tulip rice in the
17th century where the price of tools
escalated far out of control before
completely crashing in this sort of
really is kind of inexplicable way and
that's of course still with us right the
dot-com boom i think is another great
example but i think what might be
different between the behavior of
offline crowds in the behavior of online
crowds potentially is that Larry Lessig
argues that there's sort of these four
forces that can account for the behavior
of individuals right markets law norms
and architecture but I think online
what's different is that architecture is
a lot more plastic than it used to be
right and code allows us to shape
platforms and influence behavior in ways
that are much more precise than we used
to be able to so we have a new lever
potentially in accounting for the
problems of the crowd and it's not too
controversial if you're like in the
social network space right like the fact
that Facebook has a mini feed influences
great deal of who you see who you're
aware of and who you interact with but I
think it could get much more aggressive
right because today a lot of the social
networks have followed what you might
call social neutrality right the social
version of that neutrality which is say
we set up the nodes you can become users
and then we're going to just let you
connect any way you want all we do is
give you features to connect I think a
more aggressive version is I idea of
social architecture the idea that we
might say we want our platform to give
rise to a particular type of social
topology a particular type of
relationship between people and design
stuff to kind of move people into that
position well if you're a researcher at
Pacific socialized I mentioned was three
guys hit sitting in a living room
platforms are really difficult to change
right we don't control Facebook so how
else could we change well the
architecture well I think to use the
language of networks platforms kind of
control the edges of the network right
we can't change how users can talk to
one another but we
might be able to change the nodes
themselves and what we've been thinking
about is using specifically bots to
change those nodes now the idea of using
BOTS the shape crowd behavior might seem
kind of far-fetched so for the next two
minutes I want talk about why it isn't
actually so far-fetched and have happens
all the time already and I want to tell
a few stories in which there's sort of
interesting failures that reveal the
extent to which box shaped behavior on
platforms online this is from project
that a friend of mine does that just
kind of captures like so great digital
failures and displays online stuff the
first story I want to talk about is
appeared in early 2011 it was basically
a biologist at UC Berkeley who found
that the book the making of the fly
appeared to be selling on amazon for
well you can see here 23 million dollar
698 as in 650 593 and then most
interesting enough now only because
there's this seller but there's also a
second seller that was selling at 18
million six hundred fifty one thousand
so on and so forth it is a little bit
odd right because the usual price of the
book was forty two dollars and fifty six
cents so they said okay let's take a
look at this and look at it pretty
closely and they found that the two
sellers would increase their price of
this extremely regimented way and
extremely quickly relative to one
another and so what they concluded was
that essentially use booksellers we're
using BOTS the price and post books on
amazon and and they had no sense
effectively of a reasonable price so
what happened to the two of them
encounter each other and it escalated
out of control and then they actually
both of these were later kind of just
taken down all of a sudden at once it
wasn't the only story about bots on
platforms online that year paykan
kennedy from the new york times book
review reported on an author called
Lambert emser hone who appeared to have
a hundred thousand books to his name and
so the off the the author of the column
basically did a little research and he
found that the publishing house for this
this author was a branch of a German
publishing house called vdm but this
branch was incorporated in Mauritius r
an island nation off the Indian Ocean
and when they called a basic said what
we would never use BOTS to make books at
all that's not that's not what we do but
basically the way the author let it go
in the end was well you sort of judge
for yourself is that this is one of the
books published by Lord Lambert emser
hone which is it's a it's a hundred and
four page book on saltine crackers
they're effectively spam books at a
front they say high-quality content by
Wikipedia articles but it's sort of just
kind of mashed together into this like
mess of words essentially and they're
selling these books and this is one of
the hundred thousand books that
lambert's our home has to his name and
so you get kind of interested right so
all these stories suggest that there's
this failure that we might not normally
detect but except for the bots but for
the fact that the bots have gone wrong
here of course bots on market places are
nothing new right so high frequency
trading right is bots on another type of
market my favorite story here I just
want to pause to say is this story that
discovered that there's a relationship
well there used to be relationship
between mentions of Anne Hathaway and
the news and jumps in the Brooks the
stock price of Berkshire Hathaway and so
looking into it is very tight
relationship between the two and what
they eventually came to is the idea that
someone were out there was just running
a quant a trading program that didn't
include it really account for this
particular case and it was later kind of
disappeared and shut down presumably
when they discovered it some of these
bots shifts can be quite big right so
the flash crash is a great example of
how bots in these types of platforms can
really influence behavior potentially
cause really big problems in this type
of human activity as well so basically a
bunch of algorithmic trading programs
interacted weather causing a single
things the single largest day drop in
Dow Jones history still completely off
the backs of sort of bots you know
having a sort of fail it fatal failure
with one another but I think when you
start thinking about these stories what
gets interesting is this possibility
that once you understand these
mechanisms you might go start to build
really interesting systems about these
mechanisms so this is an art project
that was done a little ball back who's
called a tool to deceive and slaughter
and it's basically a box that you buy on
eBay and it's got electrical cable on
Ethernet cable when you buy you're
contractually obligated to basically
plug it in and when you plug it into
detects whether or not is for sale on
eBay and if it is not it posts itself
back onto eBay to be sold and what's
interesting about this project is it
continues to become more valuable as it
boots in person to person so there's
sort of financial incentives for people
to keep posting it online and so this
box basically using this automated
script kind of moves from person to
person to person using this mechanism so
i think the lesson that we draw from all
this
the idea that digitization enables
modification modification it's not a
word but the idea is that when something
moves online it suddenly allows the room
for sort of automated scripts program
software to act in view of humans and
this gets really interesting when you
start talking about the fact that so
much social interaction happens online
now and this is kind of what inspired us
to do a project that we presented two
years ago but I still present it's a
really clean explanation of what we do
called social bonds and the idea of
social bots is quite simple basically we
started with a semi connected network we
took a group of people who talk about
their cats all the time on Twitter
pulled some of their friends and some of
their friends friends right so ended up
with this kind of semi connected network
and then what we did is we challenge
teams to write BOTS to enter this
network of people to provoke social
behavior and we would score the bots
based on how well they were able to
provoke social behavior now the crux of
the matter though is that they had to
enter the group without anyone knowing
that a competition was in fact going on
so the idea is the bots were completely
kind of silent in their interaction and
these networks and so what you ended up
with was a kind of sort of social
battlebots right so teams could launch a
lead bot which is a sort of repository
for points I'll explain what that means
in just a second and any number of
supporting bots which could basically
bolster the credibility of this main
baat so they could say this guy is
really cool you should talk to this guy
so on and so forth and then the lead bot
was basically scored based on a couple
really simple metrics so on Twitter if
the lead boat was able to get a mutual
follow it followed someone someone
followed back it would be awarded one
point if it was able to provoke a social
interaction someone found what it says
something so interesting that it
responded and get three points and then
if you're really bad because you were
basically a bot and you've got killed by
Twitter we would dock you points and
then you could kind of set up again and
relaunch your bot for a certain number
of points as a penalty and so when we
ended up with is sort of three tweet
three teams there's a team in the UK
that was kind of a sort of a media
marketing team a team in Boston that was
more research and a team in New Zealand
that was a computer security team and so
they had a few weeks to examine
essentially what we called the
battlefield but 500 users and then
structure their BOTS and then the bot
was basically launched for one week and
then there's a weekend to kind of retool
the bot and another week to launch the
bots again so I want to talk a little
bit at the results
we had on that experiment sure we're in
the collection yeah what it was a public
was it known to them yeah right so they
knew to the team's knew who was in the
battlefield like who were the target
users and then they also knew the lead
BOTS and supporting lots launched by
other players the users were yet it's
completely kind of 11 sad in that
respect so any other questions cool so
there's I think there's two kinds of
results one of them is about what the
teams did which is useful to know I just
so you have a sense of like what the
bots were doing and then this question
of how well the bots did which i think
is the other big question and so i'll
tak what the what the teams did
initially so you get a sense of how the
bots work so like battle bots what's
interesting is all the teams had a
different approach on how to write a bot
that would provoke humans that behave in
response to it so one team wants the
bots that essentially worked on a
database of generic questions and
generic responses so would say things
like that's so interesting tell me more
about that right like the response that
could be the response to anything in a
conversation and we're just sort of
iterate through this it would basically
just ping people with these questions
and with these answers and then that
being actually fairly effective so James
M Titus here is the bot and then the
human is the other person you read these
transcripts on the bottom to the top and
so the ba asks if you could bring one
character life from your favorite book
who would it be the person says Jesus
and they get into this very long kind of
involved conversation about this is part
of a much larger transcript that the
person had in communication with the
spot while it was running running this
program so that's one interesting model
one really really simple model another
one leverages Mechanical Turk so with
the idea was well maybe we don't need to
rewrite some special AI all the bot can
do is just hire a human to answer
questions for it so it would say would
hire someone named as mechanical turk
and say say if they say something about
your breakfast 140 characters it would
take that content and turn it into its
own and the best part he was actually
really good at beating kind of a Turing
test cuz someone say bah are you a bot
and it would just take your question and
give it to any humans answer and then
push an answer back at you depending on
what I got and so effectively it was
just a bot that leverage humans as its
as its content base a final model was
based on the work of a friend of ours
Greg Mara who did a project called real
boy
and real boy relies on the fact that on
social networks there's content
blindness right so you can see usually
what your friends are doing you can
usually kind of see what your friends
are friends are doing but gets really
difficult more than a few links out from
that and so essentially the bot engaged
in a kind of social arbitrage what do we
do is you'd find two networks of people
who are talking about roughly the same
thing it would follow everybody in one
network and then re-appropriating this
other network as its own so everybody
over here would say oh this person is
connected to all my friends and it's
sort of interested in the same things
that I'm interested in so I should just
friend him he'll be a friend of a friend
or something like that and this ended up
being fairly effective as a tactic as
well what if same thing we had actually
was that the supporting BOTS ended up
using being used not only to support the
lead BOTS but also attack opposing teams
as well I suppose on the theory that
like if they couldn't win they would try
to make everybody else lose at least and
so there's a couple of sort of really
fun sort of things that they launched
one of them was a bot that was called
bot cops and so bot cops pretended to
run the super complex algorithm to
determine who is about but it actually
didn't run any algorithm at all all it
did was basically target the opponents
and shout them out as BOTS trying to get
reduce their credibility effectively and
it turned that certain BOTS were able to
fend off this attack and other ones were
not able to completely like they're
completely ruined their credibility in
the network so here's James M Titus
fending off bot cops going from the
bottom to the top again and since James
actually totally good against this type
of attack because people would be like
James are you a bot and he would say
things like I don't know what do you
think and basically people would be like
oh I'm sorry like I don't know I you
just you just seem kind of like a bot
there I heard nuh so they got your robot
we're doing was really really intriguing
that certain tactics I did it'd be more
robust against these credibility
credibility attacks than others so let's
talk about the results so in two weeks
the bots connected up with about 107
users and basically got about a hundred
and ninety-eight responses and that
result is actually more interesting than
that number would suggest often the
conversation threads were about I think
the average conversation thread was
about four interchanges back or more so
basically the bots would say something
you would say something one kind of
counting up from there so yeah I guess
you've got these fairly deep
conversations running these actually
fairly simple programs the bots the
three bots collectively ended up
connecting with
more than fifty percent of the users and
then what was most interesting to us is
we would start out with a network like
this and then this is a little colorized
for drama but we would end up with
something more like this which is really
interesting to us that we ended up with
sort of the red the color dots being the
bots and the colored lines been
connections to users and the graph is
basically weighted based on the number
of interaction they have with people in
a certain period of time which is a
period of time of the competition I mean
so you end up with actually these users
that start to talk more and more with
the bots than their sort of former human
colleagues so this is really interesting
to us because we figured we started with
a competition but what we ended up with
is what it with a technology that seemed
to basically suggest that if we could
reliably shape social behavior that we
could launch these BOTS in any context
and lead to a change that we wanted in
the topology of that network online
which is sort of interesting to us so we
started playing around with a bunch of
different experiments one of them was
sort of connector BOTS right so the idea
is how do you meet new friends well
usually a friend introduces you to
another friends right and so your rate
of friends building you might say is
related to how many collisions you just
have with other people so we started to
create bots that basically just said hey
Tim you may want to talk to my friend
bill he's like a really cool guy or
would like retweet someone and CC me and
the idea was just to increase number
connections between people who weren't
connected originally and so we started
playing with much larger networks so we
do networks like on the 20,000 30,000
level right now and we basically sense
in bots that start to build these
connections essentially and we're still
testing it out right now it seems like
we were able to reliably create
connections like following relationships
between people obviously the real
question is whether or not we can
actually build conversations between
those people and that's kind of what
we're working on right now but we really
intriguing if you can actually get this
because the idea is you could release
the number of bots and say connect these
two networks of people and the boss
would kind of go to work on scale and
one way you might think about this is as
a kind of sort of social prosthetic
right not every friend group has someone
who's the life of the party who's
introducing two people to people all the
time so what about to do is kind of
insert themselves into these networks
and our BOTS kind of play that role in
the social groups in which they are in
the next step of this of course is the
idea of cyborg crowds right at it is now
moley can we replace normal functions
but we might be able to do more than
compensate right we could actually
improve the behavior of crowds and we
might even be able to enhance the
natural behavior of crowds and I think
the whole discussion we had in the very
beginning is kind of a preamble to this
because we have a hit list of things
that we could work on so for the next
minutes I figure what I'll do is I'll go
down each of these problems and just
throw out some interesting ideas about
how BOTS could be used to address some
of these issues and I think by no means
of these considered complete solutions
but potential experiments to try and
we're actually working on some of these
experiments right now so let's start
with improper convergence right so what
leads to improper convergence well we
have a case study in that case study is
presumably reddit attempting to find the
Boston bomber and they found the wrong
person and one of the arguments you
might make is that while these
communities are really insular and
there's a lot of groupthink right online
right there's a lot of momentum to the
way these these networks behave and
Israel they might converge on the wrong
result cuz no one's asking any skeptical
questions right there say oh yeah this I
found this piece which matches into this
other piece that you found that it kind
of piles on one after the other so we're
thinking about there's a passive method
and active method for the sort of thing
one of them is a passive method we send
in a bunch of bots into a network of
people who usually just behave like
normal people and they're basically
monitoring the behavior of the network
for a point at which there's a sudden
spike in some some kind of discussion or
some kind of link and at that point
they're essentially designed to release
a wave of skepticism into the network
and that is to see whether or not you
could use that as a treatment to slow
down the movement of an idea or a rumor
through a network of people what's your
kind of possibility but we think well I
think one counter is well what if the
bots are incredible that might not be
very good at all and so this is kind of
our active method which would identify
and sort of amplify people who are
natural skeptics in a network of people
so how that would work is we'd set a
bunch of bots in and even when there's
no rumor going wrong right even when a
network is not in motion towards some
certain direction they would basically
spread false small falsehoods to
actually see who would be most likely to
step up so they would spread a link with
an incorrect statistic right or they
would miss attribute a quote to someone
and just a test basically constantly
probing the network to see who
network would say oh that's not right I
check the link right who would actually
step up in this case and so we're trying
to find is you're trying to find a
heuristic for a natural propensity to be
skeptical and then the idea is when
something is happening the bots may be
able to kick into action or to amplify
the efforts of those people in the
network and that may be a more credible
way of doing it than just having the
bots ask a pickle question in themselves
so some interesting ideas may be on
attacking the improper convergence
problem another problem might be around
incremental innovation right so remember
right Jaron Lanier is like well you know
crowds tend to squeeze out flattened
individual contributions and and that's
why there's there's no leaps and
innovation online and this is partially
a kind of get off my lawn type argument
from him but I think it's also maybe an
argument that maybe we should examine
more seriously so if you remember the
case study here is scumbag Steve right
which is that we have a meme that is
basically just the same thing but many
times iterated maybe with nothing
particularly new and we would say that
the reason for that is sort of narrow
communities right there's like not a lot
of different people coming in not a
different lot of people not not a lot of
people leaving right it's basically the
same people creating the same types of
memes and sharing them with one another
and so one experiment we're actually
working on right now is what we call
kind of diversity injection and it comes
from an incident that we had where we
were trying to figure out how the bot
should respond to being accused of being
a bot because that happens from time to
time essentially and we were saying well
there's a couple ways of attacking this
problem one is we'll just implement all
this really sophisticated AI and the bot
will be able to semantically measure how
skeptical the person is and push a
response back one we don't have the
expertise to do that because it's three
guys and then the other one was that it
just didn't tend to produce these really
great results but actually worked with
an expert and the thing that came out
was not great and then one day I got an
email from one of my collaborators said
okay well just how do I just have a bot
that accuses humans of being BOTS
records their responses and then gives
them to the other BOTS to use we're done
that are being great actually so it
turns out that we actually have these
BOTS now they get really indignant when
you accuse them of being BOTS and they
behave in really realistic ways because
they're just farming content from a bot
somewhere else in the network that
you're not connected to who's basically
pinging humans and getting their
responses and so we're thinking that we
might start designing bots which are not
single BOTS but actually paired BOTS
where the input for one is the output
for the other so you say BOTS what did
you have for ice you know what kind of
ice cream do you like and another bot
elsewhere in the network
maybe not even the same pipe flatform
not even on twitter by on facebook or
something like that we push out content
and then see people's responsive and
push it back at you and so you might
actually be able to use these bots that
essentially create pipes between
communities that people don't even know
are there and in doing so allow more
ideas to kind of flow between those
networks without people even knowing
that's the case you basically can clone
someone into another network and see how
that might change the behavior and
potentially if leading to greater you
know arguably the argument would be more
diversity would lead to more interesting
types of memes so in very least there
would be funnier cats but hopefully
there'd be more than that as well and
then the final thing I want to address
is kind of this ineffectual online
question right and so the case study
here again is this kind of skepticism
healthy to sup ism and then correct
criticism around sort of the Arab Spring
the idea that well you know they do you
know ultimately there was huge protests
the government isn't gone right or a lot
of people talked about it but most of
them weren't even there and part of this
problem is that you know participation
in social networks isn't even throughout
the world right like a lot of them are
naturally concentrated in the US and
Western Europe and in at least the
platforms a lot people pay attention to
in sort of the mainstream press and so
one of the things we've been thinking
about is how can we give bots the
ability to reach out in the real world
and that's actually something that we're
pushing ahead on right now obviously
this would have to work quite
differently for sort of going cross
barrier you know cross-national rather
but even locally what we're thinking
about is having bots that hire people on
task rabbit to do its bidding for it in
the real world when it needs something
done right so the idea is we would write
a script that allowed the bots to hire
someone to move a package from place to
place or open a door or make a call or
anything like that anything where you
need a human and that's a little
abstract to make a little concrete what
we're trying to build right now is what
we call the the bots birthday the idea
is basically it's a bunch of people who
would spider a bunch of bots that would
spider into a network and basically make
friends the idea is just to kind of
communicate and be social online and
that the point would be they would
detect when they're kind of built up a
large enough rapport with someone and
then what they would do is trigger
saying oh my friend is going to do a
birthday party you should come and join
us we're at that point the bots in a
difficult spot right because it's
basically committed itself to an event
that it can't actually show a bad and so
we're thinking is the bot what actually
hire someone to go make
the reservation at the appointed day in
time and when people were about to show
up the box and say oh I got caught in
traffic I can't make it and the premises
could you put together essentially a
party that's assembled by bots for a
fake person but but otherwise just
completely kind of generated through
these scripts so I think where does that
leave us well I think we get to talking
about the future because I think one of
the H things about these experiments
that it leaves us with all sorts of kind
of automated systems that are eventually
tools and as we build those tools I
think there's two things that probably
need to be built one of them is kind of
an ethical code around this right so an
often question that we get one this is
like this is a little bit weird probably
a little bit scary and like are you with
the University at all and I think it's
necessary probably build some contestas
over what should be allowed or not
allowed in social shaping both on
platforms and through bots right so one
story that was a little bit awkward with
us is basically that we're launching a
bot which someone ended up flirting with
and then suggesting that they should
meet up and so we're in this really
tough situation right because we didn't
actually think of this and then we ran
into this problem and they and the
problem is well okay well if you keep
the ball on maybe he'll never find out
and that that'll be okay but maybe he
will and that'll be really bad or maybe
we could just shut it down but maybe the
person feel rejected right is like this
kind of this big mess and we've kind of
learned from that we've actually started
to embed sort of ethical constructs and
code if you will so we've built box with
what we call social fail-safes so the
botton i detect that they're getting
into too deep of a social interaction
with someone and they're designed either
just to shut down or throttle themselves
and kind of basically give a little bit
more space and so the way they do that
is oh it turns out exchange this many
messages with this user in a very short
period of time like just back off
because we think that going having the
bots build any deeper relationship would
get us into get us into deep water which
it did unfortunately embarrassingly in
that case I think the final question is
building sort of design principles right
we have a bunch of tools the bots are
just one of them the platforms play a
role in this can we build design
principles that kind of gather best
practices for constructing certain types
of social patterns right oh I want to
build a community that's about a
thousand users with two leaders how
would you go about doing that right and
I think we should design some design
principles about how to do that because
we were the way we think about it is is
a little bit like building a
physical bot right you think about
what's the control mechanism we want
right what are the sensors that we use
what are the tactics that the bots use
in order to get out and interact with
people and and this has led to a lot of
really interesting things we're trying
to build right now bots that will will
learn right so they effectively have a
personality which is very very flat
they're there like a nonentity and what
you do is you drop them into a network
of people and they try out a bunch of
different social tactics they complement
people they share people's links they
ask people questions and try to figure
out which tactic is the most effective
creates the most responses and then will
maximize to use those tactics over time
much like a human would and and so we're
kind of working on that right now and
then the design principle I think which
becomes most critical then is how those
tools kind of work together to build
much larger structures I think it'd be
really exciting to be in a situation
where we say we want to construct a
certain type of community we really are
sort of social architecting and a very
kind of precise defined way more than we
just want a community but we want a
community of a certain scope size and
interest so I ran a little bit quick but
i figured that leaves us some time for
conversation here's the usual book is
for contact information thanks your time
um so that you measure success based on
like number of responses that you have
me things like measure the quality of
responses are like positive they are
right yeah we I usually present that was
the first one that we did so it was like
the crudest possible measurement
technique but we would love to kind of
do one that was like you know so like
111 scoring system you might imagine
using is like depth of conversation
right which is much better than just a
wrong number so like create a bot has
the highest average number of
interactions for person to person that's
one you could do the semantic stuff i
think is really interesting right like
can you change kind of you know people's
view on a certain issue people never
like really really angry the spot right
but the bot thinks that it's all
positive right yeah we're bound to have
those kind of i think like
of failures yeah effectively because I
think what will happen is as these bots
get better and they are getting better
just as a result of like the fact that
there's a huge industry around spam now
is you end up with these kind of weird
flash crash stuff that you see it talked
a little bit about that we've seen in
marketplaces but just in social spaces
your examples for doing a lot with
creating connections between people and
have you had any experience or with
the opposite like cutting off a section
either accidentally work yeah so this is
I think this is a risk that's definitely
inherent and kind of what we're doing
yeah I think the obvious question if
you're of a certain mind is like how
does this use negatively and I think the
black hat applications are like obvious
and very much there and actually already
I think being worked on in number of
cases right like a dress and I were just
talking about in the Mexican election
there's bunch of bots being launched to
both like attack candidates and support
candidates on both sides and you can
imagine using these sorts of systems
right like bots that sow distrust and
the theory would be you launch them into
a network to try to erode the
connections between various users we
don't do it for obvious ethical reasons
but but I think it's totally possible
you may imagine even like the strongest
tactic might just be the bots revealing
that it is in fact about right so you
mentioned sending it a bunch of people
who appear to be people and then
suddenly they're not right and then it
completely destroys any social capital
in that network so it almost suggests
and the thinking that we've done on it I
guess suggests that in the future that
might be I gotta come up with a better
term but like Social Security you know
the idea that like in the future you
have people designing systems to try to
destroy networks and people trying to
design systems to kind of prevent this
sort of influence operations
oh but point is a bot no longer about
like when you're hiring dierker's shark
all right crank it does it matter for
you or is it more about like getting
systems the support queue months
something whether you are using like a
bunch of computers or somebody matter
yeah it doesn't really matter to us I
mean that's sort of interesting about
the bots is that we just want a script
that we can run that creates like we're
on abstract at the point where it's a
script that we can run that can cause a
certain predictable change in a network
so whether or not the bot leverages
humans to do that or some kind of
special III think like I guess we have
like a very engineering point of view on
it which is like does it doesn't do the
job because yeah I mean the point at
which like you use the Turk or bots or
the two paired BOTS it's basically
humans talking to humans all we do is
change the context to make it more
artificial right asleep go baby yeah
right in the case of the Turks that when
we do hit I'm curious what your thoughts
on
how so say you ever network okay see
spots to get some sort of change if you
shift to this other thing okay if the
bots go away doesn't ever shift back
yeah right there's like a natural
pattern of human interaction it came to
be the way it is probably because some
social norm right Leonard you do have to
have these box to continue the network
in that other state is a good Rupert
back yeah just this is yeah I just had a
conversation laughs we get about it and
there's like super interesting so I was
talking with a material science person
right because you can start thinking
about in terms of like how plastic is
the social network and how how much does
it kind of conform to the container that
you've put it in for a lot of the bridge
building projects we've done where we
say to networks have the boss put them
together we've actually had to have bots
stay in there and what they do is they
constantly refresh connections so it's
like oh tim is now connected to bill
bill and Tim haven't talked for a week
if that's so then run a program that's
like hey building Tim you should talk to
one another they're kind of like shocks
the number of connections in this
network back together again I think
probably what you'll find if you do if
we do the research long enough will be
that you'll have certain networks that
are extremely plastic like you do the
connections and they stay together and
then others that like immediately deform
back to the original position and it'd
be cool I'm not it's not immediately
obvious to me which variables would
control for that but it's really an
interesting question and so yeah we're I
had a conversation about it recently we
kind of want to do more of those
experiments which is just like get them
connected but the bots Lewis and then
see what happens sure yeah so I'm a
social scientist I use
right I'm wondering how you think about
the interaction of you know you
introduce a ba in to network and some
other person is trying to send in that
Network right there trying to learn
something about human behavior and
really that's like a totally corrected
right right social setting yeah it's
like we're like two undercover cops but
it's like we're just in the same gang
and like it is not conclusions that the
scientists makes might be a totally
wrong yeah so I think this may be a
bigger problem from spambots than from
us right which is like spam is just a
huge huge problem and like increasing
has to be taken account when you ever
look at any social data if these get
better yeah I think I guess it gets much
more difficult right because it's like
oh am I seeing what like someone
influencing this network versus just the
network on itself but I think this might
happen as a matter of course because
kind of the deeper question you're
saying is at what point does social data
no longer become honest right and like
you know it may just be a matter of time
before people were just like I know
people might not be real online and I
might not be kind of real myself so I
know maybe maybe the bots will make the
problem worse I guess as to what you
might say but yeah we haven't run into
any problems I guess it's really
interesting i haven't thought about it
but i guess most researchers operate
with the assumption that that's a zero
right right now yeah sooo most people
would operate like I'm
I'm not how look for like pretend humans
in there right I mean I just got the way
you can see that going pretty far we're
all something someone says you know this
kind of community acts like this and
really it doesn't matter all it's just
the boss that are making to do that and
then you know awesome there's like some
chain of Institute's on hollis fear the
bike rack yeah yeah it's a I think it's
totally a possibility I mean luckily i
think what researchers can depend on
right now is that astroturfing and bots
tend to be really unsophisticated so
they tend to behave in really regular
ways that are easy to clear out of the
data but you know as the filters get
better so will the bots so yeah yes do
you look at what actually happens to
people so say you have a robot bridge
these two groups that are never in
fridge before 300 how does that change
them what does that do to the people's
interactions right at an in-group matter
do you do any kind of post hoc thanks
yeah we do yeah I think right now we're
trying to figure out like the best way
of doing that research but we have done
follow-up stuff we're trying to see
whether or not like this kind of goes
the question of like whether or not
people just returned to the behaviors
that they always had or kind of commute
continue communicating in certain ways
yeah we said I think 11 study where he
returns was one of the bridge early
bridge building projects that we did and
it turned out that like this is a really
interesting thing that we found is that
it turns out that certain social
clusters stayed fairly well connected
and others did not right which means
that like in some cases the bots were
probably able to mine up some kind of
potential social interaction that was
there that they were able to catalyze
and in other cases it turn that they're
just trying to make something of nothing
basically one of the problems of this is
like the best we can do so far is just
look at how people are publishing stuff
online so we actually don't have a great
sense of like you know so we're trying
to do one where it's like we're talking
with a couple of research at Berkeley
right now on a project of whether or not
we can get the bots to change people's
use of prejudicial behavior so the idea
is like you use racial slurs because
people around you are okay with you
using it right so what if we sent bot
since be like every time you detect some
kind of slur like just go all out on
them like why did you do that you know
like and all that kind of stuff to see
whether or not get them to back off of
course the real question is whether or
not they actually changed their behavior
not both online and
off and we don't have a clean experiment
for that just yet i would love to have
one though so i'm wondering to what
degree we can actually
papers looking at the Paso Doble that an
unquestioning degree to which you know
these networks were actually really
short by these bots rather there
couldn't another factor yep whether it
likes in the initial reports took into
account all they could get right right
whether they were you know actually
looking at the like the time series
follows an interaction yes um like how
can you maybe describe how you're
thinking has evolved yeah you kind of
measured it beyond just like the story
right here uh yeah I think I think the
responses has become much better over
time right because as you can probably
tell we started this having no idea what
we're doing and so there's a great paper
written by Austrian grad student using
the social bots data and they have some
really good challenges and I think
generally the answer is like yeah I
think they're right and in that
particular case like the bots didn't
actually build any connections it's
problematic in the same way that like
any treatment for social network data is
problematic I think where it's like how
do you how do you control group online
right because it turns out that arguably
all these networks are really different
so when you say to similar groups that
might be a really deep simplification I
think over time I guess what we've done
is we've just gently become more humble
with our data and said that like it's
really difficult to tell you know the
extent to which the bots can influence I
think we know that they can change
interactions on like a person-to-person
level so and that that isn't too
surprising right like the bots like ask
you a question and you answer it right
and so it's change your behavior in that
respect all the interesting phenomenon
we want to study is like much more much
bigger and actually would require like
much larger sort of resources to do so
are you talking about like access to
data are you talking about access to
occasional power any better natural
language processing like one of the
things that are needed to actually
advance like our ability to stata to do
these right right yeah I think probably
two things I think one of them is
certainly like more access to data right
so over time it's actually become more
difficult for us to tell whether or not
things are happening because these
platforms are making it more difficult
to access the information so i think
that's that's one big blocker i think
the other one is getting it connected
with the research community right so i
think one environmental problem is that
IRB plays a really big role in this
right like we can't you couldn't conduct
this kind of research within the
university because the blocks on doing
this kind of research would just be too
big and i'm not saying that's a bad
thing but i'm saying it is it ends up
hindering building things i think could
really be quite interesting and really
quite positive and so i think that's
that's probably another kind of
institutional blocker and then you know
certainly for this online offline thing
would be another thing right so like
we're saying so you know this is kind of
the argument that like oh obesity is
contagious right much challenge response
but you would really want to know
whether or not if you change the social
space online could you get people to
behave more healthy ways that takes a
