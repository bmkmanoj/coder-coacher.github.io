lectures freely available
you
okay for our the last presentation of
whip T 2015 we've got two demos they're
both they we were thinking that they're
both be on the surface hub one of them
isn't loaded onto it so we will you but
Steve will be using touched to actually
fit in with our theme here and the
second demo will be on the surface up
Steve Steven Drucker is a principal
researcher at microsoft research has
worked on a number of a very impressive
systems and prototypes and and Dave
Brown is also is is a is a developer at
Microsoft Research was also done some
very interesting work that they will be
showing you here so thanks oven so yeah
one lesson for doing demos is always be
prepared with lots of contingency plans
and that that's what we're doing on that
device was recently updated to windows
10 and Dave panicked when he said this
is a new shell I've never seen it will
this work and I guess he got that
working it's also not on the network and
all my needed was a network connection
and yet we have no network so I'll be
doubling it on this surface pro it's a
lot better when you actually see my
emotions both of these demos are in the
domain of data visualization and you're
kind of saying why is data visualization
and touch important well one of the
things we found is is giving you a
visceral feel for the data letting you
can manipulate the data in the
representation of the data really helps
you understand it so I'm going to do a
number of different data presentations
talking about some data sets on my thing
and David I'll be doing the same after
me this first thing is called sand ants
we call it sand ants partly because each
of the pieces of data is being
represented as a piece of sand on the
screen and every piece of data is
represented so you actually see all of
those things that what is this data that
I'm talking about right now well right
now we've got about 30,000 points from
the last census the 2010 census that
each of those points is a
census-designated place which is
essentially a county and we can pull up
information
and details about those and you can see
that these places have things like
longitude and latitude and income and
all sorts of things here so you can see
all these things and because i have
longitude and latitude one of the nice
things is we can actually do a scatter
plot of this and you can actually see
structure starting to merge of this so
so you know again each of these this is
not a map of the united states looks
like a map but it's really just a
scatter plot and it we're so familiar
with the outlines of the united states
that we start to see patterns emerge and
that's what data visualization is really
about it's about helping our senses
interpret the data if you just give us a
bunch of numbers or if you give students
a bunch of numbers they can squint and
maybe they can start doing calculations
there's averages music but they don't
viscerally see what's going on again
about that visceral seeing one of these
I can do very easily right here is do a
histogram and a lot of people go what is
a histogram I don't know if I just do
this column pot now you actually see
what a histogram is a histogram is
counting up all the points in these bins
and having it go down into those bins
yeah let me move that back and forth so
you can see what's happening I've
actually shown this to eight-year-olds
they go I get it I understand what that
means and you start to even see patterns
already in this data so for instance
here in the Rocky Mountains and the
desert areas again it's great for me to
point but you can't see my pointing
right now so you'll have to take my word
that I'm pointing this region there's
there's not that many counties because
it's desert it's Rocky Mountains and you
go okay that makes sense it's not very
highly populated we don't need a lot of
counties and I've actually look out here
you go um oh there there not that many
things to the east coast either i
thought the east coast is pretty densely
populated what's what's going on there
well if i switch to a scatter plot you
actually see new england sticks out a
fair amount and that's why there aren't
that many places because there aren't
that many places that far east and again
a lot of people when they draw the
united states they usually kind of go
almost up and down on the east coast but
you can really see the sticking out a
lot now just the position means some
things and we can find some patterns but
it's a lot more interesting when we
actually start mapping colors onto this
so right now i'm going to map plum
colors one of the nice things about this
data is I
mashed up some of the election results
from the 2010 election so what I'm going
to do right now is I'm going to color
these things based upon Obama and Romney
and hear what's showing words all the
counties were above fifty percent went
for Obama is Balu and below fifty
percent is red for Romney now that's not
exactly the way things or its third
parties and other things but anybody
gives you a pretty good proxy for what's
going on here and again you're seeing
these things if I switch back to that
column you you can see oh I'll New
England went almost entirely blue there
are only a few counties and you even see
the bands to the you know the south into
the areas there here you see Southern
California in Northern California and in
Washington state you can see how those
those those when and again it's this
sort of red county blue county red state
blue state but it's a lot more nuanced
than that in effect if we switch to a
different representation of the colors
here we're using ten different colors
now you're seeing a lot more variation
here in fact you can say here if I click
on the middle region there those are all
the swing counties and you can see that
there are a lot of swing counties you
can see wow okay this is more
complicated than the very simple red
state blue state thing in fact we can
also divide this up if I say let me
facet this let me show you small
multiples and now we have nine different
maps the United States in this upper
corner map I'm just trying to help you
see that little click there and that
upper corner map that's the people that
devoted really strongly for Romney and
down here those are the counties that
went really strongly for Obama and so
let's take one of these counties here
one of nice things as we can select any
of these things so if i if i just select
one of these counties up here ah
actually selected a whole bunch get this
there so any guesses what might have
been really strong toward the west for
Romney anybody but ok this is in the
continental united states that it's sort
of to the west again these are nine maps
to the United States House actually it's
easier than that it's Utah because yes
that's where Romney was from and you
could say okay yeah makes sense that
Romney took some
counting in Utah from ninety percent but
if we actually select and I can just
click on Utah there you can actually see
there were places in Utah that did not
go overwhelmingly for for Romney there
are places right in that middle area
that actually we're swing counties turns
out that they still went forty-eight
percent for Obama 51% for Romney so they
still ended up going with Romney but you
could still see these variations just
like slurring the data that way so let
me actually take off the faceting you
can see again you talked coalescing into
that so you see all those counties in
Utah so uh here's here's another thing
which is a little less political but not
much political but let's left in come on
to the colors so here red represents
low-income and blue represents high
income and I don't know about you but I
don't see a lot of blue on this map
you've got blue sort of in the DC in the
New York area maybe again I don't know
how well that's calibrated up there but
there's a little bit in LA San Francisco
Seattle areas all those things but again
you're not seeing a whole lot of blue
let's actually kind of put this into
this mode so we don't have as much
overlap and you can see some of the
variations in here again a lot of red in
a snap one of the things I like to do is
ok we preserve the geographic orders
when I shifted to this view so we should
again Southern California and Washington
on that left bar but we can actually
sort the colors here so let me actually
sort the colors and therefore will count
up how many places in each of these
buckets have blue just a little sliver
at the top and again that that that's
you know interesting but let's actually
snap income and just do a histogram of
income and again I'm doing this all with
touch here 26 k is about the poverty
level and all those counties are living
with a medium income level below the
poverty level that that's again pretty
striking and these are counties some of
these counties have only 500 people or
so and some of the counties have much
more about people but it is showing how
many counties are living at the at that
income level and one of the nice things
about showing statistics and allowing
you to interact with it is to be able to
show correlation
of this data so i'll switch back into
the scatterplot view and do income
versus unemployment and again here is a
it makes sense if you start looking at
if we go out to the right axis if we go
all the way over to the right we can see
high income needs pretty low
unemployment which makes sense what I
like to do I'll though is change in come
to something that's probably near and
dear to the lot of people's hearts here
is change in come to education you see
the same curve which is to say the more
education you have bill lower the
unemployment and again that's nice to
see we can select some of these things
up here any guesses where might be the
lowest educated and highest unemployment
in the country might be no closer it's
Apache County Coconino County Navajo
County they're all Indian reservations
every single one of them has really high
unemployment really low education um but
let's look at the other side I kind of
like to point this out because again I'm
not sure how well it's showing up on
this big screen yeah it shows up pretty
well uh the further to the right that we
go the higher education is and general
the lower unemployment also in general
the blue it is we're showing three
variables at once bluer beavs higher
income so that is a general trend but
you're seeing some weird outliers here
are you going what's going on here this
place here had ninety-five percent of
the people in that county have a
bachelor's degree that's how we're
defining education in the census 95 but
they're really not making much money
they're pretty red so where do you think
is a place that has a lot of educated
people ninety-five percent have
bachelor's degrees but they're not
making much money Microsoft I think
they're making a fair amount of money
unfortunately but uh what's that I think
I heard someone say it universities it
turns out this place here is Stanford
we're 20 in the median ages 23 and you
go oh ok that's interesting and if I go
to some of these other places again
here's word and that place there if we
actually if they just gets
this slice here is forest home that's
where Cornell is in fact if we switch
this to a different view if we actually
just duel we put in come here if we
select every single one of these things
down here each one of these is a
university town and we can just go
through that's Thompkins cows select all
those again so that's Chapel Hill North
Carolina a coupon kidding these things
but again every single one of those
places as a university town and again
it's kind of interesting you see yes and
if this curve is actually kind of
inspiring which is to say in general the
more education you have the more income
that will be in a county except when
you're a college town which means that
eventually you'll probably move away to
one of the more affluent Kelly's so
let's let's show you a couple other
stories here let's switch back to
longitude versus latitude here does
anybody know lunch to hear does anybody
know how these zip codes are laid out in
the United States yeah so let's let's
actually look for the zip codes here zip
codes so if I hit a 9 we're going to hit
all the zip codes that start with mine
and if I you know if I hit at eight we
get all the zip codes that start with
eight and actually move this down here
and if we hit a seven we have all the
zip codes to start with seven except you
can see that there's something weird
going on if I hit a five we get all
these and it's like you know the pattern
here is not making sense to me why is
there this little bunch of stuff up
there that's start with five anybody
from Vermont exactly its 05 it turns out
that when I was cleaning this data at
one point in time I was dealing with
these numbers these zip codes as numbers
and when you're dealing with something
as a number if it has a leading 0 you
could ignore that leading 0 so we just
stripped it off we forgot about it in
the data and I didn't notice that until
I put it into this tool and I hit these
numbers I go oh it's gone ah I made a
mistake and I actually purposely left
that mistake in I think it makes a great
illustration which is that you know you
can be doing all since the manipulation
the data and you can you have to be
careful you can make mistakes and not
even realize it and not notice until
much further down in the line and
visualization can help you understand
the patterns in that data let me
actually go off to nine and then eight
and here is just Western Washington and
one of the things we could do here is
just isolate that just look at at
Western Washington and now we're looking
at this hotspot of high income in the
middle of Western Washington and I guess
is where that might be turns out that
it's Medina Mercer Island he's gay but
da Nina that's where Bill Gates lives
and it makes perfect sense that he's
living in this this or you know hot spot
of high income and if we actually switch
this to meeting home value you can see
ah yes there's that pico de novo yeah
okay that makes sense actually I was
kind of surprised but it was only a
million I was like really Bill Gates is
probably living in a more affluent area
than that but if we are you know letting
all the rest of the income it turns out
the census caps out at a million so um
you know those are just the peaks that
are just there so let me just take one
more moment I'll load it in another data
set here and show you that this isn't
good for just you know maps and
demographic information here we have
data from that Titanic here every single
point is representing a passenger on the
Titanic and what we can do is you know
there's no more geographic meaning of
this but we can look at age we could
look at gender and we want to see did
they follow the old age old adage women
and children first well how can we see
that let's color this based upon whether
someone survived or not and actually we
change the colors to a slightly
different color thing so here red means
they didn't survive green means they
survived you know it's pretty clear from
this that they that they fall it let me
sort by color here you can see Wow yes
no more women and certainly by percent
and certainly absolutely survive but
that's not really the whole story if we
actually facet this look at this by
captain class you can see that nearly
all women in first class survived in
nearly all women in second class
survived but in
third class only about fifty percent of
the women's product so again you can
look deeper into the data and start
seeing these patterns emerge so with
that I'm going to pass this this over to
David my name is David Brown I'm like
Stephen fascinated by the potential of
computer graphics to solve problems in
the real world one of those problems is
trying to make sense of data which is
growing in complexity and size all of
the time because one approach is to
build ever more complex tools the other
is to try and leverage our incredible
abilities to visually process
information much like we've been seeing
here as people to try and make sense of
the data to find patterns to find
clusters etc so what I'm going to demo
here is an early version of a prototype
called newly graph that's natural user
interaction graphing to spell that out
which tries to demonstrate how you can
use of visual processing ability to find
patterns and I've pre-loaded a data set
from Microsoft Excel it was actually
exported as a CSV but it's an excel file
it's got about 42,000 rows of data in it
and those rows represent tornado events
that have taken place in the United
States over about the last 40 years or
so so each each row corresponds to a
unique tornado now I didn't actually
moved to the US from the United Kingdom
a couple of years ago and coming from
the United Kingdom I didn't really know
much about tornadoes so this was an
interesting exploration of of how I can
learn about a subject about tornadoes by
visually exploring a data set that i
just downloaded from the internet so I
pre-loaded the data set but you can't
see anything on the screen because I
haven't specified how the data is mapped
yet and so what I'll start by doing so
I'll go to my little spatial control
here and these are just the column
headings of the excel file and i'll put
say longitude along this axis and
latitude along this axis and like
Stevens demo is starting to see a shape
I come about I mean it's it's pretty
much like the an outline of the US and
all that's really telling me is that of
those 42,000 tornadoes tornadoes pretty
much happen everywhere in the US
although there is an interesting
distribution
we'll drill into in a second and like
Steven I'm representing each one of
those rows in the data is a unique point
a little cube in this case this is also
an interesting experiment in 3d and so
each one of those roses is always on the
screen and represented by one of those
cubes so let's start trying to clean
this up a little bit to make a little
bit more sense of what we're seeing here
I can also adjust the size of each one
of these cubes and I'll do that by
applying one of the other columns in the
in the spreadsheet which was the
strength of the tornado tornado
strengths it seems go from zero which is
the mildest form to category 5 which is
the strongest form so I'll just apply
the strength field to the size of these
cubes and I'll apply it to each axis of
those cubes so they're uniformly scaled
you can now start seeing there's a
little bit more structure starting to
appear there's some clustering going on
around Colorado I think some around the
coastlines in Florida and then a few
little pockets around the mountains in
California as well and in the probably
Olympics as well up in Washington let's
apply some color as well so again I'll
apply color to the strength field and
I'll have blue as the weakest type of
tornado and white so white are the large
the large white cube to the strongest
tornadoes and now you're really starting
to see some interesting data appear here
so you can pretty much see that
tornadoes take place in the mid to the
mid eastern part of the US but there are
some interesting clusters of lower
strengths tornadoes in some other parts
of the country such as florida and
colorado we're pretty safe here in in
Washington sudden then you need to worry
too much which is a good thing so that
tells me something about where tornadoes
take place but not really how often they
take place forty-two thousand rows are
being overdrawn quite heavily here so I
want to try and stretch that out a
little bit and now rather than use these
manual controls to do it I'll just jump
through a series of presets that I saved
when I was exploring the date of the
first time round so here what I'll do is
I'll I'll grid that data and I'll stack
it up so what I've done here is enabled
me to see how many tornadoes take place
in a given grid square in
the u.s. you can see again there's some
very very clear Peaks there's a very
very high peak here around Texas and so
they get a lot of tornadoes there
there's these around the Florida
coastline and those in Colorado and I've
also sorted them by color as well so
that the white ones at the top and you
can you can get a sense of where most
tornadoes take place by exploring this
this dis effectively a histogram in in
3d so I know something about how many
tornadoes take place but not when they
take place and one of the other columns
in the spreadsheet was time and so I
know when each of these tornado events
took place so let me jump just back to a
2d map and let me put time on this axis
and see what that looks like so I'll
stretch that out so you're looking
effectively I'll just undo what I did
there and you're looking down on the US
here I'm going to stretch it out x times
this is like a core sample through the
last 40 years of the u.s. I'll just put
color back on there as well just by
strength again and you can see a couple
of interesting things and one is that
there's there's some obvious clusters
going on I can see a cluster of data
down here and so if i go to my filter
control i can just pull this batch about
more about nineteen seventy five ish add
that as a filter zoom in on this little
cluster and there's a cluster of
tornadoes here I just grab a pen and
select one of these guys and so
interestingly you know I knowing nothing
about tornadoes I found this cluster
pretty quickly and actually looked it up
on Wikipedia in this class that has a
name called the super outbreak of 1974
it was a very very destructive period of
tornadoes in US history very very easy
to spot using this tool which I thought
was quite quite quite rewarding so let
me just remove that filter and reselect
all the data and the other thing I
wanted to point out is there's some kind
of banding going on here and which
suggested to me that there's probably
some seasonality in tornadoes now and
one way of investigating that is to
start instead of looking at
chronological time which goes from 1973
to 2011
here is to start bucketing this into for
example the day of the year that the
tornadoes have taken place so if I if I
do that here and drop those into a day
stacks all I'm doing here is very
similar way to what Stephen was
demonstrating was taking each one of
those points and just dropping it into a
bucket 50 50 buckets corresponding to
the days of the year and you can see
this is our tornado in them in march or
april nineteen seventy four you can see
that there is a definitely a pattern in
around springtime now days of the year
don't mean a great deal for me but
months of the year do so i'll actually
look by by month and i also color it by
the strength and order it by the
strength as well so you can see that
there's a very very clear distribution
around april may june of the biggest
months for tornadoes in the united
states and again we're still looking at
42,000 cubes in this particular
visualization here we could drop those
out by strength if we wanted to just say
that you get a relative idea of how many
of the different strengths occur across
the months of the year and finally I
suppose assuming I found myself in the
mid to the mid eastern part of the US
sometime around May or June when should
I be most aware there's tornado may take
place so I can look by hour of the day
as well so if i if i change this graph
to look by hour of the day you can see
there's a very very clear peak around
about 5 p.m. in the afternoon and that's
when the air temperature heats up enough
tornados to take place so with the
relatively few mappings of this data to
color to space and building some some
bucketed views and histograms you can
get you can learn a lot about a piece of
data just by visually exploring it then
you can play that exploration back to
people to show you what you've learnt in
a way that hopefully is a compelling way
of sharing your insights I'm conscious
of time so I'll stop there but happy to
take any questions if you have them
thank
thank you for thank you for presenting
so it's a visualization interactive with
dynamic data set I mean right at the
moment it's a static data set I load it
from Excel and so I can load it very
quickly but it doesn't work yet with
streaming data for example that's
something that we might add in the
future okay can we play with either of
these tools online you know has been
made publicly available to actually a
limited set of people were trying to
expand so hopefully in the coming months
and also hopefully at some point in the
future but I can't announce when that
would be yet so don't know where would
we stay tuned for that I'm sure we'll
make announcements via the research that
Microsoft's a common sight that would be
the place and we'll try to don't we do
an ounce of time if it's publicly
notified yeah and I guess partly what
we're trying to do is show you where we
think some of the tools may go in the
future give it a bit of a taster for
those and hopefully we've done that her
VI and all no it's not but we're working
actively with all of the visualization
product groups within the company and
there are some aspects of what we're
doing that that may find their way into
some of those tools going forward I
think a lot of researchers role is sort
of the innovators dilemma which is the
fact that these groups right now talk to
their customers that they get the
incremental responsible for customers to
fix these at future we're kind of
comment from a very different and let's
think about from different principles
different UI everything and then try to
kind of just mean so what's the size
limit for the data set ah yeah over
there I getting different tools mine is
running in the web
I've seen I was running in a web browser
and we have some limitations to the
memory card school web we can have about
500 thousand points reasonably well i
would say 250,000 completely well above
that we start slowing down and then
they're there other limitations yeah you
know I'm also loading everything into
memory so it's really what the GPU is
capable of doing now that's anywhere
from you know but surface pro one will
run quite happily on it a quarter of a
million points you can get significantly
more on a beefy GPU but again we're
thinking about what the common hardware
would be several years out from today
and so it's really not something that we
foresee is a particular limitation right
now can the visualization actually do is
root on machine learning result like is
a super big data set it might take a day
to go over the entire thing but i just
want like one minute the result there
are other projects that were working on
in research one not about incremental
visualization show a subsample and we
constantly update that up as you as you
update the things and and you know
surprisingly with a very very small
subset with its randomly distributed
throughout the data you can get pretty
good notions of what the actual results
will be so if you've done a bad query or
debt bad visualization you could very
quickly cut that off and do something
else or you can wait for hours or to be
the exactly completely correct answer
that you want to see so that size that
some other projects that are going on
that might fit into either or both of
these projects thank you okay let's
