you
right good appreciate being here and
especially being invited by Ernest I'll
assure you he's doing a splendid job so
no jokes jokes would have been fine so
the the topic of what I'll present to
you today is what we're after conception
terms of in terms of our laboratory
maybe you can see these are not and that
is how do we intervene in a predictive
manner in the types of complex
pathologies that we might be interested
in so heard a very interesting example
just previous this I'll give you the
exact disease that we're focusing on in
a minute but in general these are
inflammatory diseases in which you see
many members of the immune system innate
and adaptive immune system cytokines
then affecting also what's going on in
tissue with tissue cells and blood
vessel cells and so forth to lead to a
pathology because of course what you'd
like to be able to do is to say can we
figure out where the best targets would
be there likely be combinatorial can we
predict what would happen if we
intervene so what kind of combination of
experimental measurements and
computational analysis can we do to tell
us how to do this so this particular
application some of you may be familiar
with some of you not is a disease that's
not very well studied at all there's
something like only a handful of NIH ro
ones on this disease despite the fact
that it affects ten percent of all
reproductive age women from puberty to
menopause and that's a very very very
large number of people it's a major
association with infertility almost half
a woman infertility is associated with
this disease the economic burden is
estimated to be similar to that of
rheumatoid arthritis so if you think of
all the work going on in the world on
rheumatoid arthritis this is roughly a
similar disease in terms of debilitation
and the prevalence and so forth
nonetheless very little is known about
it so what actually is known well it's a
disease
in the peritoneal cavity in women that
tissue spreads to places that it's not
supposed to be and invades and
essentially becomes becomes a tumor like
with respect to then causing pain
debilitation and some organ dysfunction
schematically it looks something like
this that reflux tissue during
menstruation can end up in the
peritoneal fluid and it ought to be
cleared by the immune response with a no
problem lee cells ought to just die and
go away and in no problems at all
nonetheless what happens is they persist
they're not cleared by the immune
response and in fact they invade into
the tissue and then become as
proliferative lesions that you see on
the bottom right over here down in the
in the tissues where they actually form
little glandular structures and as I
said they can call they can lead to
angiogenesis they can lead to neuronal
issues and generally to pain so it's an
invasive disease of some tissue of some
cells that come out of one tissue and
moving to another tissue and instead of
being cleared by the immune response
they are allowed to survive proliferate
and invade so many many similarities to
cancer in terms of being an invasive
disease of essentially epithelial cells
now it is appreciated to be a disease of
dysregulated immune system behavior and
I won't go through all the arguments
I'll just give you a recent review
article here but many aspects of venous
system seemed to be dysregulated from
the studies that have been done altered
activities of the different types of
t-cells natural killer cells possibly
Auto antibody production generally
increased inflammation some
hyperactivation of some inflammatory
pathways the bottom line is the premise
seems to be that there's something
dysregulated the immune system very
unclear that this regulates then these
tissue cells that have come out of the
uterus and are found in than landing on
various tissues and
and the dysregulation immune system
allows them to survive proliferate and
invade so it's a fairly vague hypothesis
but that's where the extent of it so
what we're after is with clinical
patients and some in some cell basic
cell biology studies something like the
following a multiscale got to be
integrated clinical experimental data
and computational mount analysis to deal
with all the moving parts and somewhere
in here lurking is some formal
multiscale a multi component analysis
that's not the really way we've really
approached it yet we've looked at it in
a number of different different pieces
and tried to sew the pieces together
mathematically with what you might call
a a hybrid approach none this
nonetheless in essence it's a multiscale
problem so what are the scales well one
of them is in the peritoneal fluid and
proximal to the tissue you have immune
cell communication networks all the
different type of immune cells are
communicating with each other producing
different cytokines and chemokines
changing the numbers of types and the
differentiated state of the different
types of immune systems there so part of
it is to figure out what's dysregulated
in what cells are there and how they're
communicating with each other and
telling each other what to do of course
all that communication in any given cell
type is governed by the intracellular
signaling pathways so inside of each one
of these types of cells there's multiple
pathways governing what cytokines are
produced and what's going to happen next
I might wonder which cell type to pick
should I be studying this and all these
different cell types and maybe so that's
part of the question now they're giving
these things so there's something going
on the signaling networks that are
changing the cytokines and chemokines
are producing that affect each other but
in the end the disease happens in the
tissue the disease is of these ectopic
and the material cells that survive and
proliferate an invite so you also have
to study what's happening down in the
tissue level with the endometrial cells
and how are they talking to each other
and other cells in the tissues well it's
by proteases and growth factors that
they're trading
among one another essentially
analogously to the cytokines and
chemokines of the immune system and of
course this is governed then by the
signaling pathways inside these tissue
endometrial cells so you see the
different layers we have different cell
types immune system network tissue cell
networks the pathways inside of each one
and somehow we need to sew this all
together and in the end we want to tie
these two arms together that what the
immune cell networks are doing
influences what the endometrial cell
networks are doing and that is actually
where the pathology route sides and some
place in this then where would you
intervene where would you add a drug
which and an antibody against one of the
cytokines which you have a small
molecule signaling pathway inhibitor if
so which cell type which pathway so
that's that's the idea of that it's this
this multiscale and multicellular type
so let me run through these and what
we've done is try to analyze each one of
these different layers and sew them
together so let's start with the easiest
and this is where our study began and
where some others in the literature have
also landed but really in a much more a
traditional way so let's look at the
immune cell cytokine communication
networks and one can do things like this
with patients and we've done this with
patients in right here in the Boston
area so far with Keith Isaacson and
Wellesley hospital we've got
collaborations and Norway collaborations
in sau Paulo and an interesting question
there is yes are their geographical
types of stratifications there and we're
just learning this this is the Boston
area study and so one can have in our
case it ends up to be 50 or 60 patients
who having to go on let Pross coupee
which is really the only diagnostic for
whether you have this disease or not
surgeon has to actually go in and look
and you can look at the different
patients and there's some that don't
have the disease in a noticeable way
they can't find any lesions some seem to
have major legions fewer lesions some
might be on hormone therapy and the
first thing to measure is what's
actually in there in the perineal fluids
what's
what are the immune cells producing
that's influencing each other and so you
can measure that and fairly high
throughput way by Luminex so measuring
about in our case a panel about 50
different cytokines and chemokines and
what one sees what's plotted here is
across the four different stages
controls mild disease severe disease
severe disease on treatment you can look
one by one and see that a large number a
couple dozen of the cytokines and
chemokines are overexpressed or under
expressed in one of the conditions
versus another and that sort of the
state of the literature right now is
people argue over which one of these is
the most important because they might
potentially be a drug candidate so where
we try to go beyond this in a
multivariate way was just to do a start
with an unsupervised analysis non nature
non-negative matrix factorization of
these molecular data and we did it
independent of the presumed disease
status because what's very interesting
is the disease status by just counting
the number of lesions really does not
relate very well to actually symptoms
paying debilitation and so forth so if
you're actually a patient you care more
about your pain and your dilla billete
shin then do I have a lot of lesions or
or fewer lesions so we did the
unsupervised analysis independent of the
of the actual pathological histological
assessment and we could find two
interesting clusters and then if you go
back in a in an unsupervised way it
turns out that this cluster with a more
severe sets of cytokines upregulated are
substantially enriched in the severe
pain patients even though they didn't
necessarily cluster with as I said the
number of lesions or even being on
treatment okay from this you could
identify what actually is in the
signature there's a set of about 13 of
these cytokines and chemokines just
depicted scks here that form a signature
of this pain associated cluster of
immune system network communication
molecule
tools associated with with with the pain
patients although again we didn't
classify them that way that's just the
Association as it turns out now to try
to figure out what's going on with the
cell types you'd like to do this by flow
cytometry it's a highly variable the
types of cell samples right now one can
get from the peritoneal fluid so that
really wasn't an option at least at the
meeting presence so we went into the
databases of expression in the immune
system of which as many and so what you
can find is for instance cytokine
expression across many different cell
types cell lineages and activation
states and what their cytokine
expression profiles are and now you can
map that quantitatively against the
signature that we found enriched with
our most diseased patients and calculate
what cell types are to be greater or
lesser represented in terms of the
cytokines and chemokines they're
producing in terms of the receiving end
you can do similarly for cytokine
expression say what what cytokine
receptor expression for the various
different cell types are they should
they be over-represented or
underrepresented with respect to being
able to bind the cytokines and
chemokines that are found in that
signature putting these together you get
an inferred communication network that
says what cell types are talking to each
other which cytokines are involved in
one cell type talking to another versus
other cell types talking to others who's
the producers who's the receivers what
are the cassettes of cytokines and at
least to this and one of the early
hypothesis that comes out of this is
that this is a activated monocyte driven
disease that people could choose any
immune cell type they wanted some people
are focusing on cd4 and cd8 and then
kaise and so forth and this inference
model pulls out activated macrophages is
actually the central driver we go back
into the patients and now look at their
macrophages pull them out of the
peritoneal fluid measure what they're
being what they're making and what
they're making in fact is highly
enriched in the patients in the
cytokines that were in the the signature
so we could find in the patients versus
the controls enrichment of macrophages
producing the signature largely that we
said the inference model said that
they're making okay so that's the immune
cell communication network who's driving
it and what cytokines and chemokines are
they making and sending to each other
and of course you might want to play
through all of these inferences and
block 1 cytokine or a kima kind here or
another and see if you can break these
loops and that's something of course one
can imagine doing not so much in human
patients unfortunately there's not very
good animal models for this disease so
one really has to think about how one
can put this together now you say okay
we're going to focus on these activated
activated macrophages what's going on
inside of them that's causing them to be
activating this particular way it's not
even a classical polarization if you
know inflammation it's not precisely m1
or m2 there's a mixture of cytokines
that they're making so how you would
actually categorize these macrophages
isn't clear so you can now go into their
the macrophage gene expression databases
and see what gene expression Cohen
riches with the activation signature of
these cytokines that they're making and
in with some inspiration from Ernest
Frankel we focus on transcription factor
activities associated with the enriched
co-expressed genes the other genes that
were coexpressed in enriched ways with
those key cytokines and found two most
germane upstream signaling pathways one
was ikk that's a stream of nf-kappa b
that was entirely expected it's just a
highly activated inflammatory signature
in many cells the June kinase pathway
was also Co identified and that was
entirely novel that's not really been
appreciated to be a driver in a lot of
these inflammatory diseases and
especially not in endometriosis so we
wanted to test this specifically so from
this enrichment to study we actually
could rank order different kinase
pathways according to the strength in
which they ought to be contributing to
the production of these cytokines and
chemokines in the enriched signature and
we could show that you actually get the
right rank order that on the right hand
side
come in with an inhibitor of June kinase
the blue squares show that you have the
strongest diminution of all the
cytokines and chemokines that were in
that signature the next greatest
prediction was the IKK pathway as i
showed you that's the next block over
the lighter green still a fair amount of
blue in a little bit of red and then as
you go farther over some other pathways
that people had previously presumed
especially p38 and Jack as big drivers
of activated macrophages you see much
more red much less blue there's much
less effective inhibitors on those so we
validated that the June kinase pathway
was the most strongly associated
upstream signaling pathway for producing
the activated macrophage cytokines
chemokines signature and I'll note
there's an unnamed pharma company that
has especially selective june kinase
inhibitors that they are starting
clinical trials with okay so that's half
what's the other half how is this
inflammatory dysregulation linked to the
reactors the endometrial cells that
epithelial cells that actually have to
invade and form these tumors okay we've
identified what's happening out in the
immune system that's dysregulated now
how is this affecting the actual
endometrial cells in their lesion
formation well so now we have to study
what's driving them alekhya larly what's
driving these cells to proliferate and
invade into the tissue and what are the
intercellular pathways that might be a
most strongly associated with that
because there again might be targets now
on the endometrial cell and rather than
on the macrophage end so we'll look at
both these together so there is some
evidence that exists previously some
people have done small-scale in vivo
studies of endometriosis to see what
kind of receptors are most strongly
activated interestingly they came out
with the ER be family the epidermal
growth receptor family which is
interesting because that's a big driver
of many cancers especially hormonal
related cancers things like breast
cancers and there's a lot of similarity
is between the properties of these
invasive endometrial cells and invasive
breast cancer cells that that we're
exploring so that allowed us to narrow
in on this Irby family epidermal growth
factor receptor family for what might be
dysregulated in the endometrial cells
but an interesting question is where do
those growth factors actually come from
they don't come from the immune cells in
the perineal flute they're actually
produced by the cells themselves in a
very interesting manner in which the
cells themselves make their own growth
factors so they're put in the cell
surface but they're there in a very
unusable manner until proteases activate
them and they become soluble and they
can come back and bind to the EGF
receptor and other Irby receptors on the
same cells and on neighboring cells so
what appears to be the case is there
something in the dysregulated
inflammatory system that's driving the
activities of these proteases that then
make more EGF receptor ligands that turn
on these cells and cause them to invade
that's a interesting hypothesis so we
carried out a an experimental cell
biology study on this taking some of
these invasive endometrial epithelial
cells and measuring in them that
protease activities of the cell surface
what growth factors they're shedding
into the environment what their
intracellular signaling pathways are
that are downstream of that and might be
governing the migration so we measure
all these things simultaneously the
kinase signaling pathways inside the
cell migration the protease activities
the growth factors that are shed into
the environment if we put all that
together and the data just looks
something like this the intracellular
phosphoprotein signaling across multiple
pathways and multiple treatment
conditions that one might see in the
perineal tissues the protease activities
varies different proteases under these
conditions the actual growth factors and
receptors that are shed proteolytically
into the peritoneal fluid and then the
migration behavior and by a Bayesian
network pulled all this together to say
who's driving what so downstream of the
cytokine and growth factor stimulation
that would be in the perineal fluid what
pathways are being strongly driven
interestingly here's our friends you and
kinase again actually in the endometrial
cells themselves which might give you a
double strong a therapeutic effect other
downstream phospho signaling pathways in
which you see these arrows in the
bayesian network across talk influencing
activity of these things called atoms
those are proteases those proteases are
what released the growth factors that
identifies with the Greek key growth
factors are that are released that then
drive motility so with this Bayesian
network model allows us to do and I
won't go to the details it allows us to
predict where the best drug combination
therapies might be if you want to
inhibit motility downstream up pretty
much any type of stimulatory environment
because you don't really know the
stimulatory environment what two of
these things in combination would you
use to to inhibit that most strongly and
turns out we could predict that very
nicely and it turns out it's an
inhibitor of one of these receptors in
which its ligand has feedback and then
one of the downstream kinase pathways
that governs most strongly the protease
activities that govern the ligand
release and we could test that in the
cells using different individual
inhibitors and different combinations of
inhibitors and show that we can really
in fact prevent this invasion in the
strongest way with the combination
predicted here all right so we know
what's going on in the immune system
cells we know what's going on to the
endometrial cells now how do they talk
to each other is there any information
here can it be analyzed for how they
connect well us so what you want to do
is come commonly in the same patients in
which one has measured all the cytokines
and chemokines in the immune system
you'd also like to then measure all
these protease activities and the growth
factors and receptors that are shed in
the same patients unfortunately we're
able to do that having kept the samples
and now we're trying to see are their
relationships between the molecular
drivers in the immune system
dysregulation and the molecular drivers
in the endometrial cell invasion so
pulling these data sets together now
this is just a
simple topological correlation network
model it needs to be trimmed down a lot
this is a very preliminary model but
what one can see here is some
combination of in yellow some of the
cytokines and chemokines that are in the
peritoneal fluid some of the growth
factors that are shed from the surface
some of the receptors some of the
proteases and if you look at the things
in the peritoneal fluid in the immune
system dysregulation that are most
strongly upregulated or downregulated
you can see them represented here as
central drivers of at least associated
with correlated with the growth factors
that we're driving the endometrial cell
invasion so this is a very first
preliminary step toward tying the two
together the key things that have been
dysregulated here how are they
associated with the key things that are
dysregulated there so where we are in
the end is I think we've learned a lot
just from pulling a number of different
data types together mainly from clinical
patients but also in combination with
cell biology biochemistry studies and
some databases that are that are
available on gene expression so we've
learned something about what's
dysregulated among multiple cell types
in the immune system what one of the key
immune system cell actors appears to be
what some of his or her key pathways
appear to be intracellularly that lead
to the dysregulated signature prediction
of what pathways to block to reduce that
validate that on the side of the
endometrial cells what growth factors
are driving them what pathways might we
block there that regardless of what's in
the immune system might block the
motility introduced by these autocrine
EGF receptor ligand interactions and
then how are these immune system
cytokine Network dysregulation
signatures associated with what's
dysregulated in the endometrial cells so
in some places there's mechanism in some
places there's purely correlation and
and I think you can imagine ways to try
to put this into a nicely fused
integrated multi scale model
we just haven't done that yet this is
hybrid as I say so thank you especially
to a Keith Isaacson and Linda Griffith
who have led the clinical side of the
study and Michael besties miles millar
aren Maier and Abby Hill thank you okay
start here how do you okay the question
is when we build these mathematical
models where do we actually get
parameters for growth rates death rates
and things like that in most of these
these are not not really parameterised
models okay there's there's there's no
rate constant per se render Bayesian
networks you just have conditional
probability distributions in these you
just have probabilities of correlation
now when we did this we actually had
numbers for things like motility and the
signaling and the proteases and things
like that so so at this point these
aren't really parameterised models in
the sense of a priority predictions in
that sense we can compute through these
but there's no specific parameters
assigned with rates of mechanistic
processes that would be a future thing
once we had confidence that we've got
the right relationships and associations
here that I think we need to work harder
to convince ourselves of yet
yeah in this the independent samples
came from this this was a cell biology
study so we drove it with about eight
different cytokines and chemokines and I
think we had triplicates of all the
conditions so and then you see all the
components that that are in there so
what this is is not a thousands and
thousands and thousands of data point
type of analysis that's something we've
learned with a previous a student in the
lab is how efficient one can be with
data to generate these kind of networks
and you can be more efficient than
sometimes people think you can it's it's
more the quality of data than the number
of data points you have in terms of
covering dynamic ranges and
signal-to-noise ratios I've one last
question if anyone has one all right
let's thank Doug again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
