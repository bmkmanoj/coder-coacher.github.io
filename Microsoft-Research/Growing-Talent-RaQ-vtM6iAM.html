welcome to this session on research
talent as you all know that talent has
become a very hot topic with the
regional economy development now
government for example in China is
putting a lot of money massive amount of
money universities under so all this
money with all this research money flow
into the laboratories the talent problem
is not resolved still not resolved
actually become a more urgent problem so
when we go out talk to university
professors they said I'm not so worried
about money now I really you know
interested in talent so today we you
respond to this we have our keynote
session on research talent and that
tomorrow we have a different program
I'll tell you so let's first me
introduce the speaker professor Jung ho
cost group how do I go forward ok here
we go how so John is very well-known
scientist very distinguished the
computer scientist who has received many
award including Turing award so but
today you might introduction I'm going
to tell tell you to fact that's nice
well known about him so the first thing
that John actually is a visionary leader
who can advise the government on science
and technology strategies at the
National on the international level so
many people know national science
foundation on the journal is on the
National Science Board what's the
relation of the to the National Science
sport is personally chosen by the
president
to supervise the National Science
Foundation so okay unless another fact
less well known fact about young as John
actress is a war very well distinguished
educator so here is the citation of his
recent ACM Carl kallstrom outstanding
educator award it covers many aspect of
for Jones educators career but I
highlight with the 19 advising PhD
students who themselves are not
contributing greatly to computer science
well said okay some fat some my personal
experience and recently we celebrate
John's 70th birthday happy birthday so
we had a big conference one a whole day
at Cornell and a lot of people came over
from all over the world and we have a
lot of fun and at the conference this is
a picture taken at the conference where
is Chang under John's students John
student means that either his students
all students rather his official
students advised would be with God did
PhD work under John and also other
students who who may not be his official
students but they did his PhD study his
their ph diseases is essentially advised
by him so he is the actual advisor so
among them the many distinguished
scientist contributed greatly computer
science I'll just point out a few so a
whole sorry the bottom Alejo now you
know what he looks like so Robert Rajan
who's himself as twin award recipient so
John Mahoney has received to award
recipient but he also can advise his
students to become a true in award
recipient so which further distinguish
him
the Turing Award winners so under then
here's Correa who is the inner
dealership position he is a president of
University of Tel Aviv one of the top
universities of the world okay so i
won't go through all of them so after
today's keynote so if you want to
interact more where's our Jang have no
Q&amp;amp;A time and was young and he will be
participating out tomorrow's breakout
session it's basically a session the
fully developed to talent growth okay
let's work i'm john thank you very much
it's a great pleasure for me to be here
today and to talk to you about the issue
of growing talent and I visited many
countries and I've looked at their
educational systems countries like
Vietnam Chile India and so forth and one
of the things that I recognized is that
the United States made certain
fundamental decisions different than the
way these countries made them and I
think it is these differences that have
led some of the US universities to
become so well known in science so what
i thought i would do is i would start my
talk today by telling you a little bit
about the u.s. research model then a
little bit about teaching in the united
states and then i'm going to give some
recommendations but here one should be
very careful when a foreigner gives
recommendations for another country you
ought to be a little bit careful because
he may not really understand the culture
and many of the forces and the
recommendations may not make any sense
but I'm going to give them anyway and
then and then I'm going to talk a little
bit about how to spot and how to mentor
talent and then finally what i thought i
would do is i would go through an
example and show you how some students
actually got started in in their
research so to start with one of the
fundamental decisions that the u.s. made
was that they decided that basic
research was going to be carried out in
universities rather than government
laboratories and then applied research
would be done in government laboratories
and one of the reasons this is important
is some countries decided that they
would have two ministries one of
research and one of education and what
they ended up with was government
laboratories which had the funding and
had the research infrastructure that did
not have the PhD students and they ended
up with universities that had the PhD
students but
didn't have the laboratories and so for
us to carry out cutting-edge research
and so this this is one of the
fundamental decisions and the reason it
was made was doing the basic research
and universities sort of guaranteed that
there would be a next generation of
scientists another thing in the United
States is our economy is large enough
that we can be world-class in all areas
of science and what world-class means is
that there is enough research activity
that if there was a breakthrough in that
area anywhere in the world we would hear
about it we'd be able to evaluate it and
if we thought it was important we would
be able to reproduce it in the United
States then there is another category of
research areas where we're going to
strive to be number one and there's a
certain criteria that decides how you
get on the shorter list and one at one
of the criteria is whether it is an
enabling science so like molecular
biology computer science and some people
would say mathematics and this this is
actually a very important thing to
understand when I say mathematics is an
enabling science it is probably not the
phd level research that's going on in
mathematics which is so important that
it is the average math skills of the
entire population and that's why if you
adopt a policy like this in mathematics
you might focus on elementary and
secondary education another reason to
try to be number one in an area is it
captures the imagination of society if
you ask why did the United States put a
man on the moon it was not because of
the science that was going to be
obtained by that but it was because it
would raise the the national spirit
given the money that it took we could
have gotten much
quality science if we had put it in
other areas and then another another
reason is if it's coupled to a national
objective if you're concerned about a
global warming then then you may want to
try to be number one in an area like
this now another thing about the u.s.
system is the diversity we have 50
states and each one has their own
educational system and they're
independent in addition we have many
private universities such as Cornell
Stanford Princeton and so forth and what
this means is is two things first of all
there's competition between these
institutions and what this will do is
this will determine the salaries of
faculty and things of that type if we
don't hit Cornell if we don't give good
salary offers to prospective faculty
they're going to go elsewhere and
secondly it allows institutions to
experiment each institution tries
different ways to improve the
educational system some of these
experiments work some don't that we can
see this wide range of experiments and
we can adopt at our own institution
those those that work one of the other
things that I notice is in many Asian
countries when I look at the bio of the
faculty member I noticed that he or she
did their undergraduate work their
graduate work their postdoc and then
became a faculty member I'll at the same
institution in the United States that
would never happen most universities
encourage their undergraduates to go to
a different institution to get their PhD
so at Cornell if one of our
undergraduates applies to our PhD
program will consider them just as we
would any other student but we would
also talk to them and we would tell them
look this is probably a
for you to come here because you already
know the faculty at Cornell you already
know Cornell's view of computer science
and if you go to another institution
you'll meet a wider range of faculty
they will have a different view of
computer science and a view of what a
different view of what is important and
if you go and get your PhD in a second
institution you get your do your postdoc
at a third institution and then get a
faculty position at a fourth institution
you will have seen four different views
of computer science you will have seen
four different sets of faculty and you
can extract from this what you think is
is the right right view and I think this
this mobility is something which is is
extremely important another thing that
it does is when a student goes from one
institution to another he or she carries
some of the ideas from that institution
to the to another institution and so
that's how things get information gets
transferred around in the United States
I thought I would talk a little bit
about how we view a faculty member for
promotion and what we do is we searched
the world to find who are the leading
scientists in his or her area of
research and then we write them and we
ask is this faculty that we remember
that we're considering for promotion
that has he or she done why is it
important and how has it impacted the
work of others and we will get back
maybe eight or ten letters and the
decision whether to promote or not is
made by this judgment of people who are
not at Cornell there around the world
but they are the leading scientists and
from these letters it becomes obvious
whether this person is really going to
be an influential scientist or not one
of the things that I would caution
against is this notion of counting
papers or counting references to papers
it turns out that the publishing
business is a money-making business and
if you're publishing 20 journals and
making a profit why not publish 40 and
we're in a situation today where if you
know where to submit your paper you can
literally get anything published and the
number of publications is simply not a
good criterion for whether or not you
should promote somebody I really think
that the second bullet here which says
what have they done why is it important
and how has it impacted the work of
others if top researchers in the world
say when I teach particular course I
have to teach the material that this
researcher is done you know that they
have done something that is important
another issue is to avoid top-down
management you want to push decisions
down to the lowest possible level and I
will just give you one example as some
of you know I've talked a lot about the
fact that computer science is changing
in a fundamental way and we've got to
update our curriculum to meet this
change and to really position our
students for the future and what I
decided is at Cornell we should add a
new course to our curriculum and I had
talked to faculty about this for a year
so people knew I was thinking about it
but what did I have to do to get that
course approved what I did is I went to
my department chair and I had a
10-minute conversation with her I didn't
give her anything in writing we just
talked for 10 minutes and she said fine
go ahead and will teach at this next
year in fact most about 10 minutes was
concerned she just wanted to make sure
that since we were adding a course she
had enough faculty to teach every
existing course but this never went up
to a Dean or a Provost or a university
president or up to the
administration it was simply a
discussion that was that short and if
you're at an institution that can make
decisions at that level you're going to
be far more competitive than an
institution that would have taken a
couple of months to get that course
approved research the way it's carried
out if I want to carry out some research
I write a research proposal which I
submit to our to our government to get
research funding the government doesn't
ask me to submit a proposal to do
research in a given area what I do is I
tell the government that they ought to
fund research in a particular area and
what the government agency does is it
takes my proposal and sends it out to
two or three researchers in the area and
ask those researchers is this really
worthwhile research and if those
researchers say yes I will get the
funding if they say no this is kind of a
marginal proposal or then I'm in trouble
we so faculty members really make their
own decisions as to what direction
they're going to go some faculty make
good decisions some make poor decisions
those that make good decisions will get
promoted and move on in their careers
those that make bad decisions well
that's their problem quality of PhD
students it turns out that the quality
of PhD students is probably the most
important factor in the quality of an
institution when a prospective faculty
member is trying to decide what
institution they should accept a job at
the number one criterion is how good are
the PhD students that he or she is going
to be working with and because of that
we search the worldwide for the best PhD
students we look in China we look in
India we look
the world and in fact about a third of
our PhD students come from India another
third come from Europe I mean excuse me
from China or Asia another third come
from India and Europe and only a third
of them come from the United States and
in order to attract the best students we
pay their fill tuition and fees but not
only that we give them a stipend a
yearly stipend of about twenty-five
thousand US dollars now that's probably
more than some faculty are paid in some
countries but the reason we have to give
such a stipend is because of the
competition for good graduate students
if we don't give them an offer like this
they will accept an offer like this at a
competing institution and one of the
things about the quality of PhD students
is a junior faculty member who is
starting to develop his or her career
one of the most important things as to
how successful that person is going to
be is the quality of PhD students that
he or she gets to work with so our
assistant professors in year one when
they first come are able to attract PhD
students and and they work with them
directly whereas in some countries it's
not until you get further in your career
that you're allowed to supervise
directly at PhD students there another
issue that's very important is that
there be multiple avenues for getting
research funding if i send my proposal
to the national science foundation and
the foundation doesn't like it but i
think it's good then i can ship it again
to maybe the Air Force Office of
Scientific Research and see if they
think it's good another matter of fact
is the budget I have to submit a budget
when I submit the proposal to show how
I'm going to spend the money but I'm not
required to spend the money in that way
I can if I want to change money if i put
in a line saying i'm going to spend
twenty five thousand dollars on
equipment
but then decide i don't need the
equipment and want to spend it on travel
or to bring in a visitor I don't have to
ask anybody I have that authority as the
pie on a research proposal to spend the
budget in any way I want with just one
exception the one thing I cannot do is I
cannot increase the amount of money and
the proposal that goes to my salary that
they do not allow that you would have to
ask permission from from the agency I
thought I would talk a little bit about
how we admit PhD students and I'll tell
you how we do it at Cornell but I think
it's the same at all top research
institutions in the United States first
of all the students are admitted by the
field not by an individual faculty
member we put together an admissions
committee and that admissions committee
does the admissions for the entire
entire field secondly students are
funded for as long as they're in good
standing independent of who they select
to be the research supervisor so in the
super when the student arrives at
Cornell what we do is we have one person
advise everybody the first semester so
that we can get them into courses and
things of that type but we tell the
student during that first semester get
to know a number of faculty find out who
your comfortable working with who is
working in an area that you are and then
select your advisor and remember that
their support is independent of who they
select as an advisor and I think that
that is is very in an important aspect i
thought i would put some miscellaneous
things up here because i didn't know
quite where to put them one of the
things is that english is really the
language of science and international
business and if your students are going
to be successful at science they're
going to go to international conferences
where most
papers will be in English also if they
want to get a broad exposure for their
work they're going to have to write
their papers in English and they're
going to have to give presentations in
English so it's important that you try
to develop an English writing and
reading skill in your students one of
the things that surprised me is when I
was in Vietnam I discovered that the
country had said that at their top four
universities I'll education in science
and engineering was going to be in
English and I sort of found it
unbelievable that a country could say
they were going to teach in a language
other than their national language but
they recognized that this was important
for the success of their students it was
an item up here it says size of
departments 35 and what's why why would
you think of our department of that size
well one of the the items that
determines qualities in universities is
departments its departments that hire
faculty make decisions to hire faculty
make decisions as who to promote and
they're really the keeper of quality not
the higher administration and so what
you don't want is you don't want to get
a department that is so large that the
faculty don't know one another and don't
respect one another and don't interact
as a as a coherent unit and so 35 is
about the size once you start getting
larger than that faculty don't really
know each other and all of a sudden the
department starts fracturing into
smaller smaller pieces I put up their
chalk not PowerPoint when you're giving
a lecture I know many people have gone
to powerpoint but I've got to tell you
my experience has been that if you
really want your students to learn when
you're teaching you want a sense how
well they're picking up what you're
talking about and you want to have the
ability to change your lecture during
the hour that that you're lecturing and
to do this if you have PowerPoint slides
you're not going to do it effectively
also there seems to be something that
when I write on the blackboard and it
goes up piece of our pieces i'm talking
the students take it down whereas if i
use powerpoint they don't because
they'll just ask for a copy of the
slides afterwards wednesday lunch didn't
have to be wednesday but one of the
things I did when I was a department
chair is I wanted the faculty really to
develop relationships with one another
so I said look I'm going to have a
caterer bring in a lunch on Wednesday
anybody who wants to come come it's a
free lunch it's not a faculty meeting
it's just a time where you spend an hour
with your colleagues you can talk about
baseball or football or anything you
want but you'll get to know one another
and it turns out it's amazing how much
information is conveyed at these faculty
lunches it's now 20 years later and
several department chairs have continued
this and I want the next couple of
things i'm not going to go into because
part of it veining mentioned i just put
down there the first class I've taught I
just went back and checked to see how
they were doing and half of the members
of that first class are members of the
National Academy today now here I make
it into a little bit of trouble because
here I'm going to actually give some
suggestions for people in Asia but what
you should do i hope you will look at
the suggestions and ask do they make
sense for for the culture that you live
in one of the things is i think what
every University every department needs
to have a strategic plan if you're going
to go into some area let's say you're
going to go into bioinformatics you're
not going to be able to go out and hire
world-class faculty in one or two years
you're going to take you maybe 5-10
years to get there and so you've got to
know how are you going to plan and how
you're going to have the kind of
consistency it takes to really get the
quality that that I'm sure that you want
second thing is to make salaries
competitive
every country that I go to that is
struggling with their educational system
seems to have a poor salary structure
often the the salaries are government
controlled and this means that there's
not going to be competition between
universities now one of the things I
probably should not have put the word
salary up there because that may be a
technical term what I should have put is
compensation because even if the
government determines what the salary is
that doesn't mean that the compensation
has to equal the salary you can find
some strategy where you can make the
total compensation competitive and I can
talk about that tomorrow I can tell you
how some institutions are doing that
even though the government controls the
salary well as a simple thing and i'll
put microsoft on the spot here so there
are creative ways of fixing that salary
issue but i do have to tell you in the
US it is very competitive and that's why
the salaries are quite nice you have to
increase flexibility if you're going to
have creativity I think you have to
adopt international standards for
evaluation and promotion I really
believe that as an institution when a
promotion comes up you ought to find out
how does this person compare when you
ask people internationally another issue
is transparency it ought to be clear to
faculty when they're first hired and it
ought to be clear to students and so
forth what all the rules and regulations
are a faculty member ought to know what
the criterion for promotion is a
graduate student ought to know what the
criterion is for being in good standing
what the criterion for up a thesis is
you got to have this kind of
transparency the next item our PhD to
faculty ratio PhDs are so important for
faculty development that you've got to
have enough PhD students and of a high
enough quality that a junior faculty
member
can have two or three ph.ds to supervise
how many students should is a faculty
member supervise or it depends on the
area I suspect it if you're a faculty
member and systems you can do more than
if you're a faculty member say who's
theoretical like i am but i'm currently
supervising for students and two of them
are sort of just starting so I'm helping
them just with classes and things like
that I'm talking to them about research
two of them are quite well into their
research so I'm spending quite a few
hours a week in or interacting with them
but that seems three or four seems to be
the number that one can do quite quite
easily I talked about the increase of
the use of English another thing that's
important is a coherent physical
location it's hard to tell you how
important it is that faculty be in the
same building and if possibly on the
same floor if they have to be on two
floors then it would be nice if there is
an atrium with an open stairwell
connecting the two floors because you
want faculty to run into each other
during the day and and chat maybe when
they're going to get coffee things of
that type and the bottom line is faculty
government's decisions ought to be mean
University ought to be made by the
faculty not by the administration and i
can tell you i was in administration I
was a Dean of a college of engineering
and one of the hardest things to do is
to get faculty to make decisions they
kind of wanted to push them up to me and
I had to constantly explain to them that
they were in a better position to make
decisions than I was I thought I would
just put a clever slide in here this is
just to show you the value of a
strategic plan if you don't have a
strategic plan you'll be making little
minor decisions which will be taking you
in all kinds of different directions but
what a strategic plan does is it puts a
little force field on here which lines
up those little decisions you make and
make them all point in one direction and
believe me it's little tiny decisions
that when you make hundreds of them that
really move the
the institution along so getting on to
it to another issue how do you spot and
how do you mentor talent one of the
things is you've got to get to know your
students so I teach a course typically
at a u.s. University the teaching at the
top universities the teaching assignment
is one courses semester so nine o'clock
monday wednesday friday i teach that in
addition to those three hours that I'm
lecturing to the students I hold office
hours five hours a week so each each day
I specify one hour when I will be in my
office and that time is reserved for the
students who are in my course i won't
make another appointment then and it's
amazing how well i learn how much i
learn about my students typically 5 to
10 students and they give an hour come
see me we talk help them if they don't
understand something in the class but
they also get the sense that i care
about their success and probably the
most important thing in a student with a
student is not how while you lecture not
how well you know the material that
whether you convey to the student that
you care about the students success
that's probably the most important thing
in the students learning another thing i
do is i often assign optional homework
problems ones which are not required
there's no credit for them they're very
difficult students probably aren't gonna
be able to do many of them but they're
exciting and they get the student to
talk to other students about them and
quite often a student will come in and
talk about these exciting problems and
that's one way of identifying a student
who is really good we offer research
experience for undergraduates quite
often what I do is I get one of my
graduate students to work with me and
the undergraduates as a group how often
do I meet with students with a PhD
student if I don't see the student at
least
a couple hours a week the students going
to get an email from me and asking there
are you ill or something or why aren't
you in and in fact I got to mention
something about Asian students it takes
me awhile to get ages students to
realize to recognize that even though
I'm a faculty member they can come in
and talk to me so apparently there is
something in the culture where they feel
they can't approach me so it usually
takes me a month or two to get students
to know that I'm there to help them and
i'll tell you a funny story because i
had a student here from China who came
into my office and I had asked her to
tell me several research areas she might
want to work in and she mentioned three
of them and I said well which one do you
really want to work in and then she told
me one of them and I said okay how did
you pick that and what she told me was
when I mentioned the three areas that I
might work in I watched your face to see
if I could determine which one you liked
most and that's the one I picked well I
had to add to tell her that's not the
way we do research in the United States
that I wanted her to pick is something
that is really exciting to her because
if it's not exciting to her she's not
going to put her best effort into it and
so there are some cultural things that
have to have to get changed a little bit
okay so I'm going to move on to how to
get started in research some of this is
obvious one of the things is positioned
yourself for the future my career took
place over the last thirty and forty
years but I have to be careful that I
don't advise students to do work that I
was doing during my career because
that's not the work that's going to be
important in their career their career
is going to be the next 30 years
secondly I test
students to avoid well-established open
problems if someone comes in and says
they're going to work on the P equal NP
problem we have a little discussion as
to how many hundreds of people who have
worked on it they're probably better
than either of us and we're not likely
to make much progress so it's much
better to formulate a new direction and
one of the things I tell them is start
simple and also the most important thing
is to get students to ask simple
questions so what I'm going to do for
the rest of my talk is I'm going to
illustrate how some researchers actually
got into research and I'm cheating a
little bit because two of these are PhD
students from Xinhua University who
spent six months at Cornell and one of
the things it turns out that china is
willing to fund scientists to spend time
in the United States and I usually have
two or three faculty from China in my
research group so sometimes some of the
things are a little bit more
sophisticated but I tried to pick things
here which were students so one of the
things an undergraduate came into my
office and wanted to do we have a
research experience so I gave him a
paper and it was a paper by a number of
researchers at Yahoo most of them are at
Yahoo one of them is Microsoft and in
this paper the researchers introduced
the concept of an alpha beta community
and an alpha beta community is a bunch
of nodes in a graph where each node in
the community is connected to a fraction
of nodes in the community at least beta
nodes and each member outside the
community is connected to it most a
lower faction alpha and so the student
or I better just show you a picture of
what an alpha beta community is so the
vertices that are in the community are
connected to quite a few vertices in the
community vertices which are outside are
connected to very few a vertice inside
could be connected to many outside that
doesn't matter and there was this
underground
from Bangkok super Soren we were just
talking and he asked me the quest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
