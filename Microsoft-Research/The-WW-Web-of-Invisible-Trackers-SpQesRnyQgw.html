hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
I've been the India 15 years ago and
then there was this first trip to Delhi
just quite interesting lots of changes
since then so when I was hoping to tell
you a bit more how this work fit in the
part of the research agenda that we have
my team in Cambridge England is called
integrated systems which really doesn't
mean anything typically assistance means
do whatever you want to do and then we
stayin in the area of information
management and communication systems but
as you know things information has moved
very fast so initially I remember i
joined microsoft search with about 15
years ago and at that time we were
looking at browser and how people were
browsing and why don't you have
highlighting when you do search in the
browser or was that the browsing session
that was before being by the way where
we were actually logging people try to
understand what were the issues is
browsing and then we moved to general
area of how do you search books for
example when you have a digital
artifacts they're very complex how can
you get into more semantic search and so
on most recent stuff things move towards
social so communication came in very
strong a communication and communication
through media came very strong and media
is also sharing information so
information sharing and information
management and searching again was kind
of progressed so as the field moves we
need to adjust our research agenda
that's why we thought we we have a
progression there and what I will be
showing you today is something that has
to do generally about digital how do we
deal with digital in particular what has
happened to us is that we do not have
any place where to put our digital
assets so I like to call this an era of
it's a feudal era so I don't have a home
for my digital stuff most of the people
on earth now have facebook as their
primary space where they keep the
digital assets I have things on my hard
drive but again go bust any time so I
don't know I don't really have much of
control I can put things in the dropbox
skydrive but then i'm putting in
somebody else's territory in some of the
else's real estate and my negotiation
power how much I owned it
and how much I have control of it is
very minimal so we are really talking
about being homeless in a digital space
and so one thing vision of what we would
like to understand is what would be a
digital real estate what would be
something how would look if I had
something that would last for my
lifetime and you know cloud is
interesting your cloud bottom is coming
in so it's offering certain things
you're also spreading the devices and
trying to think how we can stitch them
up so that's another thing so in all
this kind of ecosystem how can we think
about what a digital estate would be
it's important enough for us it's both
of our children because what's happening
is they are being pushed more and more
toward services being pushed towards
digital my kids do all their homework
digital I haven't seen anything on the
paper for a while accepted into art okay
but then I had to scan it okay so anyway
so everything is going digital and if
you need to have something digital it
has to last 100 yes at least because
this is how how this is what my son
tells me Mommy you may have some hope I
probably will be leaving about 100 she
stopped all my organs can be replaced
now I can grow a new tissue my teeth can
be renewed so so anyway the kids are
planning to live more than hundred years
we need to have infrastructure to
support them in the digital world 400
years ok so this work comes because
there is something a design of digital
that is not very transparent so we've
designed this complex computing systems
and then we decide what we were put in
interface and who decides that and and
what's the prob what's the value
proposition there how do I decide what
to present to users so far the value was
we're going to make it simple simple and
you'll be productive so simplicity
productivity was the main driver but
then as you will see now from so couple
examples things are happening that
people don't know and that very purpose
in the way so that people have little
control or even nothing to say about and
this is about the browser so i will be
discussing this issue of a lack of
transparency in the design which are
actually is a prerequisite if you're
going to create systems that people who
understand and be able to control for
100 years okay and it really many can a
mini contribution to that bigger agenda
so it's about awareness and in this
particular case people the value
proposition of the IE interfaces you go
and get information okay and internet
and web has been put forward to us as
big repository information that you can
get two for free it's not really free
but you know you're paying internet
providers to get you and get you dare
you think you covered so you pay and
you're getting services now this is
what's happening it when when you look
at the page the number other part is
being involved so all these little icons
there or advertisements they're coming
from other parties and people normally
don't don't pay attention to that the
seat is a coherent thing and they see it
coming from the first part in meaning in
this guy in this case New York Times
this is what they're getting from New
York Times okay so what we are trying to
understand how people can become aware
of what's on the interface what the
value proposition is when they are using
a particular interface in this case by
third-party we mean any anybody who is
being referred to by a first party and
unfortunately most of these people who
are third party are not there just to
provide content they're also tracking
people and I'm just here in listing
couple of mechanisms and you may be
aware of it and most of people are aware
there are things happening the precise
mechanisms are not always very clear and
most of the time the cookies are these
little files that people put on your
computer and you can think of them as
badges so I had somebody give me a badge
I have a cookie say I got New York Times
badge so when I move around people can
see me that I had a new obtains badge as
I'm moving around and we're moving
around me is going from one side from
another and every time I land on another
another website I can be asked whether
I've got that badge if the same
companies associated with a new site so
that's how the cookies work it's like
I'm being tagged and then people can
watch me as I move around but of course
this is nothing compared to other things
that are happening the real thing is
that this
taking an individual and tracking most
of the time seems anonymous so some kind
of IP address and I may have multiple
devices or who cares I can fuss that the
problem is when you have companies like
Facebook for example or when you
actually install the toolbar or when you
actually log in and then from that point
on what you do is not anonymous anymore
and and this is what people don't quite
understand so we've done research in
this space and kind of 33 different
pillars first one is about awareness and
user interface so what would be the
process of designing interfaces so the
people can first become aware because if
you're not aware they cannot even
express the choice at the moment they
don't have choice because they don't
know what's happening they're not asking
for choice and the second two things are
just illustration of how two different
services we get exposed to these
trackers but really we use this to the
other studies one with search another
one is social min Twitter just to
illustrate the scale so what what we
will see today is empirical study of the
tracking network some properties again
you can argue we use a machine learning
and statistical analysis just to get the
flavor of it we haven't solved anything
so they're not at the moment no solution
they've got some insights in about in a
user behavior and what is the threshold
of sensitivity that's required to kind
of move people to think about things so
a little bit of that we made progress
but the other two things are really just
for our understanding who was the scale
of it and what might we hoped reason
about it okay so first just going back
to see what we offer to people if people
wanted to do something about cookies
this is what they get so on the left
side what's interesting Microsoft gives
you a slider and says you want to reason
about of your privacy well you can you
can have a medium privacy you can have
high privacy or low privacy okay it's
very interesting I mean just this very
concept that previously has a scale is
interesting right and and then on
firefox it doesn't do this but it gives
you options normally as an option you
have you can
block block all the cookies and it's
problematic because you will see cookies
can come from the first party or third
party and the third party among those
the third party cookies are the trackers
and the ecosystem is very complex so you
have first party for also trackers and
song you'll see that in a minute but
it's really difficult for Firefox again
you have boxes and you can tick off
things whatever you do will stay valid
until you remove it so the the
flexibility of this is such that it's
not it's not possible to change your
settings based on your very active
browsing just focusing a little bit more
on microsoft stuff so suppose I I bumped
my thing up all the way and say I really
want a super privacy here the problem is
that the multiple steps or multiple
layers in the interface so in this
particular interface you have first in a
normal privacy section you can say
maximum primacy and then you can go and
check with advanced means so here I'm
checking with advancements and when I
open it I actually see that what is
grayed out the status is still to accept
accept all the cookies so so now I'm
thinking in one part of the interface I
bumped it up if i look at the advance it
doesn't seem like it it took into
account my decision so then of course
you can go in and you can uncheck it but
then you then you're kind of overriding
the default and you don't know what the
default was is it before that you set it
up in the first place or not and so so
in a way you see even if people did want
to reason about it and make some steps
it's really hard to unpick and you can
argue well this wasn't supposed to be
four and use this anyway it was supposed
to be for administrators who would
understand more I'm just hoping that
also administrator would know what this
means this going back if you look at the
medium one if you just read what it says
at the top if you're making decision and
says in a medium it blocks third-party
cookies that do
not have a compact privacy policy okay
so there are a lot of notions here that
I don't know what the administers would
know it either because this is a legal
language and so so it's not very clear
who this is for and it seems a bit more
of a patchwork rather than taught
through process okay so i think i made
point at the moment and people are not
aware and whatever control will provide
to people who are aware it's a bit
confusing and so for the general public
we're thinking what would be the process
of moving people from total ignorance to
some sort of action and in order to
design and the reason about this a bit
we were just looking at the work that
was done in previous by the warnings so
assuming that quick cookies are not
desirable so assuming and you want to
warn people what will be the process you
would like to walk them through and on
the right hand side this is a particular
framework which is called communication
human information processing framework
that says you have a channel of
communication in that channel
communication you have a recipient and
then what's going to happen is you have
to get their attention first and then
you're hoping that they're going to
engage into some reasoning and there's a
comprehension part and after that even
if they understand that something is
happening then I say okay that's fine I
don't really care so there are certain
set of beliefs and attitudes towards it
so you have to you may need to think
about if you want them to change because
dangerous for them then you have to
think about how to change the beliefs
and in order for them to change beliefs
they need to be motivated to listen or
even be motivated to act so it's very
complex process to getting people from
total and awareness to action it's a
very long process and so what we're
hoping now to do is just get their
attention and maybe get a little bit of
a comprehension just just a bit we tried
I mentioned before the the box that
people had to take off we're sort of
almost like an offline process when
you're online you will have to go back
or continuously check as changing the
status so we're looking at whether there
is something
and that we can do in the real time so
when people are browsing maybe they can
act oh we don't really know what is the
right when is the right timing so you
may be aware by the number of plug-ins
for browsers among them a ghost or a
ghost story keeps a check of cookies and
then it has little interface showing
which domains where be associated so far
you can tick off a tick them off if you
want them to disappear and so on but it
wasn't really completely real time and
you couldn't get an idea how powerful of
cookies or how connected the cookie is
it within the ecosystem so so we decided
to implement another prototype I'll show
you now for Firefox and that one is
based on the principle I'll show it to
you in real time what's happening okay
and let me just far off so I'm going to
go to a new york times just to show you
happen to New York and so if I go to New
York Times that very moment all these
cookies are downloaded on my computer so
please Lex how often I'll just repeat
the things that fell off the page of the
top of the page are for each domain
number of cookies that are in so each of
these here is representing a third-party
domain the green one is New York Times
so the new x 1 and includes it with 41
cookies let them now on my computer and
you can argue well with a fine I don't
really care new trance claimed in
Dunedin so okay need them to run their
website that's fine okay so I'm kind of
assuming we have and I and the New York
Times have an agreement because this is
where i went to now I just don't know
what these other other ones are doing so
here's another one this is double-click
double-click has only three cookies but
these three cookies have been installed
on 87 other sites that i visited and so
as I go around then double-click now
that i've been in this
they probably have session information
who knows what they have and so I don't
really know what they have all i know is
that whenever I visited this site and
they knew about it and see the height of
the bar means how many cookies the
redness of it or the color of it depends
on how many other domains were involved
okay all right so we we show these
people and believe or not but lots of
people didn't even click on these things
because they didn't okay didn't know
that they can click on them baby and we
didn't really give him a tutorial so
that they would understand a little bit
how to use the interface but the real
key was that people were just there to
read the news so we're not getting them
the right time people have a task in
mind so whatever you do at that moment
you are offering a trade or between
immediate need or immediate desire for
information and then attention to
something else that never heard them did
they develop ever bleeding they never
never nobody ever target them so it's
really hard to comprehend what the
implications of this are so we decided
to have a conversation with these people
we have about 15 of them using it for a
while we put them in three different
conditions one nothing so no interface
whatsoever one with go story and one
with ours just to see whether the
attitude change changes and how they
would react generally if you show them
the the scale of tracking there was no
much difference in the attitude before
after the study so people didn't get
much better idea or what's going on with
cookies so even if you give them right
at the same time give them a list of
cookies or give them a these real-time
bars didn't really make much difference
on the attitude believe in fact that we
have a development center in Belgrade
and we said okay guys do you want to try
it and they said well we already
blocking everything so the developers
actually already controlling the
exposure so for them they're so
technical people seem to be aware and
they
a already taken measures to do this so
the developers we didn't this wouldn't
this would like a little gimmick they
were using other other matters already
so and most of them were just browsing
the private mode which pragma browsing
normally cuts down all the cookies but
you lose your history so is the problem
and they yeah using the ghost story
because through go so you can manage
over which period you can block certain
domains and so on so we developers yeah
I don't really know how you petition the
kind of market do partitioning based on
technical abilities like education the
partitioning based on other people
behaviors like with the attitudes
whether they care not care i don't
really know at the moment so so but what
we've done as a follow up they actually
showed people different representation
of this it is a natural clip
presentation so let me show you this is
a graph a network created based on a log
for one person for seven days and i'm
just filtering out a little bit so you
can see so we created this network by
simply pulling information from the log
we have a pair a domain the person
visited and then cookies or third party
that were referred to so this is what we
call a referral network and you will
find information but what's referred to
in HTTP header so it's easy to parse and
get out so in this particular case i'll
just show you example if i go to forbes
so the person went to the forbes website
at that moment it is these cookies that
these third parties that got involved so
they will refer to a by forbes among
them are different types of nodes when
you're looking at network analysis you
can look at the inn links and out links
all of these green dots are websites so
if i look for example a double click
double click is connected with all the
other sites or the many of these green
sites and also with some
the red sighs so if you look at the
edges going from the green to
double-click meaning that whenever I
landed on the website and the website
referred to double-click but also double
could refer to some other companies like
advertising.com or mocha 1.com or media
plants com okay so obviously
double-click has a very interesting role
it is a broker so it goes from the
website and then goes to the other
trackers or I would other nodes in the
education system and people who are
advertised know better and then it is a
probably add service serving the ads or
it may be a service are bidding because
the double click now says here's the
person landing at Forbes here's a person
also who was there before easyjet so who
wants to bid for the next move and so
when the person goes to the next site
which advertisement will be shown
interestingly there are other nodes like
Google Analytics the proper ones or
skolka research they are very similar if
you look at them they primarily have in
links so the sites are referring to them
very rarely they have another edge going
to add some other tracker or some yeah
so this company's self specific type of
services to individual websites let's
say we will analyze your website so
whenever somebody lands on on on your
side please just refer to us we will
collect the analytics and will serve it
back to you so it's two different value
propositions double-click is tracking
people across the sites and enabling
these companies the green green dots to
do what we call marketing campaigns okay
so the value proposition is marketing
campaigns forum for the Google Analytics
is vertically optimizing a website where
is the citizen where is the user is
outside this network it doesn't feature
any we're here and this is the web and
that's why i call this world wide web
its international tracking system which
is sitting on top of information system
of the web yeah and so it doesn't matter
where you are you as a citizen or user
you just step on the website
it and you're part of this network you
can't escape because it is the property
of the web it's not property of my
behavior it is it is really the web so
in this particular case we are just
looking we are observing the net from
that is based on on the browsing and
then I'll show you later what it looks
like if you look at the if you if you
really want to understand now how broad
double-click is covering the web then
you have to apply different methods
because this is just based on an
individual so we show this to people and
we have transcripts or the interviews is
really interesting so you have a
conversation about cookie tracking SL
yeah and then you come to this point and
there's ago oh is that how it's done and
then the next ticket and what can I do
and we say well we have the conversation
later because we don't know what it can
do you can't you can't debug the web
this is the problem we can we can and
try to protect people not to step on
certain certain places but it's really
really hard because the servers already
Service is tracking on the server side
not only just checking on on a client
side so yeah so we don't have a solution
but we're trying to increase the
awareness because one thing would be the
companies like Forbes and Europe times
it is them who have a business with
third parties so I'm not sure how New
York Times will feel if we actually
expose this and say New York Times yes
you're selling news we're going to tell
the world also how many other companies
you associate with your site okay so
maybe we can play in that card and say
look you should be informing your
readers that when I stop on your website
and if they don't like it well maybe you
should provide them another page this is
different sort of page where you don't
have this tracking now whether that's
going to ever happen we don't know it's
just a an interesting thought yes New
York Times will be getting something
probably the ability to run their
website for free you have to pay for and
then they have no excuse ones riding you
and information for free they have to
run that business in some way yes and
then the problem with informing so a lot
of British sites right now have this
thing at the top they say we use cookies
yeah and I'm like what happens yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeahs have to say yes yeah I
can you know yes it's the whole there's
such a murky issue isn't it yes as you
say the whole thing about where you have
choice away don't yes you actually quite
limited because they always say you know
same with the captures oh you can you
cannot use the surface yeah well I sort
of need to use my pocket yes yes exactly
so but in the public doesn't know first
then they cannot put any they cannot
even express the choices so the fact
that now they say we use cookies take it
or leave it they don't say we use
trackers on our website because we don't
mind if they use their cookies into the
run the site but the fact that they're
using trackers and they're basically
selling us this is very interesting it
they're selling information and we have
no choice and we don't know what the
consequences are so it's really unknown
maybe they're not no harm done and maybe
we cannot argue about harm now but you
can definitely argue about preferences
because if the society does respect
privacy so it's not Universal in some
some you know if you were born in form
of Russia then you have no privacy okay
so that is not know this is mute kind of
argument but things are changing so even
even in Russia chinks are changing so we
we would like people to become aware and
then we hope that they will be
expressing the preference and then we
hope that they'll be positive change
because the reason why this is happening
is because there is no control what's
also interesting is we have in industry
we have two camps there are companies
they have lots of data by their
customers these are like 3am Strutter
and gambled is a company's Laurel you
know these are companies that have
relationship with customers they have
lots of data about them but they are now
and the same attack if you wish or
privacy attacks
the companies like these who are Cowboys
the reason why they're doing this
because nobody knows not nobody nobody
is watching this and you know the the
conversation with governments especially
in the UK they don't really know the
extent of this and then when they're
looking at you guess what the thought is
Oh debacle he'll get lots of information
oh we cannot actually put an ID national
ID in place but we can talk to
double-click so so in a way they can get
this got this information about citizens
from the commercial sector so there
would be balanced even there we cannot
really assume that governments will work
for the citizens necessarily maybe
that's not your area but Jimmy I always
I'm always interested in that question
of you know how does this compare to are
we really being tracked like at no other
time or is it that back then we wouldn't
go anywhere so nobody cared about us I
mean you know how what's the kind of
what are the kind of historical parallel
are there not know how do you put this
in context so I don't believe that
jackie has been done by national
security agencies all the time and so so
on one side if you think if you being
tracked by own government people people
don't like it but they they also there
is a balance because they will they will
protect you is something is wrong so you
you feel that you were going to elect
the government who's going to protect
you at the same time government has
jails okay so so in a way and there is
also another aspect of the gun we are
being tracked now by international
companies who are in the business of
selling advertisements we do not
necessarily have to be aware they don't
have jails do they so even if do
something wrong now there's nobody to
punish on is this world okay unless now
governments go in and say well this
person looked at porn okay we want this
person give it them to us and at the
moment because this is international of
course in some countries that that is
more harmful and others less if a woman
in Jordan goes and look at the
contraception is gonna be different for
a woman in the United States and so how
can then companies that a kind of
digital technologies computer
technologies company is going to design
so that people who who would like to
control their privacy can do that
because inadvertently they can be
exposed to regimes that are not adhering
to the same set of values okay so
previously general is very different
from security when we talked about a con
context we often talk about security
that is provided to us by national
bodies organizations and so on this is
different this is privacy previous is
highly contextual as i said is my
sixteen-year-old daughter goes and
looked at the hotels and I look and I
see this hotels edit eyes and she moves
around okay I'll be asking her well
what's going on I know you have part in
Saturday why do you need a hotel okay
well she would not like it right because
okay why did Google advertise now reveal
that she's looking at you were just
maybe just looking at okay and then she
get grounded in no party it's okay so
okay so the consequences are not
life-threatening perhaps but in some
instances there are and they are highly
contextual yeah so what we are hoping
basically with this we don't really know
if you show this to people you can shock
them but whether that will then take any
further action as you remember you have
comprehension and then you have
motivation okay beliefs and behaviors
and then motivation for change and how
can you move these people to sign the
petition or go to an arguing Congress or
whatever then list needs to be done as a
social change left okay so but i'll just
move on quickly and to show you so the
main point here was yes we are being
tracked and the user interfaces are not
paying as much about it and the next two
things are just going to be about the
scope so just to understand a little bit
about the ecosystem this is now more of
a kind of economic view of it and people
who are working in bing and may like to
see this just putting in perspective
what search means in this context so web
we know now is all bugged why is it back
to its bug because the websites actually
engaged third parties third parties
trackers or third party to develop
delivered advertising advertising is
based on what we call real-time tracking
means and they can sell them behavioral
modeling and so in order to understand
what happens to ask me we do search we
decided to run
experiments we took a corpus about 600
original corpus at about 800 queries and
this were from k DD cup 2005 so you can
argue Saul queries but what was good
about this corpus is because it's
publicly available so other people can
reproduce the experiments but also they
had that it was done at the time when
people were very interested in
categories of queries so it was done as
a part of the competition to categorize
Cleary's so that enable a neighbor has
to pick queries in certain categories
and see whether tracking is different if
you are searching from for shopping or
you are going to honor some kind of
government site illegal site so just to
see whether there's any difference so we
ran the about 600 queries for which we
were assured that the labels were
correct and we ran them in with two
different engines so it's Bing and
Google we've done it in four different
markets in India South Africa United
Kingdom United States primarily because
the queries were in English so and
results were in English we thought it
would be so so we then for each of these
each query in each market we look at the
top 10 results and then for each of the
10 results we looked at the trackers
okay so then we we looked at the network
so this this is a graph over what they
call a connected component so in other
network is huge but then we just said
give us the connected component in this
graph and this kind of jumbled thing is
combinational websites so unique
websites that we've seen for this
example queries and this is in the
Indian market the red bits are third
parties so either trackers or the
delivery of advertisements now you can
see it's very very densely connected and
we try to spread it a little bit so we
pushed to the clustering algorithm and
and kind of get them in the clusters
which means that they are connected but
some of them are more connecting than
others so you can see the kind of
circles of this dark dots which would
websites
they're obviously connecting with
specific brokers or advertising agencies
it is often the case that the same site
has multiple of them what you see in the
middle are the big trackers so and you
can see if they have a little markets if
you wish submarkets yeah so this is this
is what we found in the Indian market
and then this is google in the united
states market there's not really much
difference and i can show you that
there's not much difference is just look
at them statistics so this is the table
that shows the statistics on the
properties of the networks but most
important things that are on the bottom
showing that for each of them vertical
which is the market we just look at how
many nodes are in this connected
component and you can see very large
ninety-two percent of the nodes are in
the big component and then if you look
at the edges almost ninety nine percent
meaning that the know that are outside
are really not very well connected so
they don't really count for much so so
anyway this is just showing if you if
you basically and a in use search then
you will become part of this you're
immediately being tracked a couple of
other things about the property of this
network and it behaves like a small
world network which means they're
extremely the shallow and they were very
good for propagating information okay so
we just did some experiments what
happens if you remove double-click how
disturbed that network becomes and it
become less effective in fact so the two
graphs show that in simulation on the
left side the number of dots that goes
like like this represent them small
world networks and our network is very
close closely aligned with the
properties if you're on the right hand
side if you remove you can see that the
our network actually is away from the
ideals small world network and another
thing we've done a little bit in a
Chinese market where these things are
just emerging and this is the Chinese
market he has only 100 queries and it's
very very similar similarly to double
we can google analytics you have two
different companies that they have the
same so it's by do that by the dicom
which became it behaves similarly to
double click and then they hit qqing and
behaving like google analytics so so
it's interesting this phenomenon is
happening in in other markets as well
and now just to reflect a little bit
what this means so if because I'm
information retrieval you're also
thinking a lot how to improve search
what sort of things to do but the fact
is that whatever however well we improve
search it doesn't matter is going to get
into double with hands because it's
whatever you do it really doesn't really
matter the money is being made in a
different way and we know this sort of
we do know and but this just as the soy
eloquently so then the question the
question really is a what sort of
baffled do we do the fight this is a
showing that if you are if how quickly I
as a individual become tracked when i'm
using search yeah so essentially this is
saying that if you look at the graph
here this destroys on the bottom how
many clicks 10 clicks 20 clicks 30
clicks 40 clicks and this just turns me
the probability that i will be tracked
it will say bye all top 10 trackers so
the red one shows me what is the
likelihood that i'm going to be tracked
by top 10 trackers and he says that it
is more than ninety nine percent if i
did 3 30 clicks in my life if I did only
26 in my life is ninety percent so this
is not even procession this is just
clicking in on the top top search
results and this is it so if i wanted to
clear my cookies i really need to be
clearing very fast ya I can't relax at
all I have to have a little robot doing
this for me yeah and I actually it won't
work if I just clear them I probably
need to be more sophisticated I have to
do something with my IP address i may
need to change the configuration or like
system all the time because the
fingerprinting me and so on okay so
that's the news on the tracking finally
there were no difference really about
which topic you are tracking it just as
you can see doesn't really matter a
little bit less tracking happens on
information law and politics and
information science and technology so
that means that this company's legal
companies probably would be more careful
and not know not to lose their face and
so there may be may not be aligning with
tracklist that often and the similar
thing maybe IT industry they are they
know what it means so maybe they would
not do that to the people who are
visiting and so we don't know but it's
basically slightly less than then for
others good okay and the final push I
know discipline too much information
just the five ministers to look at
another aspect of this and so we now
know that the web is bugged we know that
you can't escape the question then is
knowing that how do we behave in social
networks environments so what is the
problem of the problem is that if you
basically go on Twitter or in facebook
or you can you send you an email suppose
I sent you an email and I put a URL in
okay so I so this is fantastic BBC
article go and check it out and suppose
also they are protecting myself from
cookies should I tell you that if you
open this site you should also be
careful and do protect yourself from the
cookies okay so it's really about social
responsibilities so far sharing
information has been seen as a very very
positive thing and now the question is
when you're sharing information is it
your responsibility to warn the
recipients that you that the Site may be
contaminated if you wish and then you
decontaminate yourself but you know they
should do the same thing it is very
tricky so this is what we've done again
we looked at the Twitter data just to
see a little bit how often people share
things among themselves and we took it
check the hashtags on topics and also
there are hashtags related to a
following particular user and so we had
but
20 of the users hashtags and and topics
based and for the analysis on a topic
space we had about five million tweets
and then for the top users about eight
million tweets among them we just looked
at those that had URLs in them and it's
very small percentage it's not it's not
large and which is really good I thought
but still there enough there is enough
that the people get tracked so this is
what these are the companies that are
being used so this is the URL
distribution in a set-top user data set
so what are the companies that we
normally retweet about it's a youtube
and you should also see that because of
the shortening of your house the same
company is being referred it's just the
it looks different so YouTube and you'd
be is the same thing and then we also
looked at the number of third parties
associated with them and you can YouTube
it not too bad you can argue on itself
strikers but then you get to tumblr in
246 and then you ask yourself why is
that and you realize the I don't use
tumblr but I looked at the little bit so
there you can create your own kind of
little site where you can show who you
are and share things and of course each
person who uses tumblr may have
different set of trackers associated
depending on what sort of things they
put their yeah so that's why the sad
look stop very bad but otherwise as I
said per person is not too bad okay then
we did the network analysis both for the
topics just look at the edges and now
say and I just want to show you how the
social part looked like so we use the
topic on politics and look at look at
the connected components so on the right
hand side there's a lot of people who
retweet your else but the know very well
connected you have what we call
distribution lists so these are debt
will be tweeting all the time URLs and
then you have the social part with
different topics appear people retweet
to each other in this case the nodes the
red nodes and the black notes are really
old people this
is not about trackers or anything just
people and the size may I think is here
it refers to the number of followers and
the redness means how often the person
is active in retreating and these two
things are not always the same okay but
people who are retreating in this case
we know they are there spreading things
so and then we the biggest component
this one here we just again plus it a
bit further and you can see a little sub
sub groups of people who are retreating
to each other and from the perspective
of you are tracking those are the people
who contaminate each other continuously
okay so then basically sharing sharing
the trackers okay alright so it was just
interesting to see how how these things
happen and and then we look at the track
us of a bit more not bother you with
this but one thing I wanted to show you
is this after we analyzed them the
network of the trackers based on a
search and based on these tweets we are
basically now just looking at the type
types of trackers and there are
different categories that's why it's so
complicated and that's why I get angry
when I see this sweeping statement we
are using cookies take it or leave it
and because it's very complex in fact
the roles of these trackers is different
so the red ones are double clicks of the
world so these are the brokers okay and
then the green ones are the ends of the
pass in the network those are the
companies that deliver ads so after the
brokering is done they kind of bring
things in but the blue ones are the ones
that are really scary and why is it
because double-click and never go I
never seen double-click and I don't go
to their website similarly the green
ones are the ad providers I don't ever
see them but the blue ones have a dual
role these are the companies that
actually have websites like Facebook so
I go to facebook facebook give me a
certain there is a value proposition
when i use facebook but facebook doesn't
tell me that there's been distracting me
across sites I can forgive them for
doing it within the site but why are
they doing across sites that was not an
agreement yeah
what they do is the little F facebook
sign that you see across websites now
these are their Cup marketing campaigns
so whenever I see website with F on it
you know you're being tracked because
that information goes to them directly
if you are also logged in any way the
the most disturbing to me is the ad is
blue thing because the business model
then is double dipping so they get my
information that they can make money of
it and then they also go around and
check me and i have i have no idea
review without there when you wash your
life so again this network you can see
the different roles often you when you
go to and say how do certain you have
this eat our website and e how knows
everything whatever you ask on the web
they have an answer for it and then you
realize there's nothing else but a nest
of trackers and similarly so just from
from this kind of network a little bit
of the ecosystem understanding why is
this all happening well it's happening
because we know from from the beginning
of times that the vendors always wanted
to have a relationship with consumers
now when we went digital and e-commerce
started we didn't provide anything to
them to establish the link between their
businesses and consumers there was
nothing okay we had the generic browser
with generic HTTP protocols and guess
what it was then used for it it just it
wasn't each of these vendors say suppose
BMW we have their own site but they also
want to advertise on other sites because
this on their site is not enough so
that's why we have on the left side we
have a demand we have people who would
like to advertise and then everybody
else on the web is a supplier they can
accept
advertisement on their real estate so
then on the right-hand side we have
websites for supplying space okay so it
would be inefficient if each vendor will
communicate with everybody just you know
you may do it with a friend okay do some
cross cross posting that's why this
centralized roll occurred so that's why
i double-click stepped in its ok no
problem we will do the communication
between the demand and supply and so
that's why i doing edit exchange
services well right there yeah so this
is what we are observing in our website
studies so far we are observing just
what's going on on it on the supply side
we don't really see much on the demand
side but we know we can definitely see
the patterns only so as I said we didn't
solve anything we just have a better
understanding what it is and I like this
irony in computer science we work very
hard to bring computer to the masses and
with the wig interface auto
revolutionized and in early computing
era we had only mathematicians that
decision computer scientist writing
programs so you know do calculations for
building bridges but then we became a
divisive interface to remove people from
programming so that they can use can be
in domain experts and use computers so
WYSIWYG proposition was very good
proposition the problem is that we went
too far so the obstructed things so far
that people don't really know what's
happening and so what you don't see is
in this case it's what you pay and
you're paying with your personal data
and it's britta see ya so so so
generally I mean this design X
investigation will continue and we will
probably have to join forces on many
levels looking at a lower layers and
design layers and then some of you have
to speak for us when it comes to the
policy I am actually hoping that we will
be able to displace this not necessarily
by regulations but by other forces so if
you have a business fuzzy delete the
business okay if this was this came in
place because there was a business knee
and it wasn't satisfied and is satisfied
now in a way that we don't like maybe we
should come in with another business
proposition to the vendors and say no we
will be able to show you achieve help
you achieve what you really want you
really want to have a relationship with
your customers and maybe skype would be
the right technology now we have a
technologist where we can embed
communication in webpage website web
pages even so so then perhaps by
offering another way to vendors to
connect with customers we can displace
the blocklist because they are there
only because the vendors can't do it ok
great thank you yeah so creating noise
in the system yeah yeah so that would be
one strategy some people again people
who know how to do it that would have a
little BOTS and just work on them to
disguise themselves but that would be
one strategy yeah I want technical
strategy so is that the other strategies
yeah I don't know much about can tell me
more about to go into we're basically
they can't track you Oh going in there
either to you know whistleblowers before
there were journalists okay yeah I know
I just heard about yeah
yes yeah yeah we've I only learned from
the developers who on our team about his
we going black nuts they call in dark
web and these are the things that nobody
under the Sun can ever discover no
police no no federal agencies you can
get to them in a way question all is
well why we pushed all the way to that
in that direction I mean we should we
should be able to express our
preferences and have it delivered to us
it's just I don't quite know whether I'm
assuming that if there is a demand and
it there will be supply therefore if you
inform people and then create the
demands that there will be options and
that's what I'm just hoping and it's
very depressing I'll let you think about
it it just every every time we think
about this again it's just thinking
about the future and future often people
say well children don't care about
privacy as I said just before my kids
care about previously it's just
different sense of it yeah whether they
would care with a double click
double-click cannot ground them so this
is this a thing double-click it was not
going to harmed in that way but we know
that there is there is an issue more and
more now the people being profiled and I
was in conversation with very
enthusiastic students at the University
College London they've so proudly
showing me a profile they said look
Natasha we have a technology now that
instead of them delivering rubbish or
ads you can go and you can edit your
profile so they built the infrastructure
for this and then they also probably
showed me Microsoft profile of one of
them Google profile and there are seven
others and then my question then was and
you're going to go and edit all of them
and so for now now you have about seven
of them and if this takes off it's only
going to be 10,000 of them so how are
you going to then go and add your
modified profile for each of these
companies to do the job better for you
they didn't have an answer but the main
I mean disturbing point was that the
negotiation point was moved very far
from where i would like to be
negotiation is they got my data
they're not even ask and they're not
even let me erase it I can modify it but
that's it so the negotiation power is
that far from where i would like to be
