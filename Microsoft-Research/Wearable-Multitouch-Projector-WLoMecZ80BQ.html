researcher here at Microsoft Research
and today i'll talk to you about the
project called wearable multi-touch
projector which i did in collaboration
with Chris Harrison from Carnegie Mellon
and Andy Wilson here at MSR this I this
project is guided by the idea of being
able to detect and provide touch and
gestures touch and gestural interaction
on any available surface so right now in
our devices most of the interactions are
actually all the interactions are
constrained to a particular device form
factor to the screen let's say
smartphone or tablet we wanted to enable
the same kind of interactivity but on
any available surface on your wall on
your pad on your arm any surface that
you have to happen to have in front of
you to enable this we created us a
combination of a short row depth sensing
camera and a little pico projector here
and this combination actually allows us
to simulate these these interactions
anywhere so let me show you how this
works if your happen to be right in
front of the wall and if you want to get
some interface there you want to
interact on the wall all you need to do
is just touch the wall and you get
something that could be actually on your
smartphone but it's not right now just
projected in space on this surface you
can you can literally you know select an
option from that and then for example
dial a phone number just the same way
that you would on a smartphone another
example is what if we wanted to create
something here so again touching this
particular surface you've noticed that
the interface actually adapts to the
surface size and now we can use this to
draw on this pad for example so it's not
only one touch but actually you have
simultaneous multi-touch just as you
would expect from any touch enabled
application today lastly I can show you
another interface no good touch
application is done without a map so
let's do a little bit of zooming and
panning to showcase some of that stuff
so again the applications are just
demonstrations of the possibilities of
what you can enable if you have touch
and gestures on any particular surface
and for us this is enabled by this
any combination of projectors and
cameras that right now are worn but we
think we can be they could be very
miniaturized in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
