you
so thank you guys for showing up it's my
pleasure to introduce Steve Benford here
today he's actually here for today and
tomorrow and steve is the is a professor
of collaborative computing the mixed
reality laboratory at Nottingham and he
is the director of the epsrc funded
doctoral training center in ubiquitous
computing for the digital economy and
he's received numerous best paper awards
over the years and has co-authored a
book it's actually right in the back if
you wanna check it out performing mixed
reality hit me told me as a few copies
v11 copy and has recently been awarded a
two-year dream fellowship by the UK's
engineering and physical sciences
research council and I believe he's
traveling under that that funding at the
moment and I think the most interesting
thing about Steve's work is that he
manages to do lots of really interesting
interesting performance based work and
artistic and creative performances while
also making some really interesting
scholarly contributions on those works
and I think that's the that's the trick
and that's the really valuable thing
thank you thank you very much well thank
you very much for your introduction and
thank you very much for inviting me to
talk to you as well so yes for the past
10 to 15 years myself and people in the
lab seem to fallen into a mode of
working with artists particularly those
with a background in kind of theatre and
performance to create and tour and study
a series of kind of interactive
performance works and to use that as a
sort of vehicle for driving forward our
interests in human-computer interaction
and um today I'm going to draw on a kind
of car at least one of the examples of
about that work and try and pull out
some general principles perhaps for how
we might design what I'm going to argue
is kind of a sense of the extended user
experience and before we get into it
though i'll just say a kind of few quick
words i guess about why we choose to
work with artists in particularly in a
way that we think
covers being artist-led and what that
means is very often it's the artists who
come to us with the idea for the project
that they want to do and we kind of
figure out how we can help them realize
it technically and then we try and study
it and figure out what went on and so
why do we do artists led research while
I think there are three reasons one
artists are extremely creative certainly
compared to ourselves they have ideas
that stretch technologies and do
interesting things with emerging
technologies that we just wouldn't have
so that's number one number two is
public performance is a fantastic way of
conducting research in the wild of
getting these technologies into the
hands of real people albeit under a
somewhat unusual situation and figuring
out what happens and if you were kind of
working i think in highly regulated
fields medicine transportation or
whatever you might struggle to do that
but many of these projects we've turned
around from meeting the artist to
rolling out the project you know in kind
of in two to three months you saw this
as quick as that so it's a very flexible
thing and thirdly and most importantly
this stuff is just important creative
and cultural uses of computing are an
extremely important thing economically
in terms of the creative industries and
to us as human beings expressing
ourselves and being creative is a core
human value that we need to support so
damn it it's just important so as I say
work I guess 10 to 15 years probably
with somewhere between six and ten
artists groups probably created in that
period 20 or so different works and
here's some of the bits of work that I'm
not going to talk about in this lecture
one of our longest-standing
collaborations is with a group of
artists called blast Theory who would
work with since come the 1997 and the
book documents their work and the work
we've done with him quite extensively so
can you see me now is a piece of work in
which people on the streets of a real
city who were actors chased people who
are online in a virtual model of that
city and their audio is streamed out
online as well and the online players
could lead them as sort of merry dance
through the city and we studied that our
our approach to studying these things in
the wall is to use here I go ethno
methodology informed ethnography
practice that for many years with dr.
Andy Crabtree hitting me with a stick
until I said it right and that revealed
all sorts of interesting things in this
case it revealed lots of things about
how the seams in the technology is the
partial coverage of Wi-Fi and the
flakiness of GPS had to be accommodated
in how the experience was orchestrated
and that was interesting another blast
theory work I have spoken about here
before won't be talking about today was
day the figurines this was a month long
text messaging adventure game for mobile
phones but that you played very slowly
you only sent and received a few
messages each day so the game was kind
of was interwoven or became into woven
with the fabric of your everyday life
there was also a rather bizarre framing
interface that was this kind of tabletop
interface where the figurines would move
around that was in a venue that you
might only ever see once during the
whole month at the beginning but that
somehow framed or or or gave you a sense
of what the experience was about and we
published we published work about the
episodic nature of play and engagement
with a slow game we managed to write a
bit about the design of that table but
I'm not talking about that today 2008 we
began a series of collaborations with
Brendan Walker there he is a bit of a TV
personality in the UK and a thriller
engineer he would style himself as and a
part-time roller coaster designer among
other things and Brendan first came to
us because he wanted a series of
technologies that would enhance the
spectator experience of roller coasters
so we built a telemetry system that took
video and audio from these head mounted
cameras very close up quite intimate
video of people's faces heart rate
galvanic skin response and in later
versions the movements of those two
facial muscles that I can't remember
their names for smiling and frowning and
the system didn't interpret this stuff
but rather it was displayed for
spectators to see on large screens you
had a very close up view of someone
else's ride experience
and then more recently we've worked with
Brendan to think about how you can use
some physiological measures to actually
start to control ride experiences and we
built a couple of rides in which you use
breath or breathing to control the ride
and breathing is very interesting
because it's only under partial control
at times you can control your breathing
remarkably well that's kind of what I'm
doing in being able to speak at other
times you can't control it at all you
have to breathe after a certain amount
of time and if you build a ride that
responds to breathing you can bring
people to a really delicious tipping
point between control and loss of
control and after all what our amusement
roller coasters about if it's not about
giving up control to something that's
that's where a lot of the thrill lies in
breathless which was a powered swing we
went as far as to put the breathing
respirator sensors inside a rubberized
gas mask so just to really up the ante
and make you tune into your own feelings
about your breathing you were wearing
this gas mask and controlling this
powered swing so those are four bits of
work that I'm not going to talk about
but I could have probably picked anyone
to talk about this notion of
trajectories that I'm going to come to
later in at all because they do all
reflect it but I'm going to just pick a
one piece of work and apologies if some
of you have seen it before because it is
quite an old one it's 2003 now which is
pretty much ancient but um this was what
a blast theory piece of work and it just
I guess because it's quite a complex
structure it just serves to illustrate
many of the points that I want to make
later on so would quickly have a look at
uncle Roy all around you as a nice
example of what I guess we're kind of
calling his genre of mixed reality
performance at the mixed reality
performance is a phrase is really meant
to convey a couple of things firstly the
idea of performances that somehow mix
the real and the virtual whatever that
is which uncle Roy does and secondly the
idea of mixing digital content and media
with live performance from actors
possibly or from the path
participants who become actors in some
sense anyway uncle roll around you is a
performance come game that takes place
parallel in parallel on the streets of
the city and online on the streets of
the city you arrive at a venue your
personal possessions are sort of taken
away from you and instead you were given
a device and asked to head out into the
city and find uncle Roy that was that
was the your job and you followed a
series of quite ambiguous sort of
location-based clues that led you on a
dance through the city eventually to an
office that it was claimed was uncle
Roy's office you were asked to go in and
from there to a phone box and from there
to a car and you were asked to get in
the car and various things happen to you
and there's an online player you could
have the same experience but from a
different point of view you could enter
a virtual model somewhat fantastical of
this part of the city you could see
where the street players were you could
chat to other online players but most
importantly you could find out things
that these people didn't know in
particular where is uncle Roy's office
in the city and once you've got that
piece of information you could try and
build a relationship to a street player
by sending the messages and getting
messages back and guide them to uncle
Roy's office if you want it to be
helpful or mess them about and get them
lost if you didn't at some point in the
experience both kinds of players
slightly different points are asked a
series of questions about whether they
would trust in strangers and to what
extent they were trusting strangers and
would they be prepared to enter a
year-long contract with a stranger in
which if this person ever calls them up
they would give them help and if they
say yes we take their contact details
and we exchange it with someone later on
in the game and they get a postcard two
weeks later that says if you need help
call this person so I've got a bit of a
video of uncle Roy find it it's fairly
long we won't look at it all but just to
give you a bit of a the flavor of the
the work
likes a couple of seconds to kick in
uncle Roy all around you is a game which
sets online players alongside players on
the streets of the city equipped with a
handheld computer Street players are
sent out into the city in search of
uncle Roy online players explore a
virtual model of the same area of the
city
they can follow the progress of Street
players and communicate with them via
audio and text messages each Street
player has only 60 minutes to find uncle
Roy online players can uncover the
location or uncle Roy's office and so
guide Street players to their
destination this is a game which you
walk around surrounding area using
movies this map shows the game area to
move around it tuck on the me icon and
drag it also solve is there before
you'll need to speak into this to record
messages to online players your first
instruction is as follows head for
location in the park uncle Roy will send
you a message indicating where this is
once you get there tap on a million
and doing well I need to wait for
someone come in the opposite direction
jello turn just pause for a moment there
I mean I mentioned the clues were
ambiguous and give a longer talk about
the nature of ambiguity and interface
design which number of people have have
written about recently very interesting
example of ambiguity here so i think the
ambiguity here in part lies in the in
blurring the frame of the experience so
the frame with experience refers to
having an understanding of what is
within the experience and what is
without its the set of often unwritten
conventions by which you know that
something is fictional or not when
you're watching it for example and in
this case this clue kind of plays with
that the idea that someone's going to
walk across the bridge in st. James's
Park and you should turn and follow them
invites a whole series of quite
difficult to interpret possibilities
here should I just turn and follow the
first stranger who walks across the
bridge and while waiting for an actor
how will I know they look like is
everyone in London and actor who's
employed in the game who knows anyway so
bit of an aside but that's what I kind
of meant by ambiguity and it's an
interesting tactic again for generating
a bit of thrill and a bit of excitement
at perhaps some risk so this video roles
for wallets and let's pick up Jen a bit
later on well it's a bit earlier than
this though so she finds uncle Roy's
office while he does first
when she enters the office the online
player gets to see her for the first
time on a kind of video surveillance
link and he gets his interview about
trust and strangers and contracts and
things while she's asked to look around
the office right at postcard and do
various other bits then she's directed
to a phone box where she gets a phone
call and from there to the car after
Liberty
I would like to ask you a few questions
and I'd appreciate it if you would
answer the questions as honestly as
possible I bet so I'm and again
ethnographic studies of uncle Roy around
you revealed all sorts of interesting
stuff about how it was designed put
together how the technologies worked all
manner of things in a number of papers
float so over the years roll out a
number of projects such as these conduct
a number of studies published results
that's well and good academic life
continues but you do begin to wonder
slightly about the bigger picture and
what we began to wonder was you know
what there's something interesting about
these experiences okay we're working
with performers who are definitely at
the extreme end of creating certain
kinds of experiences i'm not suggesting
that uncle royal around you is a
mainstream game but but our view as they
were they were kind of pushing the
envelope and take taking entertainment
or cultural experiences to into some new
place and we wanted to get a bigger
sense of what was it these experiences
are about and how are they put together
in other words we wanted to sit back and
do a bit of theorizing as much as anyone
in our neck of the woods does theorizing
so um so this is what we started to
figure first of all we we were
struggling to characterize these
experience in terms of any of the kind
of existing paradigms that are out there
there are lots of paradigms is virtual
reality and then augmented reality and
they're mixed reality but Uncle all
around you seems to be simultaneously
several of those at the same time this
there's tangible computing and mobile
computing but Dino figurines had both
tangible and mobile interfaces there's
location-based there's this and that
what's interesting is the artists don't
really seem to care about that they take
whatever is the hand and deliberately
mix it up to create something else these
experiences are online and on the
streets and tangible and mobile and
whatever all at the same time so I think
what characterizes them at first glance
is is two things
first of all is it some extent their
extended of course it depends what you
mean by extended I mean they're not
extended yet in two years they're not
lifelong but they're extended beyond the
moment of interaction with a single
interface if you're designing your HCI
person you're no longer in the business
of designing how you interact with one
thing but rather how many things are
stitched together into something that's
larger and I would call that a user
experience I know that UX has become
synonymous again with the design of the
one thing with the interface but my
sense is there is a bigger notion of
having an experience in uncle Roy for an
hour and the structure of that
experience is pretty complex it it's got
real and virtual spaces sometimes appear
to be overlaid sometimes it appeared to
be juxtaposed or somehow adjacent it's
got complex timescales I won't talk
about those there isn't time it has
quite complex role structures there are
online players and players on the
streets there are actors there are
people behind the scenes there are
members of the public or somewhere
involved are spectators or bystanders
and it has a whole bunch of interfaces
so that's not a very exciting conclusion
in many ways it just says well our
extended and they consist of lots of
stuff so what we wanted to do is start
to find a way of articulating what we
thought the artists were doing and what
fundamentally these experiences are
about and for that we eventually turn to
a notion of trajectories and so this
path of talk i'm going to make an
argument being a computer scientist
abstracting away just a few concepts
providing a framework that all
experiences at least of this kind can be
described in terms of trajectories and
that's it well not really and that there
are just three fundamental kinds of
trajectory and oh that's it and I'll try
and convince you of that so let's have a
go so firstly the unifying principle of
these things I think is is of taking
people on a journey that's actually
quite important it's not the destination
that matters uncle Roy and many of these
experiences it's not about reaching an
end points not at a score a goal it is
the journey that matters it's having a
good experience on the way all the way
is what you're trying to design for and
they can be described in terms of
trajectories why is a trajectory a good
metaphor to use one thing that we feel
that captures is a sort of continuity of
experience we'll come back to that later
on I've put ideal because there are
episodes and break sometimes deliberate
and sometimes unavoidable but underneath
all of the things we looked at it felt
like there was something that was meant
to flow like a thread of experience
secondly trajectories inherently capture
the idea they're being individual routes
through experience you have yours I have
mine trajectory something that could be
steered and shaped by external forces
perhaps not so overtly but it can be
bent and moved around in certain ways
and that's something that I'll come back
to later on that we felt we saw going on
trajectories are interwoven with one
another the threads of experience to
create some kind of social fabric to to
kind of mixing my metaphors but that's
interested we wanted something that
captured the way in which different
people's experiences with sometimes
overlap sometimes not and would would
interweave as part of a larger whole but
frankly also it's not really our idea
the notion of interject interaction all
trajectories is already out there in the
HCI literature and of course the notion
of trajectories is everywhere in all
sorts of fields from physics to social
sciences but in particular several
people who already published about the
idea of there being interaction with
reject trees for example Christian Heath
and colleagues at King's College London
had studied museum interactions and had
pointed out how one person's interaction
with an exabyte often serves to
configure the next person's route into
it an interaction with it Christian has
a an example of a somebody interacting
with a a bolt on the frame of an
exhibition the Science Museum not
actually the exhibition self I don't
know why they're interested in the bolt
perhaps they're an engineer or perhaps
they're looking to make a garden shed at
home or something who knows but they
interacted the bolt and they head on and
of course the
person who comes in interacts with the
bolt and heads on and the next person
who comes in does the same it's a
beautiful example of you know how there
is a trajectory into an interface and
through it that the moment of if you
like interaction begins quite a long
time before you pick up the mouse press
the button are at the table or whatever
so that was already out there we just
wanted to push it a bit further and to
think about how it worked in the large
so okay I said before there are three
kinds of trajectories out of which such
experiences appear to be made and the
first is the canonical trajectory this
if you like is the plan the designers
artists performers intent defined mostly
beforehand mostly and probably expressed
in various ways through scripts set
designs list of instructions and of
course through code in computers I've
shown the canonical trajectories being
just kind of one line that flows through
the piece but actually any experience
may have several canonical trajectories
uncle royal around you has at least a
canal a canonical trajectory for Street
players and a different one that's
designed for online players moreover of
course these things can branch and merge
again in experiences that can steer you
down different routes so for example at
a top level the canonical trajectory for
uncle royal around you look something
like start at the host venue this is for
the street player there's a different
one for online players the red spot
moment was something that the artist
talked about time and time again as
being your your first successful
engagement with the game with the
interface with the clue trail if you can
do this basic one we know at some level
you're on track we've got you you're in
it blast theory would when uncle Roy
mark out a number of anticipated routes
through the city and they really did
this they documented it they had the map
they walked the city they decided which
routes they expected players to take and
they made the clues steer them towards
those routes so there was before
we never ran a sense of what the roots
through the city ought to be and if
people were on one of these roots they
were on track and if people were not on
one of these roots they were not on
track then the stuff that happens at
uncle Roy's office the phone box in the
limo and you could it's a multiscale
thing you could probably take any one of
these and you'd find a trajectory
through it there is a trajectory through
most definitely the interactions in the
limousine it's scripted and rehearsed
what's meant to happen in there there is
a trajectory of what meant to happen at
the host venue for you saw on the video
the person handing over the the PDA and
explaining how to use it well that was
scripted and rehearsed and our
observation showed Reese cryptid Andrey
rehearsed until it was done just right I
talked about ideal the ideal of
continuity but in practice trajectories
have to negotiate various transitions
and these are key moments at which if
you like the whole enterprise is at risk
and what our studies showed was there
are various kinds of key moments and
that the artists in their craft pay
particular attention to how to design
those get it right you may be able to
create something that works more or less
continuously get it wrong and the whole
thing may fall apart so what are they
beginnings is a kind of an obvious one
but the initial ritual and the initial
framing of the experience how someone's
introduced how the mood is set how the
rules are understood is absolutely
critical and so you see a lot of effort
designed into this purpose-built
briefing room scripted rehearsed
briefings and so on anything that
involves handing over an interface is a
really critical moment for several
reasons I mean if you've ever been in a
virtual reality cave with some kind of a
head tracking thing then one of the
typical things that happens is you kind
of stand in there and they as they put
it on your head the graphics are turned
on and the whole world is kind of
jumping about like crazy until it's on
your head and it settles down that's an
example of the problem of handing over
an interface and
sometimes that's designed by the artist
to be minimal that they aim for the
easiest transition how can I give this
person a PDA they've not used before and
get them into the game sometimes the
opposite Brendan would make a great fuss
about attaching sensors to people's
bodies before they go on the rides in a
very very ritualized way to keep
building the anticipation but in each
case its planned and its thought about
you don't just hand it over and say get
on with it episodes if you do have an
experience that is spread over time
perhaps deliberately day the figurines
you only play ideally the plan was you
only play a bit each day you really have
to think about how to reintroduce people
back into it quickly how do you catch up
with the stuff you missed and get back
into the game within well as we were
using text messages one text message got
160 characters to reintroduce that
person back into the game what are they
missed get them back into the position
physical virtual traversals for those
who are interested in virtual worlds how
do you get into a virtual world and
their various ways of doing this and my
favorite was from piece of work with
desert rain where the artists had a
screen made of falling water and you can
actually pass into the image and you
would enter another piece of physical
set all the performers would appear to
emerge from the image physical resources
such as uncle Roy's office the limousine
are very different to digital ones and
one of the fundamental differences is
you cannot reproduce them at will if two
people turn up at the limousine in uncle
Roy at the same moment it is a disaster
the whole illusion that you're you're in
this fictional world created just around
you is broken and even worse they start
chatting and relaxing and comparing
notes and and going completely off track
so the artists would work extremely hard
to avoid to people ever turning up to
the limo at the same moment they would
delay some people and push other people
on we'll talk about orchestration in a
moment to manage that moment
if it was a digital resource it could be
different you can replicate the office
as many times as you like no problem but
as soon as it's a physical thing one
table 1 Xzibit one painting in the
museum one office you have to think that
how to manage that don't know how many
of you worked with GPS bottom it seems
to me every time we do it and every time
we work with someone new we say it
doesn't work like you think it works and
they go that's right then we go outside
and then someone stands around for 15
minutes trying to make it work and it's
the whole thing is a disaster so it does
help to recognize from the outset that
the seams in the experience that the
bits where the technical infrastructure
doesn't quite knit together you really
got to be aware of those and design for
them if you leave somebody standing in
the middle of London with no connection
no way of knowing where they are nowhere
them knowing what to do you've probably
got a broken experience and last of all
endings and in particular one of the
things we noticed certainly with blast
theory was they would very often be a
sort of coder for the experience there'd
be some kind of thing that happened
after what you would have thought was
the end to just kind of take you back to
it in desert rain they left a box of
sand in your pocket of your coat which
you would find anything 45 minutes to
two weeks later depending how you use
your coat uncle roll around you you got
the postcard sent you through the post
but there's some kind of little moment
that just kind of took you back to it or
like talked about the transitions and
uncle Roy there isn't time ok the second
kind of trajectory we only that far
participant trajectories if um use Lucy
such wounds words if the canonical
trajectory is the plan then the
participant rejection is the situated
action it is what happens what somebody
actually does during the experience not
what was intended to happen and the most
obvious thing to say about that is it
can diverge from what was meant to
happen fact you might argue that if you
have an interactive experience that's
that's kind of inevitably what's going
to happen giving people the choice
particularly
no if it's a sort of one of those
branching narrative things there may not
be much choice thee you end up with a
canonical trajectory that just branches
a lot and comes back and the only real
choice is which branch do i go down next
but as soon as you put someone in the
real world in the city on the streets
faced with all of the things they could
do then there is real choice they can
turn around and walk in the other
direction because they're lost or bored
or given up and divergence happens
that's okay but there is an opposing
force which is that of orchestration and
this is the set of processes tools
procedures that you can use you as
people or perhaps you as the system if
you can figure them out well enough to
code them to push that line back to that
line or perhaps to some other canonical
trajectory maybe there's they're so far
off the original track you have to push
the one to one of your other tracks and
again our studies showed that time and
time again there was there were very
very well thought out processes for how
to do this I mean just one example this
is what we saw with uncle Roy so this is
the bit of the canonical trajectory
where you're going through the park on
one of those ideally on one of those
three planned routes and here's what the
artist thought they should do if
somebody if that participant rejecter he
started to diverge first of all you
would get some clues that kind of subtly
try to push you back to the main
trajectory by subtly I mean essentially
they were still within the voice of the
experience they were perhaps a bit less
ambiguous but it still felt like they
were uncle Roy's clues and then blast
theory had authored around the edge of
the zone a series of further clues that
were much much more explicit and clearly
kind of broke the voice of the game and
said basically turn around and go back
the other way and if you still continued
they would start to worry and try and
figure out where you might be and send
somebody on the streets they have about
three or four actors on the streets to
deal with this to try and find you it's
not that easy in the city but they'd
have your photograph and that have a
sense of where you were last seen and
when and they try and track you down
there
up to you and they're tryin ish ly
speaking the voice of the game be a bit
mysterious send you and if you wouldn't
listen that kind of turn around go back
the other way and a not many people in
uncle Roy were lost we could talk about
why but i guess if that fell down then
you really had a problem and there are
all sorts of technologies that were
designed to support that so this is a
screenshot of the uncle Roy
orchestration interface there's a map
with the last known positions of people
the most critical between the interface
actually is their disconnection history
that's the thing you really need to keep
an eye on people who are kind of
connected you can be pretty confident
about they are where the system says
they are and you could talk to them if
you wanted but people who are suffering
from disconnections you really got a
problem because you don't know where
they are you can't talk to them so you
have to get them early yeah each other's
lives he's one of the current people in
Street player they would cycle the
street plays through so you'd have more
people coming into the games it was a
kind of rolling experience the green bar
is some kind of temporal representation
of their has their device been connected
back to the game have we been getting
lots of messages and red indicating some
periods of disconnection I McCumber what
white is sorry and then the cart yet the
color coding the map is kind of weather
the most recent you were so we're still
on participant trajectories the other
thing is to think about the social
design of the experience and this is
interesting too so um this diagram shows
that people's people people's
participant trajectories can cross they
can diverge they can come together in
designing these experiences again
observation show there were kind of
several key aspects so first of all many
people when they design collaborative
systems designed for this moment it's
all about encounters what happens when
two people get together perhaps they
meet in space then they can collaborate
perhaps they'll eat in time but at
different spaces that they can
collaborate and in a lot of attention in
cscw pater what kind of technologies can
make this happen good
this however is really really important
nearly all of these experiences did seem
to involve moments of deliberate
isolation of getting people apart from
other people and on their own I guess
sort of bit inwardly focused may be lost
and confused not distracted by having
family members or friends present and
this thing to be a tactic that came up
time and time again uncle Roy desert
rain day the figurines there were
moments either in the real world or in
the virtual space where you were kept
apart and this also turned out to be a
real problem any experience where you're
mixing their kind of physical and the
virtual so you've got this thin
connection between people or where it's
episodic and people dip in and out
keeping people together once they formed
a relationship is really hard and so you
need to design for that in uncle roll
around you you had to be remarkably
tenuous as an online player to keep hold
of a street player for long enough to
get them to the office it was a real
achievement if you could overcome all of
the potential transitions essentially
and last of all the historic trajectory
third kind of trajectory out of which
experiences are made and the historic
trajectory supports the retelling of the
experience so it's not what happened it
is what you want to say to somebody else
happened which is a very different thing
but it's really important to have it I
guess I mean well pretty much any
experience we have we want to talk about
anyone who's on Facebook knows that but
a lot of the experiences we have
cultural ones tend to be quite
objectively shared if we go to the
cinema okay i know that in your head you
may interpret the film differently than
I do but let's be clear we saw pretty
much the same film and we have a pretty
good sense of what the other person saw
you do uncle Roy around you I have no
idea what happened to you you have no
idea what happened to me and people
would come back from those experiences
where there have been isolation and time
and time again say we need to talk to
somebody else we need some whale I need
to sit down with someone and talk about
what just happened and compare what
happened to me with what happened to
them
so historic trajectories support this
they think the size of view of what
happened and this means for things
firstly you need to in some way document
or record the participant trajectory
that is that the actually what happened
that might be the system recording all
of the messages that go through it it
might be people taking photos it might
be whatever but you need a pool of
documentation you have to select and
filter segments from well if it's a
repeated experience possibly many
recordings put those into some order
that suits the story you want to tell
and then find a way of publishing them
making them available so imagine them
imagine it sir you're playing a computer
game with I don't know how many levels
does a modern complex computer game have
quite a few some tens and that you
repeat each level lots and lots and lots
and lots of times imagine that the
system the game records your
interactions quite a lot of 3d games can
do that so you can play them back or
compete against yourself later on or
something then the interesting question
is if I wanted to ask the question what
happened say to the system show me what
happened when I played whatever I was
playing it could filter and all of those
recordings in all sorts away it could
take my most recent attempt at each
level it could take my best attempt at
each level or if I'm telling the story
to Jonathan it would take the versions
where me and Jonathan are both in the
game because surely that's the one he's
interested in knowing about so that
basically what I'm saying is you don't
just replay the experience has happened
but you have to give people tools to
tell the experience now I don't have
from uncle Roy a good example I mean
it's an interesting if you like problem
perhaps even weakness with all of these
experiences that we made that they're
often weren't good ways of retelling
them and replaying them and so I'll now
turn to the final bit of the talk a
quite different project where we did see
canonical and participant trajectories
at work outside of a kind of performance
context in a much more mainstream
setting but in particular we were able
to explore this
idea of the historic trajectory and the
setting here is the the amusement park
or the theme park and in this case for
two or three years now we've been
working with Alton Towers in particular
and thought Park which are kind of two
of the UK's bigger theme parks in
general looking at technologies for
entertainment so some of the right
design stuff we've done with breathing
and those things have been kind of in
partnership with these folks but also we
looked as one part of it at souvenirs
and storytelling and this kind of told
some quite interesting things about
supporting the historic trajectory so a
change of setting let's get to the theme
park and we'll just spend a bit of time
thinking about how people might
potentially construct their stories of a
day in the park I'm the first thing we
did was an ethnographic study
sensitizing study where we followed a
number of families around the park we
looked at how they treated the souvenirs
that were available in the park how they
talked about them we looked at their own
photo work we visited them in their
homes afterwards we talked to them about
how they use those photos and what was
on display and then uncovered a number
of interesting things I mean firstly the
theme park is rife with souvenirs of all
sorts mugs t-shirts whatever but in
particular with photo souvenirs so you
probably know you go on a ride you come
off the ride probably if it's a big
enough ride a system has automatically
taken your photo in an attempt to
capture the picture that nobody else can
and it may try and sell you that photo
in the case of alton towers within two
minutes of getting off the ride pass the
chaos you buy it then or you never buy
it that's the way it works it also tells
and then you get it kind of nicely
mounted but also people of course take
their own pictures or try to take their
own pictures too so yeah without going
to given time too much detail our
studies pulled out a number of
interesting themes about this
construction the historic trajectory at
first of all adults and towers a common
theme not the only
theme of stories but a common one was
the rite of passage Alton Towers is tip
if I'd by having quite a lot of thrill
rides and people go time and time again
and as the kids grow up one of the
themes is doing your next big ride your
new sort of social bonding being part of
the family you know everyone's done the
big ride now it's your turn that's quite
a scary experience and as a result you
see some contested stories so this is
the on ride shot of Jamie no I don't
know if you notice anything particularly
striking about that photo but in my
opinion and policies Jamie if you're
watching cuz I know you don't agree cuz
you told us I think he looks a bit
scared know what you think certainly
Jamie vetoed his parents buying this
picture absolutely vetoed it he just
would not have it Jamie was very happy
to take a medal to school until his
schoolmates about how he'd ridden
nemesis but that was out the question
the mum wish she'd bought the photo and
spent the rest of the day and indeed was
still talking about it when we visited
in her home about regretting not having
the photo time for the family this photo
was what the day was all about and it
was a continued and even then Jamie got
ribbed throughout most of the day about
every time he appeared on one of these
things he looked terrified he said it
was a g-force that was pulling his face
it maybe it is I don't know enough
physics who who knows all i can say is
it's a contested story i won't come down
on any one person side jamie did rather
like his granddad's photo it has to be
said ok so his granddad's photo shows
him having conquered nemesis and that
that photo was just fine um the other
thing say about photo work of course is
it's a routine part of being in the
theme park often spectators capture the
ride experience so that is a classic
role for the spectator is to be the
documenter of the ride sometimes photos
are taken of other things Jamie really
like bird life you spent a lot of the
day taking pictures of birds and their
of course key photo opportunities around
the park so I'm cut a long story short
as a result of these studies we we built
a prototype system if you'd like to
generate the historic trajectory to help
people tell their stories about
going to the park in a new way and I'll
talk through it but it's an app for your
smartphone and the first thing it does
is um of course you can take photographs
so you can take your own pictures that's
good there are various photo
opportunities around the park and we
tried out some location-based prompts to
encourage people to do this to say as a
photo opportunity nearby we can talk
later on about how successful various
location-based prompts were or weren't
importantly there's a shared pool so
with this app you register as a group
before you go in you sign up as a family
or a group of friends or whatever and
the rule of the game is any picture I
take through the app is shared with the
rest of you and you get to see it so
collectively we we pull our pictures and
then you can caption the pictures you
can add speech bubbles to them and you
can add captions that run along the
bottom in a kind of cartoon-like style
any captioning you do again the new
captioned images put back in the shared
pool and everyone gets to see it you can
caption whatever you like we use
location-based triggers here to
encourage captioning when you were in
the queue so thinking about again the
nature of the experience we still get
out cueing is a real pain which I think
everyone in the theme park business
would agree is true and that if you can
recognize when people are in a queue and
it's not that difficult with GPS to do
that then you can give them some kind of
prompt that says now would be a really
good time to look through that pool of
photos and do some captioning and have
under and do a bit of photo work we
threw the unrighteous to the pot so we
were able to take their the photos off
the ride systems and they go in the
shared pool the same way you can capture
them and do whatever and then when
you've been on the ride the system
encourages you to select three images
from the pull up for each ride you've
done one that you think represents
before one that you think represents
during and one that you think represents
after and this is the simplest narrative
structure we could come up with for the
rite of passage I was scared
it was scary I felt great for example so
you'd all of this work because you're
going around that the park taking
pictures sharing them automatically
annotating them choosing the three
pictures for each big ride you went on
and then the system automatically
generates these so it creates your one
page photo story for each ride you do
and this again it's got your three
photos in there and it's got a bunch of
stock material of course and a bunch of
branding because that's really important
in the theme park setting and it all
comes together and you get your comic
book page your story so this is a
historic trajectory what's interesting I
suppose is um firstly you get one for
your ride that's quite important if you
read these ones carefully you'll notice
different people definitely want to tell
different stories there are some that
are suitable for children there are some
that are definitely more adult-oriented
among groups of friends so not if you
want to tell the same story but you are
telling that story from a pool of shared
material so in terms of the historic
trajectory I think it reflects most of
that the points are made earlier about
firstly you have to think about how you
document the experience there are
triggers and point to the application to
encourage you to do that how you sift
and select and how you reorder it and
represent to make your kind of shared
account i will skip over this very
briefly but um although i've talked
about theme park in the historic
trajectory it was quite evident that to
ask the other kinds of trajectory i
talked about canonical and participant
will also at play in the theme park so
the canonical trajectory of a theme part
the plan can be quite complicated it's
co constructed by both the park and the
visitors but if you wanted a general
shape for it it looks something like
this people arrive often together people
split up I want to do nemesis I want to
do the squirrel nut ride people come
together again lunch coffee they replan
they split up again
and at each ride they also often split
up I'll go on the ride I'll hold the
bags without going to more detail
orchestration work becomes difficult for
people they spend a great deal of time
trying to orchestrate where these
trajectories come together in particular
meeting someone at the end of a ride is
really quite difficult because you don't
know how long the Curie's you don't know
how long the ride is there's I don't
know 20 people coming through every five
minutes so you hang around for hours
meeting people for lunch is also really
difficult because you don't know when
their riders finished made over when
yours has equally when it comes to
interrupting people we think we learnt
some of our notifications were good some
of our notifications were bad so in
terms of opportune moments for Mobile
notifications when the spectator is
queuing I'm sorry when the rider is
queuing before they get on the ride good
time I'm generalizing a great deal here
there are many fine nuances when
spectators are waiting around quite a
good time when people are coming
together quite a bad time to notify them
because at that point they're engaged in
lots and lots of other social stuff like
I haven't seen you in a bit what's going
on the last thing they need is a bunch
of system notification saying don't
forget to do your automic and there are
various other points i mean the rider
when they're on the ride you're just no
point interrupting them because they
can't get their mobile out this it's
disallowed so am I guess I'm suggesting
that these trajectories are also quite a
useful way of starting to think about
things like mobile notifications
interruptions and possibly how they work
as well so I'm pretty much out of time
I'm sure what have I trying to do well a
bit of a journey I think first of all
from some stuff that is very much at the
kind of cutting edge I suppose of kind
of performance and art but which I think
inspired some thinking about
mainstreaming experiences but then try
to suggest you that some of the ideas we
got from that about what user
experiences are like and what goes into
them canonical participants and historic
trajectories that are designed how that
might also be found in more mainstream
settings
Park full of trajectories each ride is a
trajectory and then the layout of the
right of the Parker are designed in some
sense so I'm trying to suggest you that
there is perhaps a broader relevance of
this notion of designing trajectories
transitions orchestrations divergencies
all of the things I've said so that
leaves me with a few questions that I
don't have answers to assuming that you
believe it is a useful way of thinking
even about cultural applications I do is
it useful outside of those can you think
about the trajectory of having a disease
for example on going through the
healthcare system can you think about
the directory of going on the holiday
can you think about the trajectory of
online shopping and use and eventual
disposal of an artifact does it have the
same sense of participant canonical and
historic do you need to document and
reflect on them are there the same
social overlapping interesting here or
having a career or a life is there a
lifelong trajectory that these are all
good questions do they provide a general
basis for understanding this notion of
extended user experience one particular
thing that we haven't thought about I
think hardly at all at the moment is how
different trajectories of different
experiences overlap so although I said
I'll we have two different participants
in uncle Roy you need to think about how
they design that was all still with an
uncle Roy never said anything about how
uncle Roy overlaps with receiving your
work email overlaps with being in the
theme park overlap with shopping at any
one moment you and I are involved in
probably several trajectories or threads
of activity and the whole nature of
mobile devices is that they are
increasingly connected and rubbing up
against one another the mobile phone is
essentially a time slicing device that's
what it does it lets you cut up your
time into finer and finer chunks and so
these trajectories get attention you
more and more into over so how do we
design that and uncomfortable least in
my own head because I understand what
I'm talking about I think the
trajectories are kind of useful for
reflect
hang on experiences that I've seen I can
now take all sorts of experiences that
be documenting say our look here's the
canonical trajectory look is the
historical trajectory but I'm not sure I
can use one yet as a proactive design
tool I'm not sure I can sit down with a
blank page and no experience and say
let's use them from the start we're
making our first attempt we've got a
project called chess which is working
doing museum design in the acropolis
museum greece and city disperse which is
a big space museum in Toulouse and
therefore time we are trying to say to
the designers from the outset hey let's
think about trajectories and see whether
any of the issues that we raise make any
sense but I'll be honest and say i don't
know yet the conversation is just
starting now at the level of the weather
swim down interrupt or not interrupt
doesn't that
wouldn't that be something that you had
built into the design so that's what you
would hope yes and and what we what
we're trying to encourage is whether you
can write these things down but you know
it's interesting there are all sorts of
questions about what does the annotation
look like does it look like my wiggly
lines does it look like whatever so how
how you express this stuff and how you
write it down and really whether it has
a kind of proactive purchase and design
I think so yeah it would be a definite
your question for the future so look
that's it by wild coincidence there is a
book the book documents the blast theory
works brendan's works and some works
with other artists as well but then does
kind of pull out in hopefully quite a
grounded way this notion of trajectories
so I'll stop there thank you very much
for asking not to go back to your time
and attention
call us one um so you know when you're
talking about your doctor is one of the
things that strikes me is that there is
no theme parts of the environment one of
the big things that you try to prevent
is everybody going the same way because
that generally leads to Harville
congestion problems and so a lot of
effort is spent to try and make sure
that the trajectories of you know
individual people are you know tend to
vary as much as possible so you don't
get that certain of them whereas in
contrast if you will get like an Ikea
okay you have you know that a single
path that we're pretty much forced to
take through the entire store so you
experiencing everything right that one's
would rather do yeah but there's
something they really don't want you do
it because they want you to see
everything are you know as opposed to
like a supermarket right where they put
the milk and stuff in the back of trying
for sure to join you know so a lot of
this has to do I guess with the
different goals right of what people are
trying to achieve you know for the deep
part case you know the crowd control one
it seems sort of ancillary to the
experience but it's actually a pretty
fundamental you know pragmatic thing
that you have to do yeah yeah I mean it
also tells when we asked about the
design and layout of the theme park that
the rationale there and I don't if it's
saying that Disney or not the rationale
there is that the big rides are spread
out towards the back of the park so you
come in and basically then immediately
pushed into is he actually icon Kreutz
three choices there are three big zones
The X Factor the thrill zone and I gland
or whatever and you're yeah you're
shunted out to those parts and then
later on you sort of find your way back
and that seems very deliberate it's
quite interesting
explicitly trying to have a very large
number of trajectories it's not you know
it's very hard you know the theme park
case you typically don't have just a
handful and fix pass you know hopefully
you have thousands of different ones on
any given day yeah so I mean it's it is
multi scale and it and they're not it's
quite clear I think you know that things
like Uncle Royal around you are quite an
extreme case in that it is a really
pretty scripted and designed experience
you know it doesn't exactly run on rails
but it's quite clear what's meant to
happen from the outset the theme park is
interestingly different each ride is
very much like that you know you go on
nemesis you're in the queue and at that
point you're in a like IKEA you're at a
linear trajectory you're going through
the queue you're getting on the ride
you're up the ramp you're down the ramp
you're off and that there it's in a line
but yeah the layout of those within the
park seems to then be based on some more
general trajectory principles but what
happens is people when they arrive
construct their own trajectory and are
those room I assume that they would
analyze the different there's patterns
and the trajectories of people take
it feels like there's a ton of basic
generalization
Ryder I go to the right it's right next
door or it will go to the bathroom like
stand in the queue yeah that list is
short and yeah and isn't it I mean
there's in the areas there's an ecology
of attractions there is a few big rides
a bunch of eateries some other shops and
some smaller stuff to do so again that's
part of it and that the trajectory thing
is again the extent to which people plan
in advance what they're going to do now
not everyone does but again our
experience suggests that quite a lot of
people do plan their day in the car on
the way what are we going to do yeah
yeah and then the situated action at
lunch they tend to have to replan so
yeah the canonical trajectory is kind of
more flexibly constructed in the theme
park for sure it's in the go she ate he
did quite a bit more I think here when I
have all kingdom first open one of the
things that was unplanned is that people
quickly figured out that the animals are
awake in the morning and I sleep the
rest of the day and so it quickly came
to be that people would line up at the
game soon to know that they all run like
crazy out of the safari ride and you get
this instant huge line there in the rest
of the park is completely empty and
there's a lot of that perspective train
fix that problem but enough troubles
wait yeah I'd love to know that anxious
with every girl please
so you sure that artists and that the
thing that you kind of ended with
something that's more of a entertainment
a consumer aspect of it and why might
have a first of all I came for saying
that industry and artists work together
collaboratively in an interesting way as
opposed to sometimes now I think
culturally people think that industry
helps our the charities at most
I love
each other but so I guess I'm sort of
curious why work with artists what it
seems like
we don't marketing or design
or something that's more highly that the
canonical trajectory a very highly and
tightly scripted but you are interested
in working with are these beginning your
servers artists who I think there
great event
communication that say I'm crazy
marketing
the experience like having a trajectory
is similar
yeah but I think that
with an eye on arts project as opposed
to going to a theme park Ferrari
so I mean I guess yes that you write
your observations when the question was
still you know why work with artists in
that that that context well I think it
does go back to the reasons I gave at
the outset I think artists are very very
extremely creative and therefore
trailblaze things you can do with
technology that I think the mainstream
entertainment industries for all of its
fantastic research and creativity may
not quite trailblaze the same things not
saying that research in mainstream
entertainment history is invaluable lots
and lots of difficult problems being
solved but I still think that artists
just go somewhere unusual and I think
they do act as Trailblazers not that
every artist does commercial crossover
work or wants to do commercial crossover
work so I'm sure would reject it out of
hand but I've seen it quite a lot of
examples of absolutely where it does
work quite a few of the industry
projects what the lot of projects we
done have had industry partners involved
in extent uncle roll around you had
involvement of British Telecom though
the figurines had nokia and sony who
were kind of in there as partners it
felt mostly kind of watching seeing what
was going on kind of taking it in so
there is that crossover I think so yeah
I think you work with article it does
take you take you out there take takes
you somewhere unusual makes you think
what was that that just got made and
then makes you think how is what just
got made perhaps more relevant to
anything else well I also like the other
side that you got to at the end which is
going outside of the theme park into the
to the real world I think the adjustment
we are all sort of you saw the
adjustment bureau I think will be the
Matt Damon well okay it's it's basically
it's this on the fact it's philip k dick
story and it's this on a grander scale
the infective is this choreography is ok
as i might see the adjustment bureau
adoption have you agreed that is what it
has some relevance here maybe maybe the
bouquet vinick's model would be worth
reading god so I but I think that that
is an interesting additional angle to it
because what one thing I was thinking I
was that if I if I wanted to use the
notion of trajectories and project some
future project like India right now and
experience of trying to characterize
what's going on by different
trajectories so I start I look at the
thing enough and I start writing things
down I say oh this event happened maybe
I do do a few of those diagrams that you
have you not realize no this is
starting to get really complicated and
there's so many different ways to
experience the thing and I just I feel
like I'm going to be very quickly
converted by the complexity of how do
how to just write it down yeah and talk
about it nip Yelena or you know worse
yet what if i have a sensing system that
you know watches people moving through
my experience and and then you know of
chocolates representation based on the
sense you know maybe I fit some data I
don't understand yeah I'm worried that
the complexity of reality is going to
just
really promising these representations I
I think that's correct I mean firstly
yeah first point is yet the complexity
of reality is great it is really complex
until what you're trying to do is
whenever you're making one of these
things you are designing a complex
multifaceted thing I don't think that
writing down trajectory diagrams will
and despite the fact I said ah there is
only everything is made up of this it
won't give you the whole answer I also
think it would be impossible to write
down in detail all of the trajectories
of any of these experiences and I've
never done it so yeah I don't think you
soon you just give up getting eyes yet
another layer another too much so in
that sense I don't think that's the
right thing to try and do what I think
you need to try and do those is take the
key elements of the idea and ask the
question of hmm where is the historic
trajectory in this experience do i do I
have a way of retelling recapturing
representing if not is that a problem
should I have one or does it not need
one the transitions I think are useful
you can take each those transitions and
take them off and go yeah where and what
are the seams what should I do about it
we're doing two phases get handed over
what's the first engagement how's the
framing done so I think of that level it
at least it gives you in my hope a kind
of checklist that you can run that says
okay have I got one of these is there
one of these why not without necessarily
then the next question is yet do you
need to put it do you need to set it out
in more detail and that's where we are
with the chess project and saying it is
it useful in a more starts your sense i
mean i'm also very intrigued by the
notion
you know model you know automatically
sort of what are the things that
everyone does you know at this moment in
this experience right
finding things you don't already know
today use of love sensing technology but
done this early is hard to do probably
impossible to do that in advance and I
mean if I suppose you could think of its
being a bit like storyboarding you know
storyboarding and experience is useful
but you probably can't write a
storyboard for every nuance of it
there's always there's always things
you're missing the interstitials between
the frames and I think it's like that to
look at it life scale you know the
number of you before it eventually hit
this but you know start with that linear
to give movie yeah there's no detours
sense and interactive gaming you have
more as you can kind of define the
detour point
no you know kind of a light level i
wonder if there's opportunities around
itself knows where that that's often
being interrupter that present you with
new detours and some single textures
here doing that so maybe there's some
filtering opportunities there with you
know if you really want to stay on it on
the light trick at grady you don't want
to make that stop Donald it reminds me
of so John chrome has this project our
tree surrounded model trajectories of
people driving right and so you can get
attempt to predict where you're going
basically you know just a few miles out
of your driveway fairly reliably it's
kind of a scary in some way
zoltan integer muscles drivers are an
interesting one it makes there's a sense
in which if you were trying to to think
about so the open question for us is to
what on earth does it mean to actually
then put different experiences together
something like driving to an interesting
because that's one that feels like it
probably dominates others when you do it
in quite an interesting way you know
when you drive there are some things you
really do have to do to be safe and
there are certain constraints spatially
you are going to satisfy certain
constraints you're going to satisfy not
leaving each other if you're in the car
with each other you're going to be there
for the next three hours so it's quite
interesting irelia where the some
trajectories essentially would shape
others a lot more that then have to fit
against them Thanks well thank you very
much thank your questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
