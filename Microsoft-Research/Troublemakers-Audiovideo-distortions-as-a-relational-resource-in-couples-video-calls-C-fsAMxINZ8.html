you
so we're talking about video cord which
is for a long time be considered the
next best thing to being there although
of course is big ? over that so you ?
what will I talk about just briefly I'll
talk very briefly about a history of
video calling and then I'll move to sort
of situating my research on distortions
and participants in the video calling
research space which will probably prove
rather familiar to some people in the
audience and then move on to distortions
as a participant's concern I'll talk a
little bit just very quickly about my
methodology and the data that I
collected and then spend quite some time
on some very nice examples of my
findings and then talk about some up
shots and then I'll move to talking
about sort of the upshot of the whole
stuff which is how we design for
relationships or for the relationship
between technology and society and talk
about a couple of projects that might
come out of that and then you can ask me
anything although of course feel free to
ask me anything during the talk as well
that's absolutely fine so video
conferencing is really interesting
because it has had almost the longest
time to sort of mainstream use of any
post industrial technology you know it
took a lot longer to become even close
to mainstream than telephone and of
course a lot of other technologies
similar to it it's been around as a
concept ever since there was a telephone
and ever since there were photographs
but very difficult to realize as it
turns out there's a long history of it
in fictional representations from Jules
Verne and the French futurists and all
those sorts of people this is a picture
from punch the top line up there of
course there's been depictions in all
sorts of science fiction films and books
and things like that and the earliest
actual video conferencing units all this
to way to a television was invented in
1927 by AT&amp;amp;T and they were displaying it
in 18 in 1927 which is quite incredible
but since then it's proved very
difficult to produce a consumer version
of this kind of product now of course
we've got skype and you can put it on a
laptop and you can not have it connected
to anything and talk to parents and
friends and family and these sorts of
things and I used to make a joke about
how now that it's 2014 you can even do
Google Hangouts from from space which is
like totally awesome although that's
competitors product and maybe not so
interesting but of course what I've just
heard is that now apparently skype can
do Holograms which
even better than doing it from space so
that's good to know that you guys are
working on that so let's talk about
situating the research itself and just
briefly some of these pictures that I
show here usually fictional
representations of various forms of
video calling but they all had something
to do with the talk as well and one of
them is interesting about this
particular one from Star Wars is that in
this version of holographic video
conferencing they're still displaying
the Holograms as somehow incomplete as
you know having very forms of distortion
and things like that in them now
admittedly this was in a galaxy far far
away a long time ago so maybe it's just
old technology all right one of the
issues about video conferencing of
course for people who are doing it is
that even though we've got pretty good
broadband network connections and even
though the codecs are pretty good now
you still get various kinds of
distortions especially if you're on
Wi-Fi audio obviously can be quite
choppy it can echo it can be lagged or
it can just go missing entirely same
with video it can be jerky it can
pixelate it can be frozen it can go
missing entirely and if you're really
lucky they'll be de synchronized so the
issue is how do people deal with that
that particular issue in a sense of how
participants deal with it as their
problem has not been looked at so much
in literature but what has been looked
at alright so what I'm going to do now
is sort of show you a whole lot of
different kinds of spaces of where these
sorts of things have been looked at what
they talked about but show why none of
them really deal with this so starting
with computer mediated communication
which is in a sense where I come from
from my earlier research on you to net
Relay Chat this is the kind of research
that really looks at the social effects
of designed modal features so when
something is designed into a system so
your internet relay chat is a type of
graphic system which has a synchronous
interaction but it's quite a real time
they tend to look at the actual features
themselves and look at what happens when
you're just using typography or what
happens when your typography is quasi
synchronous but not quite really
synchronous or they tend to look at sort
of social issues so how is gender done
in a typographic environment or how is
you know laughter done at a topographic
environment things like that there's
been a whole bunch of theories about
these sorts of things some of the
theories up there of course the classic
ones are cues filtered out from
keasler @l but of course that comes from
the earlier social presence theory from
short williams and christie there's
media richness theory which is sort of a
version of that but is about sort of
trying to choose the right kind of mode
for the right kind of situation aside
there's Walter type of personal there's
turkel psychosocial stuff and then
there's been some of the stuff which is
closer to what I do which is looking at
what it means when you're sequencing of
actual interaction all turns it's in
some ways disrupted by the situation
that you're in and there's there's lots
of research on those sorts of things so
that's one area but because it tends to
look at just the design features and
because it tends to look or at social
issues it doesn't tend to look at what i
call operational problems or
technological failures errors those
sorts of things those things are outside
of the scope of that so they're not
looked at then there's internet studies
which is sort of similar where they're
looking at practices and cultures are
various kinds of platforms so you've got
people looking at what's up and SMS and
blogs and Twitter and Facebook and all
those sorts of things and that's all
about trying to figure out well what are
people doing in these situations what's
special about these platforms and the
people and the way they're interacting
in them again though because it's about
the platforms and about the cultures
within them and the practices within
them they don't can deal with when
things go wrong very much a little bit
they might talk about awkwardness when
the system doesn't work but that's about
as far as it goes in terms of those
sorts of studies then there's a course
the designing media spaces study with
which you are unbelievably intimately
familiar and is now incredibly
intimidating to mention this material
which is all about what principles and
techniques underpin effective and
engaging video mediated spaces or device
design all that sort of stuff and so
there's a long history of that both in
the commercial field and of course lots
of experimental things along the way
those things of course are in they do
talk about when users had problems with
the system but they tend talk about them
as experimental situations they report
on experimental situations or you know
limited field trials not a commercial
software and they don't can spend a lot
of time on literally what did the
participants do sort of in their
interaction in terms of making it a part
of what they did because all of it is
sort of set up as experimental similarly
the same sort of stuff but tends to look
at tasc effect there's a long history of
legate
effects across Japan aside L looking at
what's the point of adding video to
audio and those sorts of things you know
can things like video media
communication support informal
communication like the fish crowd stuff
where they had the sort of the wishing
well they looked over and talk to one
another and whether it makes a
difference to detecting lying again this
is all about trying to do certain sorts
of tasks and there is talk in there
about how distortions may affect that
but there's not a lot of time spent on
how the participants actually solve the
problem there is stuff about perspective
differences that is given that we know
that participants in two different
situations have quite different
perspectives on the interaction they
have to do things to make regular
interaction of practices work so Heath
and luff talked a lot about the
asymmetries of their system especially
the fact that with their system they
were always on video but to make audio
happen they had to press an actual
button to make the audio sound each end
relator and Jordan looked at delay
generated trouble that is when there are
little tiny delays because of network
effects how do people deal with these
things in terms of say answers to
questions is a perceived delay perceived
as a problem in answering a question and
therefore a problem with the actual
ongoing interaction but there hasn't
been a great deal of look at again of
the kind of technological failures and
how people deal with that what there
does tend to be is a lot of stuff about
thresholds of problems when does it
become a problem like how fuzzy does all
you have to be before people get upset
with it how much video is the right
amount of video when can you drop out
video as compared to audio those sorts
of issues so what constitutes the
acceptable quality there's a quality of
service issue there as well and I'll get
to that in just a second I'll talk about
that now there is talk about latency
issues and quality of service research
but again that kiss me thresholds or
they say for example people playing a
video game got very upset when they're
when they're game of even tic-tac-toe
rock-paper-scissors is delayed by even
just a little bit so talk about the
frustration that the participants felt
but they don't talk about what actually
happens when they do it right what did
they do to try and saw it beyond simply
sort of saying I'm frustrated and of
course there's lots of research on video
calling in various kinds of contexts and
I've looked at couples and
there's obviously lots of stuff on home
and families as well and in that you do
start to get sort of ethnographic
descriptions of how couples and families
deal with troubles getting set up
getting started fitting into social life
you do get that but you don't get a lot
of the close detail of turn-by-turn how
do people actually incorporate that into
their interaction it's mentioned as a
part of the use part of what it means to
as it were dwell in the situation but
it's not looked at in detail and then of
course there's technology adoption which
is both a quality of service issue but
also a diffusion of innovation issue
where they've pretty much been I think
and this is my reading situation they
pretty much tend to treat this as
trouble is a self-evident thing there's
only one sort of thing and it's bad and
it's always bad and that's all it can
never be right and undifferentiated
negative so that's the context of a
whole range of different sets of sort of
fields of research which look at what it
means to have trouble while you're
interacting in technology but they
haven't tend to look at the details of
well just what happens just what
participants do so that's my interest
right video calling distortions as a
couple's problem has a participant's
problem but not just any kind of
participant as a particular kind of set
of participants doing particular kinds
of things because that's why they're
using the technology right so I don't
want to lose sight of the fact that
these are couples talking this
particular image by the way is taken
from a postcard set which was some
created in 1900 French postcards set and
I just I just love the way that all this
technology is all put together anyway so
what do I do I'm an athame the doll gist
which is a really long word which is
really quite simple it just means
people's methods the complicated version
of that is that what interested in is a
version of ordinary reasoning so what I
the way that it's it's sort of a better
explained is that it's situated it's
methodical it's self exploitative all
these things are displays of accountable
reasoning that is reasoning that when I
do something you're going to hold me to
account for it you're going to treat
that as being in some way related to the
interaction as in somewhere alone to
what we're doing and how we do it
together and it's all about trying to
figure out where the orderliness
here so as opposed to the earlier sort
of structuralist functional sorts of
stuff of Parsons garfinkel had a problem
with that sort of thing because he
thought that you know what the problem
at the 10,000 foot view is it assumes
that the order just happens like this
the order is above the order is found by
the researcher whereas garfinkel point
was we're not judgmental dopes or robots
we are making order we're achieving
order every moment as we do it receiving
the orderliness of society Garfinkel
said there's order in the plenum which
is a nice way of putting it so that
spawned also conversation analysis and
membership categorization analysis which
is a particularly interaction alee
oriented version of looking at the
orderliness that's where you're trying
to find the oiliness in turn by turn
interaction why does one turn lead to
another how does one turn look forward
how does a turn also look backwards and
how do you know what's going on in terms
of the order of turn by turn by turn and
more importantly how do participants
know the critical thing about the term
ethno methodology and the term
conversation analysis is that these are
things that people do and analysts do at
the same time they're one in the same
they're not different it's also worth
noting that we should build into this
other sorts of allied feels like such as
the Chicago School ethnography and those
sorts things especially government who
is looking at similar sorts of issues
but from a with a different sort of way
of getting at the data the data that is
methodology and conversation analysis in
particular is very interested in in
getting to is stuff that is in empirical
collections it's naturally occurring if
at all possible and it's highly
respectable so it relies a lot on
transcripts and increasingly on actual
videos and things this that actually
shown along with the the presentations
or the or the articles themselves it
looked tense looking interactions but
there's also field observations and some
interviews that sometimes Diaries and
sometimes lab experiments Garfinkel did
some they sort of fall out of favor with
the with the earth no people outside of
HCI of course inside hco live
experiments are still done what I want
to add into this is the concepts of
affordances and technologies interaction
I know you're familiar with affordances
it's been long talked about it's a way
of looking at what's going on in the
world in terms of artifacts environments
people and the idea is that there are
stable action relationships between
actors and material objects in the
meaningful world and that's the critical
bit right the meaningful world right yes
it's true that these things are in a
sense dumb and they're always there
there's a realist materialist aspect to
this but the fact of the matter is
animals and humans or humans or animals
as well I guess are highly creative and
when we see something we don't just see
the material thing in and of itself we
see what we can do with it basically in
hutch be took this concept of
affordances and moved it very cleanly or
merged a very cleaning with conversation
analysis in 2001 in his book on
communication and technology he called
this intimacy at a distance and he was
interested in in finding out how in
particular communication technologies
worked as a material frame that was
inescapable in some sense but they
didn't determine the trajectory of
actual interactions themselves that
these material frames in which we are
talking are in fact resources for
interaction for making meaning just like
anything else in a sense as a resource
for making meaning right just like the
physical room itself is so to his actual
medium itself hutch was largely actually
looking at other sorts of other sorts of
other people's research although in 2005
you also did look at mobile phones and
was looking at how they how they worked
in terms of affordances but I thought
this is a particularly valuable way of
looking at distortions in particular
because distortions are things that are
endogenous to video calling they're
completely inescapable they do happen
and you can't stop them so they're
outside of your control of their
material in that sense you have to deal
with them but you can choose in a sense
how to deal with them that to me is why
they were interesting and also why this
affordances way in was a particular
useful sort of vocabulary for talking
about it so what I did was in the end I
got six novice couples although I
actually signed up 24 couples but the
rest of them all dropped out due to all
sorts of problems which is an
interesting issue in and of itself but
in the end I got six long-distance
couples that all been couples for at
least a year they got to stay in their
respective homes and then I used a
remote recording system that I set up
they had two months trials with
no set tasks and they didn't have to
stop using other technology it was just
here try video calling see whether it
makes a difference in terms of
maintaining your distance relationships
what I knew it happened because of in
tests and stuff for a while is that
there would be trouble and my interest
was in when would the trouble occur and
what would they do with it so I was
waiting for in Dodge ously occurring
distortions and they did occur the
couples had between 511 conferences so
in sort of almost one week over that
two-week period there are a hundred and
forty five cases that I found where
distortions were not let pass now it's
critical to note that you know dropouts
of audio and glitches and video happen
absolutely all the time but most of them
are just let pass they don't make enough
of a difference right they don't pass
that quality of service or they do pass
rather that quality of service sort of
threshold test and then not paying
attention to so I was interested when
the participants themselves drew each
other's attention to some sort of
problems some sort of distortion and
then treated that as needing to be coped
with not repaired I'm going to get to
that in a second not just repaired of
those for what it's worth about fifty
percent where audio and the rest of us
but between video or combined audio and
video problems in terms of the amount of
conversation time it was disrupted the
minimum time was three point six percent
that meeting was about eight percent and
one poor couple who you will see today
forty-two percent of their of their
total talk time was disrupted by this
stuff incredible now what's interesting
about the way that these couples
responded to the interactions is that
about forty percent of the time they did
try to remedy the technology itself with
the internal various sorts of slider so
they could choose audio bandwidth they
could make a change video bandwidth they
could do all sorts of stuff like that
and they did choose to do that a lot of
the time I won't be showing you any of
that material today that's a wholly
different sort of talk and quite complex
what I was interested in in particular I
did look at it in my dissertation but
it's not in this talk what I'm
interested in a particular the content
remedies which is about thirty percent
of time when something went wrong and
the and the repair was to try and fix
the content right the informational
stuff that went wrong but the really
interesting stuff was a thirty one
percent when there were non remedial
coping responses
to distortions that is the participants
didn't try to fix content that went
wrong they didn't try to fix the
technology and stop it going wrong they
did something else they did something
quite different and in fact what they
did was they used the distortions as a
resource to do something intimate
generally it was always about intimacy
so let's look at that let's start with
something sort of simple what I want to
show you first is a conversation or pair
of distorted audio the kind of thing
that happens all the time in regular
interaction face-to-face co-present on
the telephone and also in video
conferencing as well so it's pretty
simple the order will be quite hard to
hear but I'll show you a transcript
after play what is it not playing
I don't know why that's not playing but
ok I'll talk you through the transcript
so he'll says she broke out the cake
that's how it sounds to Eve she broke
out that cake and Eva says the what the
what is an absolutely standard repair
initiator what Eva's done in the wat is
to locate that something went wrong in
the prior turn the what she even locates
more or less where it was she broke out
she unbroke out the cake that was the
last thing before the problem and so
that is the first thing that Eva says
and then she says what which is the
marker of what goes in that space and
how just does a very classic stand
repair she broke out the cheesecake he
repeats his entire turn in the clear and
nevis Ashurst nice and they go on right
and nothing is mentioned it's not
relevant that the sound cut out the
material was simply reproduced very
simply but that doesn't always happen
and what I found was particularly
interesting for these couples and this
is specifically relate to the fact that
they were doing being couples in a video
call was that sometimes when audio
dropped out when they happen to be
talking about their relationship or
something very close to their
relationship not at other times when
those things occurred then they would
actually potentially spend time trying
to figure out whether or not the
technology had gone wrong or not there
was something else at stake and there's
something else at stake was something to
do with the relationship so let's hope
that this video works goodness me here
we go why my dear
don't project on the couch yeah cut out
all right so what's important here is
that this is a couple who are talking
about arranging a shared vacation
they're going to go on vacation with
each other they haven't seen each other
in months and that's really great it's a
very important sort of thing to do if
you're in a distance relationship to
have these vacations and to arrange them
but because of both students they're
also poor so they can't afford to go on
vacation to some cool place by
themselves so they're going with friends
and what they're talking about is how
they're going to manage the hotel room
arrangements it's cheaper to have more
people in one room but if you do that
you lose out on the chance for intimacy
so you've got a relational issue that
you need to work out here so let's just
look at the transcript so des is
proposing the possibility of well if we
get a room which has got a separate
bedroom and then a living room area
someone could probably sleep on the
couch that's what he's talking about but
doesn't come out that way it comes out
as I'm some could probably sleep on the
three in cases wait what now the
difference between wait wat as a repair
and though what which was in the
previous one is it wait what just Holt's
what des is doing in midstream right
stop and it doesn't actually locate what
went wrong it just indicates that
something has gone wrong and that's
what's particularly important it's not a
locator what went wrong just that
something did go wrong in the prior turn
so she says wait what now des does what
held it in the previous example he
starts to repeat the turn the
immediately prior turn which is the
common response of doing a repair
someone could probably sleep on the
sleep on did it cut out so he stops
himself in the middle of repeating his
own line stops cuts off on on and then
he asks did it cut out no that also at
the same time that bracketed over from
cable oh that is that k comes in wild as
is saying someone can probably the slot
of sleep she overlaps and says oh so
there's an issue here des is in the
middle of producing a standard repair a
repetition of the prior material
but as he gets partway through that to
sleep he hears k go oh now that might
indicate that that's not what K wanted
from wait what that way what was
different to just repair prior material
so des cuts off right after that and he
asks did it cut out he specifically asks
whether the technology went wrong or not
cases year is as Oh some kubota sleep on
the couch right and he just finally
repairs that same turn in the same way
so what's interesting here is that it
suddenly becomes relevant to know
whether or not it was the technology
that cut out or something else because
if desert asked did it cut out and k
said no what do you mean someone going
to seep on the couch they're going to
have a Barney right there's something
problematic in terms were potentially
problematic in terms of the relationship
no they didn't know just just completely
smoothed over by mentioning the
technology so that's audio no audio is
sort of dealt with often in terms of
that conversational repair mechanism
similarly visuals were rarely repaired
their let go much more often than audio
but again what I found was that when
video distortions did occur repair if it
occurred at all again only occurred in
these relational situations when somehow
it made it was important that the author
vo was seen one so let's hope this one
works
you know teeth blurry it looks like it's
like so shut my quality I feel choppy I
wish it was better but it's not this is
why you can't date people far away oh
very funny did you like that what'd you
do did you wink mm-hmm uh yeah all right
so this is really interesting because
you've got them talking about the fact
that it's choppy you've got them talking
about the fact that in line eight and
nine all right I'll turn up my quality
steel chops they're talking not only
about the fact that there is trouble
going on both audio and especially audio
but some video and that they know there
are technological solutions right
turning up the quality is there that's
their way of glossing what it means to
use the bandwidth slider so alternate my
quality it's still choppy I wish it was
better and then k says me too but it's
not a nature teasing this is why he
can't date people far away but she knows
us at ease des says yes I know and while
he's doing that she smiles he's looking
away and then she does this exaggerated
wink and then she does another one but
you can see in that second one it kind
of goes missing she goes from sort of
one spot to another and then back again
and you don't see that big wink and does
says very funny now at that point that
line 16 very funny is responding to you
can't date people far away because it
seems like des hasn't seen the wink we
know that because cases did you like
that so what K is actually having to do
here is to check whether or not that
wink was seen because the wink changes
the nature of the t's right it
definitely shows that it was a tease for
a start right and it's also one of those
sorts of things we do too after a tease
we want to show that okay it is a tease
but we're still relationally close and
those funny Winx are sort of one of
those sorts of gags that are you know
used in all sorts of things movies and
TV and things of that and she's doing
that kind of sort of false snowing
obvious exaggerated wink
so that he can see that this is clearly
a tease and they can go on and do
something intimate but she has to ask
him whether or not he saw it because
they know they are in two different
locations and she doesn't know what he's
seen what she does know is that he
hasn't seemed to respond to the wink he
hasn't winked back for example right
typically people will do that right or
they'll laugh or something he doesn't do
that he does them more morn fall very
funny which is interesting so she says
did you like that and des soeurs what
did you do so she does another week and
he has to ask did you wink so it may
well be that on des is n we can't see
exactly what densities but on desert end
all of this was heavily distorted in
terms of the actual video itself but he
gets it he knows that he she's probably
winking and she does yet another one
into this movement and then he laughs in
them they can go on so here's a repair
of visuals again to do with relational
material right in a moment when it's
potentially relationally just a little
bit sensitive not very sensitive it
doesn't have to be sort of the
catastrophic end of the world for this
sort of stuff to happen but it's very
interesting that otherwise that kind of
distorted week would just be let pass
entirely so here's one of the most
interesting sorts of responses and it's
trouble as as a resource for teasing
I've also got another one which is a
joke as well but i thought i'll leave
the joke the joke went out the teasing
is more interesting so this is the
couple who were distorted forty two
percent of the time and they just having
a horrendous time and this is at the end
of a particularly horrendous court and
how here on the on your left is totally
frozen he has been frozen for a couple
minutes before this and they're now
moving to close the call so it's at the
end of the call itself
okay no dude he go hmm look I caught it
I don't make it through the third all
right so oh stop it okay he was so we've
got it we've got an issue with the air
here all right so they're trying to
close the call both of them are
disrupted in different ways would have
thought in different ways her first
blown kiss is missed again right frames
go missing he doesn't respond to the
blown kiss right I love you and then
there's this sort of weird pause and she
says did you see it he says no do it
again so sort of like the previous one
with this sorted wink you know did you
did you like that did you wink in this
case it's did you see that no do it
again so she has to actually do the
blown kiss again alright so we've
bothered repairing a relational
important visual and then he'll says oh
well okay I caught it now the
interesting point here is not that he
says it it's that he's frozen and he's
making this up he's now at a point where
he can say he can describe any kind of
situation he likes creatively and as it
were do what he wants with that blown
kiss and so he teases oh he says did you
see that she says no I can't well in
that case I threw it away now you didn't
throw it away there's nothing to throw
away but it's an interesting little
creative spark it's a tease which
matters relationally and she says oh you
bastard and they laugh and they say all
right I love you goodbye and it's all
fine it doesn't matter that he teased
her and that it didn't go wrong or
anything like that what matters is that
distortion was not repaired in any way
for that it was for the blown kiss but
it wasn't repaired for this instead it
became a creative spark one that I won't
have time to show you but is really
interesting is where because of blurry
video cases your mouth doesn't move when
you talk sort of like
she did before and that he does that des
does this ventriloquist act where he
pretends to be hearing a voice
off-screen and he turns the side and
hears the voice and then looks back he
talks okay and keeps going doing this
all the time it becomes a creative spark
the fact that the mouth isn't moving in
in conjunction with us with the with the
voice itself all right let's move on the
final one I want to talk to you about
just quickly is this casting in
attention as a potential technical
trouble this is a weird thing which is
sort of a medial and sort of not it's
doesn't k again this is actually in
their first talk it's very into their
first talk what you need to know is that
k on on your right hand side there is
watching my fair lady on the television
just to the side of the computer and
this is her favorite movie ever so her
attention is definitely drawn to that as
much as it is to him she asked him a
question about what he's done he starts
telling that news and then you'll see in
attention rolls along and what des does
is to not not tease or not ask her about
you know are you not attending to me he
says are you having trouble hearing me
so listen for that oh okay I never
mentally but I've ever seen it what
it
ah I can make all the other loop good to
of it you don't want to see it you get
here yeah why do this didn't want the
movie No Oh make those good movie to be
right now know anyone else in here India
no oh no do you hate me alright so
that's the the joy of that right so it's
very clear that in this particular
situation she's asked him to report the
you know about the movie and he starts
to do just what she asked but she's not
paying attention to his answers he gets
to the end of the answers and then he
you know produces sort of next responses
which would then propose that she should
say same to him but she veers off over
here she's looking at my fair lady all
the time and it keeps happening to the
point where in fact she basically
restarts the conversation half way
throughs as you I know it may didn't
want to see it what he does in response
and I'm sort of zipping through this
very quickly what it does in response is
he does ask you know I watching your
movie she says no and this is are you
having trouble hearing me again right
they've had a little bit of trouble
before they might be having some trouble
now and she says no and she's sort of
caught lying and they do then this
little sort of moment where there but
but where we're sure he's asking her the
question of you know are you watching a
movie and she's pertained to say no but
he also can see where her eyes are and
see that she's doing and then she does
that sort of big sort of funny I roll
thing so the point here is that
you've got is this little moment of
interaction when it makes sense to
actually ask whether the problem is
technological because if there's wanted
they could have gotten to a quite a
serious bonnie about the fact that she's
clearly not watching so what does this
mean what does it add up to all these
bits and pieces what I'm interested in
here is this concept of local
accountability right the point where
we've got people who are trying to
account for the distortion and they're
trying to maintain relationship as it's
happening at the same time but they're
not treating these things is just
threshold issues they're not treating
them as undifferentiated negatives and
not treating was just noise which has to
be repaired or remedied in some way what
they're doing instead is concentrating
on continuity what they want to do is to
keep going in some way and to establish
that kind of continuity means they've
got it intertwine their engagement with
the technology and an active
relationship at the same time so they're
not just being a couple they're doing
being a couple that's an active
engagement it's an active achievement
and they're doing being a couple via
video calling they know that they're
within the frame the frame is
inescapable and indeed not only is the
literal frame of the screen inescapable
so too are these distortions you've got
to do something about them what's
particularly interesting is that as has
been the case for a very long time audio
and video are treated as parallel
channels they're not combined channels
and audio is given primacy sort of a
classic classic finding but video
becomes a highly performative channel
now always is in a sense but it's
particularly importantly performative
when it comes to fixing video trouble
it's almost like if the trouble occurs
to do with video it's either completely
ignored or what it gets is these very
creative sort of dramatic moments where
they actually spend some time creatively
enacting their relationship in
interesting little ways like pretend to
be ventriloquist's or deliberately lying
and showing they're having fun lying to
one another so taking this to a sort of
a bigger picture how do you design for
the relationship between society and and
technology this image by the way is
taken from a 1930s German cartoon called
the end of the world and it shows one of
the first depictions of mobile video
telephony and they
got these big cases on their sides which
can't see in a particular image of all
the technology but they're talking to
these things in there and they're
talking it looks like two looks like a
young child in green the yellow light is
talking to a young child and green and
then the red light is talking to it's
unclear well that's also a child or
maybe a young man nevertheless using it
very much in a domestic in a personal
kind of sense this is sort of thing that
we've wanted to do for a very long time
and yet here we are still talking about
the tricky bits of how you design for
relationship between society and
technology so the old question the
classic sociological question is where
does the power lie in trying to figure
out where the causes are of societal
change is a technology or is it people
effectively to technological determinism
says the technology is a driver of
social phenomena rather than some
implicated in social relations and
social constructivism says that
technological artifacts have no inherent
properties outside of what people
actually do right outside of people's
human interpretive work I've actually
comes from from hutch be who says that
right reading technologies as texts now
it's sort of an interesting kind of
question but as castel says it's kind of
an irrelevant question right the dilemma
of technological determinism is probably
false he says since technology is
society and society cannot be honest or
to represented without his technological
tools so it's still interesting debate
in a sense but doesn't really help you
do anything I think there's a better
question and the better question that's
been asked by a range of different
theorists in a range different ways and
I would boil it down to a version of
what goth fences which is where is the
action right so adaptive structuration
activity theory actor network theory
distributed cognition proxy ology
habitus all those sorts of highly
sociological kinds of theories look at
not is technology doing it or is society
doing it but how is it actually done in
moments it might be done in very small
moments it might be done between people
and artifacts but in one way or another
it's always looking for the action what
is going on to make society be the way
it is right for people to be able to say
the things that they're saying in
computer-supported collaborative work in
HCI this is concept of local
accountability it's been around for
long time certainly since since such men
and professor Harper of course and many
others so there's been that and then
recently there's been dwelling felt like
the sociability stuff which has also
been talked about by Harper and others
and the cop and others sort of a more
ethnographic look at where is the actual
action what we're interested in here is
this this concept of the fact that we
know that people have to do things with
technologies they always have to do them
asking whether or not the technology is
making them do it is never going to get
you to any kind of answer right you're
always going to be able to argue about
whether or not they're doing it what we
need to do is to find out what people do
with those technologies in those moments
and then design for a fit so you've got
to design for the local accountability
of action so accountability this ethyl
methyl our concept of accountability it
underpins both the products and the
practices of design at the same time and
these are fitted to the society in which
they take their place right products and
practices are fed it to societies their
parts of societies and they produce
things that are parts of society's
technological affordances the actual
stuff that we're using our artefactual
resources then they are things to make
meeting with right but we do this in
creative and very fluid ways they're
usually self explicate in that is the
ways that we do it don't rely on is
telling one another and now i'm doing
this fire technology we just do it and
expect the other person to figure out
that there must be an order here and
then to follow along with that kind of
order and that can be ritualistic we
could have done it before or it might be
as in the cases of video calling quite
opportunistic and made up just on the
spot and maybe never seen again but it
doesn't mean that it's idiosyncratic and
not relevant what we're trying to figure
out here is what is the principle by
which the reasoning to get through the
situations is done and thereby how to
design to allow that kind of reasoning
right how to treat the accountability of
technology not just features as the
focus of user engagement and to treat
designing of accountability in terms of
where that action is where users are
treating methyl mythical order pneus as
being at stake how they create the order
that they need to understand this
is going on so just quickly then a
couple of projects which could flow from
this by this by the way is the 1927
first demonstration of to a technology
by Walter give it i think is talking a
Herbert Hoover actually and those was
engineer standing around so it's sort of
three projects which come out of this
all of which have these poetic names
which is sort of fun so from conundrums
to communion is all about technology
failures clearly they happen all the
time and video conf Singh has plenty of
them not just distortions within it but
also all the problems that are
associated with actually setting the
stuff up and getting going what it means
to make sense of those as part of using
the technology itself they matter to the
technology whether or not it's hard to
get things going technology adoption
would say well that might be a barrier
to adoption well it sort of is but
people do it anyway if they're motivated
and that's what we've got to try and
figure out when the motivated to try and
you know talk between grandparents and
grandkids they really want to do it
they'll figure out a way we need to see
how they're figuring out those ways all
the way right from the moment when
they're trying to turn on the computer
and stop the virus checker and all those
odds things to the moment they're
actually doing stuff the next kind of
project I'm interested in is one on
intimate looking so looking particularly
at video in video conferencing and the
performativity of this the way in which
people are developing performative modes
sort of like the things we saw where
people are talking about talking about
what it means to look at one another and
then finally this idea of from code to
communion which is really about the
software developers themselves I
realized that time is getting short so
I'll just quickly go through them the
first one is the easy one right that
there are more problems than just
distortion interestingly underneath the
gizmodo article about skype saying that
can support video calls the first
response is somebody's saying well
that's really nice but whenever I try
and do stuff up there's when I whenever
I Scott the first 15 minutes of the core
consists of me trying to understand
what's going on at the other end cameras
connect the ethernet port full system
virus can conclude coinciding with the
call disconnecting reconnecting waiting
for reboots or my blood pressure
skyrockets and then they talk about
social stuff of corralling kids all
these things are part of what it means
to use technology but these things have
been dealt with in some literature but
not in detail in terms of what does it
mean to actually create technology which
acknowledges that the intimate looking
performativity project
really looking at what it means to
figure out how to look at one another to
do who we are and what we're doing via
video calling it's based on a good ones
idea of professional vision but
obviously recontextualizing it and
performativity and also technology
technology is interaction you never see
at a distance and the third project that
i think is particularly testing is the
fact that if you look at all this prior
stuff that i've done as cool as it all
is if i may say so myself is the
developers are missing right it's all
sort of post facto evaluation 10 a 4
which is interesting it's only does tell
you in a sense how to design to get
better scores but it does leave out a
whole point of well the fact is
developers are part of this they're part
of the technology the practices their
cultural practice of developing the
software make it into the technology in
some kind of way and we don't know
enough about that we don't know a lot
about for example what developers
themselves think about interactions what
theories do they have about interactions
they've got lay theories but have there
been explicate 'add I haven't seen it
and then how do those things whatever
they may be become designs and then code
and then active features and of course
changing through each of those modes
it's interesting to try and figure out
what the printables are by which
software engineers treat their own
training and the infrastructure the
management requirements all that sort of
stuff as practical resources for making
professional judgments which then go
into designs and code and active
features and of course you don't have
just one culture there's lots of
different engineering cultures you've
got agile cultures you've got older
cultures different sorts of cultures and
they have to merge one way or another
especially now as you're having sort of
this this merger based acquisition based
technology growth this is happening more
and more so clear this is the kind of
important cultural issue that matters to
both the actual the industry sort of
quiet industry but also to the features
that are produced in the interactions so
on that basis ask me anything
jump 1mon tariff occasion there was
meeting which will be we have another
talker that's a tank so in for you to
sort of scarpa yo sorry around the
haight because I've got confused I don't
know if you mentioned the methodology
maybe at the beginning you did okay see
so it fits at a position I can ask you
later if you don't want to answer that
missing feature I don't want you to do
this full time I don't know with what
just briefly I'm an afternoon
methodologist which means that I'm a
qualitative sociologist and I collect
naturally occurring interactions and
then I sort of examined those line by
line and I'm trying to figure out
principles of ordinary reasoning in
those collections and what I'm trying to
is to create collections of practices of
reasoning basically which are done in
the moment by people to establish what
they're doing as in some way socially
orderly adopted for registering at the
media calls and our how long they were
like IE I was interested in the to the
details of the methodology since it
seems to be complex or at least I don't
know many couples you did examine okay
yeah that is in the slides I mean I'm
happy to tell you but with anyone starts
a question but they were there were six
couples they did they were two in two
month trials they could talk whatever
they like there were no set tasks I knew
that troubles would you know distortions
would occur endogenously and so I just
waited for those and I was what
interested in waiting for those moments
when the couple's themselves acknowledge
some audio or video distortion and then
made something of it right tried to cope
with it so that they could continue the
interaction there 145 cases of those and
they basically split up into three kinds
of ways of coping trying to fix the
technology was bandwidth sliders and
stuff like that was about forty percent
about thirty percent of time they tried
to fix the actual content itself what
went wrong and trying to repeat that
content and about thirty one percent of
the time they did
other things which are non remedial
coping strategies and what they
basically did was they use the fact that
distortion was occurring as a resource
to make meaning and in this case because
there were couples they were usually
doing that to make relational meaning in
other words they were enacting their
relationship by talking through the
distortion and doing something creative
and interesting with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
