around the 300 people this year
including about 30-40 people from
Microsoft and all of you come in from 19
plus universities in the asia-pacific
here yeah we have prepared our right
ranging of topics under a theme called
picking out technological trends and the
future Thailand there's a lot of
exciting things going on and it was
difficult to choose the topic however we
believe those are the not only because
their heart and also those topics will
generate a long-term impact in the next
you know a few years and to further
Jared are in summer topics to not only
however three tracks of discussion yeah
one is a natural user interaction the
other is a mobile sensing and the last
one but not least one is about a talent
fostering we also are tomorrow afternoon
we prepared our number of our demos at
the innovation day so you will be able
to see not only the latest research for
micro risks research Beijing but also
other locations of my cell research
there is also some of the projects
payment by our collaborators from the
universities so now I'm going to use a
few minutes to give you a very high
level overview of our academic
collaboration in the Asia in the
asia-pacific at her annual basis we
touch about 20,000 people through our
various events we work around the 180
University universities and the research
institute in the region around the 30 to
40 you know researchers professors came
to our lab to either spender sabbatical
and maybe just take some time off work
in our lab as a visiting researchers we
fund around 100 you know
and small projects even though maybe
funding sites not large however each one
of them really you know combined our you
know to our common interest and also you
know included the collaboration directly
with our researchers we also have around
200 interns at Microsoft Research Asia
each year yeah regularly our researchers
also visited many of you at the
universities so in the next slides I
gave you a few highlights about to wear
whatever I've done in the last couple of
years because a lot faculty summit was
in two thousand eighty in Beijing last
year around this time many you know some
of you saw us in a we were you in Japan
where we organized the first 21st
century computing in Tokyo and also in
Kyoto it was a real success with many of
your support especially like the
professor tokuda under under professor
you know professor you know where we
also launched our Mount Fuji plan at
that time that is a three year or plan
include a su million-dollar investment
with help from a dr. Tony Hall we we
work we organized a verify the software
at the beginning we thought it may be
only have a 80 70 80 people might be
interested however you know to our big
surprise there's more than 230 people
and join our faculty workshop and then
you know more interesting Lee they all
paid by themselves so that was a really
good learning experience for us that
even though budget is important however
a good set of agenda agenda and the
outstanding speakers are very important
to have a very good a successful
workshop in 2008 we initiated a project
called e heritage yeah
ab is globalized it becomes increasingly
important to preserve and to promote
cultural and historical identities we
applied our latest research for Mike
cell research you know especially from
computer vision computer graphics groups
under the leadership of dr. bilingual
you know true the those projects we
selected welcome ad hired huge party a
very successful was our collaborators
collaboration with our partners such as
a duel academy the police museums in
Beijing and the tae BAE under the
university involved such as a Peking
University and a national taiwan
university in the last two years we have
also build a new partnership in Asia it
was just a matter of you know about the
two weeks ago you know we have a journal
project through the info portion in
Japan sensitive professor Azul egawa's
help that we will do the circle of
computing in Japan next year also
working is a ministry of a knowledge
economy in Korea where we launched a new
program you know with the confirming
program that each dollar from Microsoft
you receive Cleo can also receive five
dollars from the Ministry of knowledge
economy so I hope you will participate
activity and also share the information
with your other colleagues yeah
Microsoft has always been committed to
cultivating talents yeah since the
beginning of our lab we have the most
comprehensive programs for the new
faculty for the graduate student and for
undergraduate student we are quite a
proud of our programs which have touched
the many students and help them to
launch their professional careers so
though so a program has also received
very positive feedback from the
government and the university around the
world moving forward
my cell research Asia will continue to
committed to the academic collaboration
in Asia for the next couple of years our
research collaboration will focus on a
few areas which I listed here you know
first is about a club and client
computing and then the body health a
heritage natural user interaction mobile
sensing yeah we also continue to work on
the you know internship and fellowship
and we hope you will participate
actively as well in addition through
those two items I mentioned we also
continue work on academic changes and a
curriculum development hopefully we can
work with you to apply the latest
technology to improve to change the way
of learning and look the way of teaching
