so we talked about sort of the role that
Bart's play in changing a company's
culture or having an influence in a
company's culture and one of the main
points we talked about is that the butt
is a guest within your organization
within your your slack channel for
instance and it has to adapt to the
context of which it's in so for instance
some teams are have a very jovial tone
like jokes you know will be very casual
with each other where there's some
channel some teams prefer a very serious
working environment and we'll leave the
joke somewhere else and it's very
helpful for a but to be a way of that
context and understand where it is it's
obviously a very difficult problem to
solve but would make people feel a lot
more comfortable with having that bottom
there in this space if it knew how to
behave and it's together with that is
because it's a guess and because it's
coming into your space it needs to build
trust and there's many ways of doing
that you know mixing fun with serious is
important having people giving people a
way that they can interact with the bots
in a safe and secure way before giving
it serious if neck tasks to do with
actual valuable information is very
helpful so you know you know I can trust
this thing and I know what's going to do
and how it's going to interact with me
and then you know the other side of it
is culture is very different between big
organizations small organizations and
but serve a different purpose when
coming into a small organization they
generally don't have to conform to the
culture because there isn't one it's
very fluid and mixed whereas with a
larger more structured organization
there's generally a long-serving culture
that exists in the bot needs to conform
to that and understand that culture and
this was something that but builders
have to be aware of so everyone in this
room has to think about ok what is the
kind of organization that the spots
going to be used within how do people it
like how can I give them different ways
of interacting with it so they can
figure out what works best for them and
then how can I give them opportunities
to
customize the way that it behaves so how
can i give it ways of changing the
content the way that it responds so that
people can tweak it and give it make it
feel like they own and make it feel like
it belongs in the organization and then
finally but play a very important role
as record keepers and that's very
important for the culture of an
organization you know again you inviting
them into your company you're telling
them things you need them to remember
that make that accessible and make it
available for new people coming into the
company so that they can pick up and
understand the context of the company
they're joining</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
