you
good afternoon everyone welcome to be
welcome to this monthly playful learning
expert talk today I am delighted to
introduce dr. consistent cooler senior
policy analyst at the White House she is
currently working on a national agenda
on games on learning so you know glad
you could make it and let's get started
great so officially thank you for having
me please enjoy your lunches this will
be informal so if I go in a direction
that seems incomprehensible put your
hand in the air so I don't keep on
talking in ways that don't make any
sense and alex gomez thank you thanks
for having us this has been a really
extraordinary trip just what i've seen
so far in the last couple hours here on
the microsoft campus has been
exceptional in mind blowing and i'm
really excited so i'm just going to walk
through a little bit about let me well
we first say who am i what am i doing so
i am temporarily on leaf the university
of wisconsin-madison I'm an academic who
studies games and learning games in sort
of the smarter side of fandom and gaming
writ large and I am currently advising
on policy in the White House Office of
Science and Technology so mostly what I
want to talk about here is just to give
you an idea of the tenor of conversation
around games for impact broadly at the
national level and talk a little bit
about some of the initiatives that we're
working on hopefully to inform the work
that you're doing and then we can start
having a conversation about about what
that might look like for the future okay
all right so um and in some ways I may
be sort of repeating things you already
know which is nice usually I speak to
audiences where I have to actually put
many different numbers in front of them
of various sorts order to help them
understand that games are in fact a
vital part of our economy a vital part
of our culture of our art forms etc but
in case you are not aware you know they
are in fact considered a vital part of
our economy if you just look at the
numbers of consumer spending you end up
around 25 point 1 billion much to other
people's surprise how this lines up
versus thing
like the music industry is you know a
good two and a half times x something
like the movie box office income profits
for in America it's also one of our
fastest growing economies and global
numbers the forecast if you saw last
what two months ago in economists had a
nice spread on some of the predictions
around the economy of video games and
its global markets but one of the more
compelling statistics I find is thinking
about it in terms of just our national
GDP show from 2005 to 2010 that gdp rose
by about sixteen percent so to give you
a good comparison point video games are
more than doubled right so this is
compared to other economic sectors this
is a high-growth area but what does that
got to do with the net addressing
national challenges so my role in the
white house is not simply making the
economic argument that gains are an
important part of our economy albeit
though they are and that alone should
have people paying attention but in fact
my work actually focuses on how might we
think about games as a go to strategy
for thinking about some of our national
grand challenges our stretch goals and
the administration's current goals right
now so you know in this audience I don't
have to explain many of things but if
you think about the potential for games
obviously they have massive potential
for engagement that's what game
designers do is design experiences to be
engaging the fact that they are
thoroughly social they're all so
ubiquitous across not just demographics
so we have and this isn't ten years ago
where a much smaller variety of people
gamed in fact now it's become a
mainstream activity if you look at
things like the apps store on something
like your iPhone games are the major
push they're all so ubiquitous across
the everyday routine so if you get on
the metro in DC you know it's hard to
enter a car where at least a good fourth
of them are not playing some form of
game on and on a touchscreen typically
but there's other points that make this
from a particularly salient strategy
they're conceptually transformative so
some of the work that we just heard a
couple hours ago upstairs about thinking
as games and gamification as a way to do
things like even debug systems they can
be used to explore space etc etc there
are obviously leading technologies my
computer replacement rate given
particular computer games that I happen
to like is ridiculous so as games move
into the home so do advanced
technologies they're also rich for data
analytics and assessment and of course
there are links to STEM careers you know
if you're not here at microsoft campus
or in the tech industry it is surprising
to find out that games are in fact the
biggest hobby space that we all have in
common games have a huge influence on
STEM related careers on technology
related careers on advanced
manufacturing but a lot of that
influences left sort of unspoken unless
you're in those industries themselves so
as far as potential go games have a lot
to offer in many ways the research on
video games is equally compelling and
here's just a smattering of some of the
findings so and I won't dig into too
much of this but you know the empirical
argument that games made you more than
then convey certain cultural themes that
that are that are controversial this
this argument has now been put to rest
so there are growing bodies of research
and academic disciplines dedicated to
things like literacy and games basic
reading and writing all the way over to
digital literacy neuroscience around
visual acuity attention scientific
discovering not just fold it and
thinking about high-end scientific
discovery but games there's a growing
body of evidence around games as entree
into thinking like a scientist into
doing hypothesis testing and doing
things like Theory crafting in World of
Warcraft etc so the research is equally
compelling with that I don't know if
you're familiar with any of the federal
reports that came out but in 2009 the
2009
National Academies of science put out a
report called learning science through
computer games and simulations and in
the front end of that the the goal for
this report was simply that there has
been a new call for different strategies
toward teaching science and science
literacy in the classroom with a general
idea of engaging students in as it says
you know developing understanding of
both science concepts and science
processes and the conclusion of the
report was that in fact computer
simulations and games have great
potential in terms of the state of
evidence for this is research studies
around stem in particular most of the
evidence so here you've got the five
main core categories of stem learning
that show up across things like our core
standards etc so here's five main sort
of topical areas in stem and if you look
at both the evidence and gains and have
been the evidence and simulations
simulations by the way in science have
been used in the classroom for the last
I don't know 85 95 25 years something
like that so you'll see that in fact
games were marked is emerging but
inconclusive of course if you look over
at simulations that has a huge leg up
historically on games if you compare the
two games are not faring poorly here at
all so the evidence so National
Academies of science and other major
institutions that are basically the
keepers of our collective knowledge from
academia have now sort of concluded that
games are a ripe strategy for thinking
about engaging kids in stem which is a
plus for us but it's such a science now
we've grown from when I first started
studying games or maybe were gosh I
guess zero at the time but that grew to
probably two or three programs at
universities studying the impact of
games beyond settings simply violence
and now
all that collection has grown to
probably 20 different schools of tier
one academic studying games and across a
whole bevy of topic certainly not just
stem so you have both the economic
argument that gains are compelling part
of our economy and you also have a
growing body of MP racal research
showing that games can have really
interesting positive outcomes for kids
and adults so this is sort of the
background against which the White House
starts to get interested in games as a
particular policy strategy so I want to
talk a little bit about the history of
the strategy with Obama's White House
you know since the campaign trail
President Barack Obama has been an
advocate of science literacy and STEM
education more broadly this has not
always been the case in the White House
administration yet for Obama's
administration he does in fact see STEM
education and 21st so-called 21st
century skills as absolutely
foundational to the other goals that we
have as a nation so let me try and say
that a different way unlike previous
unlike previous administrations this
administration sees understanding
science and understanding technology as
core to our entire our entire future as
a nation which means that there is a lot
of concern and energy and momentum
behind topics around that back in almost
a year ago at Tech Boston Obama talking
to a group of students actually issued a
challenge and said I want you guys to be
stuck on a video game that teaches you
something other than just blowing
something up so you start to see the
general rhetoric and tenor of
conversation around games emerge if you
paid much attention to you know games
that the first family plays this last
holiday season we had great clips of
Obama buying games for his own children
of course Michelle Obama the first lady
has long been an advocate of fitness
nutrition through her let's move
campaign and is issued for example the
healthier apps choice so this had a game
component to it that wasn't solely
Gaston games but here you know one thing
that I found so interesting about this
mobile apps challenge which was before
my tenure at the White House what I
found so interesting here was that the
general strategy was release federal
government data and then enable the
private market to innovate applications
that might leverage those data for
consumers which is a really interesting
strategy and one you'll see repeated
again and again across various agencies
so if you're interested in this kind of
work the HHS and todd parks who is the
chief technology officer of HHS his
entire team for innovation focuses on
just this strategy which is release
federal data and then help innovate and
spur and spur technology development
toward leveraging those data which is
fabulous to say the least now my own
office is John Holdren office this is
the Office of Science and Technology
Policy is anyone in here familiar with
this office yeah I wasn't either when i
first started having conversation about
joining it so John Holdren this
gentleman John Holdren is Obama's
science director in our office we really
have four core topical areas this office
it's a fairly small office in the White
House of about 60 people sixty seventy
five I think so there are four core
topical areas science technology
security and an environment and energy
it's revealing that I was originally
asked to take on the topic of games for
impact in a national agenda toward games
for impact and originally that was
straight under the director's office so
I kind of work with teams that do
innovation and within the first couple
months i became assigned to every team
except except environment and energy i'm
pretty sure i get some form of badge or
achievement pops I ding at some point if
I can conquer that one as well but I use
this to illustrate the fact that games
the administration is open to technology
strategies including interactive
technologies like games
not just for something like learning and
education but in fact to think about
improving our cybersecurity issues of
national security to think about you
know how do you increase not just
scientific literacy but how do you
actually spur innovation like the work
of Zoram Popovic and fold it so thinking
about scientific discovery so games have
been construed for me as games for
impact across almost every area health
fitness energy consumption etc and when
i joined Tom Kalil who is the main
person I report to ask me two simple
questions and they're not really so
simple but I'll tell you a little bit
about how we're starting to frame and
operationalize them the first one is
simply what games should be built what
game what are some really sweet spots
where the administration has set certain
goals and games may be a go-to strategy
or a way in which we might think about
accomplishing those goals and the second
one was in some ways more challenging in
the one that I is probably will makes
fewer headlines but I see as the longer
lasting impact which is how do you think
about creating an environment for
innovating in that space so in my
assessment games for impact are in some
ways kind of a blue ocean market like
there are some people moving into that
space and you guys are some of them but
in many ways there's this market that's
there waiting to sort of be actualized
so the question is how do you think
about spurring innovation into that
market in ways that aren't happening yet
and I should also ask the question what
is in fact the role the federal
government in doing that right i mean
the the two basic rules of thumb of
policy advising at the federal level two
of a couple probably but you know one is
that federal tax dollars should go to
places where on the cutting edge of
innovation and although private marker
does some things very very well if you
look back at certain major technological
innovations like say the internet those
actually had federal dollars far before
they were ever monetized in the private
market so that's one role of federal tax
dollars but the second role is also
investing in spaces where there's no
there's no large enough clear return for
private companies to be able to invest
in it themselves and when they when
there are spaces in which the public
good is very high but the individual
profit to be made for a particular
company is just isn't high enough for
someone to invest in that way that's
another important role of the federal
government so keep those two things in
mind so when I say something like how do
you create an innovation ecosystem that
also means like how do you try to think
about how to leverage the federal
government dollars in ways that you are
either at the cutting edge of innovation
or you're trying to spur development an
area where it's made just not be
profitable enough topics I work on this
is literally a page from my current
portfolio so there's really kind of
three themes of things I'm currently
working on the first one is thinking
about games for impact in specific areas
so you know the question of where are
the sweet spots when it comes to games
for impact and the administration
initiatives administration sort of goals
of topics like energy conservation
neuroscience casual games well-being
financial literacy you could also add to
that list several topics like civic
engagement the second big theme is
infrastructure so how going back to how
do you create that environment of for
innovation and the third one is really
kind of trying to think about pushing
discovery so there's a lot of work to be
done I mentioned some of todd parks work
with releasing federal data but some of
the big name of the game and the office
in which i work our discussions around
data liberation so what are the assets
the federal government has that it can
release for its public market that are
not simply just tax dollars so reliable
data sets and are one of them thinking
about analytics so learning analytics
and of course discovery games of Zorn
and other other efforts in that space
some let's say a little bit more about
infrastructure because that's where my
head is at right now and I probably
relates to you guys the most so on the
topic of linking back to this so three
main
things that we've been working on at the
top of that list first is sort of
establishing some form of community of
practice of the people who are investing
federal dollars in games it turns out
that I expected when I first convened a
group of people working at the federal
level across agencies so across like DoD
across you know department of the
interior etc when I first made people
that were actually involved in games to
sort of do a landscape analysis of who's
doing what in this space I expected to
run into about 30 people 40 people that
group has gotten very very large it's
actually the first meeting we had was 70
attendees 23 agencies it's nowt 147 and
33 agencies and that's actually a bogus
number already it's already like 170
people who are actually immediately
involved in games and game investments
now keep in mind that for many of the
people who are in it who are attempting
to invest in games from a federal level
they're operating with a portfolio that
spans all kinds of technologies and
strategies let's say within Department
of Education so department of education
program officer has a portfolio of
projects that are funded through their
particular program and games may be one
of them those game investments have been
around for five six eight years so the
idea of the government being interested
in games that has already been going on
long before i started my position at the
White House the difference is that my
role is to help coordinate that
interagency conversation to help figure
out are we investing in the right things
are we investing in innovation are we
redundant in places are we you know are
there gaps or redundancies and what
we're doing so it has actually been a
surprisingly large group in terms of
representativeness you'll see the three
sort of predominant theme three kind of
predominant emphasis right now in the
government is military health and
education that should come as no
surprise though maybe the health one but
those are kind of the three biggest
standing rep representatives in this
group and one thing that we've done
already is sort of form and more
official cross-agency wing called
there's this committee like sort of a
committee it sits above sits above
agencies at the sort of a cross agency
level of we've just put in place a
first-ever games committee with games in
the title at some point I had to hold
the Charter up and just sort of put it
on my desk like I believe we've just
made a committee in the federal
government that has the word gains in it
which is not like a press release about
how it's going to rot the minds of youth
I was like score mmm personal try out
there just want to get that out there
wow it's great um University so the
second major effort I'll talk about is
just sort of building University in sore
shins so once we started looking around
that group of higher institutions
academics that are already engaged in
thriving programs around games for
impact has grown from just a couple to a
good large swath so part of what we've
been doing is putting those universities
in conversation to talk about things
like okay how are we thinking about
privacy how are we thinking about
ownership what are we doing this open
source versus closed how do we solve
problems like sharing data in certain
ways that we can build algorithms that
might actually trace what people are
accomplishing without having to rebuild
the wheel again and again at every
institution so thinking about what are
some of the pain points we have in
common or assets that we could share
excuse me I have a terrible cold right
now that we could get together as a
community of universities and actually
start pushing the market in that way
here's why this is so important right
this is the thing that plagues my
existence and always has games for
impact have to be great games and they
also have to have demonstrable impact it
is simply not good enough to say we
think that it's we believe that our
title is educational right we need to be
able to build some form of argument
based on data that it has impact in
whatever direction we claim it does well
that mean
the marriage of two things that in in
some conversations have been sort of
incommensurate it means that you have to
have really great design chops you have
to know how to build a game that's worth
playing for me the golden standard is
people should play it voluntarily and
pay to play it it should be marketable
not I have to assign it in classrooms
and like bribe you with extra credit to
get you to do it right so it has to be a
great game and that's hard and most of
that talent sits in the industry some of
it sits in higher add a little bit
there's some but for the most part it's
an industry versus the second which is
games that actually have impact games
that there is an empirical argument that
they have impact and a non-biased non
profit driven argument that they have
impact so part of the reason to build
something like a university consortium
is to say are there ways that we could
partners that we can start dealing with
building your ain't games that are great
games but also researching those games
in order to make that argument for the
public and for ourselves that in fact
they're having the impact we say that
they have one thing I love about this is
that on the abstract level that sounds
like good luck with that sure and yet I
guess because I've gotten old in this
field I have yet to go to any actual
meeting where academics and designers
weren't in the same space playing the
same games talking to each other with
absolutely no problem about like how to
think about progression through a level
right so in practice where I think in
some ways there's a sort of culture
clash between the two general
institutions of private sector industry
versus academics the truth is that all
that is hogwash when you actually just
sit down and talk to each other and I
see that happen again and again and
again right I mean just the academic
presence at GDC I'm like this is awesome
this is amazing i remember when there
were no academics at GDC because simply
they believed that you didn't have to
pay attention to great design and then
it turns out you do right so it's great
to have them attending to the expertise
it's already in industry and vice versa
right we're seeing more and more of game
designers become interested in these
topics enjoying higher join both game
design
labs at universities but also take on
tenure track positions at universities
and start teaching and building that
next community well so what is the role
of industry here I don't know if you've
noticed that for many of the of the
serious video game titles the publishers
are not at all the commercial publishers
and while you guys may be the exception
to the rule most of what I spend my time
wading through as far as serious games
or games for impact tends to actually
have a publisher over here and just ask
yourself how well the Federation of
American scientists for example what do
they know about game publishing yeah
exactly right turns out that that's a
whole nother level of knowledge that is
still way over and commercial and
actually not in conversation yet with
who right now is publishing some of
those main titles so figuring out how to
get these groups in better conversation
would be a good thing um but here are
some other ones I can't stand the there
so here's some other sort of leadership
roles that I've talked to people in
industry about so thinking about things
like sabbaticals what I just talked
about with game industry designers
actually taking sabbatical and teaching
both undergrads and grads in higher
institutions or vice versa thinking
about professors and researchers whether
it's I keep focusing on on academics but
actually some of those researchers
reside not just an industry but also in
um you know think tanks and philanthropy
though to a much smaller extent but
thinking about how do we start to cross
pollinate in ways that it would be
really like how do we create a world in
which you it's viable for you to come to
my institution and intern for a year and
teach some courses where people might
learn from you and vice versa where
someone in your lab you might actually
have a PhD researcher on you know data
modeling of us particular ilk who works
with you I'm thinking about how can you
build that empirical argument that
impact is actually taking place and I
already talked about university
relationships another issue this second
couple ones is thinking about how come
start talking about assets that are
shareable versus assets that we want to
hang on to and monetize ourselves right
so what are the assets whether it be
data sets or even in some cases you know
I've seen some really interesting
examples of game engines that have been
built on federal dollars and thinking
about how can we make those shareable
because they are in fact now a federal
investment so why can't we make those
shareable in some capacity or I guess to
be more precise like where can you do
that and where do you need to actually
keep it private and then the final ones
are a little bit more general but
thinking about you know how do we
actually enable rigorous research on
impact you know there's precedents and
other fields to do partnerships where
you create you know you create some form
of like I'm thinking right now like
pharmaceuticals where in fact the
research arm is separate as a way yet
there's deep compatibility between both
research and development so thinking
about how can you actually enable some
of that research to happen and i'm just
going to in there and hopefully have
some questions as well but i will say
this part of the reason why I'm here is
because this is certainly an
administration that believes in all
hands on deck that right now you know
some of the grand challenges that this
administration has every single
intention of addressing requires people
requires input not just from people who
know the federal government but
including folks like me that are not
necessarily insiders the federal
government but they actually want input
on how to do games for impact and that
also includes people in industry who
understand some of these problems much
better than government or academic may
right i mean the old adage that no
matter how great your company most smart
people do not work for you that adage is
true as well of administration of the
federal government as a whole so the
idea of having broad conversations and
going on big listening tours is just
simply part of how we get our work done
so I'm going to open it up to questions
there I think we have another 20 minutes
with our room and I would love if you
guys were open to just having a
conversation
whether about some of the interesting
things that you're working on here and
how we might think about what are some
intersections between what's going on
the federal level and that work or
questions you have about what am I
talking about with topic X and building
a guild thing at a federal level send
all right all right our charters I don't
know how much you Alice Alex talk to you
about it it's trying to go to the blue
ocean of saying there's something that's
incredibly fun and also trying to be
good for right and we struggled in
defining exactly so what is it good for
you gain and you had serious games and
then the commercial ones do you have a
definition of what's a serious game and
we have for example scribblenauts I for
endurance people yes and that frozen
what sort of our guiding light which is
very high on both right that just set a
very high bar on both and that's exactly
where it should be right I can't tell
you how tired I am of seeing B+ or B
minus or frankly c- games that then you
know I guess I'm talking about like
certain federal grants where it's like
look we took a bunch of money we made a
fairly mediocre to bad game and then we
research the crap out of it to show that
it's a kind of fairly mediocre to bad
game right so the bar needs to be way
higher than where it is so thank you for
helping set that bar I mean as far as
defining like what is a serious game
that's a really tough question that I
struggle with you know so to take my
White House hat off for a minute and
just play the academic person my own
bias to date has always been studying
commercial games not because I don't
believe in games for impact but simply
because I'm as a researcher very
interested in what everyday person plays
not what niche community plays so my
interest has always been in kind of
following the titles that garner the
largest crowds and those are
consistently commercial games right so
when asked the question of what's a game
for impact that's a really tough
question because the the games that I
would naturally pull our
often commercial titles that were
intended to delight to entertain to
scare the crap out of you to do whatever
to help you so to allow you to socialize
allow you to frag one another and the
the impact part was a byproduct but not
an intended one right so what is a game
for impact and I think I think the hard
part about that is that I've seen games
had no simple casual games I had no
intention to have impact but put in the
right contacts in the right curriculum
or the right activity can do amazing
things I've also seen games that had
every intention to teach something or to
change a practice that had no effect
whatsoever so I don't know that there's
like a hard definition I will say this i
will say that number one I do not see
games for impact as a genre one thing I
think is really stymieing both
development and research is that people
tend to treat it right now because the
communities are to segregated as some
sort of weird genre and like games for
impact or not a genre right there is
simply a way to talk about games that
are hopefully good games but beyond that
I'm not sure I'm not sure that that
there's a clear way to sort of define it
the reason I bought this slide back up
was that I will tell you this so in this
report I was part of the committee that
put this together and I mean that was
like I think we did most of our work in
like two thousand eight and it took two
years for us to get this report out so
by the time it came out you're talking
about games that some of them no longer
even exists which was interesting an
interesting lesson I should say and how
hards and this work is but in in this
particular document i worked with a
gentleman named carl women who has a
Nobel Prize in Physics and he and i were
matched to actually do this state of the
evidence part so wading through the
evidence about games and the part about
simulations and Carl Wyman's expertise
is a simulation side and my expertise is
the game side it was a very interesting
conversation we'd allow thumb-wrestling
to see who was going to win various
arguments but the hardest part about
this about growing this trying to even
ride a synthetic document about the
state of evidence was really difficult
because many of the studies you couldn't
even figure out
like what the goal was right so the I
guess to make two in this long answer
it's that i will say that like in the
game titles that you're working on if
you can even specify like what are the
actual goals for impact that you want
and i don't mean that like a overly
narrow way i don't mean that in a way
like our goal is to increase students
performance on 8th grade science by one
standard deviation like that to me is
pretty narrow and that's fine if you
want to do it but i mean even in a
broader sense like i would just like to
have someone be interested in science
longer than they might have otherwise or
i would just like to engage someone in
contributing to a group where your where
your contribution makes a difference and
just to have that experience or whatever
the impact goal is if it's specified
then you can get some traction on the
research right the hardest part is when
there is no goal specified there's just
a design and some claims about it so i
don't know if that helps at all it
certainly doesn't help you define it but
at least if we can get specific about
goals I mean gains matched particular
goals I think we might get some traction
yeah how's the White House spending
their dollars for trying to any space to
the impact of games is it more on the
the research side or is it like giving
grants to independent developers or
how's that sir King structure so I
assume you mean the agency's versus the
White House because by the way my own
salary is coming out of my own pocket of
grants back at my home institution so
yeah so I mean the White House and the
awesome part about this interesting job
is that we control no budget whatsoever
we have no budget right things we do
well we do meetings really well we do
policy advising really well I can
convene the crap out of a topic like
what's can be and let's do it you know
but it's but you can get a lot of
leverage out of those things but that
said so are you thinking about like how
the agencies are like yes even like what
there
their goal would be to you know try to
steer funds places right so hmm okay so
what would be the White House goals so
the agency goals are truly very broad so
what for example is going on in
Department of Defense is even wildly
different than what's going on in DARPA
so DARPA right now is much more
interested in sort of like crowdsourcing
and exploration and sort of
cybersecurity and much more cutting-edge
topics Department of Defense you see a
whole lot more of sort of military
training simulations which are games but
in a very narrowed sense so my so my
role is to advise across all of these
areas which is fairly broad and I can
tell you what my priorities are and here
they are there so my priorities right
now my the last couple months have
focused primarily on infrastructure so
thinking about how to shore up what
we're doing with federal dollars and how
to get much better communication between
industry academics and federal money
like how do you make that triangle work
including things like can I create an
event that's piggybacked on a designer
event where I can literally take the
program officers that control those
dollars and put them in the same room
with people who do game design and have
a conversation so that they can get a
better sense of even simple things like
game design requires iteration your
grants don't allow iteration if you do
not allow iteration you are stymieing
the product right so just conversations
like that so right now my head is much
one this infrastructure space but i
would say on the first question that
Khalil gave me of what should we be
building i would say probably these are
the five top themes in play so thinking
about fitness energy conservation really
thinking about how do we marry stuff
like the emergence of smart grids and
better data like consumers can now get
much better data that their own energy
consumption and thinking about how could
you use games as a way to as a way to
engage people in
own energy energy consumption so that's
another very hot spot financial literacy
is one that has actually been developing
long before I came into the picture but
on that topic the sheer fact that so
many games basic financial literacy
concepts are already embedded in so many
games is an interesting sweet spot to
think about well you know for example
when i go back to world of warcraft
because that was from the earlier work i
did wow so it turns out that like
there's a whole thriving community
conversation theorycrafting mods in part
of the game if you do not understand how
to so for example you know sell high and
buy low you simply don't go forward
right so thinking about like what's the
marriage there like how can you think
about that as a game mechanic is that
help yes okay those are more just like
an advisement body is what you're saying
then trying to give people the sort
these sort of resources to help them
build these sorts of games yes yeah so
um and because we advise to the White
House level we advise we do not get into
the business of procurement on any level
instead we're much more abstract than
that so we advise on what are good
investments so for example a typical
thing would be to issue an advisory kind
of paper that might say here are seven
areas I believe are high return on
investment we should be innovating in
that document with an influence down the
pipeline that was abstracted but
hopefully helpful yeah challenge try to
help educators because
and there's certainly no shortage of
challenges there that we try to do
special co2 in a walk with huge products
it's given them whether it's information
or education or training or you know
tools posting photos free so what do you
see on a federal level as far as
initiatives there that are helping that
that are helping teachers yeah that are
helping really kind of make tea should
be more successful than kind of doing
what we're trying to see here think
about that so on a federal level I mean
there is I mean that's you know it's
interesting we were having this
conversation earlier today or yesterday
about you know education is a
particularly sticky topic because so
much of Education happens at a state
level versus a federal level and now we
have like a common core which is just
even the beginning of a common language
but in the Department of Education I
would say that they are one of the slow
I mean I'm being overly honest here but
they are one of the slower branches to
warm two games in certain ways and yet
for example there's discussion of sbirs
that might spur small business so an
SBIR forget the exact acronym of it but
essentially it's to Smurfs to spur small
business partnerships with federal
dollars to create things like games for
innovation now the discussion about
teachers is always sort of a precarious
one and a a hot political one as well I
would say that you know probably the
best work i'm seeing done right now is
jim holder ins office through the
investment for innovation i believe it's
called and Karen Cator who is our
educational technology person in
Department of n both of those are really
big innovators but you know the
interesting sort of rule of thumb that
I've run into it that I think is kind of
a problem and why I have nothing
tangible to really report to you is that
I think that in conversations about
learning technologies for anyone geeky
enough like me to pay much attention to
it there is suddenly a lot of
conversation about technology and
learning right three years ago this was
not the case suddenly it's very hot and
there's a lot of venture capital going
in a lot of new companies a lot of large
publishers moving into this space and
buying small company so it's just a lot
and play and part of the big glory of
this is really thinking about big data
sets there is almost a an almost utopian
view toward technologies for learning
and then just if we just get the
assessment metrics right if we just get
the research right then almost as though
the technology will be the solution to
learning so teachers get left out of
that conversation a lot it's not very
popular and it doesn't make the
headlines to say that in fact like a
technology tool forget it just being
game any kind of technology tools really
only as good as the conversation around
it right the same is true of every
medium I know but that doesn't really
it's not a very popular thing to say it
certainly doesn't get the headlines and
it doesn't get the kind of video what
what's the venture capital is supposed
to invest in your like conversations
with good teachers it's hard to do right
so I would say that you know trying to
get like teachers and even forget about
teachers in classrooms I mean I'm also
as equally if not more interested in
things like parent conversations or
peer-to-peer conversations like getting
the phantom space is back in the
equation of where learning is taking
place is a tough nut to crack of course
keep in mind that I am the only social
scientist in my office the only one
right so it may just be that in my
corner of the woods I hear a particular
conversation and it may look differently
a much more optimistic when you go to
Department of bed I don't know I just
gave you a depressing answer though and
I'm sorry haha which actually the call
to arms it means keep doing your work
right ask you must already all see
roblox and running yeah moving forward
with educating teachers October we're
getting technology schools particularly
a policy on that effect well the school
is happens not enough cute yeah well i
think you know i know the scott can
participate to this too but it's it's
it's just a big job right there's a lot
of teachers out there I mean every day
we're hearing teachers I'm like hey we
need some help we've got to talk to you
about the school how can we learn to do
it and you know we're trying to do our
best really reach out these folks it and
help them and they're very they really
want to do it right there excited these
teachers really like get fired up about
the stones but kind of gets us excited
that's right but it's just such a big
job that where it just seems like I know
the UK is doing all the talkin Alex's
talk about that they doing a lot of
stuff over there to try to kind of get
that across the board it just seems like
we're we're doing the bottom up it seems
like there should be some sort of
top-down push to kind of help as well
then just that cap would might consent
thereto draining the pikas
teachers have this barrage and
technology will say get into it and see
it how easy it is in terms of the
technology we run into a couple of
things a graphic card issue schools are
technical typically running over
internet explorer and we obviously don't
get access to the internet like we would
hear so sharing levels and screen that
community sometimes tough but we find
workarounds for and they're passionate
about not actually do fine I would be
very interested if I would love to hear
even I'll here I'm going to put up my
email right now I would love to hear
your thoughts about uh there you go
hello how to get it up I would love to
hear your thoughts about ways to more to
to better enable that space it strikes
me that one all right let's see if I can
actually get this big and please write
this down and keep me in mind for a
future stuff but it seems to me that
that would be terrible that would be
wretched for all you font lovers out
there I just ruined your mind didn't I
did I get that right I think I got that
right um I would love to hear your
thoughts on this and continue that
conversation because there isn't enough
movement that space it occurs me that
one one potential lever might be to also
do a better job you know in the sort of
technology literacy skills incoming
teachers have there you know I've
watched a sea change I sit in a school
of ed for teachers right and so I have
gone from i remember in 1998 literally
the attitude of incoming teachers was
like not all schools have great
technology so it should be thrown out if
everyone can't have it then no one
should have it and then the field
shifted into debates about computing
computers are they good for you or not
discuss and you're like that's like
asking me if the color blue is good for
me it's just so weird and all that
conversation is died now except that so
I think we see like a new incoming
generation that's just accustomed to
games accustomed to technology but you
know i'm not sure that we're seeing a an
equal level of innovation and moving
forward when it comes to sort of
technology in schools and programs that
are actually training teachers and then
supporting teachers and part of like
their career ladders so I wonder what
that space will
alegna patna it might not be another
place to actually reach out for a much I
know it doesn't solve the immediate
problem but like as a much longer term
conversation about what does that
teacher I'd look like around things like
interactive technologies that I mean and
this actually i think is something at a
policy level
that is what is sin devices a picture to
pick up a technology I you know in the
current structure in the current
structure of schools in I would argue
probably 43 out of all the states
there's absolutely no incentive to get a
teacher say hey I'm gonna pick up or I
want to learn this new thing and that's
going to give me some sort of you know
benefit in my career instead it is you
know if you're not teaching to that test
and and it's interesting to me right now
that we are seeing you know the moment
that that the administration made
optional to be part of No Child Left I
what states are dropping it like flies
this is that that's clear you know
plaintively why that is happening but in
my mind I think there's an important
piece of work to be done influencing the
conversations and at the sub thinking
that states are doing about around those
teacher incentives and I know that
that's in you know central part of
rethinking how do you know Obama has
stuck lauded numerous occasions how do
you know I don't even I know we're out
of time here but i would even raise the
bar a little bit higher and much more
long-term to say that you know one of my
great hopes for games is that there are
understandings that you can communicate
and games there are impacts that you can
have that are very difficult to get
elsewhere and like beyond all the
conversation about standards and common
core and content and focus on content
standardized tests and all this stuff
one of the things that I find really
compelling about games for learning is
that you can get to a lot of really deep
and important sort of content and
practices that are far beyond what's
articulated in standards right so on the
one hand the standards have been
incredibly common core been very very
helpful in helping us have a
conversation about what those goals
might be like you've been putting people
on the same page it's been very helpful
but on the other part and on the other
hand sometimes I think you know some of
the things that are the biggest bangs
for your buck in terms of impact for
games
don't show up in content standards at
all right I mean including simply
knowing what it's like to really
difficult and a system and be able to
push on it and understand where it's
going to push back right you're not
going to see a content standard
dedicated that specifically or to
understand what it's like to like
contribute to a community and have it
matter in a way that once you have that
happen once you experience that it's
very hard to not get engaged to be too
it's it's very it becomes very difficult
to be cynical about civic engagement
once you actually find that something
you do had real impact in the world you
know sorry whatever advantages I look
like an extradition we please this is an
area that should be basically
it's basic research you understand how
are we thinking with key right we don't
even know it we don't understand it and
we're making claims about games having
impact or being good for learning or
this or that it does based on different
media so yeah just like I couldn't say
hey I'm going to evaluate of you you
know are able to critique you know One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by asking
you to read an essay about One Flew
whose nest right yeah should we try to
do the same thing right which is to say
we all said the new future standards
right for what understanding should look
like and so there you go there's a call
to arms I don't know what people's
schedules are but I would again I would
welcome more conversation if people have
time for it or simply email me ideas you
know I've got probably another 12 months
to work on this project and I'm very
interested in ideas about what people
would task me to do and pain points that
you have in your own industry or things
observations that you've had again as I
said this is an all-hands-on-deck kind
of move I will tell you this the idea
that the White House has someone on
video games in the first place is
already a huge step in the right
direction so if you think about you know
presidents who understand media I think
that Obama certainly demonstrates an
understanding of sort of new technology
that here before we didn't really see
and I think that alone is a certain win
but I will stand up and celebrate once
we actually make some traction and more
stuff happens like what you're actually
building now so I guess thank you for
doing the work that you're doing but I
hope you don't hesitate and telling me
how to do my job better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
