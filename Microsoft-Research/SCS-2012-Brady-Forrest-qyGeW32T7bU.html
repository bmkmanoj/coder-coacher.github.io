nine eighty people got together and
build a 35 foot tall Rubik's Cube this
cube would dominate the sky at night
there were three controllers for it 14 x
14 y 1 / z they were screaming distance
apart from each other the first time it
was solved it took three hours the
person who ended up controlling it with
his two proxies lost his voice ended up
having runners who would run to the
other people as he said shift left shift
right go green whatever this was done
obviously at burning now I'm going to
Burning Man almost every year I've been
ten of the past 12 years and it's where
my community in seattle i suppose base
current is running man now if you've
never been to burning man it's really a
pretty amazing place in a week it
becomes a city of 45,000 this is a shot
that i took probably in 2007 from a
skydiving plane I don't Scott it but I
wanted to go up the city is tink like a
clock and so here's the man in the
middle there's a temple of midnight the
sound systems the club's broadcast out
into the desert and then this is where
people live all throughout the white
area is where the heart is and that's
why I go back to bring them is to find
the arnessk you see is very well
organized sorry Joe and we have a great
public transportation system of cars
that people will have built and will
drive you around and this is the size of
burning them it's pretty huge you can
walk around it all day every day and
never see the same thing twice there are
hundreds of art projects like this
Trojan horse which is about 60 feet tall
several hundred people worked on it and
on the last night in 30 min the night
before the actual man burn it exploded
in
see the fireworks set ablaze by a woman
with a flaming arrow you have to wonder
why do people invest this much time this
many hours building art for a city that
goes away and in large part because we
do open that city it's a city that is
built by the people for the people and
there is no real need for an Occupy
movement because the city is already one
that the people were created and there
are no rules other than don't need
litter and it's really about building
your community in Seattle our challenges
are rare to find a good breakfast brunch
spot that doesn't take too long here is
how do I keep my tent stake down from
blowing away how do i do my art from
falling over also there's something
beautiful about having the art only
lasts for a week you can build it you
can cheat in ways you can't here in the
city and there's something about having
a whole city as your playground let's
build at a different scale you can't
really build our concern
stories tall without major furnace and
years of paperwork like you can and
burning them where you just show up any
built and it lasts for as long as you
want and people do geek out this is our
equivalent of a street view this person
has six point shoot cameras on top of
his recumbent bike and you can go check
out street view burning in their aerial
maps but there's a lot of criticism
around burning and it is a lot of time
effort and money and the traffic is
great in San Francisco during that one
week every year but I think it's
important that people have this out of
it and that they go experiment but it's
also important that they bring it back
and that's the trend that I really like
to see and that Rubik's Cube project
that you saw the beginning is now in the
middle of a nine-month display at the
Seattle Pacific Science Center where
kids and families are coming in and we
all going to end it to us about two
weekends to set it up you could go there
now and play with it it's Arduino this
cloth based so my suggestion to you is
forget the fact that there are a lot of
making people that are forget the fact
that it's a big party go there for the
art go there to make your friends better
get to know them in a different way I am
happy to offer classes I can even offer
a two or if you wanted I'll probably be
going again this year and so I suggest
you go there build our make community
geek out and then bring it back to your
city thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
