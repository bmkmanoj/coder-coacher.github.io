you
I'm commun wet house I'm a visiting
scholar here at Microsoft Research
coming from University of Virginia where
I'm an associate professor and I'll talk
to you today about some of the work my
group is doing sensing doorways and
trying to use that information to figure
out what's happening inside a
multi-person home so the first question
is why are we sensing homes well for
better or for worse the average person
in the United States spends ninety
percent of their time inside and sixty
percent of that time is actually inside
their own home that number can actually
go up for certain populations of
interest the elderly children people who
work from home and we're trying to
leverage that fact to use the house the
home as a window into the people's lives
to understand what's happening in their
lives and for example we want to know
how much energy people are using what
they're using that energy to do and how
they might change their behaviors to
reduce their energy consumption we also
want to understand people's sleeping
habits eating habits and any changes in
those habits or other habits that might
indicate health or illness and of course
we also want to understand social
interaction in the house for example how
well and how effectively people
coordinate to have dinner together or to
share resources like a car and the way
people might do that today is to
instrument the home instrument the
objects in the home and instrument the
people to understand what's happening so
let me give you some examples and if
this is one of the houses in the United
States about 34 million of those homes
have a smart power meter so they can
monitor the energy consumption of the
entire house and that data automatically
gets sent up to the utility company and
about 10 million homes in the United
States have a smart water meter
monitoring overall water consumption now
these don't measure the consumption of
individual appliance is the only for the
whole for the whole house but even just
with this information you can figure out
for example what time people go to sleep
when all the lights turn off and all
appliances turn off with hang the wake
up when they go on vacation and if you
want to get more fine-grain information
than that then you can add more sensors
so we can disaggregate that power
consumption for example into individual
appliances or water consumption into
individual water fixtures the way people
typically do this is to add additional
probes let me say let me call them
probes to the objects themselves to
figure out let's say when the object
turns on or is activated or deactivated
and then how much energy or water it
consumes another way to do that is to
add more sophisticated sensing to the
power means or water mains that can help
differentiate those objects and identify
how much energy or water they're
consuming in real time and once you've
done that you can figure out what
objects people are using them from that
you can figure out activities for
example if you know that the bathroom
sink and the toilet are being used
somebody's probably using the bathroom
if you know that the kitchen sink and
the oven are being used somebody's
probably cooking dinner and that
solution works well the only or one main
problem with that is that you're
monitoring activities at the household
level so we don't know which individual
is cooking we don't know which
individual is consuming water in the
bathroom and so on and this is a problem
in particular for things like elderly
monitoring in a house where you might
have one sick individual and one healthy
individual both living in the same house
and you want to know is the sick
individual waking up when are they
sleeping when are they eating how often
are they using the bathroom and so on
and if we can't differentiate the
different people in the house then we
can't do that kind of monitoring so of
course one problem here is that people
don't all live alone in fact only ten
percent of the population in the United
States lives alone so we really do need
more effective solutions to monitor
individual people in multi-person homes
and the way people would do that today
is to add tracking systems for example
cameras or microphones or wearable RFID
tags or other solutions like that as you
can imagine people are reticent
sometimes to accept this technology into
their homes and and so for that reason
it's hard still to monitor
multi people multi-person homes what I'm
going to try and convince you of today
is that we actually don't need any of
that that all we need to do is
instrument the doorways since the
doorways and turn those doorways into
portals to see the multi person home to
extract information about the
multi-person homes such as activities
and energy usage of the individual
people and we can do that with no need
for cameras or microphones are wearable
tags and no need for additional probes
on the objects in the house or the
infrastructure in the house that's the
goal that's so why do we believe that
the doorway is so important that the
door waking provides so much information
why not since the walls or the windows
are the floors or the furniture or the
appliances the reason is that the doors
are essential to the rooms and the rooms
are core to the structure of the home so
rooms don't just divide space rooms also
divide activities house a room is
equipped with furniture and objects for
certain activities you can't sleep in
the bathroom you can't brush your teeth
in the bedroom you can't cook in the
living room right every room is
instrumented for specific activities
rooms also divide things like lighting
and heating control right the walls
around the rooms help to insulate from
thermal transfer or light transfer and
so you can control rooms individually
but you can't control necessarily parts
of a room or multiple rooms as easily
they also divide social interaction
walls divide people but common rooms and
hallways and so on help bring people
together in fact the aspect of a doorway
and rooms to separating things in a
house is so fundamental that just about
two years ago from notre dam notre dame
people some psychologists performed a
study showing that walking through
doorways causes forgetting and the idea
here is that you as you walk through a
doorway your mind believes you're about
to change from one episode of activities
to another and for that reason it files
things away in your memory and it wipes
your cash so clear clear
you're working memory and it does that
as soon as you walk through that doorway
that's how fundamental the doorway is to
the structure of the house and the way
we perceive the house and that's why
when you walk into a room often you
might find yourself maybe not you but I
at least find myself forgetting what I
came in the room to do because as you
walk through that doorway your you're
working set has been cleared so the Rue
the doorway is not just part of the
physical structure of the house it's a
core part of the semantic structure of
the house and by sensing that door we
hope to keep our finger on the pulse of
what's happening inside that home so to
test this theory out we built a
prototype so let me explain how this
prototype works the prototype is a
doorway sensor and you can see it's kind
of a plastic enclosure that snaps in
behind the door jamb at the top of the
doorway and it's got a lot of sensors
built into it for example it's got a
motion sensor to motion sensors in fact
one pointing in each direction to
monitor the adjacent rooms some of them
have a door latch sensor if the doorway
has a door to monitor whether the door
is open or closed inside that enclosure
you have things like temperature sensor
magnetometer light sensor and the last
thing that you see here is an ultrasonic
range finder that can measure distance
and it's pointing downwards into the
doorway I'll explain to you what all
these sensors do and how they work
together but first let me explain what
they're supposed to do so we take these
sensors and we combine them these
doorway sensors put one in every door in
the house and we combine them with the
electric meter and water meaner than I
discussed earlier that are already being
deployed across the country for because
they basically make billing easier for
the utility companies so by leveraging
that data and combining that with the
doorway data what we hope to produce is
something like what this video is about
to show you so you don't need to
configure anything what you do is just
install these sensors in the doorway and
all of a sudden a map pops up showing
the floor plan of your house so it's
been figured out person walks into a
room and a black icon follows him in
detects that he turned on the lights and
the television another person walks
through and a purple icon follows him
through and so the important thing here
is that the system was able to figure
out that the first person is still
sitting in the first room the second
person
moved on to the back room and it's
monitoring the water light and
electrical activities that person is
doing so the other person walked around
out of sight of the camera but we can
still see the person in the bathroom
here walking through the other rooms
turns on the light turns on flushes the
toilet washes his hands turns the light
off comes back in turns off the
television and walks out the door the
other person turns off the microwave and
walks out all this activity is being
detected and by those doorways sensors
and the two whole house monitors that I
mentioned we already got some questions
go for it oh I like that so I guess the
question is I'm sorry this example like
every person is in a different room at
they became a time that's why you
actually track them what if all three
people and the living room and then want
this has to leave how do you keep track
of who is who it's a good question if
people if you have multiple people in
the room that can be problematic and
we're still working on solving that
problem but we still think that we can
do a pretty good job just sensing at the
doorways and I'll explain why later how
are you able to get the smart meter data
where you're getting it from the utility
company or directly from the meter
itself practically speaking we install
our own that we could get a data from
okay cuz i was gonna say it's really
hard to get the data from the utility
company yes you can depending on which
part of the country you live in get that
data although you won't get it at a
higher enough resolution to do what
we're doing so we basically install
their own the idea is in the end that
power meter data would be able to would
be would be available and in a good
number of parts of the country there are
incentives power companies to give that
data to the customers and I do to give
that data although not necessarily at a
very high resolution other questions
okay so so that's basically what it's
supposed to do now let me explain how it
works so I'm going to talk about in the
rest of the talk i'll tell you about two
main things about this application one
is a technology itself how this whole
thing works and then i'll talk a little
bit about applications which basically
means what we're going to do with this
kind of technology so to start out with
technology I'll talk about it in three
different pieces there's first what we
call smart blueprints the thing that
infers the floor plan of the house and
the location of all the objects in the
house then there's
what we call a door jamb tracking system
that figures out which room people are
in and then there's something we call
fixture sense that identifies which
fixtures are being used so the first
thing when you want to do is figure out
after the person installs these sensors
in the doorways how that what that floor
plan looks like and where the sensors
are relative to each other and so if you
imagine that these circles represent the
motion sensors on both sides of that
door we've got one of these doorway
sensors in each doorway and the system
of course hasn't been configured
requires no configuration so to the
system it looks like an anonymous set of
unordered doorway sensors and what is
trying to do is figure out what that
floor plan looks like so the first thing
it does is look for motion sensors that
detect correlated activity so if it
senses that motion sensors are
correlated it connects them with a line
and it looks for clicks in this informs
a graph and it looks for their cliques
in the graph and each click represents a
different room and we know that two
motion sensors are put on every side of
every doorway and they're connected in
the same physical enclosure it can't be
separated so for example these two
motion sensors here we know are
connected in the same physical enclosure
therefore these two rooms the blue room
in the red room the blue click in the
red cleek must be connected so we looked
for look for adjacent doorways adjacent
motion sensors and define those to be
connections between rooms and from this
graph here we generate what we call a
room adjacency matrix so every click
becomes a room and every pair of
connected sensors becomes a connection
between those rooms and adjacency
connection question that's right the
basic idea the high-level intuition is
that these motion sensors will all
detect the person in the room at the
same time so if you're in a room then
motion sensors in that room will detect
you it's actually much more complicated
than that but for short you know brevity
L I'll skip over that detail yes that's
right there's a that's right there's a
learning period where it figures out the
floor plan and then you can turn on your
tablet computer and see the floor plan
so for the first has to learn that and
we're working on shortening shortening
at the period of learning period is
about one week now we're think we can
get it down to a day or less than ending
question the question was can you guess
that this might be an interest in the
house because it's far away actually I
drew it this way only because that's the
actual locations but the system and
doesn't know how far away they are all
it knows is we have an ordered set some
of them are connected and some of them
some of them are connected by co
correlated activity and some of them are
connected by physical colocation in a
same enclosure I think the question is
do the doorway sensors know that others
doorway sensors that are exists yeah so
they have to be sort of on the same
wireless channel let's say so they can
discover each other that's right okay so
we end up with this adjacency matrix
from that graph I'm sorry that we come
up with a room adjacent C matrix our
graph and one thing you notice about
this is that it's not very rigid it's
under under constraint so you can pick
up one edge of this thing and shake it
and it'll move around a lot its kind of
floppy so what we want to do is add
constraints here and that's what we use
the magnetometers in the door by sensor
for to monitor the direction of the
doorway the cardinal direction that the
orientation of that doorway where the
doorway where the door sensor was placed
so for example some of those sensors
might be facing the northerly direction
some
be facing south somebody facing east and
so on for each of the doorways I'm gonna
use that constraint to define a
relationship between every pair of
adjacent rooms which one is east which
one's west which one's north which one's
self and we so this is a much more
constrained graph but is still not fully
constrained for example this room here
might have an interior wall with that
room or my deal with this room or with a
combination of these two rooms and so on
so we don't know exactly how these rooms
connect to each other in terms of
interior walls what they don't have
doorways and so the last thing we do is
use the light sensors on both sides of
that sense of that doorway sensor and to
figure out which walls in each room our
exterior walls in other words which wall
is probably have windows and so that the
light sensor will detect for example if
it's an east-facing doorway if it's a if
it's a doorway into a room on the east
side with an east-facing window it'll
detect a lot of light from the east
facing window in the morning it has a
south-facing window to detect a lot of
light midday and if it's a West have
that has a west-facing window it'll
detect a lot of light in the evening and
so based on you know time yes or no time
so yeah you have a network so you can do
you can do time yeah so so you know that
so you know the time of day and you can
estimate based on the light patterns
that the light signature that you get in
that room which win which direction the
windows in that room are facing and so
on this graph we can overlay estimated
window locations and now this is more or
less a fully constrained graph and we
can piece together the house kind of
like a puzzle where we know for example
that this is a south east facing window
so that sound face south east facing
room so it's probably adjacent with this
one here and so we end up with a with a
house floor plan that looks kind of like
this our original floor plan look like
that they're not exactly the same but
they're very similar I'm one of the main
differences is that the room sizes and
this graph are almost all the same
whereas in here this graph they're all
very different we think we can estimate
those room sizes as well using things
like using time how long it takes for
example to get from one doorway on one
side of the room to doorway on the other
side of the room I haven't gotten to
yet but that's one possibility to make
this look more like that so one of the
challenges here is that like I said this
is more or less a fully constraining
network but not completely constrained
and sometimes there are more than one
floor plan that satisfy all the
constraints we were able to extract out
of these sensors and you might have more
than one floor plan that's viable and so
to address that problem with basically
when the person opens up their tablet
computer and looks at the fuller plan
for the first time they need to swipe
through a few floor plans and choose the
one that actually looks like their house
and this is based on the assumption that
it's easier to recognize your own floor
plan than to create it in the first
place especially for a non technical
user and so we deployed the system in
four different houses and in three of
this three of the houses we had a pretty
a small number of candidates so the
person had to either swipe I fear had
only a single candidate or they had to
choose between two different candidate
floor plans in the last house it didn't
work at all and so we know that there's
a lot of work left to be done here but
so so yeah we know there's a lot of work
left to be done basically and I won't go
into more detail yes well one of the
problems with this house was it had
multiple floors and so we have to add
pieces to the algorithm to deal with the
multiple floors another problem with the
houses then it was um it was built by an
architect who lived in the house and it
had a very modern open floor plan and so
you don't have as much separation
between rooms as you would in a
conventional home where you have more
walls and that led to problems with
motion sensors seeing through rooms
basically we're trying to address that
we think we can address that with the
height sensors the the doorway Center
sorry the ultrasonic range finders that
I mentioned a little bit early on I
won't go into details about how we're
going to do that but certainly there's
work to be done and we have some
direction about how to do that so that's
basically how the floorplan system
floorplan inference system works and and
what the results look like so far next
I'll talk about our door jamb tracking
system this is a system that actually
figures out where people are in the
house and so the idea is
toukley that we've got ultrasonic range
finders pointing down in the doorway and
typically it monitors the floor had the
distance to the floor and when a person
walks through it measures the distance
to the top of the person's head there by
inferring the height of that person and
that's how it differentiates the
identities of the people in the house so
it knows for example the shorter person
is in the front room the taller person
has walked through the front room and
into the back room now just because we
know the person's identity as they walk
through the door by doesn't mean we know
which room they're in they could have
walked in either direction so we take
that ultrasonic range finder and tilt it
just a little bit and that causes an
asymmetric sensing region so when the
person walks through the door we now
have an asymmetric response if the
person walks in the direction of the
tilt we'll see this the shortest
distance to the head first and the
longer distance kind of trail off but
they want the opposite direction this
waveform will be flip so now we know the
person who the person was and we know
which room the person has entered and
that gives us that gives us tracking
people inside the house yeah what if
they're the same height yeah so there's
a lot of noise that's good questions
people typically are not the same height
especially when they live in the same
house so we we did an analysis of some I
think it was a twelve thousand homes and
only in two percent of the homes that
people have did it where the residents
so close in height that this wouldn't
work I mean that's because there is age
bias and gender bias and other factors
that cause people in the same house to
be different heights sometimes you have
twins we just don't support twins and
what happens when you have noise like
high heels and hats well then that
causes noise and people don't always
walk straight anyway so there's a lot of
noise and in fact that when you're
walking full stride you're shorter than
you are when you when you're standing
straight up and that causes noise and
one thing that I'm not going to go into
detail here about is the fact that we
what we what we end up trying to do is
use multiple consecutive readings and
multiple doorways to figure out who the
person is so think of it this way if I
know somebody's in the kitchen and some
person is in the kitchen person B is in
the living room and we see what looks
like person be walking out of the
kitchen is probably in error is probably
person a so you can you can use state
and history to try and
so resolve ambiguities yeah the question
have we done anything to look at pets so
pets are basically not detected by the
system because they're too small if we
did have so but there is there are
applications for jacking pets and if we
just change the sensors we could do that
but right now our sensors don't detect
anything lower than a certain height
which is good for certain purposes yeah
so we also cannot detect children right
now which is which is a good thing for
IRB purposes but but in the future this
would be able to support children and
theory that's right or the range of the
sensor is only about about that far
question yeah so the range of the sensor
is not very far at least it becomes very
inaccurate as you get down towards the
ground so we tested this system and
compared to a conventional tracking
systems you might say why why use
doorways to track people why don't you
just use like an RF beacon people have
been doing indoor tracking for a long
time and the reason is because like I
said rooms are really essential to what
we're trying to learn about and indoor
tracking systems using for example RF
beacons don't do room mobile tracking
they do meter level tracking and in a
hat in a house in particular you might
have a desk sitting very close to a wall
and if you have one meter of error that
puts you on the other side of that wall
or a word or people might often sit in
your doorway and we don't quite know
which room the persons in so we compared
this where we installed our doorway
sensors on the doorways installed
tracking beacons on where you see all
these blue beacons these are basically
RF transmitters that look kind of like
this transmit a wireless signal and we
use that to localize that person who is
number one walking around underneath the
doorways but number two carrying a
wireless transmitter as well and the
results of this study with three sets of
two different people showed that our
door wide tracking system was able to
achieve about ninety percent accuracy in
terms of room localization whereas the
wearable tracking system got about
thirty seven percent and that's not to
say that Wireless are
wearable tracking doesn't work but it
doesn't work as well for room level
accuracy so if you're talking about
meter level accuracy the the results
would actually be inverted right we'd
have smaller smaller error in terms of
meter level accuracy for an RF tracking
system but higher higher error for a
room mobile tracking system question
ground truth was people walking in the
study had a little cell phone and tapped
on the room that they walked into yeah
good question right so this is not an
insta to study this was a you know one
hour each study yes right Institute so
far there are it's hard to get ground
truth yeah okay so that's how the door
jam tracking system works and now I'll
talk blast about the fixture tracking
fixture sensing system so the basic idea
here is that we have now figured out
what the floor plan is and we also know
how people move around in those rooms
but we don't know what fixtures are in
the house or where they're located what
we do have though our data strings from
the electrical mains and the power means
and so what we can try to do is for
example if the person walks through
let's say doorway number seven and we
detect a flow that looks kind of like a
toilet we can assume they're probably is
a toilet in that room and if we then
detect flow that kind of looks like a
sink we can assume there might be a sink
in that room the person leaves that room
let's say walks into a different room
and we start to see power data that
looks kind of like a light bulb or a end
of TV so we assume there's maybe a
100-watt light bulb in this room and the
television and so from that we also can
figure out all of the other electrical
and water fixtures in the house and
where they are located in that house and
once we know where those fixtures are
located what fixtures there are and
where they're located you can also try
to identify what kinds of rooms they are
so for example any room with a bath with
a toilet is probably a bathroom any room
with a fridge or microwave is probably a
kitchen and rooms where people sleep at
night those are bedrooms
that's a good question the power the
power data it depends on what up what
what you're actually looking at so if
you're looking at a toaster you know you
might need something like something like
on the order of sub hurts so on the
order of few seconds but if you're
looking at other things like light bulbs
we found we found that people turn on
and off multiple lights within one
second period often which we didn't
expect so you need something lower than
one second what I know I simplified a
lot here we can't just look at the power
power data and figure out at that
instant when the light bulb turns on we
actually look over a period of time
again there's a training period where we
try to correlate often when the persons
in this room we c plus or minus a few
watts 100 watt event turning on and then
turning off so there's a lot more math
going on under the hood here I'm not I'm
not describing and we need to do a lot
of noise filtering and we also need to
do some pairing so we eliminate a lot of
false positive events by let's say
assuming lights always turn off after
they turn on they never turn on twice in
a row things like that I'm not going to
go into details about but it's a good
question i'm not to answer your question
directly i'm not quite sure what the
minimum resolution is we could get right
now we're using something like second
level resolution so one hurts yeah so
like if they were like swerving out of a
couch out of the way to like around a
couch would you be able to see the move
so the question is can we detect where
people are in the room the answer is no
we can only know which room the person
is in so once you figure out which
fixtures you think are in the house and
where they're located then you want to
try to recognize those again later on
and the way we do that is to identify
multi what we call a multi modal
signature for each fixture so for
example this sink here might be defined
by a motion sensor going off and that's
in that bathroom a certain water flow
that we detect on average maybe the
presence of a person and maybe even the
the usage of neighboring fixtures and so
based on this multimodal pattern multi
modal signature we can recognize when
that specific sink turns on otherwise
all the sinks in the house and all the
light bulbs in the house look more or
less the same and you can't tell which
one turned on or off question is it
within your scope of work to then do
kind of like a guessing of what people
are doing in terms of one person's home
but now there's 15 people here so they
must be having a party because ovens on
and the fridge keeps on getting opened
or now we know that typically people
aren't home at this time so there must
be a robber who's looking in the fridge
or someone who's cheating on their
spouse looking on there in the fridge
you can suddenly there's someone else in
the bedroom I'm just just so know since
you're collecting the appliance level
data I'm just wondering if you've
started doing that mapping of what can
be assumed other than I mean you're
starting to do something bit like oh the
water they must have flushed a toilet
yeah these are great questions coming
from a privacy aspect so so i think it
is within scope we haven't gotten there
yet but we'd like to look into these
things and see how much there is we can
do so so security is actually right now
the highest growth that the biggest
industry in terms of billions of dollars
in terms of home sensing I think it's
similar on the order of 20 billion
dollars market in the US that's so can
we transplant that industry I don't
think so because if a rubber can just
get down to the right height and walk
through the house and not be detected
then it's not very secure system so
maybe there's maybe there's something to
that but we would like to identify
activities that people in the house are
doing legitimately and and from there
start to identify patterns and so on
yeah
question are you sorry I repeat a
question so when multiple people are in
multiple rooms using a lot of different
appliances are you still able to
approximate like what are being used
because you only track the power of the
whole house not each individual room
right yeah that's right so this is a
that's a very good question this is a
problem called disaggregation so you
have the aggregate energy and aggregate
water for the whole house you want to
try to figure out how much energy or
water is actually being used by this
specific picture that we think we
identified in a learning process and so
like segues directly into my next slide
which shows the results so we we focus
here on lights and water fixtures
because lights and water fixtures are
often ambiguous if you have a fridge or
an oven those often can be distinctive
even at the whole house level but lights
and water fixtures are very ambiguous
because you might have multiple fixtures
that are all more or less identical we
use this multi modal signature to try
and differentiate those and we have in
black here our ground truth in terms of
let's say the energy usage with the
lights and ground truth in terms of
water usage for each fixture and you can
see that the system over time this is
actually an institute study that in this
case over time where you have people in
multiple rooms using multiple fixtures
we're still able to get on average the
more or less the the right amount of
energy or water being used by those
fixtures even when you have things like
multiple fixtures being used
simultaneously in different parts of the
house and it's not to say that we
recognize the fixture every single time
it's used in fact we don't sometimes
when its use we make a mistake but often
those mistakes cancel each other out
that's on average you get the right
numbers so that pretty much explains how
the system identifies the floor plan and
tracks people and identifies what
fixtures and water fixtures and
electrical fixtures are being used
another way to look at it might be let
me make an analogy to help explain this
in a different way imagine that you had
a camera at every intersection in the
city they could recognize the license
plate of cars that move to those
intersections if you did that and you
knew which time every car went through
the intercession
have a pretty good idea of who was going
to the movies who is going shopping
who's going home and so we're doing
similar thing here with doorways taking
it one step further where you don't
start out with a map of the city all you
have is data streams which showed the
traffic which showed the license plate
numbers and from the license plate
numbers you want to infer the map itself
and where the movie theater is and where
the shopping center is and where the
homes are yeah okay
the fully automated design point I think
I think it's there that's a good
question I'm not sure I can I'll try to
repeat that and the question is why go
fully automated when some people might
be able to add information to help infer
some of the stuff that we're learning
and the way I think of it is we we want
to infer as much as we can and provide
that to people and if we can do a great
job fine and if we get it wrong at least
they have a starting point and so in our
use your interface in our last user
interface at least we've started to try
to get an interface where you can let's
say tap on an appliance and move it and
so you can correct things and from the
corrections the system can also learn
other things like oh well if that room
doesn't actually have an oven then maybe
that's something else maybe that's a
nice space heater things like that so so
I think we can still go the route of
trying to automatically learn everything
and then let people try to add
Corrections if they want to but it's a
good to have a starting point
agreed a week versus that 30 minutes is
a big difference we're targeting 30
minutes right now we're out a week and
we see a path to get there that I won't
go into okay so other question song
about to transition from how it all
works to what we can do with it I mean
whatever time we have left are there
questions now yeah this might be of this
is more related to the door jamb but
what happens if they're so you said then
if like ace in the kitchen but you could
have detected that like bees walking out
of the kitchen but bees not in the
kitchen then you assume that a is
walking out of the kitchen but then if
you had like certain states and your
actions didn't really make sense and
then you infer from that and then if
those things look if those little errors
build up do you refresh and like reset
the whole door things or do you just
keep adding to the finance dates this is
I think I think what you're asking is um
as you're estimating state in real time
what happens when you realize you made a
mistake in the past does it crash or
does it refresh so that's a good
question we there is a commit point
where we can no longer go back and
that's we we can define that in terms of
the fact that we all know never get more
information about the past so we do have
a commit point but up until then we give
the we can give the user let's say one
of two outputs one is the current
estimate estimate of what's happening
and one is the the best estimate what's
happening so we can either show them you
know what's happening what we think it
is now or or we can we can show them
what you know later on they can go back
and look and replay and they'll see some
different estimate let's say but there
are there are constantly we're actually
working with them it's called a particle
filter so there are thousands of
estimates what's going on and we have to
try to distill that down in real time at
some point your commits but it's not in
real time it might be delayed by minutes
or hours you yeah question yeah
all right I think the question is what
happens if you're interested in only one
person instead of everybody in them
that's a good question what happens if
we're not allowed to track anybody else
I don't know I don't think we I don't
think we can do that right now I don't
think there's any way to do that there's
there's always it unless they're really
short we can't do that yeah exactly the
craw we there's always some uncertainty
about who the person is and who's using
an appliance and which appliance is
being used and so because of that
uncertainty I'm not sure that we're
serve constantly resolving that
uncertainty as time goes on and
resolving it into the past and so I'm
not sure there's any way for us not to
sense people if they're in that house
yeah good question if two people go
through the door at the same time let's
say they actually squeeze through the
door simultaneously then we can't get
them usually there's a space between
them and that space is detachable so
let's say the space is even as small as
a foot and that would be very
uncomfortable to walk sit behind someone
with a foot space but you can still pick
that up and know that there was a there
was a space a gap there and we can
separate that into two events yeah in in
that case we might miss one of them will
miss actually the shorter one because
will detect the taller one and that'll
be called a false negative so we missed
somebody and hopefully because you saw
the person over here and you saw them on
the other side then you can infer they
must have walked through at some point
we don't really know when but we know
that walked through so it's false
negative okay so what I'd like to do now
is transition a little bit from how this
whole thing works to some of the
applications that we've been using it
for there are a number of applications
here ranging from heating control to hot
water heating to to lighting control in
the interest of time I think I'm going
to focus on only two of those the middle
ones just because we're a little short
on time but I'll
please do stop me if you have any
questions about those so the the
applications that we've been focusing on
our our energy energy conservation
primarily an energy conservation realm
and the reason is because residential
energy is a big problem account accounts
right now for twenty two percent of the
total u.s. energy usage in total energy
usage in the in the country in the u.s.
so it's a pretty large fraction larger
than cars for example to all of
transportation including cars planes
trains buses boats that's twenty eight
percent so twenty two percent is a large
fraction the white people save energy
and homes today is to do what we call a
physical retrofit you might have an
energy audit where they use
thermographic camera zorg lower doors to
identify how energy is being lost from
that house and then do things like add
insulation or change your windows or
upgrade your HVAC system or upgrade your
water here and these solutions work
really well they can bring your energy
bill down from hundreds of dollars a
month down to tens of dollars a month
but the only reason why people don't do
them more often is because they're very
expensive so typically ranging somewhere
between five thousand twenty five
thousand dollars a house now the average
energy bill in the US is only eighty
dollars a month so if you say thirty
percent of that twenty five percent of
that is twenty dollars a month it takes
a long time to pay back your
twenty-five-thousand-dollar investment
so that's the only reason why people
don't do this more often this is a big
problem and we're working on the
hypothesis that what we call a
computational retrofit so adding sensors
intelligence and control I'm can save as
much energy in homes as physical
retrofits but at ten to a hundred times
lower costs and specifically we're
targeting something like three hundred
dollars for the base sensing system plus
the cost of actuation yes
the thermal camp thermographic camera
getting that sometimes you can get it
for free if there's a company that's
sort of sponsoring it somehow but it
typically costs on the order of a couple
hundred dollars to get an energy audit
which might include a thermographic
picture but what I'm talking about here
is the actual retrofit itself so adding
insulation to a small house on average
cost somewhere between four to six
thousand dollars I'm larger houses or
even more when you start adding
upgrading HVAC system or we're upgrading
windows you quickly can get to twenty
five thousand dollars and many many many
people go well over that add solar
panels for example that that takes up
your whole budget right there so so our
goal is to to show that sensing
intelligent intelligence and control can
save a lot of the energy that would be
saved otherwise by physical retrofits
but on a much lower cost so the first
thing we started out with was to look at
heating and cooling because it's the
biggest energy consumer in typical homes
forty-three percent on average in the US
much higher closer to 60 percent in
colder climates like Canada and the UK
so we came up with two solutions to
address this on the first it's called a
smart thermostat that basically tries to
identify with occupancy sensors when you
when you're not home and turn the
temperature down and I won't go into
details the challenge here of course is
to turn the temperature up at the right
time so you don't cause miss comfort
discomfort that's what we call
preheating and in the interest of time
I'm going to skip over this analysis
here about when we decide how to preheat
even though we don't know when a person
is going to come home overall the
solution compared to optimal optimal was
about thirty-five percent so that means
if you knew exactly when people are
going to come and go if you use our
system it's about twenty eight percent
energy savings of your HVAC energy and a
simple system that just turns on and off
the way your lights turn on and off when
you occupy a room that actually only
save six point eight percent on average
and in four of the houses actually
increased energy usage c so these
solutions you can buy today on the
market I caution you to be to be sure
that you're not one of these four that's
actually increasing energy usage if you
use those I can go into more detail
offline if you want to know how how a
reactive system might increase your
energy usage taking that twenty eight
point eight percent and multiplying it
by the forty three percent that we have
for heating and cooling on average I'm
translate to an energy saver
of about twelve percent on average for
homes at least for those homes that look
like the ones we test at da homes we
tested the next system uses more of the
more of the occupancy sensing system
that I was talking about earlier the
basic idea here is on the based on our
preliminary analysis when we looked at
houses it turned out that even when
people were in the house they were only
using half the house or less and this
makes sense because like I said rooms
are designed for activity so you sleep
in your bed rooms at night you use your
kitchen in your living room during the
day so typically in the house only half
the house is used at any given time and
so we can save some energy by not
heating and cooling those parts of the
house that are empty for large periods
of time so when person walks into the
house during the day we heat and cool
the living spaces and when they go to
sleep at night we start heating on
cooling the the bedrooms and we stop
heating and cooling the living spaces so
we built a system and deployed it over
over over several weeks and we showed
that this system can save about twenty
one twenty one percent energy savings
can produce about twenty one percent
energy savings even when people are our
home almost all the time now this was a
fairly short study a statistically
significant with alpha equals 0 point
one five so we're still doing additional
studies to make sure that we get we get
more numbers for that but if we were to
take these numbers as as an
approximation for now we multiply it by
the forty three percent for heating a
cooling overall that translates to about
an additional seven percent I'm heating
and cooling savings when people are home
so this is this system saves energy when
people are away this one saves energy
when people are are home now after that
after heating and cooling we looked at
the next biggest energy consumer in the
house which is the water heater the
water heater in an average house in the
u.s. consumes about fourteen percent of
the energy bill and typically when
people talk about heating water heater
energy they think of insulating a tank
you waste a lot of energy in the tank
turns out that tank loss is only about
ten percent of your total heating bill
and so we're looking at additional
sources of loss
in particular when that when the heating
system when the when the sink turns on
hot water flows through the pipes and
when you turned off the hot water sits
there and cools down and that causes
what we call pipe loss which actually
accounts for twenty percent of your
heating bill so keep being lost through
those pipes and in some preliminary
studies we found that in fact there's
another reason why people lose energy in
their in their hot water tanks this is
the fact that you turn on the hot water
and then you turn it off before the hot
water even guess to the tap and so the
hot water sits in the piping and gets
lost again this counts for another four
percent this is what we call a short
event this counts for another four
percent of loss and when we questioned
our our participants we found that the
reason they were turning on the hot
water tap and not actually using hot
water is that they might have had
something in the right hand like a
toothbrush or a bar soap turn on the
faucet with the left hand and that's
where the hot water is so they don't
actually need hot water at the nail they
don't want to wait for the hot water but
they turn it on anyway draw a hot water
out of the tank and cold water goes in
which then needs to be heated so a
complete waste of energy so the solution
that we're trying that we're exploring
now is to add flow meter start to our
hot water mains and our cold water mains
to identify how much water what a
temperature of the water add a fixture
currently is so people typically mix
that the fixture you turn on some hot
water hunt some some cold water we sense
how much is being used at the fixture
and what temperature the person wants
and so we learned we already know like I
was explaining before which water
fixtures have turned on and we learn a
profile for each fixture where the
temperature is that people want and it
turns out that every fixture has its own
water temperature desirable temperatures
for showers are typically on the order
of 95 to 105 degrees depending on the
person and sinks can be different so
kitchen sink might be 120 degrees if
you're washing dishes but bathroom sink
might again be about 105 degrees so if
you learn the temperature that people
want then you use a water mixer
afterwards once you've identified though
that a fixture has turned on to pipe
water at the right temperature to that
fixture so if you're typically piping
let's say 130 140 degree water and
cooling down to 70 degrees we're now
piping something like 100 degree water
cooling down to 70
so we've reduced that pipe loss by under
fifty percent they won't go into details
about the the results but we analyze
this on the order of I think it was five
different houses and and demonstrated
energy savings of about ten percent
without the person noticing anything at
all in terms of hot water usage so I
never notice the water being colder and
if we were willing to make them feel
cold water every now and then because we
were a little bit aggressive and we got
it wrong they they actually did huh want
hot water in we didn't know it where
they wanted water that was hotter than
we expected and then we can save
additional energy of to about fifteen
percent so in the interest of time I'm
not going to go over those those results
and I think I'm going to have to skip
over this last piece also but i'll give
you the basic idea the problem here that
we're trying to solve is is on what's
called a lighting so you'll use daylight
from the windows to keep to light the
room and when there's enough daylight
you dim the lights inside not a problem
that we had to face is that daylight is
an unstable light source it changes all
the time because of clouds and other
factors like shadows and so you don't
want to be flickering the lights on and
off and closing the blinds and opening
and opening them turns out in fact that
people who are daylight harvesting
systems that are out there today I'm
fifty percent of them are disabled
because people find them annoying
they're changing too much and the ones
that aren't annoying are too
conservative they don't save enough
energy and so they're only fifty percent
as effective as they were expect it to
be so the the savings from daylight
harvesting is pretty low right now and
what we're trying to do is predict the
actual light levels in the future and
change the energy heart the deglet
harvesting system so that it can provide
the right lighting levels without
causing annoyance to the user so again
in the interest of time I'm going to
skip over these details for the basic
idea was that the end result is that
we're able to reduce glare by about
forty five percent and reduce energy
waste by about sixty percent
simultaneously and this particular
operating point other operating points
give you a different trade-off so if you
take that sixty percent energy waste
reduction and you apply it to the ten
percent of entered of energy that's
typically used for lighting that's about
four percent and now you take the energy
savings from heating and cooling water
heating and lighting and you combine
them all together and that will look
that will add up to about twenty-five
percent of the household energy usage
now this is all very experimental small
small sample sizes and so on so we've
typically analyze these houses somewhere
between notes analyze these systems from
was somewhere between four and ten
houses at a time it's a very small
sample size it's not necessarily
conclusive and there's a lot more work
to be done but if it were to take the
results that we have now the data that
says that we're able to save about
twenty-five percent of household energy
usage now to put that into perspective
let's bring it back to the the overall
graph where we talked about twenty-two
percent of the total US energy budget
being residential homes twenty-five
percent of that is about five-and-a-half
percent energy savings in comparison the
entire aviation industry meaning all
planes commercial jets and so on is
about two and a half percent of the
national energy budget so even if we're
able to save only half the energy
savings that our data currently predicts
that would still be about the same as
making all planes in the world solar
powered for free or for the cost of
adding these systems to homes so we
think is a promising direction this is
sort of why I think computer science is
the the fastest way of the best and the
easiest way a way to save the world so I
hope you convinced to you I want to just
thank all the people in my group who
contributed a lot to this to this
project and happy to questions thanks
yeah are you did you have like a
database of life
guests like the most common floor plans
or you know if you know like the
neighborhood's installed like those
neighborhoods kind of that's a that's a
really good good point that a lot of a
lot of neighborhoods have similar floor
plans so you can use data from multiple
houses probably to come up with an idea
of what these floor plans might look
like we haven't tried to do that so
basically what you trying to say is use
a prior on your floor plan distribution
and we haven't tried to do that but that
could help a lot in fact some architects
have told me you know there are only a
limited number of floor plans so unless
you have enormous houses that will
typically be a finite set so we could we
could do something like that just are
you just doing this per house I'm trying
to learn the patterns
that's a good question so the I think
the question to repeat the question is
are we trying to identify patterns in a
single house or are we trying to find
patterns across houses and I think
ideally we would do the ladder it's very
expensive to run these studies so we
haven't been able to scale up more than
about ten houses then ten houses in a
particular study so we can't do that yet
but ideally that's where we'd go yeah
yeah that's right so water mixture can
basically take a proportion of hot water
and proportion of cold water and this is
sort of how your there are certain
showers that are thermostatically
controlled so you have a you set the
temperature and no matter whether
somebody flushes the toilet or not
you'll never get burned because it
automatically adjusts the hot and the
cold temperature so you could use
something like that to choose the
temperature and then it would just mix
the water and the right proportions we
didn't build a hot water heater so this
is all analysis based on the homes that
we instrumented we measured how much hot
water was being used what temperature
that water was where the temperature of
the water was up tap and when people
turn when people actually use water and
then did an analysis of if we had
replaced that water heater with a new
one that did this how much energy would
actually have been saved so we didn't
build hot water heaters in rep you know
retrofit all these houses so if we were
to do that we would end up using
something like this thermostatically
controlled what about that I was talking
about
yep thought about buying this with yeah
that's a good it's a good question I
think that I think that ultimately the
long-term solution maybe is and I guess
our privacy people have left so I'd love
to get their feedback on this one
ultimately the solution who knows how
far into the future will be to use
cameras to track people around and to
figure out what's happening I don't
think the population orange is ready for
that yet and one of the main reasons for
doing the work the way we did it is to
not collect any private information
about people so we're not using
microphones we're not using cameras
we're not requiring people to we're
tracking devices but ultimately I do
think that things like like connect and
other systems like that will be
invaluable right now I don't think
people would be happy having them in
their bathrooms for example
it could be complementary I think it
could just be a solution in itself yeah
right now because it's experimental all
the data is being collected at one pc in
the house and then upload it to a to a
database where we do all the processing
and some of that processing is online
most of it is offline so we do a post
facto in a real system I think people
wouldn't want their data to be sent down
to the house so you would end up with
something like a tablet computer on the
wall maybe that's a home console maybe
it's a thermostat and that's what's
doing all the processing and hopefully
the data never has to leave the house
and of course if you want to do
correlations with neighbors or aggregate
information across multiple houses you'd
have to agree that it data somehow and
there might be some way of getting
anonymous data out of the house
um that's exactly what yes so if you're
so that little that little map that you
saw on the beginning if you pull that up
on your phone and you tap into the data
stream then you would people to see that
kind of thing our goal is not actually
to present that visualization to the
users that's more or less for our
purposes the goal is maybe it used that
data to automatically do control of the
house to give aggregate feedback like
you should be doing you should be
cooking at different times of day or
something like that but in theory yes
