welcome welcome everyone to puppy and to
the machine learning summit it is very
exciting to be here with such an
international crowd of people covering a
wide range of interests in machine
learning and I'm actually personally
looking forward to spending this next
two days with you all of you like creme
de la creme of thought leaders in
research in academia in industry and
also the thought leaders in machine
learning and finally I feel very
fortunate that we are able to do this
event here in PE I'm French but also in
this beautiful because of the computer
and I would like to introduce the person
who enabled us to be here Alan cozy with
the president of Microsoft Hans an
enclosure has been at the microsoft for
almost 20 years now in different roles
business roars financial roles and it is
in his role of president of microsoft
owns that he is hosting us please let's
welcome and inclusion
Thank you Thank You Elina you know what
I am I'm honored but I'm also impressed
by this crowd this is not a crowd that
you know I usually talk to so I don't
know what will come out of the summit
but i'm sure a lot of good things okay
first of all i want to i want to thank
Evelina and increase that you saw in the
on the first slide to organize to really
put together a lot of efforts to
organize this this event we are very
proud as as you know 2 o's you here in
Paris not because it's Parris okay but
because it's also like Evelyn it's it's
my country so when we when we add this
opportunity we said it has to be in
Paris why because first of all we have a
long history the Microsoft France
organization as a long history to work
very very closely with the research and
R&amp;amp;D organization the partnership we have
in France with organization like the
area we were apparently michelly is here
representing it's very important for us
and why did we work with that and why do
we think it's important at the end of
the day what will differentiate us one
day it's not by what we are doing today
it's by what we are going to do tomorrow
and when we see things like machine
learning I can tell you this is what's
going to bring us to the next level this
is what we're going to bring us on top
of something we don't really know why
you know what I was in to lose 10 days
ago in a big data conference and I was
sitting in a roundtable with started
somebody from Jack nil which is a for
France the organization that really
control you know a privacy and things
like that but I also somebody from the
UK government
mr. Bracken who really is a digital guy
for the camera and government and we
talked about that and of course you know
we said oh we have all those data those
terms of information what do we do what
can we do with those information and
today every industry private public is
looking at doing something with those
informations when I discuss with the
banks when I discuss with the e-commerce
industry when I discuss with the auto
industry when I was Oscar of course also
discuss with government local government
at the end we know that doing something
using those information can really help
you get ahead of the crowd the
competition and so on it also help you
be more productive increase your
services to your people private or
public and at the end it's very
important that of course you know we we
work in this space so when the
discussion was too old system it in
France I I really said a it has to be
here and for the first time the second
time actually we have here one of the
lodge let's say some it organized by ms
are the first one was in 211 this one is
in 2013 I'm asking I'm begging rich was
here Rick that you know in 2015 if you
come it's gonna have to be in Paris
again okay so I'm gonna maybe welcome
Rick to come and talk to us or maybe
Evelyn is going to do the introduction
but I'm very very proud very honored
this is a great facility and you said
well yeah it's a facility with an
auditorium let me tell you towards about
this one we receive 100,000 people in
this building a year 100,000 people a
year are the customers
not only people from universities local
and state government private sectors all
kind of private sectors people were
customers we want to see what we are
doing we have a bunch of facilities
assets in the socket in this building 1
is of course an Innovation Center which
is where we take the best and breed of
our product and solution put together
assemble those solutions and propose
great great great solution for our
customers we have a lab here we have an
MTC which also is where we test the
latest technology that of course a
company and our partners are putting
together so this is a very very highly
technology called space and of course
you know when it's highly technological
I think it's a great place for research
and an R&amp;amp;D people so welcome against two
friends and Evelyn I give you the crown
thank you so much thank you along so now
we are going to look at some of the
latest excitement in machine learning in
our labs at microsoft research and for
that we are very fortunate to have Rick
rush it the Microsoft chief Research
Officer Rick overseas an organization of
over a thousand people including
researchers and engineers across the
world and researchers who are technical
staff who are working both in applied
research and basic research in a variety
of areas including machine learning and
now for those of you who don't know Rick
there are three things you should know
about him so first rick is the founder
of microsoft research max off research
was funded over 20 years ago now second
Rick speaks to research languages he
speaks the language of research in
English
in his role as a chief research officer
at Microsoft but also the language of
research in academia Rick was a
professor at Carnegie Mellon University
and there he published the influential
papers in a variety of areas including
computer vision operating systems and
communications security finally the last
thing for those of you who were were
able to make the reception listed
yesterday and were able to talk to Rick
you probably already figure it out what
I'm going to say but if not actually
Rick tells stories like no one else even
for technical stuff so we're going to be
here for a treat and having Rick talk to
us now about his topic on machine
learning Rick please let's welcome Rick
Thank You Evelyn thank you well as the
founder of Microsoft Research and the
head of Microsoft Research I want to
extend my own welcome to all of you you
know that this topic of machine learning
has become incredibly exciting over the
last 10 years I mean the pace of change
has been been really dramatic and I
think it's exciting to be able to get so
many people from so many different areas
you know here today to talk about it for
those of you though who are closer to my
age you probably may remember a time
when you know machine learning wasn't
necessarily held in such high esteem as
it is held today I could remember back
in the the 1970s and the early 1980s
when you know people would commonly of
course then we tended to use the term AI
to refer to a lot of what's called
machine learning now or even machine
intelligence when they ran out of things
they want to call it AI they just
changed the name a little bit but back
then there was a tendency to think about
AI as being an area that was probably
best defined as a a space where people
were working on problems
they had no idea how to solve and no
good ways of doing it and the techniques
and the ideas that we replied then in
terms of really being able to build
expert systems or try to to build
systems that could that could solve
problems or learn we'll really built
more on notions of taking information
from a single human or multiple humans
encoding it into a set of rules and then
trying to apply that or by using
relatively simple techniques of pattern
recognition unfortunately those
techniques didn't work remarkably well
they generated fairly suggestive results
but they never really quite panned out
and probably the the nadir of that era
was the fifth generation project in
Japan which is a 10-year project which
included a huge effort in in artificial
intelligence and unfortunately the
failure of that fifth generation project
really put a damper on a lot of people's
ideas about what you could actually do
in the field and you went through a
period when it was both difficult to
find funding for some of the research
projects but also I think people were
generally discouraged and I remember
even within you know Microsoft in the
1990s of people I think there was a
large largely held belief that machine
learning was was interesting as a topic
but not particularly practical and
wasn't likely to produce interesting
results well times have definitely
changed today you serve you ask a little
bit about what's really changed here
today a lot of different forces have
been coming together to really transform
what we think of as machine learning and
really changed what machine learning can
do for us obviously one of the key
things that has changed is data I mean
the reason that people built you know
rule-based expert systems back in the
70s and 80s was often because they just
didn't have enough
useful information to get good results
when there were statistically based
machine learning technologies even going
back to the 1960s but the computers of
that era could process a very small
amount of information and we didn't have
a lot of good data for a lot of the
things that we wanted to do and so
instead we relied on techniques that
didn't require huge amounts of
computation and didn't require a large
amount of data well that's changed you
know as we've built larger and larger
data centers as we've collected more and
more information we now have the ability
to process enormous amounts of
information terabytes petabytes exabytes
of data and we have the ability to gain
together hundreds of thousands of
processors in data centers that are
linked globally together so that's
really changed what we can think of
doing in machine learning and it's given
us ability to do things or tackle
problems that we would never have looked
at before we've also learned you know
come up with new ways of thinking about
machine learning new techniques and
people will be speaking about many of
those during the day today and tomorrow
but that again it's not just the data
that's driven the expansion of the
machine learning area but it's also a
better understanding of what we're doing
a better understanding of the algorithms
and the mathematics behind it and that's
really changed the field as well
something else that's happening right
now is is deserved new world of devices
you know we're now I suspect almost
everybody here is carrying a cell phone
we have laptops we have tablets we have
all sorts of of devices now that are
spread out in the world GPS systems and
in cars and planes those systems are
turning the entire world into a vast
data collection laboratory for computer
scientists we're collecting enormous
amounts of information from all those
devices again that is changing how we
think about solving problems so we're
you know not that many years ago oh it
was difficult to say find a large amount
of speech data to do
speech understanding systems now we're
collecting huge amounts of speech
information everybody that's using their
phone and using voice to do search or to
activate various functions in the phone
using an Xbox which is now being used
heavily through its speech interface all
of those those devices are collecting a
huge amount of data they're also
creating a huge opportunity for machine
learning because suddenly now we've got
good reasons to try to build better
interfaces these devices have suddenly
become more like us in the sense of
having our senses they know where they
are they can hear they can see they've
got cameras they have a sense of touch
they have a sense of acceleration and
movement and so now it gives us an
opportunity to take all that information
integrated together and use machine
learning to create a whole new category
of the interfaces and new ways of
thinking about using those devices
finally this new world of large data
centers and cloud computing has created
an opportunity to create services built
around machine learning that can do
things for people that we would never
have imagined doing before so all of
this is basically feeding into this
growth of the field and really changing
people's perceptions of the importance
of machine learning in the field of
computer science you know it's it's it's
funny to think back you know on the in
the 1980s and you know the feeling that
people had that that there's artificial
intelligence machine learning was sort
of cratering and to realize now the
amount of economic value that's and the
effect on people's lives that these
techniques are created I mean the search
business alone is is over 50 billion
dollars a year in revenue for a number
of different companies the you look at
things like the Xbox Live service that
heavily depends on machine learning
techniques in order to do player
matching something called true skill
came out of our research lab in
Cambridge you look at xbox kinect
that's change people's perspectives on
what computers can do how they can see
you suddenly now there's a device in
every pin in in anyone's home that can
see them moving that know what they're
doing with their arms and their legs and
that allows them to interact directly
with with the computer system and with
other players again that's both changing
people's perceptions perceptions what
computing does but at the same time it
creates a huge economic value so Xbox
Kinect has helped Xbox continue to be
the number one selling console in the
United States that's huge economic value
to Microsoft but just the Kinect
business itself is a multi-billion
dollar business for us again amazing
change in what you think of systems
being able to do but you can also begin
to see the idea of machine learning you
know solving critical problems in
people's lives so there's some work
that's been going on with our research
lab in in Cambridge and with edbrooke
hospital looking at using machine
learning techniques to recognize
aggressive brain tumors in
three-dimensional MRI scans there's
actually going to be there's a demo out
in the demo booth area you'll be able to
see about that project Moondog is work
that's being done by david heckler man
and his group in Microsoft Research
working with the Wellcome Trust and
looking at all of their data their
genetic information in looking at seven
different diseases using a new machine
learning technique called fast lmm for a
factor it spectrally transformed linear
mixed models that allows them to process
60 billion of SNP pairs in a in a
genome-wide Association study and to be
able to find both existing relationships
that people knew about between diseases
in genetic information in that database
but also they've discovered things that
were not known about the relationship
between certain genetic markers and for
example coronary artery disease again
really exciting to work a new way of
doing a particular kind of machine
learning house that's linear scale
linearly in the in the amount of data
and that dramatically reduces the amount
of time required to be able to process
the information actually that's a look
at much larger collections of people and
then of course you know speech and
language translation you know I can
remember a time when when language
translation translation was pretty much
a joke I mean you know people would have
fun with it yo you you run your your
text through the language translator
you'd run it back through you and you
try to see what kind of funny thing it
was going to say now a huge number of
people are routinely using machine
translation to be able to read web pages
in their own language or be able to
process process information in their
language that comes from another
language it's one of the fastest-growing
features for example in Microsoft Office
being able to to automatically translate
text and to be able to look at it it's
one of the fastest-growing components of
our being serviced being able to
translate pages from other languages
into your own so this these things that
used to be very poorly done suddenly
we've been able to do them much better
than we've been able to do in the past
and that just changes our perspective on
what's possible and what you can
actually do so I'm just I'm gonna tell a
little story associated with this so
late last year I got to be come
personally the poster child for a
certain kind of of machine learning task
for a couple of years now I've been
pushing our teams in Microsoft Research
to allow me to get up on stage in my
annual we do this a huge conference in
China academic conference every year and
I wanted to be able to get up on stage
and give at least a portion of my speech
in English and have it automatically
translated into Chinese now two years
ago when we first experimented with
doing this on stage it really didn't
work I mean it worked I mean actually
worked remarkably well it just wasn't
sufficiently reliable that you could put
you know a Microsoft executive like
myself on stage
and expect the results to not be
embarrassing right so so we would get
most most of what I would say right and
then it would produce something that was
really embarrassing you know like you
know a random reference to somebody
else's product for example or you know a
inappropriate comment of some kind so so
we kind of nixed that particular years
demo but right about that same time
about two years ago donggu in our
research group it Redmond working with
Alec Alec cyssero you came up with a way
of using what was sort of emerging as a
new way of doing neural networks was
called deep neural networks in order to
process a speech and to be able to do
better speech recognition so for those
of you that have been in the speech
business for a long time you know that
that in the early days it was basically
a pattern-matching task and the systems
were extremely fragile with the work of
of Kathie Lee and shaman Hong of showing
on the in the late 80s with a stink
system you began to use statistical
techniques in particular hidden Markov
models as a way of doing general-purpose
speech recognition and and really a huge
improvement occurred during that period
and you saw dramatic improvements in our
ability due to speech recognition it was
still the case though that that those
are those techniques kind of plateaued
and from the late 90s really until just
recently rates for general speech
recognition so recognizing what I would
be saying right now that's not very good
i mean one word out of every four being
wrong and usually being wrong in a not
necessarily a great way didn't really
work well enough for most purposes you
could use speech recognition people were
using it extensively for restricted
domain tasks and you know anybody that
talks to their bank anybody that calls
up any type of service or using an Xbox
rocks are using Siri you know that you
can get a much more much better
recognition rates in more restricted
domain but for the general tao's get was
it was not sufficiently good but what
what da you in people in both in our
research live in redmond and in in
beijing were able to do was to
dramatically improve the recognition
rates for speech recognition by about
thirty percent so a huge change now
there is a talk i think it was actually
a google talk not that long ago where
someone talked about this being a you
know twenty year of improvement in
speech recognition in this course of
basically 11 discovery and today pretty
much all of the groups that do speech
recognition whether it's a Google IBM
nuance Microsoft we're all now using
these deep neural network techniques so
using that idea we revisited last year
the idea that I could get up and perhaps
give my presentation or at least part of
my presentation in English and have it
translated into Chinese and with a bit
of a twist the team was also able to not
only trance translate me into Chinese
and have that come out in a Chinese
voice but have the Chinese voice
actually be mine meaning they took the
spectral characteristics of my own vocal
tract and we're able to use out so I'm
going to play you a short video then
I'll tell you a little bit more about
the story that goes without there's much
work to be done in this area Central
Community old one so it goes off
but this technology is very promising
Hyunjoo the t-shirt videos you love and
we hope in a few years that will be able
to break down the language barriers
between people truly info woman Sheila
lindo gato engine
personally I believe this is going to
lead to a better world to over a Jew
Gentile Japan thought that she's here so
so that was a particularly fun
presentation because the audience of
course didn't know what was coming and
you know it was it was sufficiently
stunning we had audience about two or
three thousand Chinese students and
professors there were sufficiently
stunning to them that I was told by some
of my colleagues in the audience that
they saw some of the students crying
they just you know this was such a big
change in terms of what they thought
computing would be able to do for them
now it turns out I'm evidently a really
good speaker for speech recognition
technology because for the 45-minute
speech that I gave the word error rate
was about seven percent for that
particular day and the to put that in
perspective you would expect a good
human to do real-time transcription with
an error rate of about two to four
percent depending on the individual and
their and their skill so so it was it
really worked remarkably well but it
wasn't without a lot of trepidation on
the part of the team that was doing this
for me because the idea of tio sending
up your your your boss's boss's boss and
putting them on stage and trying out
something that had really never really
been done before and expecting it to
actually work was a little daunting he
even for them even though they'd built
the system and I can remember you know
Frank side who is the one who's actually
you know Manning the machine while I was
all I was doing my speech the night
before when we did a rehearsal you know
his first comment to me was well if this
doesn't work do I get fired and I said
no no no that this is China your boss
gets fired ok if it was the United
States you'd get fired ok it's just all
different different cultural different
cultural norms but what's what I think
been interesting you know both about
this demonstration but also really about
the change
that are now happening in the field of
machine learning you know especially as
we bring in new techniques like these
deep neural networks it's a sudden
optimism that some of the great problems
of computer science you know whether
it's it's it's computer vision which by
the ways area I did my PhD thesis said
whether it's it's speech recognition
whether it's machine translation that
that now we may actually be beginning to
see the light at the end of the tunnel
that that that we may see not just in
our lifetime but maybe in not very many
years many of those critical problems be
VP solve and the last thing I'm going to
mention this is just really for your
benefit as many of your machine learning
experts is this isn't just about machine
learning this ultimately this is a if
we're going to make a great deal of
progress in this field it's because of
cross-disciplinary work it's because
we're bringing in a systems people in
engineers to be able to help build out
these very large-scale systems because
we bring in domain experts in particular
areas that help us to tackle problems
were understand the data or bring data
into our our systems to analyze or that
give us new problems to solve and so you
know I think as you go through the next
the next day or two you know that's
something you should be thinking about
as well as it not just how you work
together as a community but how you
collaborate and work with people you
know outside of the community to be able
to really create great system thank you
very much
