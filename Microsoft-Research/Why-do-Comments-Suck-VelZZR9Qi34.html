oh I am delighted to have play doing a
slightly belated opening talk it's
actually good that I'm not doing an
opening talk because I didn't have
anything large and framing to say in
fact I'm going to use this moment to
talk about something that I've been
puzzling through and haven't talked
about in public yet I can't think of a
room of people I'd rather talk about it
with so I want to present something that
I've been kind of grinding through and
see what you guys think and it starts
from here I have the big the big sort of
change in my life in the last year's
been that I've become a professor of
journalism which is exactly as
improbable an event as it as it sounds
and I'm not a professor of journalism
because i'm going to teach those
students how to be journalists which i
could no more do than teaching them to
be violinist but because i'm trying to
talk to people about what social media
is like which is one of the things
transforming their landscape and so I've
spent a lot of time revisiting a comment
revisiting a conversation that has been
core to the social media conversation
both within this community and in the
public at large this oops refocus that
21st century ritual of the changing of
the machines let's see there we go this
question which second perhaps only to
information overload has been one of
those questions that can continually bre
asked in public and i've been as of
turned my attention to talking to
journalists about social media I've been
been revisiting this question having set
it aside as I think a lot of us did for
what so let's let's start here charlie
bit my finger the most-watched minute of
amateur video ever created it's no
Gangnam style but it does have half a
billion page views and here is the the
famous moment the moment that makes this
video compulsively watchable the second
insertion of the finger into Charlie's
mouth without this this video would be
would be nothing and here so this is
obviously running on YouTube a large
video sharing site you will have heard
of run by an even larger Internet Borg
called Google that you will have heard
of here's a much smaller side feminist
this is a a blog for discussing feminist
issues and here is a conversation about
Congress and rape and abortion right so
if I went out and said to the average
internet music well here's this cute
video of these kids playing around that
the parents took and then here is this
conversation about political
polarization in the United States rape
and abortion and on one of these sites
the comments were really horrific ly
dreadful and on the other one the sites
the comments were quite polite and
engaged everybody would say yeah I get
that I understand why except that it's
through a reverse order the YouTube
comments are horrific YouTube is like
the basement of Internet commenting
whereas if you go and you look at the
family's comments they're polite they're
threaded their thoughtful people begin
the sentences with those big letters and
they use the internet they use the IP
address dots to indicate the end of a
thought the whole thing right unfolds in
this remarkably polite and engage way
even when it's contentious even when
people are disagreeing right so you
can't use content as one of the
explanations for how come comment suck
so bad because plainly you would expect
the contentious subject to be to be the
one that generated the negative comments
and it isn't right it's the it's the
baby video so maybe right maybe this is
just a question of technical competence
maybe one of these organizations is
large and has an enormous number of
resources engineering talent really gets
the internet and another one of these
organizations is just a kind of small
scrappy media outlet that's trying to
make it and that's true but again it
crates in the opposite direction because
if you ran into the street and grab
anybody and said quick quick who's a
rich company that gets the internet
Google would be on that list and Jezebel
would not be and yet on the Google site
the comments are terrible and on the
Jezebel site they're not
right so Google doesn't lack for any
resources you would care to name to make
comments on YouTube good and yet they
are not good right so there is some
institutional bias here separate from
the demand side separate from both what
the users want to do with each other or
care about and separate from what the
what the software makes available there
is some third thing here that's making
this comparison go in the opposite
direction of what we might expect so I
want to I want to offer up three of the
various reasons people have talked about
for why comments or sometimes poor and
re-examine them in the light not just
the kind of socio technical bargains we
we often talk about but also in terms of
institutional bias what institutions are
capable of or not so exclamation right
and and your own your own daily life
experience will doubtless confirm this I
don't write these are these are useful
this is a useful explanation and yet
although the world is populated by
bitter hateful trolls Jezebel's concert
famine these comments are not right so
what is going on here and the answer
fairly obviously is it feminist is
simply moderating harder than YouTube
they are letting fewer negative comments
through and i don't mean negative in the
terms of disagreeing among the
commenters but people who simply want to
shut the whole conversation down
families just posts fewer of those
comments compared especially to
newspapers which has been the area of my
focus on this you know in thinking
through this this institutional issue
newspapers often say well we have a
higher degree of respect for the First
Amendment this is an American this is
American papers the First Amendment
doesn't apply to American papers but
they metaphorically make the argument
that respect for freedom of speech
respect for open comment posting is in
line with American values and so
newspapers simply let more comments
through than a place like then a place
like feministas and this is out of
respect for the First Amendment and that
argument holds water right up until you
get hold of the text of the First
Amendment because it does indeed protect
freedom of speech and freedom of the
press
also protects freedom of assembly right
so in fact the big difference in the in
the the world is populated by bitter
hateful trolls what will we do
conversation is do we regard commenting
as being analogous to publishing or do
we regard commenting as being analogous
to community membership which
metaphorical frame inside the First
Amendment an organization of Dobbs has
nothing to do with the technology under
the hood almost any tool that's in
modern use would allow for a high or a
low degree of filtering all right it's
just that the New York Times The Daily
News the New York Post regard the public
availability of words as being
inherently like publishing whereas
feminist is willing to regard that as
being communal as being like assembly
and so they say we're going to remove
the trolls because if we allow the
trolls too much free rein the community
suffers right and you can't actually
adjudicate that by saying one of those
ideas is more in keeping with the First
Amendment than the other what you're
really saying is that wrong so I what's
the row you know why are we from here in
that job so I'm maybe friend who's the
First Amendment because of this because
of this you know because I'm an American
look at your papers but I think if
anybody that commits to publicly
available words as closer to publishing
the community is going to be more likely
to
commenters as publisher than as members
of some group that means who's this
group nature needs to be protected okay
fair enough fair enough I will I will I
will not do that because right obviously
it's if it given the International
parallel so let me say this instead I
think that the regarding of each comment
or as a series of individual actors is
in line with what the publishers are
used to thinking about for making word
public whereas thinking of a group of
condors being a community you your then
more willing to take steps to control
second explanation good big cheap pick
to the famous the famous trilemma of
comment right if you have a small group
of commenters right then you can't have
good comments at very low moderation
costs you don't need to spend a lot of
money you don't need a lot of spend a
lot of time you don't need to have a lot
of complicated software because small
groups tend to self moderate right but
when you look at when you look at
youtube when you look at youtube scale
plainly what lawyers call an attractive
nuisance right plainly the presence of
half a billion page views is enough to
bring people in her saying you know for
a children's video what the fuck did he
expect shoving a finger in his mouth
right not the kind of thing you'd
ordinarily say years ago on the charlie
bit my finger video when charlie bit my
finger was number one and lady gaga was
number two so many of the gaga fans came
in and were cursing out charlie his
brother and the parents that they had to
put a little thing on the top of the
video that said this is a
family-oriented channel please stop
leaving these comments on our on our
video right so this is a function of
skate but again if you take a publishing
frame right anyone can reduce scale if
you like right just let fewer people in
but if you take a publishing frame then
maximizing your audience is what you
want to do rather than maximizing the
quality of your community and so
although the people at YouTube will tell
you right we
wish we had good comments what they
really mean is we wish we had good
comments given they were absolutely
committed to maximum scale at low cost
and given that this is a trilemma it's
not like they want good comments because
if they wanted good comments they would
do something about it they wish they had
good comments which is to say we don't
want that trilemma to exist we don't
want to have to trade off comment
quality versus scale and cost but you do
right and again the institutional frame
of maximizing page views is the thing
that leads the that leads all of the
social and technical solutions we we
have known and documented and lived with
for decades not to be adopted in places
like this this is sort of ironic in the
u.s. context because the newspapers
historically have prized themselves on
something called the Chinese wall which
keeps the business side of the
publication and the editorial side of
the publication apart here there is an
absolute business decision about letting
comments drift towards low quality
because the people managing the comments
don't sense themselves as being in the
business of the content side of the
paper but rather maximizing page views
so they're willing to make that
trade-off you can see in gawkers
experiment right so here was a story
that went up on Gawker was on /
daughter's well you've probably seen
this the guy who was being paid by
Verizon out sourced his job for twenty
percent of his salary to China took
eighty percent of the money to watch cat
videos all day long and that was then
rated the top employee ironically the
top employee in the building little did
they know so this went up on Gawker it
generated lots and lots of comments and
yet the Gawker common thread is quite
good right it's not it's not as
discussion oriented as the feminine
thread i showed you earlier what Gawker
is done is it says where are we going to
show you to discussions we don't care
how many comments there are we're only
going to show you the top two
discussions and they're going to be
rated by how many people are replying to
one another and how much the people hire
in the comment thread value the comments
or in the threat right and so this is a
very high degree of veto power hand it
over to the users right control handed
from the site owners to the users in
order to make these comments in order to
make these comments work better right
the bottom of the Gawker comments are
the usual one-liners and throw is it's
not like the low-quality crap isn't in
there Gong kurz just said we have a site
where anybody can say anything but we're
at we're getting out of the business of
guaranteeing that everybody will hear it
right and again that's that isn't about
the technology the technology to do what
Gawker is doing is relatively simple
right what this is about is the decision
that the community and conversation are
more important to the people hosting
this site then actually trying to drive
or maximize page views which is to say
to optimize for high scale and low cost
and then just wring your hands about
quality and then the third the third of
the three explanations almost no one
working in an institution that solicits
comments on a story could answer the
question what do you want the users to
do right in part because the real answer
is we want them to forward this article
21 million of their friends and then we
want them to shut up and read another
article right that's their actual goal
and when you look at the design of these
sites right so here's here's the new
york times there's a article that ran
ran actually today in the new york times
when you get to the bottom two please
setia this on facebook share this on
twitter google+ anything do anything
except comment and then comment if you
must right and so the the comment
section is relegated to the bottom part
of the page often between a gulf of look
at other articles on our site look at
other articles and someone else's site
anything else and then finally here is
where you can comment but share your
thoughts is a really generic way of
framing what it is they want the user to
do they don't say do you know anything
about this story
has anything like this happened to you
what what do you think the next outcome
should be what do you think Senate
Republicans House Democrats whatever
should do it's all just an open-ended
framing which invites something that
reads very much if you spend any time of
the New York comments it reads like
letters to the editor which again
entirely within the institutional sense
that the New York Times makes of user
participation right they're not there to
have a conversation with one another
they're there to annotate and react to
our to our articles but this this bias
in particular what do you want the users
to do is even more extreme when you
start imagining that the users actually
can do things in the world not just talk
to each other so if I go on to the time
site and I am looking at Broadway shows
all right so here's the show called an
they tell me where it is they'll give me
the address they'll give me the map
they'll tell me the data it previewed
the dated opens they'll give me a
closing date if there is a closing date
and the more show information and buy
tickets a buy tickets button right there
right there very eager to give me as
much actionable information about this
show as I as I can get if you'd gone on
in last last year and looked up Herman
Cain under under times topics the rough
equivalent of what they do for Broadway
shows they would not have pointed you to
Cannes website they would not have told
you where to make a donation they would
have not have told you how to look up
where the primary was in your state they
wouldn't tell you how to register they
wouldn't tell you who his opponents were
they wouldn't link to his positions
nothing nothing no actual information at
all so newspapers make a big deal about
their political importance to the
citizenry but when you look at what
they're actually doing under the hood
they do a much better job and are much
more engaged at helping consumers plug
into the market than they are helping
citizens plug into politics and this
isn't just about not wanting
be seen to be advocating because they're
providing information right Ben Brantley
the theater review of the New York Times
hated spider-man turn off the dark so
much he will drive over to your house to
personally convince you not to go I mean
this review was legend this is the first
two sentences of the review merely
boring massive improvement merely boring
right buy tickets let by tickets they
make they they have no trouble at all
making a distinction between this is our
judgment and these are your options but
they never ever do that for politics or
indeed any of the possible citizen
actions we could take and this isn't
this isn't because of the technology
they do it every day right they do it
every day and you know David post Khan
here's will you buy this camera I'm just
talking about right they do it every day
in the theater section here is where you
go to go see the show buy tickets when
they're talking about politics and when
you see what's possible using the
newspaper platform you realize how much
this isn't just socio-technical on the
demand side this is really institutional
bias on the supply side in 2006 there
was a famous grounding of aircraft in a
rainstorm 48 hours people sat on the
tarmac 48 hours before the planes were
allowed to take off again and this
happens fairly frequently but this time
someone decided to do something about
this woman kahan I relocate who was a
realtor in California when she got home
she said I am starting an organization
to advocate for fliers rights as of
right now and she created the coalition
for the airline passengers Bill of
Rights put it up in a wordpress blog but
up a little little petition you could
sign and then she googled that flight
number and every single newspaper that
wrote about it she would go and leave a
comment in that paper her comments were
often twice as long as the as the actual
article she was commenting on and every
time she left a comment
said at the end I've started this
organization go to this address sign up
help us so she used the newspaper
platform to create citizen engagement
and weirdly the newspapers were writing
about this airplane thing because they
wanted something to happen they weren't
just saying Northwest get people on the
great ground 48 hours thought you'd like
to know right newspapers often argue for
their relevance because of their
political effect and yet the person who
figured out how to use the newspaper
platform to actually drive change not
just spread information but to actually
change things with somebody working in
the comments section not the newspaper
itself so we can even see places where
people like hermit crabs are adopting
the frame that the newspaper provides to
actually do something that plugs
citizens into politics not just
consumers into markets and yet the
papers because of their institutional
bias will never go there so I've I've
found this line of thinking quite
depressing because for years I'd adopted
the theory I think many of us did
watching watching traditional media
companies Russell with the internet a
theory that could maybe be compressed as
the those dumb heads theory right and
the advantage of that those dumb heads
theory is when you see someone not doing
something that seems like a good idea
you can say those dumb heads if only
someone would explain to them how much
more flexible how much how much more
latitude they have in this platform how
much easier it is to create a good
community a good conversation a good
comment section at Saturn I don't think
that's what's happening I think this is
what's happening the institutional bias
particularly as we're out of the world
where social media is mainly done by
startups and exists in a kind of
parallel universe and where large
companies are are all almost all of
adapting to social media in one way or
another and especially publishing
companies I think that one of the big
obstacles to them taking advantage of
everything we know to be possible in
this room is just a set of institutional
bias
right they just can't think of their
commenters as a community whose right to
assembly would potentially Trump their
their existence either as individual
publishers who are using this platform
or as people generating cheap low-cost
pageviews and if that's right then we're
going to see much less progress
particularly in the news media because
because of the institutional bias and
I'll end there and open up for
conversation and Elizabeth I saw you
nodding your head so I'll get to you in
a minute
and the idea was basically
happy sad angry but actually much like
that
say there are some so we have a lot of
analysis and give you the detail but
there are some sites where there's a lot
of anger for this
might be a superb
impossible to get into
not seen
because the action on the same
was less prioritized in terms of premium
i'm not sure i've advertised
I just want to reach breathe and and
some of that is again this is his
tendency it sorry this tendency to what
you see this tendency to think of
themselves a separating content and
business except when it comes when it
comes to this sort of conversation yes
well that's where I want to come in
first I having work to publishing
organizations like right now and still I
the way the internet arm starts is as
the way of creating money around the
content produced somewhere else red
onions so the New York Times writes the
content the team of the internet is
there to take that content put it online
and stick so anything that you see on
the wonder where that fundamentally is
about making greater engagement spent my
Bible so nothing to do in the editorial
the writer of that they saying like here
is a great article you know dismissing
this cut our way now you show by ticket
the authors will be horrified normally
the author of the obstacles that the
writer is dis really impressed by the
kind of of the buttons stuffed around
their stuff online but that's why they
don't care about the quality stuff
generally because it's just you know
that's not the remit of that tea the
remit of that team is taking our content
make money on it so that when the press
goes down where's people's finally
stopped buying pluggy newspaper we can
still actually have some people right
now that being the case some layers of
the sound is complete
I'm totally on board with and it's that
the elements of life conversation
response that the organization prompts
you it just says I'd respond to the
article there's no response between the
people apply having said that what you
said over New York Times the way they
framework is pretty much exactly the way
that gorg offense break things like see
things responsive as out but there is a
little difficult discussion I think ones
we dismissed a lot particularly of scale
is cultural logs is the development of
the group of people you have a
discussion and debate things aneesa's
any side with a certain limited number
of people will gradually develop a
corporate provocateurs corporate people
than using more actively and they will
try and least some extent kind of
conversations going on as well as
setting good examples be on something
like YouTube someone on The Bachelor
instead Randy people strive down the
street they pop there they go what it's
not like 4am I don't really care what
you know but but they just do something
go off and find somewhere else where
it's a place they've got niversity I
think actually that's profoundly
difficult for very large companies
together heads around particularly when
you launch something at scale
because you can't develop delicata
facebook twitter blogger all of them are
smaller prep work and presto I mean I
give some limited kind of defense on
that basis fucking our little bit so
what is your ideal comments duration
like sort of
today what that well I have a courtesy
world in which there is a dashboard
between there's def word anthem headed
for awhile which makes it appear fantasy
that we will ever hire a new in which
every comment section sculpted to the
argument so someone can say in Kurt's
threaded so we get more conversation or
encourage letterbox until we get more
annotation right something just here's a
friend in question that goes in between
what I was trying to show here with tom
arban talker you can't see because i
took the screenshots wrong but there is
literally nothing between the end of the
article beginning of discussion and so
they don't have that please tweet please
facebook that he must comment go go down
here but i would love this is live as an
exercise i gave my students big picture
the boston globe photojournalism son and
all through the big picture that you
know that is hopping around the disaster
and i say take these photos ignore with
possible to design and earphones and not
one of the students ever this is the
option to put a donate if it's a
disaster never misses I never mention it
I don't hint at they all come to it
independently if you could see a picture
of a disaster put a donate button the
possible would never do that so my my
fantasy is that the range of things that
able to think about it I publishing
companies is much larger and they have a
kind of dashboard which takes a I'm
going to inject this piece for this
story in that case for veterans it's a
kind of editorial judgment so the common
TV said this isn't that you're coming in
would it be and Facebook is hard to
solve this by peoples no maintenance
module so would you happen on this small
bags of salt but yes so how you stretch
box be like calm is commenting and going
people's real names on there this is a
big talker is wrestling westwood but the
new system in part looks like all of
these things because you have a burner
talents you go to verify one and you
have a kinjo the front of the moderation
reading anything slow to the drop the
really big name that works to drain the
worst but it doesn't do so much to
either encourage the best kind of
interactions that again best within
within a sort of catechol conduct it
also doesn't do enough to recognize it
you just have all kinds of agency of
which typing is only one and that's
something I'd like to save come into
these into these publications until they
have time for one more question in
they'll have to know why we describe
this behavior to knock now isn't that
like art
very well served by making your
there's a two pieces of is one which is
the institution's our area and therefore
served well of me and the other part is
the technologists who create the tech
that makes good communities are also
arrogant where they'll say well this
cludes people the time should figure all
this out and we shouldn't have to do
anything to encourage them to use our
tools I'll disagree with you on the
second point because off you know
there's hardly anybody who's made a tool
that banks conversation at least more
interesting disqus branch talking
whatever the long list that we all know
who would love to suck sometimes I'm not
sure that there's what would love to
sell versus doing the work to
accommodate their culture at you today
this is fear of a conversation earlier
fair enough yes all right but the egrets
and mouse they got it you know 20 is
what if one of my assumptions is never
ascribed amounts what can be explained
by ignorance oh that's just an opera or
a assumption i got i don't think that
individually the people making i mean in
a palm story about this arises out of
the advertising program I don't think
the people making individual choices are
saying let's keep the comments annotator
let's make sure conversation doesn't
form let's make sure that the user can't
use as a platform for collective action
I don't think that it's an affirmative
choices I think they're saying that
letters to the editor this feels like
letters
which is kind of a comfortable place for
us I made me wrong right it may be that
a dozen years into this revolution
continues into this revolution that
these places have now set up fairly
formal conversations around preventing
collective action protecting place every
types of platforms that's it right so
every software social software platform
tries to prevent collective action of
the universe taking control of the
future experience facebook doesn't want
you to rebel against the new speed
change right so there these are not rest
and then therefore they cancel the bus
therefore the council votes so is most
popular at the medium in the same things
that's it sure I don't know who's
sitting silently thank you for this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
