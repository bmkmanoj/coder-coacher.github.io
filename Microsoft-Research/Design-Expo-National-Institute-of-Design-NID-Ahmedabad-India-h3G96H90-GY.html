next up we have the National Institute
of design from India so come on out you
guys this is a pickle will be hello
everybody I'm action and this is shreya
we're from the National Institute of
Design in India and we're here to
present our project Paulo city Sao Paulo
city basically is an application which
is designed to create a citizen centric
and transparent transparent policing
system in India the incidence of crime
in India recently has really increased
and it's almost like the police doesn't
care about the citizens sorry about that
all right so the incidence of crime in
India is really increased and it's
almost like the police doesn't care
about the citizens and and the citizens
do not have any kind of trust in the
policing system so we wanted to look at
this from a design perspective and
figure out what we could do to make
things better in our country our first
step was to speak to citizens themselves
and understand what they thought of the
police so when we spoke to them a lot of
them shared the experiences of harrowed
experiences if they found the police to
be unnerving and intimidating and did
not want to approach the police at any
point so we also spoke to officials in
the authorities and got an insight about
how things work for them and what are
the kind of pressures that the police
themselves face and based on that we
developed a video that explains the
present context of India Indian policing
system a lot of jargon is Indian in this
for example things like chai pani
represents bribery in this case when you
power and what the common man needs is
justice the Indian police services with
only 130 policemen for 1 lakh residents
promised to help but instills fear and
distrust in the citizen
this is rajesh 24 years old he has just
moved to Delhi from Chennai for better
job opportunities and a smoother way of
life Rajat speaks only English and Tamil
and has no clue but with me the most
widely spoken language in the north meat
Dharam Singh the constable at the Dwarka
Nagar police station who can't speak
anything but Hindi he has been on duty
for the past 22 hours thanks to the
politician visiting the neighbouring
area
his wife is peeved at him his daughter
wants him home and not to forget Dharam
needs to update all the paperwork in the
station register the crime records and
last week's case dying but all he really
wants is some peace of mind Rajesh is
back containing important documents has
gotten stolen from very staying he has
no idea what to do and wonders if you
should even approach the police he
rushes to the nearest police station
only to be told that the scene of crime
does not lie under their jurisdiction
and he should go someplace else
he tries other stations but all in vain
when he finally manages to make it to
the right one he finds it appalling that
there is a huge rush and not enough
policemen the only remotely available
policeman is Dharam Singh who is annoyed
with a loan that he owes that local
biggie for getting him into the service
not to mention the sheer number of
people and their problems
finally rajesh meets Dharam Singh and
starts speaking in English disgruntled
Dharam looks at him with sheer annoyance
Rajesh wants to talk to somebody who
understands his problem and can assure
him of some help he knows that he has to
file a first investigation report but
does not know how to do it
Dharam tells Rajesh that he will listen
to him only if he pays for a stipend e
Rajesh refuses Dharam suggests Rajesh to
change the statement from stolen to lost
to avoid the hassle of filing in a file
instead he should just write an
application and get it over with
Rajesh refuses but Dharam insists Rajesh
is helpless he realizes that he knows
nothing and the police will not help him
without influence or pressure either way
he knows it's a lost cause and so he
leads the police station as for Dharam
Singh he still has 20 kilos of paperwork
to deal with we now had three very
important questions to answer how do we
create a better relationship between the
citizens and the local police how do we
bring in accountability and transparency
in the Indian policing system and how do
we ensure that policemen are more
efficient and really and we can reduce
their workload what we realize is that
the only way that we could build trust
in the minds of the citizens for the
police is by creating services that are
citizen-centric this would then enable
the police to also help the citizens
through the entire process so then we
created this concept called poly city
which is based on our insights that are
that people usually don't know where to
go or what to do when they approach a
police station there is a lack of timely
and relevant information and because
people are ill informed it is easy for
the police to misguide them there's a
lack of clarity on jurisdiction that is
that people have to hop from one place
to another before they can actually get
to the right police station to get their
job done we also realize that there is
no platform for sharing experiences and
stories that people are faced with the
police and we thought this could really
be nurtured into better service delivery
models and of
as there is an excess of workload and
redundant paperwork which still exists
in the police stations in India so while
we're building our concept again we
looked at three key factors firstly that
when something like this is given there
should not be an excessive overload of
information happening secondly in this
case when the person is filing a first
investigation report very contextual in
India he has to be guided through the
entire process and consequently the tone
of voice in the concept should be very
reassuring and comforting so that he is
not unnerved at any point so now we've
got a video that explains the concept
it's called Pali City so what Polly City
essentially does is it takes the user
through the entire process of filing in
complaint with the police so for example
this is Neha she was walking down a busy
street in India and her bag was stolen
by two bikers she logs in to the Paulo
city app the app tracks her location and
tells her what the closest police
station which will handle her case she
then can report that incident
she's authorized using the unique
identification number which would be
available for citizens across the
country now she can enter the entire
details of what happens so she is guided
through the process she is given
relevant information at that particular
point about her complaint once she
enters the details she gets information
about the law and procedure regarding
that complaint so in this case it's the
theft that she is recording she can also
see details of the procession that she
would be going to so she now has a
better understanding of what exactly
happens there we also realize that
people want to go to police stations in
groups because it boosts their
confidence and they can face the police
citizens can also get updates about
their complaints because so that to
avoid the hassle of going back and forth
between police stations
in the case at which the police are the
citizens go to the police stations and
if the policemen try to bribe them or
they're some sort of misbehavior now
citizens can flag them using this
application we also have a multilingual
support to support 30 35 different
languages that are existent in our
country so what happens is that at a
community level people can now see
what's exactly happening so police
stations are mapped across the city
jurisdictions are now available to
citizens they can see which police
station handles which jurisdiction
there's a citywide crime mapping that's
available or petty and small crimes
everything is visible comparisons of
police stations can be done by citizens
so that they know corruption levels of a
visible number of complaints filed by
citizens can now be seen and even
experiences that people have can be
shared and viewed by citizens
so what happens when a whole community
starts you know when the app starts
aggregating data from the whole
community about crime and corruption
levels and police station details is
that it helps the entire system in three
ways one is that people now can make
better decisions about where to send
their kids to school maybe or you know
which locality to move into secondly it
helps hire police officials to make
better decisions about where to deploy
their forces or understand what kind of
crime is pertinent in particular areas
and thirdly and most importantly it
gives the citizens of our country a
voice and in evidence to ask for a
better policing system and this is
essentially how we dream of a free and a
safe society that could be created with
a better public and the police
partnership coming together thank you
thank you
that was a really lovely video very
impressive very well very engaging
I imagine this could be used in cities
all over the world I think you know
there are benefits for it in all sorts
for all sorts of reasons in different
cities but I'm watching I was wondering
and what's to prevent people I'm abusing
it and kind of subverting the system to
maybe if they have a grudge against the
police to suggest as bribery in
particular districts for example or to
get back at a particular police officer
that is a concentration that we had to
take that I mean it is very evident that
the people might have judges against the
police but the situation right now is
such that there is a complete imbalance
in the power equation between the police
and the citizen so it is very essential
that at least higher police officials
know what is happening at the ground
level and that can only be done when
said when community perception comes
into the entire ecosystem I'm sorry did
that answer your question no I'm I love
the setup of the PM of the animation the
beginning and I'm wondering if it really
needs to be a mobile app like this isn't
this more just about trying to get a
service that exposes and helps people
can you just talk about why you made the
scenario of the mobile app yeah so this
is a mobile app or it's actually a
multi-platform thing as we thought about
it the mobile app in specific so that
you can guide the citizens through the
entire process of filing a complaint and
it becomes personalised where you have
to fill in fill in your u ID or unique
identification and it's your complaint
right so then it has to be personal but
also we realize that a lot of people do
not yet have access to internet on the
smartphones in the country so we thought
that this could also be used as an
application for public kiosks maybe in
public spaces if you instead
ATMs or like you know post offices or
information centers if this could be an
application that could be used there so
first I give Tony the both the video
that animated one and the video where I
loved the contrast in the two and none
of the they were it was just a good
storytelling so thank you um the other
thing though that I think was
interesting is that you took you
considered the policemen in some sense
also as a victim and instead of just
pointing your finger send you guys are
bad and so you were trying to look at
the full ecosystem and the players like
I just wanna say I think that that shows
the maturity and thought that actually
is non-confrontational and actually
therefore has some some hope and success
I thought that was a that was really
nice work it that was even as good as
the animation thank you for watching
alright thank you guys here's the
project alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
