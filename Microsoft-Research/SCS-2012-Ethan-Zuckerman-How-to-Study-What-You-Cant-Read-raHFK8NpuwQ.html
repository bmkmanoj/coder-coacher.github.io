dismiss for it I was also talk about
something that I actually think
something about a lot about in a channel
instead i am the whims of my crown over
me to give a time something that i
really hope you a dress today free
holding thought out blog post so you get
to figure out whether i actually know
any of this stuff or what we're making
this up real fine and players prepare
yourselves we'll probably getting surely
guys we go for it i'm pretty loud to
start like a little figure with that so
look I spent a lot of my time trying to
study what shows up in the agenda of
mainstream media and the way that I go
to the study this is I have a tool
called being a cloud that sucks up lots
of newspaper stories and I try to look
at those newspaper stories and get a
sense for what agents for being agenda
might look like but that is at best
proxy for what you'd actually like to
say what you really like to study is
what's being so television what's being
said ham radio which needs to be
incredibly important and instead of
going to doing some studying newspapers
because for the most part nowadays to
publish online they have RSS feeds you
can pull them in you can analyze them
and so basically what you'll end up
doing is you look for your keys or the
lights best even if that is not the
faculty so the classic
the lights best I think we end up doing
this an enormous amount within social
media and I think in many cases we ended
up studying platforms in intense detail
not because they're interesting but
because they're basically model
organisms there's a lot more people
using Facebook than there are using
Twitter but Facebook is really really
hard to study there's all sorts of
commissioning associated with it it's
very very alarming of data whereas
Twitter sort of says Jaime Penedo here's
an API we are being well understood
fruit fly use us to study genetics it's
not to say the trip light is not
fantastic we're fascinating where they
can't learn a lot about genetics from it
but it is to say that it's a model
organism have to be very careful in
trying to draw conclusions from other
organisms just based on what we actually
understand that we spend fairly closely
I think when we start thinking about
what's going on in the social media
space there's an enormous amount of dark
matter that's actually someone's
visualization of dark matter that we
almost never through study I suspect
that things like email alerts are
probably vastly more embedded in shaping
opinion then Twitter or even Facebook
that's extremely hard for us to get into
without starting to worry about all
sorts of privacy things so I want to
talk particularly about one of these
dark spots as one of these spots outside
of where the light is shining in the
alley and that has to do with the
simplistic limitations of what we end up
paying
so everybody's this room that takes a
much many people in this room speak
english as a first language dispatch a
given first language it took people in a
while and understand what was wrong
about that slide english is the tricky
language row with them but look when
people started studying language online
there were these wonderful statistics
going back and forth we've taken a
sample a subset of all the pages that
exist on the internet the internet is
eighty percent English you'd actually
still find us if you do a search on
google or a ring for what percentage of
the internet is in english will find
these aging webpages asserting that
eighty percent is in english based on
doing a random sample of IP addresses
for treatment instead of looking at it
it's actually very hard to find more
current research on this topic there's a
good bit of research done by thanks back
in a minute member that is investigating
that english is now down to about forty
five percent but that's still dealing
with static web pages when you start
dealing with all these web pages
generate another database is coming out
of social media it's probably well below
it the simple reason that the people
using the internet at this point are no
longer majority english-speaking it's
still a large morality but probably not
very much longer and certainly we're at
the point where there's so much social
media being created in languages like
Chinese that we're about finding ways to
study this in a serious way we may
actually be missing
within the system now what are the
consequences of missing what's wrong
with the system I want to suggest a
couple of things that end up happening
when we end up some trapped by language
I suggest is around the Green Revolution
later the green movement in Iran let me
just start with the disclaimer that this
is no way is intended and operation
disrespect to the incredible risk
incredible bravery is shown by people
who got involved great little bit well
this is really about is picking on the
press which ended up sort of reporting
the green movement as invariably leading
to the overthrow of government and in
part it wasn't hard to sort of get the
narrative that that was going on because
it was very very difficult to report on
what was going on in iran simple reason
that the wrong had bad for internalist
from the ground so the way in which most
of us were bojangles going on the ground
was what was coming up in association
and this was an extremely narrow channel
that got amplified in the story there
were less than a thousand by some
estimates less than 100 active Twitter
users on the ground probably a thousand
when it started was cracked down down
about 100 but there were massive massive
numbers particularly for Amiens in the
diaspora who spoke excellent english who
were amplified from spreading these
messages as you know this very strange
forward storytelling where CNN would
literally sit there and say we have no
way of verifying any of this but let's
read what people are saying on Twitter
and we'll use that to report what's
going on the ground and there's no doubt
that there were massive protests and
many people involved with it but the
interesting thing was that if you happen
to speak Persian as many of the people
that we had a build
to you ended up with this fairly
powerful counter narrative of what was
going on in conservative couraging blogs
essentially saying this is a bunch of
rich kids in one particular neighborhood
of terror on there's lots and lots of
people who simply assume that this is a
US UK Zionist operation you know we
expect this to go away and if you're
reading that counter narrative it's not
that kind of narrative been necessarily
true but instead those narratives put
together probably get much closer to the
objective reality of what was going on
the ground rather than just the
english-language narrative which ends up
giving you a certain bias associate so
one possibility on this is that you only
have that one physically blocked
narrative you end up with a very
distinct perspective on what's going the
other thing that ends up happening is
that you end up with situations that end
up being something mystically invisible
if you're not able to attention to
what's going on with them what happened
with the revolution starting in Tunisia
this year is that it looking invisible
in two very interesting place it was
largely in
pull in North American press literally
in total moment when the valley
government Falls it's really fun to go
into like LexisNexis and look for
discussions of CD cuisine the town where
the salt starts or Mohammad yzc that the
vegetable seller to immolates you don't
see either of those terms appear in the
new york times in totally gay then I'll
eat leaves the cover the difference
reports on Tunisia they don't actually
get to the heart of the story the actual
revolution until today that Bentley
steps down it's a couple other sources
that you better Christian Science
Monitor that's better he does better
o'clock they would be taken an interest
story out of a park very early long for
the world but for the most part of us
misses it in part because keynesians in
particular strategically interesting in
part because you're getting the language
involved I Rebecca and crash I respect
the white a Lamaze about this yesterday
and he was mentioning that to a certain
extent of his heart for Egyptians to
follow what was going on because most of
the coverage of this is either coming
out in Tunisian Arabic which is
basically incomprehensible to non
Tunisians in this weird linguistic mix
or in French with most Egyptians in
denim speaking so you have this event
that's incredibly important and in many
ways into the imagery and the video that
it's come out of it or the language
that's important of it because you'll
end up with no secret so we got the
language brought locked you can end up
invisible or you can end up
misunderstood sort of the two mornings
about so that means we're doubling
listing closure
you've got a set of media that you have
no access in one fashion what do you do
at the hope recruit what you do well so
the first hope for what you do is you
have someone who's going to nap so
here's the story looks like a pic 11
times today I am I do that most days I
can't because I love from a jogar coffin
and you guys remember when Google said
we're getting the hell out of China
being hacked we're being specifically
targeted mark up a follow-up story
couple weeks after its saying we figure
it out we know who's hacking us
predictably its Xinhua university is the
best university in China but it's also
another school that no one's occurred of
its lung Shan technical if you had and
we figured out that this is a secret
military academy a huge vocational
school established military support
trains some computer science from the
military operated by company the close
ties to buy do delvin surgeons in China
great story great reporting we
understand where the hackers are coming
from the only trick with it is that this
is long shot Tex website if you can't
read it I'll read you in translation a
little bit about what's going on at
lunch I mutational school there aight
academic tracks automotive maintenance
repair numerical control of factory
instruments computers bulldozers
forklift earth escalators of welding
professional cooking Beauty hairdressing
electrical mechanical machine repair
this is the sort of place that
advertises created morning on Chinese
television essentially and the ad by the
way says do you want to learn how to
drive an earth move comes when I shot
occasional type in chinese hackers love
this so much they loved that the new
york times death is so wrong that there
became a remix of this app you want to
be a hacker should've been able to get
this counter to your life story is this
dude rolling son who basically spends
his entire life sitting in hong kong
breeding english language media about
china reading chinese language media and
translating them posted above zone or
your world cup which is basically this
running account of here's what Americans
are getting wrong about China by virtue
of the fact that they do not speak
Chinese so the first way we can try to
deal with this is by trying to find guys
like this instead of reading from the
religious lady or finding sites like
trying to smack that sit there and try
to figure out here's an interesting
social media trend coming out of China
let's try to put it in context where for
me the stuff gets really interesting is
what you get it said about an ongoing
basis this is a wonderful experiment
this is a site which is taking all the
tweets from AI weiwei very controversial
artists arrested multiple times he's
taken to Twitter as perhaps the least
sensor platform and
access to in China and we now the
project are run by at Chaminade and a
number of trans lines which tries to
translate and post on tumblr these
tweets in as close to real time as
possible and this ends up being this
very interesting window to one
particular Chinese conversation you're
only in this conversation you're
sophisticated enough getting around the
firewall that you're fighting with
colobus but it becomes a very
interesting way to follow us on our
conferences so the first answer in time
study with you can read as you find
someone group in reading simple
straightforward the second way to do it
is to try to figure out how studying
structures rather than study what's
going on with attack this for me was one
of those interesting visualizations that
came out of the Arab Spring mrs. Costa
Luca the blue entities in this are an
interlinking of people were writing
about the Arab Spring on Twitter and
what we're speaking in English the
people arrive are people who are doing
this and speaking in Arabic to me what's
really interesting it's hard to see on
this are the people who show up and
control because those are basically your
bridge fingers between these communities
and you have this sort of thin band of
purple running between these different
communities and these people in many
cases are so saying here's what they are
beasts fingers are saying here for the
English people who say let's figure out
how to get them talking to one another
one way to think about studying this
space is to try to get everybody else
out of the picture and take that sub
network of the folks in purple and
essentially say here's what a group of
people for love you bilingual or
connecting this conversation see as
information in these
what's ever done you might go further
and sort of say what would be really
interesting is to say what's the Delta
between the purple speakers on the red
speakers and the blue speaker what ends
up being translated in one community
remember what ends up being a
conversation that's linguistically
locked in one community or another and
what ends up crossing over between the
two of them one of the guys who's been
really pioneering work on this is John
Kelly who's over at Columbia who have
you know those work I have simply
recommend piece of a catch up on
everything that he's done John looks at
blogs first and foremost in the way that
he looks at it is he says I'm gonna
study stuff that I don't read that I
don't understand that I know nothing
about and I'm in studying purely
constructor I'm going to look to what
people linked to so he takes a whole set
of dogs in this case the Iranian
blogosphere he said what is everybody
linking to and let's cluster people by
common place so the way the descendants
of getting flustered is you are together
in the same place if you link to the
same material not necessarily to each
other but to outside material and he's
able to put this in take thousands of
blogs get immersion clusters and then he
sits down with someone who actually
speaks the language and says one of
these clusters all about when we did
this for the first time in two thousand
a day he was able to say well there's a
group that we all knew about there was
going to be a conservative group there
was going to be a sec of the group no
one really had any sense except of
course conclusions that there was this
massive plot talking about Persian
collagen largely disconnected from the
rest
actually there's very visible fissures
within these conversations that
ahmadinejad ends up closely connected to
the sort of conservative politics but
there's a group of religious youth
particularly those interested in the
return of the 12th Imam who are actually
quite separate instead of engaging in
their own little dialogue roughly align
with the Conservatives with some further
out than that we've been trying to do
some of the same work between MIT and
the Berkman Center using the media cloud
platform and so turning it on the
Russian blogosphere what this is
basically a map of how close or how far
different media we've collected are from
poor Kremlin errors so take what gets
talked about on the Kremlin's website
and take what gets talked about on the
websites different ministries within
Russia take that task all you really
need to know about rushing to using a
decent stemming library because all
you're doing is basically text
similarity and you're trying to figure
out who's closing who is far when you
simplify this out you end up with this
really strange picture you end up with
very very close linkage between all the
government entities all of these lines
you end up with TV basically being as
close to the government as actually some
of the government agencies TV is so
closely government controlled within
Russia that you actually have TV
stations following the Kremlin set of
the Ministry of Defense's when you get
out to the bloggers your way the way to
check out and what we've done by some
digging into this is we've been able to
find out that not only the blogger said
an alternative public space so what's
going on in common conversations there
are two alternative public spaces that
have most nothing to do
with one another there's a little side
there's an ultra-nationalist side both
of them are massively far from what's
going on the common conversation it's
not that the not sheep goats the sort of
pro naturalist folks are following
Kremlin's orders this is not the 50 cent
party this is a bunch of crazy guys who
are about as far out as the guise of
electron what's particularly interesting
about this is we looked at a set of
posts specifically dealing with the air
strength and we look to see whether we
could see this pattern within the
english-language blogosphere rather than
the Russian language blogosphere in
Russia we found again TV is really close
the few bloggers really close lots and
lots of bloggers way the heck out there
talking about something entirely
different we did not see the same thing
at all of the u.s. the dialogue about
the Arab Spring within the set of us
blogs we looked at was incredibly close
to what the White House ended up saying
and incredibly close to what mainstream
media was saying which offers this
possible intriguing scenario which is to
say that the Russian blogosphere is far
further from a mainstream media
narrative than the u.s. log experience
of being at least within a subset that
we were talking about so here's the
thing that I am most obsessed with at
the mall this is an amazing tool put
together by guy hong kong university and
eccentric Sam someone hired this guy in
be able just you know grab him now
before he gets away from you he's built
a great tool called huevos con Weibo in
this case was recruiting to Sina Weibo
it's the short messaging system
it's analogous to Twitter I mean the way
the army that's better than Twitter in
some ways not only does it have 140
characters support not only does it have
built-in URL shortening but you can
associate image or video with every
house and most people do so you end up
with this incredibly visually rich
medium used by about 350 million Chinese
pieces and it's becoming incredibly
political importance it moves so quickly
on Twitter that it's actually very
important sensor and so much the
information about the high-speed rail
crash that came out recently came out
via Cena wave level now summer glyphs
this and says I have a lot of your
speaking friends they have no idea what
the hell is going on in this it would be
really nice to open up for them why do I
simply take the images so what witness
cope does is takes a subset of
incredibly popular wait little users and
tries to figure out what they are
talking about and then writes it by how
many of these very popular users are
talking about then it gives you a
civilization of it then one suggesting
what the visualization is you start
seeing some interesting similarities for
those of us who care about cute cats and
their impact on global politics there is
no shortage of Chinese cute cats these
are androids speaking cats things about
English speaking country
the Imperial places for those who care
about little mimetics it's very very
very very pleasing to find success
toddler in there but you can see a lot
of what ends up being hot on reddit
showing up on way but within a couple of
days or sometimes going back to very old
stuff lately trending was the sea gold
who goes and steals the burrito said in
the store that their brief insurance
companies periodically you come up with
an image like this and you go wait what
the hell just happened better thinking
it's for these images and it's not
actually all that hard based on reading
some courage china headlines and doing a
little bit of research to discover
pretty quickly that this is the guy who
heads up menu dairy maybe Jerry was in
the news at the time that this started
trending because they had admitted that
a large amount of the milk that they
distributed had been tainted because
they've been feeding how bad feed may
you dairy was also the firm responsible
in the melamine incident where Chinese
companies started pouring lots of
melamine into their milk as a way of
elevated nitrogen count which is a way
of trying to make protein detectors say
there was more milk than enough and so
you know again Shannon you ended up
being censored pretty quickly on huevos
very hard to talk about them by name but
as much harder the sensor a cartoon and
are soon going to Khartoum it ends up
Evan significantly more
and those of us are trying to study
Chinese names getting very very used to
dealing with really bigger imagery this
is AI weiwei on the left who is covering
himself with a stuffed womp and the Lama
is not in fact online although it looks
like a lot it is a grass mud horse and
the grass web course has very
interesting symbology within a Chinese
blogger at this point the phrase grass
mud horse is a hobbit embroil an
incredibly offensive and explicit
epithet about one's mother's anatomy and
the ways of this sort of became it would
play was Chinese bloggers taking a
course of children and having them sing
the Ballad of the grass mud horse and so
you had these cute chinese kids singing
this song that's technically about a
grasp of course but it's basically say
brother but another as a way of saying
there's no way to censor us as long as
we can cut create a place to use the
speech so what's great about Weibo is
that if you start using it in this way
the enormous scope you're going to get
incredibly boring you're going to
get the popstar is going at the
actresses and you're going to get you
know Chinese sophomore and every so
often you're going to get something
incredibly strange that some density
dig in and try to figure out what's
going on until treat you like the
extended tells you what's really going
on but the point that I'm actually
trying to make on this is a fairly
simple and straightforward one if you
look at the scholarship at this point
you look at the well-respected papers
out through twitter there cited hundreds
of times you know one of those articles
a sudden all the seven hundred times at
this point the most started article i've
been able to find on Weibo it's great
article by the way it's currently cited
by nine people we're missing something
here and it makes perfect sense that
we're missing and it makes perfect sense
that this is hard to study but at a
certain point we're missing a chunk of
our ecosystem if we don't find the
latest any what people are talking about
this decimal your language astray before
that at this point I should have a
predictably both the middle previous
slide I don't so I'm Justin Sacher
questions what we're not authentic i use
padres grow up good some summative
awesome is actually relevant to us as we
our website
and 67 people should
also french fries
totally timely what is a revolution
translation and trying to do so with a
wave of scope product one of the nice
things is you click on this image and it
will immediately come up with a text
that company and it will treat it into
google translate what you're going to
find is that three times out of five the
translation you get is totally
conference and this depends a language
right I mean Google is getting better
and better by the day I would soon to
take romance languages it's readable
ninety-five percent of time for Arabic
it's less than 50 Chinese is also sort
of less than 50 even someone's going to
clue about it and then you should have
been following this chains and trying to
figure out who's this image because
figure I think machine translation is
going to get a lot better but I think
one of the ways the King translation
gets a lot better super Council which is
to say that to get a machine translation
can be really big parallel corpora one
of the ways to get really be parallel
corpora is my game people actually take
one of the things that I should have
perpetually shocked about is that if you
look at the Chinese blogosphere there's
great efforts to translate English
mountain there's this amazing site of
media that produces thousands of
translations of week of English language
content if you want to read readwriteweb
in Chinese it's there within a day or
two we do not appear to have any sort of
parallel effort that's doing this on the
other side but I guess what I would say
is something automated side of this you
can wave your way through certain
languages until it starts getting into
the culturally complicated stuff for our
languages i think the certain point you
have to make the investment and trying
to figure out how you work with someone
that might be someone being a capital
term for your establishing a
relationship with and saying hey these
are things that are coming up and really
good though about or it may be getting a
point where you say if sixty percent of
my commentary is coming in from down
these fingers this is a really good time
to hire down these views what i'm amazed
by is that we're really slow audits I
mean watching so that how Facebook deals
particularly around Arabic language was
getting taken down let's take in that
company a while to figure out how to get
Arabic speak in on the news team which
you know media to be a very high
priority early on it sure why L is going
to talk about some of his experiences
with YouTube and having videos taken
down on youtube because no one
understood that these people being
tortured would be tortured by the police
and that this was going
make occurs just
really great of someone who really
stunned because I try this I think I
love you got that documenting that there
is that answer
these are what do you have any sense of
what percentage of the human readable
web is actually now machine language in
other words you know yesterday we saw
the lady from Twitter showed us examples
of tweets that were entirely optimized
for albums right they wouldn't be
incomprehensible to you I would imagine
that as we will compose searches and
exactly that it's actually being
composed the optimized for an outward
how much of the human readable lab is
now we get these ages that are
completely incomprehension you know to
figure out what was actually being
created for machine you would buy the
only lunch better question to put this
way so the question of others is what
percent of web pages at this point are
now being created not to be reading
so essentially leading to the point
where we have the visible web right what
I meant to be so it is the left one
what's what's potentially doable as web
page but as of not being comfortable why
human my answers you would want to get
some of the studies projections I mean
that's the sort of thing would be the
search engine logs the search engine
queries I am NOT I am lucky enough not
to or I'm not lucky enough to work for a
company that has direct access that's
that's a hard one to answer there are a
couple clever papers out there trying to
figure out linguistic distribution in
the human readable web at this point and
then I can
slightly different topic yeah
yeah the wiggles or big huevos go for
you're not getting it I'll be felled w/e
i do SC 0 PE I also the guy you should
be hiring eccentric sounds SI m and no
i'm not going to get a percentage or not
but
I've considered a really high-end market
place in a really low in part because
the question is who's actually paying
for human translation in this space
there's sort of a higher marketplace
which are the professional translators
who have been used to working a 25-7
word that just doesn't work at about
concepts and so those guys have certain
amount of resistance to being popped
down off of that premium rate which is a
really nice place to be the challenge
appears to be coming from the bottom
which are people who are on turk who
speak two or more languages saying i'll
give you a rough translation of that and
that's often being done at you no sense
attacks and that task might be a
paragraph rather than work so you had
that giant space between two this is
extremely high quality this can be very
low quality but the way people are
finding out how to B's term is that you
just don't work Sam so you know if
you're paying you know a penny per
paragraph pay them penny for paragraph
five times and so to figure out how to
win with it the other thing that we've
found that this I know that you have
this is one Jim is that volunteers are
this really interesting sort of except
involvements you would look at that sort
of market economy and say there's a
linear relationship between quality and
when you're painting and step the
volunteer space which seems to be often
higher quality than the professional
translators and 0 calls and so for me
part of this is sort of trying to agenda
a certain amount passion to sort of say
if you are bilingual english spanish you
