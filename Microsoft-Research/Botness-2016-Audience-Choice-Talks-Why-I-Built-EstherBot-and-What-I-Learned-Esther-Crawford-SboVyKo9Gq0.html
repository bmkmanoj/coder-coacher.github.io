little bit about what happened with
Esther ba why I built it some of the
things i learned um and go from there so
I felt s turbot and the startup I was
working at so I'm a product market the
startup I was working at was about to go
out of business we weren't able to
secure funding for the next round I've
been really interested in trying to
build a bot and I would have been
playing around with different frameworks
and I was trying to figure out what's an
interesting use case one that's not
necessarily business oriented but that's
more consumer-friendly something that
just like kind of like everybody could
relate to and I felt like well a resume
bought it makes a lot of sense and also
I'm going to be looking for a new job
pretty soon so you know timing so I I
built a strippa on top of smooch I ended
up open sourcing the code and it was
pretty cool almost 700 people have since
forked it and I've seen dozens of
variations of people creating their own
and so a couple of things that I took
out of that experience um constructing
conversation flows is pretty tough and
people love personality like gifts and
emoji and stickers and I would see that
because my initial bot was so basic it
didn't really couldn't couldn't really
respond to those things you just give
you like the same answer and over and
over again people to feel like oh you
know terrible and so then I implemented
the action buttons and i went from
getting an average of eight responses
like you know go go between back and
forth and that went up to over 20 and so
I saw buttons work just from like a
really practical numbers standpoint
people stay engaged a lot longer and
also like the feedback I was getting was
more positive I put it on facebook SMS
and telegram and I did a series of like
posts about it and I got the got some
press and everyone landed on the same
landing page where those three options
were
and it broke down to nine over ninety
percent of people chose messenger when
when given those three options and I
thought that was kind of interesting and
and so I decided to go all in on
building on messenger for the v2 which
you saw earlier today um let's see there
were definitely a lot of people going
off the rail and just trying to test it
and some of those conversations were
interesting to see I found scaling
conversations is really challenging
granted it was just me behind the bot so
when there were dozens of people
interacting with it in a day it was
challenging for me to then jump in and
and there was a connect with me option
and so people had an expectation of I've
been an immediate answer and so having
some kind of guard rail there with here
here are the times or what not is what
really motivated me to add that feature
in Chris's and just from like some
random statistics standpoint I ended up
getting over eight got eight interviews
and three actual offers from jobs like
intercom smudge a couple other companies
directly from the bots like what I built
and them interacting with it and so yeah
I think that it proved that it's a like
a use case that's actually viable and
there's something interesting here so
that's it
