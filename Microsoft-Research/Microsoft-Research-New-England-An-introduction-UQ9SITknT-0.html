interdisciplinary lab which brings
together conventional areas of computer
science like theory and machine learning
with the social sciences social media
sociology economics and the biomedical
sciences in England in particular in
Cambridge and Boston there's a large
concentration of research in this area
the best economics research in the u.s.
is probably done at MIT and how so we
felt that Microsoft really should open a
research lab in this area to profit from
the possible interactions with vibrant
local community my area of research is
artificial intelligence and machine
learning and the boundaries of my
research are being pushed because of the
collaborative environment and the
excitement of having so many different
people around at different stages in
their career what Microsoft Research is
able to do is its able to connect people
from different disciplines and different
universities together we invite a range
of scholars from around the US and
around the world to come and work with
us so by doing that we've developed this
incredibly strong community of thinkers
so for me what that tends to do is it
augments and deepens my work because I
have this benefit of a range of
perspectives that I wouldn't have had
otherwise I think one of the things
that's really exciting for me when I
come to the lab it's the ability to sit
down for an entire day with another
visitor who may be visiting from
University of California Berkeley or
maybe was Inc from Northwestern but we
have eight hours to do that and if it
weren't for the lab we'd be sort of
bumping into each other at a conference
and we may only have a minute or two to
say hello and exchange ideas the thing
that motivates any successful researcher
is that the work is very interesting
what the exact content of it is can can
change a great deal from year to year
this is a place where there's a lot of
freedom a lot of different kinds of very
smart people to interact with an
opportunity perhaps to do something
different from what you'd be doing
normally back on your own home turf and
I think most of the people who come and
visit take advantage of these
opportunities and and look back on it
and very enthusiastically we have a
tremendous diverse lab we have about 40
to 45 percent women in the lab and one
of the six I find really exciting that
here is a research environment where
women really thrive and do wonderful
research we have the most phenomenal
young people coming through this lab and
they come in having been trained in one
discipline but leaving the lab with
broad knowledge of other disciplines
ready to take up leadership positions in
these new fields that are forming on the
boundaries of data science and the
social sciences and the biomedical
sciences there are very few places left
where you can do long-term big research
projects and Microsoft is a shining star
in that regard it provides us the
freedom and the infrastructure to really
try for a homerun and that's what we're
hoping for and that's what we're working
hard towards
each year Microsoft Research hosts
hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
