alright thank you for coming this is
mostly for purposes of recording thank
you all for being here especially those
of you who came from the world outside
this building all the way over here and
join does especially some of you came
from other parts of the world entirely
so thank you even more I'm Nancy bayman
were happy today to have deven desai
visiting from the jefferson school of
law in california san diego san diego
thank you and he's going to be talking
about 3d printing and patents and I will
hand it over to you I should say there
will be time for questions throughout so
feel free to interrupt and also we will
have some snacks and refreshments
afterwards so please feel free to stick
around and chat further what do you
thank you well of course thank you to
Microsoft Research and nancy has been a
tremendous host in the last couple days
I've been thrilled to grab a whole bunch
of ideas from folks here so it's a guess
my turn to try and give back a little it
is a work in progress so absolutely as
she said questions thoughts at any point
or very much appreciated and with that
I'll get into some hopefully some
substance so Michelangelo allegedly said
that he made statues by just removing
the parts of the statute that hit the
sculpture and while much of what is
manufactured today comes from that sort
of subtractive method 3d printers are
applying the opposite principle they're
building items up layer by layer and the
devices can be seen as part of a broader
movement the maker movement that tries
to empower people to design and produce
customized objects in their home or
business now there are some parallels to
copyright policy that will likely apply
to 3d printing and those come from the
VCR but I want to be very clear that the
technology that 3d printing resembles is
another general-purpose device that we
all know and that's the personal
computer so as a little bit of
roadmapping I will first cover the
basics of 3d printing and hopefully make
the case that it is in fact a
general-purpose technology which is
important when we start to get to the
patent law behind it second I will go
into some economic implications of 3d
printing and I'll
talk about the gun issue but not
necessarily as a public safety issue but
also to reveal that it shows why patents
will pose such a big run into such a big
problem with 3d printing and then I'll
get to some of the legal issues and
possibly propose some solutions but you
know depending on time we might be just
kicking that around at the end so some
mechanics i know i said pc but i
actually first want you to think about a
different thing the peripheral that we
all know called the printer 3d printers
are in fact modeled on the desktop
printer that we know and they operate
along very similar lines it is as I said
an additive process and it involves
squirting molded plastic in some cases
or targeting a laser to harden layers of
powder or liquid resin or sometimes they
can they can shape other materials such
as metal believe it or not cake frosting
has been tried and living cells and they
then make an object now the raw material
is basically set in a 2d pattern and
then layer a layer on layer until you
get your 3-dimensional object that's a
rough quick and ready of the hardware
and here's a couple pictures of what
they are these are both what's sometimes
it just freezes hold on a moment let's
try this good open source notice the the
design itself stays it's people go in
they tinker they mess with this quite a
bit i'm not going to get too deep into
that but just there you go there is a
software component the patterns and
adjustments of these machines are
controlled by often open source software
part of the computer aided design world
and often these can be downloaded for
free and examples would be the website
thingiverse but producing a design from
scratch is not that difficult 3d
modeling programs allow people to draw
what they want and make what they want
and in fact high schoolers are doing
this for example the fab lab project was
started just next door an MIT has a
branch in San Diego and in Fab Lab san
diego works with K through 12 students
and they are doing great jobs where for
one example is they make limbs and poor
sews and then they learn how to make an
Arduino or controller put it together
and get a robot that actuates you know
so you have one level it's
very easy they're also learning
programming math they get very excited
they are willing to go solve new
problems they may not tackle otherwise
just because they're having fun but
suppose you're like me right the
unfrozen caveman lawyer I can't design
or draw to save my life there's hope
here too we have three now have 3d
scanners these bring science fiction to
life's they're using lasers and cameras
to capture the contours of an object and
turn it into the design file there's
other software that allows you to use
just a simple digital camera so if you
take 20 or 30 pictures maybe a little
more to get every angle of the object
you can upload it it will be turned into
the design file you easily download it
all open source and free there's it's
called one through 12 3d and then
there's another software program called
blender that you can then take it to
clean up the noise and then again print
in short almost anyone might be able to
use 3d printing technology which then
takes us to some economics not deep
economics but really how is it being
used out in the field it's 3d printing
is poised to alter and change
manufacturing sectors of the economy
just as the PC put the power of
digitization into the hands of everyone
so that copying and distribution costs
were no longer barriers protecting the
copyright industries business models of
the late 20th century 3d printing
promises to put the power of digitized
things into almost anyone's hands
question go for them we might not be
that easy to make and correct getting
off the copier actually the some
industry partners control and sort of
Sahara and that way controlled actually
printing copies absolutely correct that
that is possible right now it has been
essentially open source but as some of
our audience knows more than I there is
a little fight brewing over that but so
far the they have stayed pretty much
open source and the price is dropping
like crazy they are about 1000 to 3500
dollars so you're right this could
change the whole game and if it goes
that way that might change a lot but ok
twenty years of the history of this
technology for 3d printing it was
and it was very expensive as soon as
those initial patents expired you saw
this you saw obvious create
proliferating dozens of designs at a
thirtieth of the cost and that's how
it's really taken off so that genie is
out of the bottle the very early
technology assuming that there aren't
sort of patenting tricks to recapture
the public domain which ought not to
succeed but you don't know yeah thank
you so what I'm suggesting those the
shifts and copying technology that
disrupted the copyright industry are in
essence starting to show up in 3d
printing and that they might also
disrupt manufacturing and related jobs
so on the one hand we should be starting
to see lower manufacturing costs the
ability to make specialized in
just-in-time parts and some return to
local manufacturing might come out on
the other hand we might also have fewer
jobs because of automation and
industries that thrive based on patent
rents might no longer be able to do so
so 3d printing in the in this space
people champion it as innovation which
is in my opinion and incredibly dead
word but there it is but in this space
what might that look like and I'm
suggesting you know classic lawyer trick
three possibilities home startups and
large factories so at the home 3d
printing is offering the chance to make
items that are not mass-produced Neil
Gershenfeld of MIT and who's a leader in
the space has called this personal
fabrication so that you can make what
you can't buy at Walmart so for example
the toy industry might actually become
in this crowd is a little dangerous but
i'll call it think of it almost like a
platform it becomes the basis for one
thing and what's already happening is
obvious are there kids get bored with
barbie or ken and as we know some of us
mattel's not very pleased when people
mess with their intellectual property
but they're sitting there and they're
taking putting new heads on new costumes
changing them like crazy lego is another
example of this possibility so as a
quick little bit here's something where
it's surprisingly good you get one side
was the original and there's the the
replica this is interesting because it
was all in one print but as I understand
it this jewelry each of those little
rings actually
move it was not you had to make them
separately and connect them which just
gives you a sense of how powerful the
technology is getting and here's where
it gets kind of weird right you have a
spoon that also has lego in it and you
know you can imagine the fun of the
fights over that so give the tendency to
share the designs and then not everyone
may want have room for a 3d printer or
as you point out there might be costs or
other issues involved some creators
might just sell it directly in which
case you might see sort of this becomes
further expansion of the etsy model and
etsy for those of you don't know is a
marketplace connecting handmade and
customized craft makers to consumers and
in that sense it might be that 3d
printing really expands the artisanal
individual part of the economy but what
about startups startup firms can use 3d
printers and other automated
manufacturing to compete with older
industrial giants for example Local
Motors in Chandler Arizona has used the
approach to launch a specialized
automaker business and the business
works in part because they actually are
crowdsourcing the parts from the maker
community as opposed to the mass
production system of other automakers
it's easier to design and test parts
using 3d printers and milling machines
and then create parts is needed and
insofar as 3d printers are part of
flexible manufacturing Tesla's approach
to auto making is a larger scale example
of how the technology is making
specialized items but not having to
invest in the large single purpose
production lines thus sparking a
different type of innovation so here's
sure can take a picture often car and
mind if you printed it doesn't drive
fret no so you have to first take the
car pop into its million pieces print
all of them and put it back together
very good that's it I'm not saying you
can actually print the whole car but
what I am saying is this part is
becoming easier to design and adapt and
make quickly the capital cost the old
world classic model was you have a big
factory it only has one thing and so
people said well I have a patent on that
you know you need to give me that
protection because the investment to
make that work here though a company
this is not as a company called erbe has
in fact said that this car the parts are
all 3d printed and then they assemble it
that's the difference
so large factory for instance to get a
little bit closer what you're saying is
they are they're able to make and runs
of one item and then switch the item
that they're going to make because of
the nature of this again think about the
PC the machine itself is able to simply
get new files new designs and turn them
out one after the other but they don't
have to retool everything to print the
next run so in theory this should result
in need for less labor and it might move
some production to the United States and
Europe whereas previously because of
labor costs they have been elsewhere and
some of the possible benefits for this
would be you get lower inventories and
thus you can address market demands
faster you should be able to shave save
on shipping and related environmental
costs and insofar as there's some threat
of IP being taken when it's in a
different country you're keeping it in
your own now what was interesting is
when Gershenfeld wrote fab I think in
2005 there was a line that caught my
attention he said it's not as though
we're printing jet engines with this
last year GE aviation bought Morris
technologies precisely because of their
3d printing and computer milling
capabilities and in fact wanted it to
not only prototype but be able to make
production items for their leap jet
engine that's how quickly this
technology is moving so in short 3d
printing seems to promise faster speed
to market lower risk to test new
products because the company can test a
product without the cost of full-scale
production and might even alter that
product based on market testing the
industry could also produce items that
are now previously had been seen too
intricate to be able to machine so that
takes us to guns I look for a good
picture of the gun stuff but it all
looked like it someone might claim that
i was in printing copyright so i haven't
put one up but you know what they look
like so the power to make whatever one
wishes poses a problem for regulated
industries in general especially
firearms and pharmaceuticals Oh as a
side note I saw just saw a paper that
looks like it's from a real scientific
journal by I think it was two Scottish
scientists who believe that they can
take the technology and do chemical
compounding so you can imagine the
pharmaceutical industry will pay
attention but
sticking with guns what I'm going to
suggest is that understanding the the
debate over 3d printers and guns will
actually reveal the problem that 3d
printers pose for patents in general
okay the early attempts to print the gun
including the regulated parts give us a
real example of our troubles it shows us
how quickly what was basically printing
fantasy becomes reality and one of the
big barriers that went away sorry has
gone away and that was the cost time and
skill right the machines you needed to
make a gun are absolutely gone now when
it first happened a little over a year
ago everyone freaked out right at one
level they said all was only six bullets
and then some people said it was still
six bullets right it's a big deal but
one of the things was the receiver which
is a regulated part that the government
says if you're a gun manufacturer you're
not allowed to sell it cracked I'm not
positive but I think because of the
press it seemed like a little bit of a
challenge to those guys March of this
year they put up a video of them firing
an ar-15 which is the civilian version
of the m16 with the receiver that they
had printed 600 rounds of ammunition and
they said we would have kept going we
simply ran out of bullets and in fact I
just saw yesterday no April 26 so a few
days ago they are claiming that they
expect in a few weeks to be able to have
the plans up for free for anyone to
print a fully plastic gun okay so it is
regulated if you're a manufacturer but
technically in the US we're all allowed
to do that at home if we feel like it
that may change but what I think is more
interesting here is that the ability to
print the regulated parts are already in
trouble patents it can be seen as sort
of a subset of trying to regulate
anything so 3d printing is a larger
issue is going to affect any field
subject to regulation because of public
health and safety concerns for the
purposes of the research that my
co-author and I are doing we're trying
to say well these industries also
their faith in patents so insofar as 3d
printing threatens incumbents we expect
some perhaps many are going to look at
public safety and health issues as well
as patent arguments to stop or regulate
the sector but for reasons that are not
about those issues but more about
protecting their position so some legal
implications this could easily need
updating but this is rut right now what
I think are the different vulnerability
points if I were to be a council and
wanted to go after 3d printing so the 3d
printing world will lead to some patent
infringement the question is what will
patentees do in the absence of any
legislation that stops them the classic
move might be lawsuits against different
pieces of this puzzle right people who
are facilitating the 3d printing go
after them but they're going to have to
face the same sort of headwinds that
limited the utility of copyright
infringement claims filed by music
studios against digital distributors of
content co-author and I believe that a
more promising strategy would be to join
the 3d revolution and find different
ways to leverage their current position
nonetheless before we get to that where
might they suit your question hat is
present a much more difficult a barrier
lawsuits than copyright infringement
copyright infringement the actual file
had to be transferred player you're
transferring instructions I have to go
through some contributory argument and
that's gonna be hard much harder I think
it's I didn't pay him but I was using
what where might they attack and the two
angles will be contributory infringement
or active inducement so yes I tell me if
you think I get it wrong but I'm with
you so far all right so one place that
you might go is go after the hardware
right or and that would be the 3d
printer makers or probably something I
should add in here you could try and
claim the scanners or other things but
again these are general-purpose devices
it's really should be a non-starter in
fact promised not to much heavy on law
because there's only a few lawyers in
the audience and we can get deadly
boring arguing about what the code says
the regulators were very successful
enforcing the hardware to put some of
copyright protection into DVD drm yes
digital rights management they were
successful i would say in so far as yeah
it happened but notice and i will get to
this in a moment in reality most of the
big makers have given up on drm Apple
got rid of it at just the other day a
tour and a few other big publishers have
said no more drm on our books so yes
they were able to go that route and part
of my co-author and I are what we're
trying to say is we could follow that
path again it would be a waste of time
it has not worked well in the other
areas and instead when the industries
have adapted and addressed the issue of
well that sort of lock up look engineers
crack things right there they're gonna
break it again it's an open system and I
think a little bit what David was
getting at if you remember with the
scanning technology I don't know how you
can get drm to stop it's it's not the
same concept anymore problem here what
you're doing is you're building a
patented device where once you do that
you violated the patent right you're not
making a copy or somebody else's file
right so let me go a little further if I
haven't finished answering it let me
know but alright so the first concept we
stick with the hardware the concept here
that maybe the printers of the
accessories are covered by the provision
the problem is we're not going to be
able to prove right if you want to go
after them that this is a device that is
not suitable for substantial
non-infringing use right I hope I've
made that case pretty clear there's so
many non-infringing uses for 3d printer
that it's it should be a no-brainer for
any court in fact if we think about the
big case here in the copyright world
which in fact borrowed that concept out
of patent law which is the sony case
come on compared to a vcr this thing has
got way more non-infringing uses so
there's that they could say that the key
players and 3d printing are actively
inducing infringement again only if
they're idiots right at this point it's
so obvious what that's going to look
like if you specifically made one of
those printers I put up there or our
scanners that infringe patents and
in you know entertain your friends yes
we're going to come after you but it's
too easy to say this has so many cool
devices that your things you do do not
be groc store Napster and tell people
hey we're going to be a repository where
you can use our device to to infringe so
I mean really you'd be quite foolish and
if a company does that fine sue them out
of existence call it you know sort of
Darwinian self selection and move along
others won't make that mistake that's
right if you're talking about just
patents generally but you can't imagine
a seller but 3d printer says look at
these cool things you can do with the 3d
printer and then anyone with a patent
covering one of those implementations
that's used in the marketing would have
an argument for so you'd have to be a
little careful yes I'm with you right
that's where you would see someone at
least throw some darts or shoot take
some potshots at that I'm totally with
you on them you have to be careful on
what you say it can do absolutely all
right so let's take a little bit of the
software and the sites that host the
files that give us the instructions all
right you could prevent it right if you
could lock it down as you're describing
this would make the patent industries
extremely excited in fact I don't know
if you've noticed this already but
Nathan Myhrvold has obtained did he get
it the patent on DRM he has in fact gone
out and gotten a patent to try and
install a digital rights management
system for 3d printers no one that I
know it is is thrilled by this I don't
think it's a wise strategy but that
would be one angle but the other issue
here is when you had those claims in the
other worlds right Napster for music
ebay for counterfeit court said that if
you were the website you would be liable
for contributory or copyright copyright
or trademark infringement if you had
knowledge that what you were doing was
illegal so you might think a website
that serves as a conduit should be
liable for contributory infringement if
it doesn't take down the file after
receiving a plausible complaint from a
patentee in fact by the way a couple
sites are already doing a version of
that without the law pushing them into
it thingiverse and I believe shapeways
have notice and takedown policies that
that track the DMCA process
but the contributory patent infringement
claims against the website could be
rejected because the language of the
statute doesn't seem to cover that
software the portion of the section that
could apply to 3d printing files is the
text stating a component of a patent
cannot be used to infringe but in a
slightly different part of the statute
the Supreme Court in 2007 said that the
term component address patented objects
that are assembled entirely or partly
abroad doesn't include software
unconnected to hardware this makes some
sense here's why the analogy here is
that the software is actually a
blueprint the blueprint may contain
precise instructions for the
construction and combination of the
components of a patented device but easy
itself not the combining of the device
and this makes sense patents are
supposed to be the instructions on how
to make the item that's part of the
patent bargain ostensibly but nobody
thinks then that just posting that file
is an infringing act now it's not all
rosy here there are possibilities that
the court could read the word component
more broadly in going back to this part
of the statute instead of the case in
2007 and that's one possibility the
other part is that the courts
construction of component in that was
from a utility patent case and we also
have to deal with design patents so 3d
printed fashion or other objects are not
covered by copyright and might be
distinguished this leads us to a little
diversion all right so a little side
note just getting into design patents
myself and I'll tell you this obviously
apple vs samsung for those who followed
it brings this design patents to the
forefront we just had a conference at
stanford about design patents with some
very smart people and the only thing i
could tell is it's a ridiculous part of
the law it shouldn't exist but it's
there um it traces to a very odd legal
moment a moment in legal history late
1800s Early 1900s there was no trade
dress protection and basically my
argument though I have to do a little
research to support it is industries
that relied it on design went and said
you need to give us this protection and
they got
the new technology I think further
reveals how devious these laws are now
one of the strange things that I learned
was one of the early cases had to do
with believe it or not a spoon and a
little cool trill on the handle of a
spoon total design and you reproduced it
you infringed all right so smooth now
that's pretty ugly it's not very
sophisticated you may not care but it is
a someone's head attached to a spoon
there's some design stuff there you may
think that'll never touch someone's
design patent what about that now one
could get closer and be pretty easy to
copy and then our old friend from before
so everything it's got utility well yes
of design pet side we could go way into
well what is it the part and is only
ornamental is the is it utility because
I can snap other Legos to this I don't
know it but you're right you get some
mixes but here's some other ones just to
give you more sense so this was not
granted it's not a 3d printer but it is
the larger world of CNC or computer
numerical control this is a fairly
important design and a lot of design
patents are about chairs the egg chair
now this was only at scale right another
famous chair right i mean at least since
10 years yeah lot of furniture is
produced by sort of machines that you
just use submitted CD and they make sort
of the parts of a bookshelf washer yes
but this is what is that so that goes
back to the computer control stuff right
but this again becomes those are tend to
be bigger machines you're not as likely
to see them in the home what's curious
and granted you might say it's a little
sci-fi of me but this is the one that
caught my attention the claim for this
file when they called it parametric
which i don't think is necessarily how
that word works but i'll defer to the
owners of the file was that this set of
files would allow you to make these beds
and chairs from the tiny to the full
size as long as you had a big enough
machine right so that's where if you had
designs right those other ones where
it's small scale but this suggests that
if you've got anything that's subject to
a design patent you could take your
picture
you could arguably rip it off or at
least make a copy and you'd be good to
go so as a getting back to contributory
infringement let's say you bring that
suit against the website the patentee
still has to figure out what is
identifying what is infringing and
identify it you're going to have to
locate the potentially infringing 3d
files see what they make decide if the
end result is infringing and that's
pretty owners and things are even worse
or at least as bad if you're the website
the digital intermediary is going to be
incapable of making judgments about
patent infringement when we consider
that lawyers and engineers have no clue
as it is or at least often removing any
file when a patentee raises the
complaint that the resulting product is
too similar to its patent is unrealistic
because this would basically drive users
off the website or perhaps to what
patent user patentees might care about
more a full on distributed peer-to-peer
system for these files as well moreover
it's unclear whether a claim that the 3d
printer file would produce something
that might be infringing is specific
enough to give that site the liability
under contributory infringement
standards at least so far as they've
been set out so far for copyright and
Trademark so even if the patentee worked
hard to locate the files the notice
would probably not result in much of a
response from the websites so if the
patentees are then unable to stop the
widespread infringement by 3d printers
their best fallback might be to embrace
the change and in production and
cultivate new markets so possibly just
like movie studios found a way to make
money from DVDs even though home your
ship cannibalize revenue it could be
that patentees could profit from the
growth and home manufacturing this is a
way other hypothesize up here is think
about the fact that the machines are
expensive at one level even if they come
down in price and we may not want them
all the time but if we do want to use
this perhaps the brand itself could be a
lever to help the patentee in other
words I might be happier getting the
Mattel doll or the Lego piece knowing
that the file was clean and came from
the original company in addition they
might give authorized or certified the
plas
stick etc so that my kid may not be hurt
that the colors don't have something
else going on there's a whole world here
where this could all work out relatively
well and the big entities would actually
move to to use trademark to give the
quality assurance that we would
otherwise be running up against if we
just get the file from anyone end-users
in that sense might be wanting to get
their inputs from an established brand
where there's customer service and
liability issues where you can go to
them and say hey this didn't work rather
than the unknown author or plastic from
a local shop so when penalties enter the
3d market they're going to have to
resign themselves to the fact that their
software won't be patentable right
they're going to need this is where they
might demand the drm for these other
options even if they go this other route
because they'll say oh my official file
was copied but right now what I've said
so far is patent infringement is way
more complex than copyright or trademark
infringement and the legal theories that
were not effective in slowing the online
distribution of music or counterfeits
are less likely to work in this space so
the patentees have a couple options
hopefully they'll be nimble and pursue
the new strategies unless Congress bails
them out with some new statutes to
restrict it at the same time we could
see a demand for for DRM what my
colleague and I are going to propose is
this there are a couple things that
Congress might want to do to try and
find a middle ground here first there
might be it might be needed to have an
infringement exception or sorry
exemption for personal 3d printing so it
would not affect large-scale production
an obstacle to the growth of 3d printing
is that those who engage in that
activity are going to be strictly liable
if you infringe the patent so chances
that a person might be sued for direct
infringement are low there's nonetheless
the potential chilling effect on those
who are risk averse or think it's
immoral to break the law because it is
the law so a sophisticated firm might
fail to find patents that conflict with
their work and there might be little
hope that the average individual or
small business can navigate the
minefield and be sure they are not in
fringing so it's unclear why production
at home for purely personal use should
be unlawful especially given that
enforcement is futile the norm of benign
lacked for 3d infringement might work
but it's not the same as saying let's
create a legal carve out Congress until
now had not had to do that because
personal production from patent remedies
because it was very difficult to make
patent devices at home but the physical
limit is eroding maintaining a liability
standard created for another age may not
make sense here given the interest in
complex questions involved with the area
we're suggesting that the best solution
should Congress try and do something is
to create this home la immunity from
liability and set a pretty high minimum
for controversy before you can get into
court Congress make it legal to copy a
gun for your private use it's already
legal by the way welcome to America but
that believe it or not if you wanted it
right now to have take a milling machine
etc it is not illegal for you to make
the gun at home as far as I've been able
to tell this is all perfectly legal it's
illegal for you to be a large-scale
manufacturer so it's already the case I
can make it was all too nice but you
can't take it out of your house
you can make it you can keep it in your
house you can't walk out the door is
that right David you can't shoot it out
on a rage but in generally for example
in Massachusetts you need a license to
have a handgun actually need for a long
time so you can't go get the license
even if you made it yourself well you
can't you know get the license okay but
then you've got a license right you're
saying for unlicensed guns oh I see yeah
you built it your basement but you can't
go walking outside of it without a
license right so there's a couple
different a couple different things here
right so one was there are regulations
the government regulates the manufacture
of guns if you are a overall seller this
is a different question in my mind which
is nonetheless if you print it at home
to be legal in addition you will
probably have to comply with the local
licensing laws and but that's a separate
question to me if you were to build a
gun for example for build a shotgun with
a 12 inch barrel that would still be an
illegal gun if you build an automatic
repeating guy a machine gun right that
would still be a drink that's right see
it's the legal gun that's right to be
legal that's absolutely right but I'm
but but the interesting question is the
the real analogue to me is we can talk
about you're not supposed to do X but
they can still do X as you said and if
they are in their basement who knows one
thing you're missing yeah because this
is where I think 3d printing is going is
there's the nerds that will build their
will build the riprap the new thousand
dollar or three thousand dollar running
but what's really going to happen yeah
it already has happened in central
square there's a laser cutting news
bureau you can go in and get all sorts
of the laser sight my guess is what
you're going to have is neighborhood 3d
printing yes it's like you have a kinkos
this and you might want to think how
this all applies to that service bureau
industry because of course that they
have a different set of incentives not
to not to know that's why i was saying
is i think what might happen in the
middle is what I was talking about okay
so wasn't really getting into it with
this version of the presentation but I'm
with you so think about it what makes
more sense rather than us sitting at
home with this is if there are basically
an app store yeah right so I think this
is where Amazon and Walmart should head
and most likely will amazon is
become very much about on-demand
consumption despite wherever they are so
they now try and have local distribution
and for specialized goods I think they
would do this for you without a doubt
and they'd have the scale to do it and
they say fine you want your file well
print it and have it ready for you
tomorrow kinkos and others might get
into this I think Walmart if you really
think about Walmart's model which is
just in time right i mean the real
genius of walmart by the way is there a
warehouse right there system is designed
so that the local customer is driving
that process so that the goods hit that
shelf and move within a day and so that
if you're the person who sells through
walmart Walmart's making tremendous
money because their inventory is never
on the shelf this could work the same
way right right absolutely i think the
amazon it to me if they're going to be
building the local stores for same-day
delivery it would make i gotta believe
beezus is so smart he's already on them
and the problem with the home systems is
there you know five by five by five
you're really limited but once you have
an industrial system they can do
sintered metal I mean you give a really
neat system and I think that they're
you're much more likely to have some
sort of a relationship where patentees
can move a dmca like system or just at
that point again it they're gonna be so
out in the open it won't be worth it to
them to necessarily infringe but the
question might be if you go to them and
give them a file do they have to police
your file and I don't think they should
have to that's again the same issue if I
said one file to one manufacturer one to
another and they all come together first
of all they're not patented yet but I
put them together yes and so this is the
other part of the the I don't know if
you look at the Akamai case yeah I
actually wrote the original piece really
I was chick clerking for judge so Bell
did the first draft for her okay then so
you you know it quite well well I mean I
you tell me how about the latest
iteration from the Fed circuit screwed
up okay so as someone who again doesn't
always track the patent side that's my
co-author good i thought i miss
sometimes like is that really what they
said and wow it's out there you know one
of the things they didn't say a lot of
stuff they didn't really sit what the
standard is if you were and you
you are enabled giving someone the tools
to make a patented now the thing you
have to remember is limelight did not
believe what they were doing violated
the person so is it strict liability
under this new theory where you don't
even have to do it all yourself do you
have to what the decision says is you
have to know there's a path and so if
you give all the pieces to someone else
and they do the last piece before this
decision that wasn't patent infringement
because one entity had to do the wolf
right now the argument is well if you
know its patented then you can be
responsible even if someone else does
part of it but it didn't make it clear
whether you had to know it was patented
and believed that what you're doing
infringed back yeah cause it to back it
out for everyone who's perhaps now even
though I swore we weren't gonna try to
get too into the nitty-gritty I did is
my fault as the lawyers would say we
open the door and it's my fault but um
roughly speaking what the case started
to say was a correct me if I if I miss
state this if you basically set it up
were you like hey look this piece and
this piece and this piece are all okay
go put it together you could now be in
trouble in simplest terms and this was a
shift a big shift but the other piece
was this question of knowing that what
you were doing was also going to
infringe at all and it's it's a cert
right what is it up for cert I think
yeah I think it is i'm hoping yeah so it
might go to supreme court because it is
a relatively new interview but there's
also a question of whether six and by
decision suggests that there was a lot
of certainty right but then getting back
to this then the other concept that we
suggest might work is believe it or not
maybe something like the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act but for patents
and a lot of people hate the DMCA I i
think the DMCA has worked out a lot
better than people have realized it
might suggest it works yes I'm with you
I I in fact said that a few years ago
when I was doing some work at Google
where I said you know this actually
means that neither side is happy and
both sides have to come up with
something that works which was you can't
be too complacent if you
on the oh you might be infringing side
because the copyright industry was still
able to come knocking and say what are
you doing and so one thing that was kind
of interesting is content ID I was
pretty interesting market outcome may
not be the best outcome for all issues
but in that situation the music industry
gave digital fingerprints to youtube and
now if you upload a song and it looks
like it infringes the alleged owner gets
a notice they have to still do some
legwork and then they can choose if they
want to send a takedown notice or and
turns out they may want to monetize it
by putting up ads and actually saying by
the original here the harder part with
patent is kind of interesting here right
it's I don't think it will work as well
to be able you can't do that sort of
digital fingerprinting maybe yet who
knows the weird outcome of this is maybe
we'll get better patent claims and in
fact better files that you would have to
upload your file for the patent so you
could actually cross-reference better
and it might be that machine learning
techniques and a couple other cool
things will actually allow you to
compare a database of my file versus the
original say this looks like it might be
infringing I mean my guess is that will
take 10 20 years but who knows the other
piece of the puzzle here is patent is
strict liability there's no fair use so
the interesting question about the DMCA
was well there's a fuzzy world of
copyright where maybe i'm using
expressively maybe not the weird part
for patent is either you've infringer
you haven't you don't actually get an
expressive right to patents now I'm
guessing that as I say this there might
be my colleagues and legal academia who
are running around thinking yet we
should argue about what would expressive
patent rights look like certainly
Gershenfeld has talked about 3d printing
as an expressive act it rather
persuasive I don't think the law is
ready to think about that but you know
that's why professors get to write to
write I think the analogy is to the I
don't you know I don't infringe
copyright yeah because it's fair uses I
don't infringe cuz I don't infringe the
patent right but but and so it should be
even less the issue i think really
because unless you can really show this
was a straight-up infringement you don't
have that same interest at all and so
the
this it should be less of an issue
because there's as you said it's more
binary at least in patent all right so
quick wrap-up as it were as here's my
basic claim again it 3d printing is the
next step in general purpose computing
the activities that used to be the
province of only a few players are in
the hands of the many the patent system
has arguably been able to require
disclosure how the process works because
the cost to infringe was high now the
cost structures that required an
adventure to find a deep pocket outside
backer or gone design manufacture
distribution of goods is easier faster
less expensive than ever before and the
tasks that can be done by someone at
home in a start-up are sorry these tasks
can be done in home startups or large
business so patent law and industries
that rely on patents are going to have
to adapt to the new environment or
probably face a type of obsolescence the
disruptive power of 3d printing and
large squats to the economy affected by
3d printing means it'll take just one or
two industry players to try and force a
repeat of the mistake of the copyright
wars instead of learning from them so
instead of trying to follow the
copyright industry strategy of seeking
new laws to prosecute any and all who
use a technology to fringe a patent and
instead of demanding technological
solutions similar to drm tactics
deployed by the copyright industry and
instead of attacking internment
intermediaries who provide the files for
potential judgement we should realize
that those all failed books music film
these industries have started to give up
on those strategies have started to
embrace digital distribution and are
starting to make big profits printing 3d
printing should be lightly regulated
it's enabling exactly the sort of
creation and progress of science and the
useful arts that intellectual property
is supposed to foster the locus of that
work might shift it doesn't diminish
however that progress is occurring it's
often faster and at less cost the dawn
of the web increased and revealed the
scale at which individuals and
businesses engaged with shared and used
copyrighted or trademarked intellectual
property at scale the old bottles of
enforcement and what constitute
infringement had to be rethought to have
even a chance for the PC and the web to
grow and thrive the spectre of copyright
lawsuits of trademark law
it had to be mitigated 3d printing
raises similar challenges and the
largest threats comes from a fair amount
of uncertainty in the law trying to stop
or dictate the way a 3d printer should
be used is a bad idea it would unduly
limit the potential of a general-purpose
machine and mimic the failed drm ideas
of the copyright industry but if we have
to do anything we might want to revise
the patent law to increase the notion
sorry to create a high minimum amount in
controversy to at least get a de facto
fair use standards for home and
experimental use and contemplate a DMCA
but for patents to open the door to
these files being able to be shared and
played with in that sense we should be
able to see more sharing remix and
selling of the IP just like we did in
copyright but now in patent without
these changes 3d printing could become
mired in fights over protecting old
business models mistaken regulation
could fall into past dependent solutions
where creators are told to use a 3d
printer for only certain purposes as a
footnote that irony of that would be
that the original world of
computer-aided design used what was
called the dreaded dongle which was an
old drm licensing system so we would be
going backwards in time to a system that
has already proven extremely poor by
very smart people just down the road
from here and the proposed changes what
we at least we think or hope should
balance interest and create some space
for 3d printing to become a foundation
for a new way of a general-purpose
computing and creation and with that I
am in fact out of words for the moment
but lay it on me any other things that
I've confused you on earth yes so as far
as the law goes like it seems to be
totally impractical to go after home
users play if if someone successfully
went after a home user would you expect
that the damages would just be the cost
of licensing their patter originally I
mean in addition to having to find out
that somebody used it at
home what would be the benefit that the
person would get from suing this is the
beauty of having a co-author I can put
out that he's the patent extra but I
don't stretch your damages I don't even
know right the right damages or if the
person should I built the thing okay
that would be reason already if they
uploaded the file yeah if they designed
it uploaded the file then you know you'd
get into the economic damages standard
economic damage nursery right the more
significant cost would be illegal views
of the defense but the the standard
patent troll business model of settling
for nuisance value because actually
litigating a patent case being cost
millions of dollars yeah 22 10 is the
usual assumption for a packing case at
least four large so yeah it sounds like
the RIAA model doesn't really work noho
they are a not only works because the
statute says are damaged and actually
hurt pound Samuelson to donate some
really good work pointing out speak for
a one of you know and the real problem
would be somebody who designed the thing
and upload it right not knowing it was
padded with this one of the problems is
because it's strict liability yep you
here's a cool thing you're done upload
it then that person is but once again
they're probably judgment proof so
there's a whole bunch of problems again
seeing individual users it means you get
a 20 million dollar judgment and you
have ten bucks in your savings account
so it doesn't really do the person who
got the 20 million dollar judgment much
good to have spent five million dollars
to get that if their objective is to
make money as they rejected our roads
right if they're just as it to terrorize
people it works but so practically it's
a practical quick judgment proof hey
students were not about they don't
really expect to get a million dollars
out of Jamie its public I oh yeah yeah
and they don't expect to get the six
hundred and seventy thousand dollars
it's not here and that it's all about
and instead a lot more than that it's
all about listen on the other hand
there's a whole series of lawsuits
against individual downloaders of movies
for 15 which offer to settle for 1535
them that's about making money and
assumptions
somebody can come up with that but if
you go after someone and get a big
judgment that's to scare people their
bankruptcy you only do that if you're
trying to scare other people at him
which you know there's been busy some
areas where that has worked I think
there's some evidence that people now
are sort of oh well maybe that's illegal
but at the same time what where I don't
know I assume i don't know if i should
assume but i would bet that if you could
do an empirical study that a lot of that
stuff has just gone peer-to-peer because
then you can't even find them at least
pretty easy to find you through what do
you three packets oh yeah yeah okay so
straggles a movie lawsuits are through
peer-to-peer here appears fairly easy to
tell what people are doing okay it's
it's direct downloads from mega uploader
ah so around that those are fairly
difficult which is why they go after the
slightest k repair hasn't gone to sort
of a full mesh where it's really hard to
track you it's really easy there are
private networks VPN services you can
use to mask your IP but if you're gonna
stay on them if you're just on a general
you know torrent without being part of a
special I'll piracy community than your
I guess I again the more good I figured
they'd take advantage of all the ways to
hide but I was wrong as people don't
even think about what they're doing
music they don't write about that fair
enough you don't think about the fact
that there and they have no idea the
technology so they don't realize that
they're totally exposed right other
questions yes so what about going the
other way and say you're actually
copying so you violate copyright uh if
it's covered by copyright so statue ads
things like that would be implicated
absolutely and the answer to that would
be BMW may have right mom yeah we were
talking about so the trade trademark
itself i mean i can imagine i had to buy
a replacement BMW grill yep which by the
way is made by a lot a third-party only
for cheap oh yeah so I don't know that
3d printing is really going to change
anything but theoretically that's the
trademark part absolutely or you know
the simple version what if you make a
toy and there's some trade dress or
trademark combos on there and you know
someone says I don't I don't exactly
stay
well Disney now I guess is they I think
they just bought the star wars franchise
you know they're not known to be so
generous about healthy and no company is
I mean honestly I it's it is valuable
and so if they see that as there's a
whole bunch of problems one if they if
they come up with a ridiculous idea in
my opinion that's some sort of naked
licensing they could theoretically be
told oh you didn't police your mark you
have to go after them and I've actually
written about why that's a really dumb
model that this isn't the sort of use
that you should consider a naked license
because it's just not now if they start
making it at home and selling it well
yeah they probably will have to go after
that the law is talking about is the
reason elevator which supposedly as a
trademark isn't yes supposedly if you
come up with a lift and decide to call
it elevator and somebody else call
stairs elevator and you don't do
anything about it it becomes a generic
word yeah there are a whole bunch of
reasons that that that that law actually
has another deep relationship to patent
law turns out as well the original cases
had to do with the patentee had
exclusive use of the term and the
technology so when it came time for
someone to compete I think those early
decisions were fairly sophisticated
about saying the problem is your
monopoly on that thing has gone we're
not going to let you stop consumers from
using that term and or competitors they
have to be able to reach them but today
again it's sort of like we're talking
about how absurd it would be to go a
come actively and do you know infringe
with me marketing groups are smart
enough that they should always come up
with a suitable but maybe not maybe not
perfect or great so tivo right that's
why you have to have DVR because someone
can use DVR and tivo is tivo right
rollerblade inline skates that one's
probably a little dicey er but still you
at least if you deploy that I personally
think that I can understand a court
saying no one else can call it X because
you put in the time to market it so be
it but without it then yes you get into
this weird world where enough people use
it it becomes the term that everyone
uses and in theory it's generic and it's
called genera side it's sort of you
killed your brand or your mark
okay so one of the things that struck me
that you mentioned was that sites like
thingiverse are complying with patent
law and I was wondering why they were
doing that if they were doing it because
they were worried about being sued or if
it was more of like a moral thing as in
there trying to respect the rights of
the designer because this is really
interesting space right you have like
artists who are doing their own thing
and you have let the artists rights kind
of you know people should get money for
their IP and then you have the
open-source people who are kind of like
yes we should be distributing stuff so
where do you think like where does the
site like Thingiverse fall on the morals
yeah so from what I can tell they're
notice and takedown was I think
partially to be safe if they got a clean
notice that there was an infringement
issue but some of it has been morale but
mainly because of the gun stuff right
they've gone after I think MakerBot or
no was it a stratasys one of one of them
said in terms of those of you interested
this space at a larger issue that
technically their machines were only
licensed and that they were they tried
to pull yeah they're not in the position
of saying yeah that thing you thought we
sold ranks only a lease it was clearly
elite but the lease terms had this moral
thing and they they yanked it back from
the group those during the gun printed
right so but it was a basically of
morals type Clause you cannot do things
that are legal and or make guns and once
they found out they were they said great
you violate the terms of the lease will
take that back thank you very much um
the thing averse now theory says I
understand is actually owned by MakerBot
so I'm not positive as to what the
intent there was but I think they
probably had some smart lawyers and part
of it was if we get a clear one we want
to be able to be set up well to say hey
we've tried to do in good faith if you
guys say it's a problem we're done we're
taking it off at the same time I don't
know if they have any morals well
actually no they removed the gun parts
too I thought I read that and I I assume
that that is PR I mean they just at
combination the problem is of course
removing patented items doesn't immunize
you the way it does on copyright on my
dmca but it makes perfect
is that if you follow the DMC model
you're much better protected
particularly if it's a contributory
argument which is all as it can be right
it's hard to imagine you could win a
contributory argument when you have a
DMCA type right so right but but to
Kate's point in terms of the exact
motivation i'm not positive but I did
find it curious that in some cases it
was a morals question now the morals
question gets kind of funky though right
think about there there there are songs
which technically you know any any go to
any head shop and they're not yours
they're never supposed to say it's for
anything other than tobacco um you know
I don't know if they're gonna try and
police that and and frankly sex toys
right 3d printing all over the place for
them but there are some states where I
think they're still not supposed to be
sold I don't know where that's gonna go
and whether whether places like
Thingiverse is going what oh yeah I'm
putting pretty soon it was Ella just
change the law but maybe not I remember
something recent when one of his other
why huge head or sexually but yeah last
I heard it was Alabama but I had heard
they were thinking about changing it
finally but I don't know that that
happened but as an example anyway those
would be two items or at least one where
I don't know if finger verse is going to
say we will call that illegal or we
disapprove and you know and this is the
weird part I think with intermediary
liability in general is as you start to
exert some sense of this is how we look
at it courts say wow you started to
manage you started to police and so now
you're more responsible because you had
the right to do that which is you know
if I remember correctly this is part of
the reason the DMC is at least kind of a
nice compromise of okay we're not going
to hold you liable if you sort of in
good faith respond and in fact I think
if I remember there's some carve-outs
that if you set up some good morals
we're not going to hold that against you
it's actually sort of an old port
concept right which is if you fix the
stairway after someone fell we're not
going to say that's evidence that you
were at fault to begin with so I think
we'll see more of that here and the
question will be you know exactly why
not so clear but in terms of a nice
balance I think it actually could end up
being pretty well balanced so
other questions it is five I don't want
to keep people away from snacks and
drinks but and i'll be at snacks and
drinks for a bit so you know you can
bother me there yeah all right thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
