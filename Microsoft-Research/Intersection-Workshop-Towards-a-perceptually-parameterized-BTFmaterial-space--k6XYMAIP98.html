hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
what I'm going to talk about is this
type of materials and of course lexmark
elided platform that's what online my
PhD students and their former PhD
students in the past and I I saw it
works while to get you first of all a
motivation why we did all this and I
hope it works okay i will talk about why
we want to have a GF material space and
then in the second part i will talk a
little bit about how to install this
space and our very first motivation it's
limited is about was that there are many
many materials and collections all over
the world and they are extremely costly
and you see that they came from
different areas we have lever you have
gotten it whatever and in florals they
are in textile textile team and they are
produced sounds of them are produced
every day because the designers were
very good shop and designing this stuff
and the big question is can we make
these collections will show and this is
really important that we want to make
these collections virtual let me get a
real equivalent representation it's not
only graphics you cannot see it in
generate images which look nice they
should look like the savings otherwise
it does not make any sense to to try to
come up with better new collections the
same same question arises in the area of
cultural heritage and we wrote using
this area is very nice-looking artifacts
involving museums and if you capture
only their chivalry it's simply not
sufficient what you need is to
somehow reproduce the look and feel as
there is of course the aesthetic
impression and this all depends on
appearance of a material and this means
that your disposal and of course the
conservation documentation of small
defect here like the scratches or with
engravings in such stuff is very
important in the server motivation which
appear to be really important in the
advertising industry they recognize that
if you do simple graphics for
advertising foot it does not work simply
not because yeah people are very
experienced in recognize a foot is fresh
or not fresh or whatever and if you try
to model child with liquids it takes in
the creation is dipping their legacy for
such kind of object even for 3d artists
and at the end they are not not
satisfied with the result and therefore
the question is can we generate virtual
replica of these models and what should
be replica if you look into Mexico time
it's a copy exactly all details and big
pti it's it's it's there you'll find
this relatively indistinguishable and
that's something I liked here and I
suggest to use in our context and visual
copy visually exciting on it and what
what does this mean what do I want to do
if i have a replica of an object and I
compared it to a prog-rock it should be
in distinction okay but that's not
servicing why is it not so easy because
pipe in there that's what we're here for
the chance that doesn't mean it
perfect because at the end botany what
we get in our image depends of course on
the illumination and it depends on the
materials atrophy and both together and
there is a few point the generate my
direction and therefore if I want to
measure the quality of what I did I have
to take the distances between images for
all purposes and all positive images
otherwise it was not many make real
sense but of course I'm very use it are
there better metrics for this because I
think this is not the coracle lets our
experience okay if we go back and look
again at the materials and try to
understand appearance then of course
it's totally clear that it's much more
than color it contains surface variation
in their fields double the things which
we have to consider here then we have
these very microscopic reflection
parameters like Los view and life and
cellos occlusions angular cover
dependence and then of course this loud
and global illumination attack you
showed us how to feel oh okay but this
is all contained in in these images and
of course there might also the temporal
variation like a g6 like that interview
and if we again look on object
appearance we see that it influenced by
features which are inherently on
different scales mainly they have this
macroscopic the shape then we have a
mesoscopic scale never know yeah it is
not really what is mesoscopic but it's
some somewhat between the microscopic
heavy and in the macroscopic tail which
is it less than a pixel in your religion
therefore it depends on the distance of
observer and so on but it's more than
the microscopic scale which is normally
modeled using VR the F models or water
okay
and I have here some examples how this
looks and the form of representation how
are having the represent the appearance
of course we have here on microscopic
say we have shape explicit purpose de
Janeiro polygon mesh on the microscopic
staley normally we use statistical
representation in media the other F or
whatever Apollinaris comics kind of what
should we do here one thing to do is of
course because it's mutual resolved by
human perception the statistic reverse
station is not accurate enough because
if they have tried to see these
statistics does not make any sense and
next visit representation is too costly
therefore yeah normally you take images
and regret and replace this part by
images and if you do this you'll simply
grow Thank You which is of common option
in the of course if you take the images
you get the microscope is 10 for free
and this was the ideal of a
bidirectional texture function it's 15
years old on even more and John Cameron
we develop out him yeah we introduce
this from first time embodies the DTF
and now I that you said already all
about reflection and so on you have a
reflectance field of an object that is
reflected speed I paralyzing the about
bounding sphere of the object and this
means i have these outgoing directions
and i can tell for every Halloween
direction the intensity and hydrogen
incoming light field which illuminates
my scene and this incoming IP is related
to outgoing right likely about the wild
ease reflectance feet and because of the
linear collider is probably not about
this if you have one illuminate
light sauce retelling it let's take a
second one we needed simply and that's
the result and if we do it we get this
image files regarding equation which
reads like this that we have integrated
over all positions of positive positions
of light sources in four directions and
of course this is in a dimension
function okay in the PTFE some not which
is a little bit simpler we do not take
into account all these different
positions we throw away to arriving
simply the position on the sphere and
take only the directions and this makes
things simple because now we have the
lighting that she thinks only honor on a
direction and this is the incoming
flight with and we get it still this
instead of outgoing light and this
reduces that the transport to a sixth i
mention establishment object and if we
do this capture this by sampling be
again use this light songs I to describe
and they have this individual light
sources the captial dis reflectance
feels this all these images you showed
us they are little bit larger because we
do not have only one image we have many
many thousands of images from all
directions but that's our reflection
field and if we write the incoming light
as a linear combination of some basic
elimination slide you get as a vector
simply then we get this discrete image-
relighting equations this means they
have the life we have the strength of
matrix which is a variant matrix because
they have much more not only one images
of many images and then we get our with
liquid suit okay and that's what we are
going to capture it and how it get this
PDF you simply take many many images and
of course because reflectance of the the
art is of course a silent that the range
of the reflectance is as high as the
binary range of our scenes we have to
take hdr pictures into these and on
various you in lab directions and this
is the same material and all different
views and I'm front line okay and the
capturing set up our perception setup
consists of of some hundred cameras
which we are mounted on a on a half
sphere and if we let the V flesh this
one camera and capture the images
resolve cameras and if we do that we get
this hundred fifty 250 few and I
directions we get a CR images and it
took us about four hours petrol a full
yard again and now we have a better one
little bit better and faster moss that
more stable high resolution and so on
but nevertheless it remains to say it
have still the high yeah I capture times
in the province we have here are our
fixing your settings and they are
pleased combats football that works okay
and that's how it looks like if we take
for example is Evan that's what what
happens here 151 pleasures 151 cameras
and then of course these different
exposure times and depend on the deposit
times we we capture about the photo
power source and Latin source images
this time okay if you have done this we
can generate nice images of you sweetie
it's okay these are some results what do
you see you can represent William until
appears on different few directions an
arbitrary direction of course
directional lighting if I go close this
on my lighthouse able to get wrong
results but as far as our send us off
somewhere in space they look looks good
okay and this allows for brings the
green ring of complex with you this is a
close-up of such a material looks like
packages okay what is how are we missing
it's very little monkey because if you
if you want to reproduce original images
you should do all in separate space but
this is expensive to measure and it's
not only expensively cause-effect the
cameras are expensive it's even
expensive because of Italian you have to
spend and much longer time for disposal
time to to get out of these signal to
noise ratio three cameras okay and we
were already on this a little bit and
reconstruction from sparse data here
that we capture only some day huh some
sparse a respectful and reconstruct the
rest on these files and links but of
course and future it would be necessary
to come up with better ideas here and of
course we want to have more efficient
capturing systems adaptive techniques
some materials are similar can be take
this into account any of course do not
have any ideas how to measure larger
centers yeah so the Assumption solenoid
is
position Lapid sorts of funny several
consequences for sometimes so for
example cavities in the oceans or I
think the VR sufficiently far away from
our very small tiny samples with
whichever hide off ya off in English in
a range of 100 yeah and with micro
meters at most okay if you have these
blood samples there is occlusion and
there is all that stuff but it's not
really important but of course if you
have these these objects are a show to
hear from cut yeah this cultural
heritage artifact yet with a tape it's
important
not when you measure with x-ray yeah oh
ok let's let's that's a poppin of course
because there's okay what about the
official group presentation if you look
on this lifeline spot matrix and that's
what people from you it's it's a huge
magnet for mileage if you have the south
of images and it's very large in an all
new setup it generally two terabyte of
data and therefore we need of course
compression another first idea which
came into mind that was what people that
did in the very beginning they try to
fit brdf to to the mall and this works
relatively good here i show from this
magnitude the reflection map of a drunk
pixel how's it look like I very good man
and light directly and these are regular
reflections you see you designers and it
works right well and you can fit a model
okay these are our different views a few
directions on cameras and our light
sources and this simply hour and half
sphere game which you see here one cop
lied on camera on the top later okay and
these are the specular if you take a
different material and you look at this
apparent vr af-s then you see that it an
area so it will probably see nearly
flattened you get this is the not BR the
effort diagrams but otherwise because
you have this edge SEL shadowing end and
so on and therefore fits the vehicle
fitting the other stuffs not like upset
and the editor who work on that
thousand he tried to fit spatially
varying brf to his materials and they
did not look good because he simply lost
death in his images and there that's
exactly because of these idiots because
you simply smooth this in the job and
then that's disappears okay and
therefore what God can have a little
mind that you have many many
similarities and this means you can
perform City sweet data analysis and
that's what people did that's what also
we okay you write the the 24 matrixes
speaks as well as a tensor and if you do
that for example you can use full matrix
factorization or whatever n is for
stunning and you put simply the images
are always in made in a large matrix you
perform an SVG and you get these eigen
textures and deciding ABR eps in india
be component and this is a
representation with its authors now
already compact but the more important
is its renderable in real time okay in
what we are using that's what here on
rotate this decorated full matrix
factorization we separate yeah the
intensity simply and then they you
perform the SVD are all components and
then they use less components in in the
UV space okay and this way we can
compress the 500 gigabyte down to 640
megabyte which already fit okay let's
yeah I think
make sense to talk a lot about about
this and you can use the similar ideas
to screen the images / internet because
the individual IE textures and island
atif's continually debated income and if
you do that it's able to scream it and I
think I've shown the videos done besides
if you have transmitted 0.87 megabyte
problems with the same as it and then
one manor by seven being a biased and
then fully transmitted one then you get
the however size before you get
something more flirty but it still
virgin to get a first impression of what
you're hitting okay he had some exam
what you can produce you see the
materials look quite good and you can
reproduce what your head we have here
even for campaigns and since that it's
useful it looks all right in the quality
is also not too bad I suppose and here
you can see varying live and you can
simulate the light variation and dip and
its really faithful because if you take
the photograph it from and then you look
at the towhead results it's right is it
they are friendly people compare two
pathologists important metrics
extra max galaxies I think important so
you always specially very right it's
always special eager I think I can show
this very geometry or the poison with
the temple of letting a starter this
then i can ask video between you have to
take some fun okay yeah spatially
varying yeah it's specially very on the
geometry it's not and for every pics we
have a different ap rdf you don't know
what how they are related okay they are
compressed isn't it in via data proven
manner I cannot tell anything about that
about the relation between the different
parts but as you can see here you can
change you can change all in thing we
see the texture you have the fuel and
now you can change the light and you get
get the different images for different
lines okay you simply again you get what
you want okay it's a reflecting sweet
what you capture and that's what what is
going on at the end okay but but let me
let me stop here this thing they want to
continue the question is can you do
better with respect to do these
compression and I think there's a lot of
space for involvements is better than
interpolation of the sparse and it with
irregular senex we work on that your
graphics this year then maybe it would
be a good idea to factorize the
representation and it will physically
face model plus a statistic component
you know about this here and of course
maybe there are tales of moles all
genuine that he will be dependent
edges with which might do better but I'm
not sure about but now to the point of
the talk what I also want to talk a
little bit about why do we want to have
a perfectly paradise PKF material steps
given that we have already large TTFN
database and we are going to publish one
in some weeks okay we have captured a
lot a lot of data and we are going to
prepare this loudly can we retrieve BK x
which are similar to a given one that's
that's an interesting question because
it's not simply the image retreat
because the image is look totally
different from different directions and
then of course we might also ask for she
can be retrieve a letter that it's a
little bit softer than a given one or so
more sportiness then then in this
requires of course I'm networking the
size of the weekends that can be
computed of course efficiently and
resend with some perceptual properties
if they have their be can navigate in
this space and of course many people
were already on our PDF editing and
things like that and how to how to deal
with it what you want to help you want
to simply move with your Center to cross
a certain level and there is a lot of
work in this area of course how to how
to vary materials and the one of the
first things which from which we are
done here in this area was on NPR DFS
these very nice work of Matyszczyk where
he has a database of obvious that he can
navigate recently sega base towards and
some Zerby years and in this conduct
there are numerous of equations and and
Beaverton a little bit on that boat
Network should be used to compare BRF is
there something like just notable notice
of a difference for bre-x what would it
be here and is the president of current
brf more than sufficient end okay we
propose something
and you can see it here we have some
results we have reference then we have
our quirks and beta build an
approximation of this material and maybe
you see there's really no difference we
are able to express all these subtle
details for example if you compared to a
 tolerance model t's totally not a
YouTube to cater to get this material
it's very hard but of course there might
be more yeah it wants which word but but
to find these months it's really
complicated and therefore our idea was
that we simply take our samples place
them somewhere in the two-dimensional
space and then interpolate between these
70 and here you see interpolations and
now feel the sportiness of this material
down here is much higher than a spot in
a co-ordinate ok not only the curvature
here also we would like this behavior of
this VR a space and of course because
they have slightly vary materially yarn
are only interested in the check
machining they reflect this behavior but
also the changing the texture and that
was already an idea of Napa's within the
seven years on and he try to interpolate
between between actions and this work
somehow but not really good not good
enough for this purpose ok and therefore
we tried to come up with what is in
between two two materials and we found
that the most yeah the most challenging
things that if the apology for some here
you have for four edges and here you
have met maybe you have only three
inches somewhere if the pro policy
changes it's really challenging ok and
that's the little problem that you get
if you if you do something in the main
idea of the whole algorithm of our
interpolation art room for texture was
that we do the interpolation only on
neighborhoods from which we synthesize
the texture afterwards ok and
and this I think this is the the basic
message here next to the pleasure can be
found on neighborhoods only advise this
quotient because this limits the problem
as i will show you okay we have these
textures they generate the
neighborhood's we use the second texture
we generate the neighborhoods and now as
you can see here the apology we have for
our edges is totally different than here
but if you have small patches there are
not so many possibilities and you can
really work on that and then you can
yeah you can interpolate for the
individual patches in a in a moose nice
man okay and interpolate neighborhoods
instead of power images the feature
alignment is only needed between the
neighborhoods and this is yeah this is
simple because as you can see you they
have these suits it's not even funny two
more and you feel if you have more
complicated ones like this this one's
and this one's this indicate a set up a
car and then we can compare this
neighborhood fits best and then the
interpolate between patches which yeah
which which are better her more closely
related okay and I will not talk about
or details of discussion that's not made
since we do this patch interpolation we
use the correspondences revolve the
patches the individual small pitches
only 15 16 by 16 pixels which are which
is simple and then we have these
drawings okay yeah end yeah okay we use
this are showing off of
new home phone on require matching which
works by perfect in this this context
and then we can see what we get we have
a leper and we have this trick wall and
if we interpolate between pose it's
already quite good ok what is missing is
what is not really good is that the
overall statistics of what they get here
in the middle it's not the statistics
people expect for for a real or in that
you having having this structure ok and
therefore the would it be the business
sophistic and synthesize some details on
it on top of this director direct copy
and this way we get there nice texture
interpolations as you can see here here
is timing of course that's not so good
300-500 simple design for this sequence
on this material to these materials that
i have some more results here what you
can see here ok there's a song to be the
models interpolations to get here or
send unfortunately it looks like a
shipment even here for with stones and
we get doesn't get nice transitions
between options having this attend the
plane of course to do a to the
navigation interface but so far we are
not there yeah and we are waiting for
that ok ok we want to do or a depth
detection interpolation for spatial
distribution hide maps of its debate
avrx and then interpolate more than two
textures it's possible adding materials
are ETFs at phase first base if I the
DPF and of course more along serving
drinks ok that's it what what I wanted
to present ok thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
