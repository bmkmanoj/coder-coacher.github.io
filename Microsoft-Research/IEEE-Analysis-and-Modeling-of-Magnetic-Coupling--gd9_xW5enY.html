you for coming and doing this
presentation and podium is yours okay
thanks so it just 11 technical everybody
signed the sheet the if anybody didn't
sign the sheet will please do that the
day attendance you
so it sounds like it is coming over the
speakers great I got started in power
electronics working a little startup
company with a professor and we were
designing electronic ballasts and
together we learned about magnetic
coupling and and neither one of us were
had a lot of training in power
electronics but we studied that and then
I over over the years I've attended a
lot of seminars and studied and but I
always how would I put it I had a hard
time dealing with magnetic coupling and
it wasn't until nineteen ninety-five
that I met a doctor James spreen who
came to work for magnetic in Indiana
where I was working at the time he was a
PhD from MIT and he really understood
magnetics and so he was kind enough to
spend a fair amount of time teaching me
things and basically this these slides
are kind of a distillation of what I
learned and it's more than we can
possibly cover tonight but the slides
are online and so you could go back and
study at them in in more detail if you
didn't get one of the emails from me
they had a link to this if you send me
an email to Bryce BR yce at i triple e
dot org I'll send it to you
so the here's the the basics of what I'd
like to cover looking at modeling with
electric circuit equations how you do
measurements and how you create
equivalent circuits a little bit about
magnetic modeling and then some tips
that I found from from taking
measurements and how I was able to make
the models better correspond to the
actual performance data and then I
wanted to talk a bit about stability
magnetic stability and this is something
that isn't taught very often anymore and
the the basic idea is that if you have a
set a couple and coefficients it's not
good enough that they're between minus 1
and 1 if you have more than two windings
there's there's more mathematical
restrictions on that and ultimately what
it boils down to is if you pick the
wrong set of coupling coefficients and
put that into a circuit simulator your
transformer will become an infinite
power source and the circuit simulation
will not converge or we'll we'll head
rapidly head to infinity and I will try
to explain why that is and how you make
sure that you don't pick the wrong
couple and coefficients okay so my goal
is to try to make magnetic coupling a
little less mysterious showing how to
model it measure it and use it in
circuit analysis so in in the most basic
sense you have two windings that are
coupled and only part of the flux that's
in one winding ends up in the other
winding and
and that goes either way we if you drive
the primary or the secondary still only
part of the flux makes it to the other
side so that you have some different
modeling options you can use a linear
model you can get parameters to
determine from circuit measurements and
you can you can measure the necessary
parameters with fairly high accuracy if
if you know how to do it and those are
some of the tips that I want to want to
give tonight however if you're doing a
linear model it doesn't tell you
anything about flux and if all you're
trying to do is see how a circuit is
going to perform and and and you know
you're a long way from saturation then
that's a plenty good model now there's
another way you can model and that's
with the with reluctance modeling and
then you have to have electrical the
magnetic interfaces for each winding and
that kind of model explicitly shows the
flux paths and you can do that with
linear and nonlinear reluctance paths
and you can calculate electrical circuit
parameters for magnetic circuit
parameters but you can't start with
magnetic excuse me you can't start with
electrical and then tell what the
magnetic ones are it's kind of a one-way
street there so just I'm going to go
over some very basic equations and go
through this fairly quickly we all know
V equals L di DT for an isolated
inductor for two windings you have to
include a mutual inductance and the
mutual inductance is in common for both
so in this case L 1 2 is equal to L 2 1
and that's a fundamental circuit theory
issue that
that there's only one mutual inductance
and and when you go and create an
inductance maître see it has to be
symmetric and I'll talk a little bit
more about that here's how you put the
whole thing together in one big
inductance equation and you just string
all the circuit all the equations
together and put the coefficients in the
right place and and that will describe
it in the time domain you can do the
same thing in the frequency domain and
you end up with the same inductance
matrix and the diagonal are the these
are the self-inductance a--'s of each
winding and then all of these are the
Mutual's and the Mutual's are are
symmetric so the reason why the
inductance matrix has to be symmetric is
due to what's called the reciprocity
theorem and it's required for
conservation of energy and it's it's
messy stuff but I did give some
references if anybody wants to look into
it and see see why it is and there's a
couple of different arguments one is
from Maxwell's equations and another one
is from stored energy but basically if
you don't have a symmetric matrix than
your energy goes to infinity or you know
you have something you have it a system
that puts out power it's not pass it so
for two windings we can define a
coupling coefficient and probably
everybody here is familiar with that you
take the square root of the mutual
inductance / the two self inductances
now depending upon how you set up your
polarity
then you can either have that coupling
be from you know minus 12 14 n windings
you can create a matrix where you
compute the couple and coefficients for
each of the pairs and of course down the
middle it's its unity in that in that
matrix and if you do the measurements
accurately the coupling here is going to
equal the coupling here this matrix will
be symmetric in practice measurements
aren't perfect and they get corrupted by
resistance and capacitance but what I
found is when i say i want to measure a
transformer i'll measure all the
couplings both ways run it into mathcad
a little routine and it says which you
know k 21 k 12 whichever one is the
highest one that's the one I use and
that seems to have given me the best
results when I actually go and try to
match a simulation against the physical
model now here's some other ways that
you can can you can actually measure
this because mutual inductance here this
this number that's not something you can
measure directly we have to use some
technique so one way you can do it is
you can take two windings and you can
put them in parallel our excuse me in
series and this is called series aiding
and you measure the inductance and then
you can flip the polarity around and
measure the inductance again and that's
called the series of posing and if you
use this formula or the aiding and
opposing and divide it out like that
then that will give you the coupling
coefficient and I've derived that in the
slides but but we're not going to go
through that I just want you to know
that it's there and you can and you can
look it up and everything just goes back
to these simple equations and this is
really one of the
the important things that the gym spring
taught me was that if I would just write
down the equations and work my way
through it all this stuff falls out it
just takes a little bit of time to work
through it and I just I didn't realize
the power that I had to compute this
stuff starting with very simple things
now here's an another way to measure
coupling and this one is what's called
the voltage ratio method and the idea is
you take one winding and you drive it
with a voltage source you measure that
voltage then you measure the voltage on
the other winding and you turn around
and drive the other winding measure the
voltage on the first one and then if you
plug that in to this equation it gives
you the coupling coefficient and this
particular method is really useful for
power line type transformers where you
can run it you know at 120 volts or 480
or whatever you can drive those windings
at the rated voltage and then and get
this measurement now one of the one of
the tricky things about a coupling
measurement is that the magnetizing
inductance is somewhat variable and so
the coupling coefficient itself is
variable this and if the if you're
magnetizing inductance is voltage
dependent this is a nice equation to use
because you can drive it it under the
actual operating conditions and then
then I go through and again just using
those simple basic equations derive of
that calculation method now probably the
the the method that most people use for
doing coupling coefficient is this one
it's what I was introduced to first and
what what I do is or what you do here is
you take one winding and you short it
and you measure the inductance of the
open winding
and then you put it into this formula
where you got the leakage inductance
which is the inductance you measure when
the other winding is shorted compared to
the self-inductance without winding and
if you do careful measurements these two
numbers are going to be really really
close the problem tends to be if you
have leakage inductance a--'s that are
down in the Nano Henry's and you don't
have a good instrument to measure them
in that case particularly what i would
do is I'd short the one that has such a
low number I can't measure it measure
the other one which is easier to measure
and then just go with that and but there
there are some really nice instruments
out now that that can measure down in
the tens of nano Henry's quite nicely if
you need to do that so again I go
through and using the same techniques
derive that so if you wanted to develop
a nice transformer model and get all the
couplings appropriate you need to have
them with kind of the same base for the
magnetizing inductance so the way I like
to do that is if I have a nun gap core
then I'm going to take my oscillator
voltage on the same network analyzer and
I'll scale it so that the volts per turn
is the same on all the measurements and
that gives you the highest accuracy if
if you have a meter that allows you to
do that and I take them all at the same
frequency and you want to do the
measurement at a frequency where the Q
is high and it does you don't
necessarily want to your measurement at
your operating frequency you want to do
it is a measure at a frequency where the
capacitive and resistive effects are
minimal and that a lot of times 10
kilohertz is a great frequency to run at
for power electronics sometimes 100
kilohertz
very rarely what have I done
measurements and megahertz but sometimes
that makes sense for when the inductance
values are really low Wow and that's you
have to get the frequency up high enough
to get within the range of the meter
because those your typical meter has a
50 ohm basis everything's compared to
that and if you're down in milliohms and
is two hits in the noise let's see here
okay so I already measured mention that
yeah so you really want to what I like
to do if I have a network analyzer to do
these measurements i'll do a frequency
sweep and i'll look and see you don't
have any peaking and i'll i'll do my
measurements well away from any any
resonant peaks okay so typically we can
measure inductances to at least two
significant figures and the coupling
coefficient is actually accurate two
more decimal places or significant
figures than your measurement because
there's a square root involved so I
typically want to use at least four
digits and if it's really close to one
point nine nine nine then I'm going to
want to go point nine nine nine until I
get something that isn't a nine and then
get you know two or three digits of that
and then you'll have something that
makes sense because when you put it back
in your circuit simulator these days
there's enough resolution that that can
handle this stuff and in particular if
you have really tight coupling
coefficients and you're using ltspice I
would use the alternate solver it's got
double precision compared to the regular
solver and then it just just works its
way right through it
now there's a polarity convention
uncoupling and you can define it any way
you want just by saying how i want the
voltage measurement to be notice the
same transformer can be described with a
positive coupling coefficient or a
negative coupling coefficient it's all
the same thing depending upon how you
define what is your plus and minus
polarities and so you can do it for
whatever is convenient for you now
here's where it really gets wild if
you've got a three-phase transformer in
order to describe it with dots it takes
three types of dots you can't just use
one dot you've got to have three types
and this this shows you how to do it and
the other thing is the triple product of
the couple and coefficients has to be
negative that means you can have two
positives and one- or you can have three
negatives and just for consistency I
typically will use a negative coupling
coefficient for all three and okay so
now let's start looking at the
equivalent circuits you can take two
windings and put a couple and
coefficient between them and you know
that's easy to do in spice it's set up
for that and other circuit simulators as
well and if you want to do some analysis
I found that for two windings the
cantilever model is is very handy
because like if you short this winding
here then this inductor goes away
because this is an ideal transformer and
that's the directly measurable parameter
then if you open circuit it and you
measure the total inductance here then
you just subtract this from the total
and you get that so it's really easy to
do and it's easy to write equations
around now and this is this is what I
used when I was analyzing the electronic
ballast was was this model
you know this is the derivation of it
but we won't go through that now here's
another model it's commonly used the two
leakage inductance model and this case
you've got a leakage inductance here and
the leakage inductance here and what
you've got is an over specified
situation there's only three parameters
that you need to describe this but
you've got more than that so that gives
you freedom that you can you can split
the leakage between these two any old
way you want but that will put
constraints on this ratio and on on this
inductance and and so a lot of times
people say well physically what is this
physically what is it it isn't anything
it's a figment of your imagination and
so there may be some reasons why you say
oh well this is the true magnetizing
inductance and this is the energy stored
here and then but but it isn't because
it's always comes leakage inductance
always comes as a pair you can't really
split it up between one side and the
other except arbitrarily and once you
realize that then you realize what
freedom you have and you can place and
play with things but but I like to do it
this way and that's my choice because
then I don't have to decide yeah right
so the reason that is is because you
have the freedom of choosing the turns
ratio which maybe you were going to get
to that but you now what's implicit in
your slide you didn't write write write
that yeah that's what I was why I was
trying to say here is you can you adjust
this and these formulas here if you work
through it it'll show you what it has to
be to make everything work out you can't
make it anything if you're going to make
it match the actual coupling
then there there are constraints and if
you work through it it can it can be
done I'm just saying that that you have
this extra freedom to to play around
with it if there's some reason why that
seems to be helpful and go ahead the
reason that it's helpful for a lot of
people is you can choose the
mathematical turns ratio to match the
physical turns ratio yeah and then the
linkage inductances have to go where
they need to portions of the property
right right and so that that's that's a
convenient thing to do but it doesn't
have any physical basis on how stuff
works and but I mean yeah it has the
terms right but hey things really get
interesting when you start dealing with
high leakage stuff and then you start
saying well I don't really care that I
need to put in the physical turns and
especially when you start getting into
multiple windings then you can't and in
well there's a there's a way you can do
things with three windings and beyond
that it doesn't work but you can go
beyond three windings if you use the
import model but that one assigns a
pseudo leakage inductance to every
winding but one and I'll give you a
reference on that and it's actually my
favorite model when I want to put in a
complicated model into a circuit
simulator so the main thing is there's
many many equivalent circuits but
there's only this many parameters n
times n plus 1/2 so for example a 7
winding transformer 7 times 6 it's 42
divided on 21 parameters that you have
to to measure to fully modeling this is
a really nice paper and I've got a
hyperlink to it if you if you get the PD
but it's downloadable from the
University website there and these other
two models are really quite interesting
as well but you have to have an I
Tripoli account or pay for it or
whatever but this one's free so now
let's talk about modeling with magnetic
circuits electric circuits are really
nice because kirchoff's current and
voltage laws hold when you go to do
magnetic circuits you model them with
things where kerkoff's of equations hold
also but in in a magnetic sense but in
the physical world you can't constrain
the fluxes to flow in nice clean paths
the way you can electrons so everything
ends up being much more proximate but
you can still get some fairly good
results this is like to e cores with a
big center gap and I'm going to put a
winding around this leg and a winding
around that leg and I can I can measure
up you know I can compute all of these
little reluctance paths here and i can
compute a path through the air here in
and here and model it like that the
difficulty becomes and saying well what
is the reluctance this way and in in
reality it's those all mushed out into
space but there there are people who
have come up with some fairly good
approximations sometimes the math is a
little hairy but and so an approach that
a lot of people take now is using finite
element modeling and I didn't I wasn't
really using finite element modeling
when I wrote this actually wrote this
nine years ago and since that time I've
I've had access to
a finite element modeling and got a much
better picture of what's what's going on
however I don't have permission from my
employer to add that kind of stuff into
this talk so we stick with what's
already out there but I can at least
tell you that there's a lot you can
learn from finite element modeling
anyway this kind of shows that the
technique that you would go through to
see what the self-inductance is of a
particular winding using this reluctance
model you replace all of the other
windings with with with shorts and then
you do series parallel combinations and
you can then you have to translate it
back through the turns ratio squared but
you can figure out the inductance of
every winding and the leakage inductance
is is you replace the MMF source for
each winding not be considered with a
short circuit and then replace the MMF
source for the shorted winding with an
open circuit and the idea is if you've
got a short you can't force any flux
through it oh if you have an ideal short
and so that's why it opens up in the in
the modeling here and so there's there's
a fair amount of references on this
going all the way back to the MIT book
from 1943 is the classic book on
magnetics and I've got all of these
these references you can get this on
eBay typically or one of the sites like
that if you're interested or many
libraries have it but all these are
really good good references now getting
to energy storage
the magnetic energy stored in one
inductor one half Li squared whoops
there we go so the the question then
becomes well what if I have a whole
bunch of windings and it turns out that
you can put it in matrix form and you
can calculate it what the total stored
energy is from all of the induct all of
the currents if you know the the the
coupling for them and this was actually
quite helpful to me in working with
integrated magnetic structures and
seeing where that you know what the
total energy storage was now once you
have more than two windings you put them
together there's our additional
constraints and 43 coupled inductors the
inductors are passive if you meet that
equation and it's not all that intuitive
is to wear that equation comes from but
in this paper they derive it now if
you've got more than that you can set up
a coupling coefficient matrix like this
and put into mathcad or MATLAB and you
go and you use a building function and
calculate the eigen values you didn't
even have to know what an eigenvalue is
you probably learned about it many years
ago in school and never thought about it
since some people do some people think
about that stuff but a lot of us don't
think about that much but anyway mathcad
knows how to calculate it matlab knows
how to calculate it and and basically
all of the eigen values have to be
positive or zero
and so what I wanted to do is show you a
little well before I get to that I'm
going to talk a little bit more about
this this stability stuff but some
consistency tests that you want to do
when you're doing when you're modeling a
transformer the eigenvalue test lets you
know if there are measurement errors but
it doesn't tell you where your mistake
was at least I'm not smart enough to
know how to back it out from that I only
know that there is a mistake and and and
typically I would tell you know I'd see
this and so something's wrong there and
either I'd go back and do it or tell a
technician to go back and look at it but
there are some things you can look at if
you've got magnetizing inductance is on
the same core leg then they're
approximately the ratios of those should
be approximately equal to the square of
the turns ratios and the leakage
inductance is you can do things like
shorting one whining and applying a
signal to the other winding in in spice
and you can compute the inductance that
way you can set up other various test
simulations and if you play around with
it enough you can figure out probably
what you did wrong and if you can't go
try and measure it again and I wish
there were similar way to just
troubleshoot it but but these simple
things will at least let you know that
you've done something wrong now here's
an interesting thing that you don't hear
about a lot in verse inductance matrix
and the symbol often used as gamma it's
like an L upside down so each diagonal
element is equal to the reciprocal of
the inductance of that winding when all
of the other windings are shorted
so there's a way you can you can
actually use this to find something
useful let's say you have a for winding
transformer what's the inductance of
whining one when windings three or four
are shorted but what you do is you take
your inductance matrix and you split out
the parts that you don't need and then
you compute the inverse inductance
matrix and one over that value is the
inductance of winding one when windings
three and four shorted and I found this
to be useful when working with suppliers
and you want to specify leakage
inductance is but you got this moldy
winding thing and they're not going to
go and measure every stinking linkage
inductance in there it's just too much
trouble and so what you do is maybe you
have them do groups of windings that are
shorted together and using this formula
you can come up with an idea as to where
that what the bounds for that should be
and I found this actually works out
quite nicely if you if you do all the
winding measurements carefully you go in
and do this it does predict what happens
when when you short sets of windings now
if you want to take coupling they'll a
coupled inductor model and stick it into
a set of equations that you want to you
know write equations to describe the
circuit behavior notice you're not going
to use a simulator probably the best way
to do that is modified node analysis
this is what spice uses and this is a
great book to describe exactly how you
do that now here's here's a simple
example of how to take a circuit that's
got coupling and and basically write
equations that describe the circuit you
come up with all the voltages and
and write your KCl equations and and
it's just kind of a cookbook thing you
walk your way through it and and you'll
end up with when you're all done you can
put the whole thing in into into a
matrix equation and I used this when I
was working on electronic ballast where
I had a big inductor and they had a
smaller windings that were used to to
heat the filaments on the lamps and I
could handle everything with this with
this matrix equation put it into mathcad
and and and you can you can you can
solve this equation numerically in in
mathcad or matlab obviously these
equations can get messy with more than
two windings now here's something I'm
just going to throw out dr. Millbrook
came up with a technique he called
design oriented analysis and there have
been two books written on it besides the
work that he did this one just came out
last month by Chris da basso from on
semi conductor and it came in the mail
yesterday it's a nice book and I bought
this one when it first came out back in
I don't know 2005 or something like that
and this is also a really good book what
I'm proposing is that there might be a
way to deal with multiple windings and
all a couple and coefficients using
Middlebrooks ideas for how to simplify
stuff it was extra element theorem I've
never tried it and neither of they as
near as I can tell no one's tried it
and someday I want to try it yeah you
know maybe that would something would
come of it I don't know I'm just kind of
throwing that out as a challenge if
somebody wants to do something
interesting that hasn't been done so now
I want to talk a little boy a little
more about the coupling stability and
i'm going to use mathcad and write
differential equations and show what
actually happens here so here we've got
a simple situation I've got three
coupled windings and what I'm going to
do is I'm going to assume an initial
condition on the currents and then just
let it go and see what happens how it's
something you can easily do in spice you
can set up an initial condition and
simulate it but I wanted to to see if I
could run it through with with
differential equations and and see what
happens so here's why it works you start
out with some magnetizing inductance
a--'s and inside a coupling coefficient
then I construct a coupling coefficient
matrix and i compute the eigenvalues and
they're all positive so great I know
that this is going to be a proper system
so then I construct an inductance matrix
and then I evaluate it and and I put in
the resistor these my three resistors I
just made it simple or all 10 and i put
1 amp into one winding and 0 amps into
the other two now i define a current
vector initial condition vector and then
i basically this is mike my differential
equation i can then compute an inverse
inductance matrix compute the
eigenvalues and i'm not going to go
through all this but basically you go
through these steps one at a time and
when you're all done you have three sets
of equations with
exponentials in them and what you have
to have is all of the lambdas have got
to be negative if the things going to
decay anything is positive then then
it's not going to work so I checked if
the current values in a few points then
I plotted it and you can see here the
currents in the two windings start out
at zero this one starts out at one it
decays the others build up and then they
just kind of head out for a really long
time constant but they eventually decay
20 which is just what we would expect
now then I can take this current vector
and I can define a function to compute
the stored energy and we have an initial
value stored energy and you can see over
time the stored energy in that set of
coupled windings heads towards 0 now I'm
going to make one slight change I'm
going to change this it was point 9 8
i'm going to make it point 99 I got this
example here out of a book on spice
modeling okay and I checked with the
author later on and I said you know
these values that you have in your book
if you put them in a spice that will run
and so I never tried I just pulled it
out of a hat and so anyway I go through
and compute the eigenvalues and look at
that we got a minus minus value there
and so now let's see see what happens go
through the same process convert you
know the inductance matrix right all the
differential equations and come up with
these coefficients here I've got all my
lambdas oh my some of them are positive
so let's see what that does yeah I start
out with my initial condition these are
zero and I let it go
look heads towards infinity and then
this is you take the total energy of all
of it and you can see exactly what it's
doing the energy storage starts out
positive quickly goes through 0 and the
energy storage becomes negative which
means it's putting out power and and and
so I mean this can't happen in reality
but if you put it in spice if it's not
ltspice this will go bad ltspice checks
for for the eigenvalues and if they're
if it's got a negative one in there
it'll give you a flag and that I'll brag
I told Mike engelhardt about it and he
put it in so and savor already had it
and and peace seems going to get it
because I talked with the founder of
peace summit at APEC and explain this to
them so this won't be quite as much of a
problem in the future we can get you
know I can we get pspice to do it pspice
doesn't listen I talked to look closer
at pspice and it's hard to get them to
do anything but but I haven't given up
so anyway I'm kind of gone I've gone
through all the slides does anybody have
have any questions no questions yeah you
said that the K value you multiply all
the tables together oh that's only if
you have a three-phase transformer and
you're doing the couplings between three
windings on different legs
and so the question would be why why is
why does it have to be that way yeah
let's see if I can go back if we can
find that basically if you look at this
and you say all right I'm going to
define the coupling between this one and
this one as as positive if you look at
the the flux the weight the way they go
around these paths one of them is going
to have to be negative you just can't
you just can't make it work out if you
trace the flux bounced around that's
really and you could add more windings
on here but the three or more legs but
three is a common situation we run into
war I'll should be naked all right I
can't be negative so with four you'd
have to get it get it gets more
complicated so like with any set of
three out of the four I know that the
triple product has to be negative but
I'd have to sit down and think about it
to say what what it would have to be
it's not I don't have that off the top
of my head maybe nine years ago I could
have told you but I haven't thought
about that one in a long time anyway so
thanks for coming and I just wanted to
say I'm really like to get the power
electronics chapter going again and if
anybody has suggestions for topics or
speakers then just just let me know and
we'll we'll see what we can do I'm also
interested if if people like the six to
seven time frame when I was in Colorado
we did seven to eight I'm just out of
show of hands here who prefers early
okay who prefers seven okay
630 huh okay and your name is okay
thanks Roger so yeah well in and I've
been thinking about you know people are
located in different parts of the area
we may want to move the meeting
locations around I know when I was in
Colorado we had three three locations
that we rotated between we got a
different crowd and each one so anyway
thanks and I will be in touch with
people by email if you'll be in touch
with me then we'll see what we can get
rolling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
