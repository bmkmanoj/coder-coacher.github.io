hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
let's get started so few people here in
the room guys you're missing some pizzas
here we have for you anyways so welcome
to the tech talk for up for office I am
Amal nori and i'm here with garrett we
are both pms on the app's fur off his
team and now now the new name of the
team is developer platform and we are
really excited to be here with you guys
to share you know which are you how
basically how to create apps for office
you know using this new tool technology
so before I get started I want to know
everyone in the room have you ever tried
to build an app for office before you
know what the nums but what's another
office huh okay that's great actually so
let me I'm going to start well you know
produce this session it's actually
pretty straightforward I mean I'm going
to talk to you about what it's an app
for off in the first place and for that
I'm going to show you a few demos of
what's an app for office said you get it
I mean looking at an example i think is
the greatest way to learn what's an app
for office and then afterwards I'm going
to do in terms of intro and going to the
introduction to three basic parts of my
presentation is divided in three parts
the first one is about how to set up
your environment to create apps then i'm
going to show you what what's exactly
what kinds of apps you can create and
finally i'm going to tell you how you
can publish your app to the marketplace
if you can actually have a marketplace
you know a very similar to what we have
for the phones or windows marketplace
but now you can you can also blow the
office apps so let me go you go through
a
a quick down all right yeah hello okay
cool so let's start let's get started by
by showing you what sign up for office
so let me go ahead and open for example
excel so I'm going to show you a very
cool demo that we that we preferred you
know for the for the elections you know
my account here so law says you notice
now in office 2013 you can actually be
logged in with an account it can be your
enterprise account or it can be like
something like a hotmail account let me
switch that now my hotmail account and I
can acquire apps in the market place and
then use them inside office and one
example of that is the what the election
tracker app let me show you how it works
so this is actually a worksheet that has
a map of the US and it's actually
showing in a graphic way you know the
results of the election this is a map
that obviously doesn't actually start of
the box if you if you have if you play
you know with the charge that are in
Excel today so so one of the ways that
we want to improve the office experience
is by creating these types of charts
that are not available out of the box
and our of the main specific nature so
what we have here is actually a
spreadsheet that it's connecting to
services is connected to some you know
trust trustworthy polls that the polls
were you know giving giving information
about the elections and daily basis and
then on the main page of the of the app
you know the chart was actually colored
either blue or red depending on the on
the pole that is and then they have this
control here that you can actually see
the trends of how the election was you
know performing over time you know so
from September you can see that actually
most interesting state i think was the
florida state which means sometimes was
red sometimes got loose and then for
example in october it was red and then
finally ended up blue you have a very
nice visualization of what was going on
so this map what you see here it's a nap
it's actually a nap and in this there
are three types of apps this type of
five representatives our apps are can be
dropped in the in natural in the content
of a document it's a really cool example
let me show you another types of
application so let me go up and open
Excel and there are made the types of
different apps you can create and one of
my goals today's to walk you through the
types of apps you can you can actually
do so this app is about importing data
so there are a few services in the web
that are really good you know to get
data about many different types know for
example the Asia racial data Mart team
it's exposing in in the web services to
get for example the crime data per state
so you can go and let me show you how
that works so we have an app called
crime data so as you can see the
experience here we certain app is we
have in the insert menu we have a rerun
that it's up for office this is where
the apps are going to show up when you
click on it you're going to see this
dialogue that we call the insertion
dialogue the assertion dialogue is
actually listing apps that are located
in many different you know catalogs or
categories that we call them for example
in my app stop these are all the apps
that I have acquired in the marketplace
I go to the marketplace acquire them it
would show up here I can also have
internal catalogues of apps so this is
our apps are deployed sharepoint and
then in an only stand then I i I'm able
to office is able to go to that list and
grab the you know the apps are present
there which is the case for this example
so if i go ahead and click and click on
crime data you're going to see that at a
spring up this is a different shape to
support and it's not content is the best
thing I've is shown as a testing here
and then I know I'm able to do actually
here
you know go and like this page like
completely watching today and this this
circle is charged knows how to get crime
data from several years now I'm not
interested in a specific City I want to
get all just just all the cities in
Washington state of the in the year two
thousand six and when I click on insert
crime data what is going to happen here
is that I'm going to go to date to the
azure data map service service collect
all that information and then insert it
into a table in Excel and I want you to
see that patterns that we have here now
we have patterns that are like for
example inserting data into the
worksheet reacting to events and stuff
like that and then the cool thing about
apps is that you can use obscene or in a
composable fashion so that for example
you can actually charge or for something
going to hide this column here you can
do you can do things like once I have
these data here I have all the city's
population and violence and crime rates
I can actually for example select a few
series here and then i can i can
actually insert another app for example
i want to see how this looks in them up
so a map is noah is not a chart that
it's available out of the box in excel
so therefore there's an app that
supports you know charging in a map that
actually was built by the mink Bing Maps
team me when I insert that up you're
going to see here that being map chart
is going to be published this is a
workbook I'm going to be activated
active in a few seconds and then then I
can you know charge some of the data
that is here oh look here's a big mouth
chart I'm going to select the few states
or a few series and populations you know
from Washington State and I'm just going
to go ahead and click on these blood
locations button here so this upward is
going to be doing is that it's going to
be this disambiguation there's another
city named like this in Alabama but you
get the idea no so basically I'm i need
to disambiguate the city names but you
can see that if I specified in our city
and some information I can actually
represent that
a chart and how this very nice views
inside excel so finally I want to show
you more apps that you can use in other
office solutions for example if I go to
work I want to show you one very cool
app that we have here that it's actually
an intense experience of how to use bing
bing images you know to insert images
into Word documents if we go go ahead
and go again to the apps insert apps for
office menu here you can go to the bing
image image search app I can insert it
here and then this apps knows how to you
know how to go and fetch images from
being a bit slow today you know what's
going on okay well there you go so you
once you have the app activated here you
can actually search for I don't know
this case I'm going to search for a car
I'm going to keep it on the search
button here and then you can see that I
have images of porches but then the cool
thing about this this app is because you
can do advanced think north of example
you go to the filter to the filter
options you can actually be specific and
say you know what I just want to filter
to yellow porches so what that's going
to happen is that that and kind of
filter is going to be applied and then
you can actually have these images here
and then you can insert them into your
document if you click on the plus sign
right here
there you go well this is just this is
just a search engine this is the Bing
search engine i don'ti yeah it's
actually being now this app that you're
seeing here this is this amazing use of
these technologies you can extend in
very easy and interesting ways office
it's it's just HTML and JavaScript okay
so that's so that's why we we are very
happy to claim to the world that if you
are a web developer you are now also
another developer which is a very
awesome proposition okay so then you go
back to my presentation and tell you
more details about how this works i'm
going to show you just a few slides to
set up some content about what exactly
enough profit so from developer
developer what's an app for office so
you can think about the nap for office
to be you know a what we call an iframe
inside office it's an I friend when you
can show a web page and that iframe can
be actually located in a past ping like
here or you can be also content in the
case of Excel that's it you know it's a
web page that is showing up inside
office so therefore another office has
two very very important components the
first one is a web page and this web
page can have actually this can be any
web technologies you know about know it
can be rich client side or server side
so this could be an aspx page or a PHP
or your favorite web technology here and
then you're going to you're going to
have this page deployed to some web
server right it's going to be somewhere
on the internet the internet or intranet
and be as well this can also be used
inside an enterprise environment then
you're going to have the second part of
an app for office is what we call an app
manifest enough money if it is an xml
file that describes in a very basic way
what's the app and what do you think it
describes their it describes exactly
what applications it can show up so you
can say it's going to be rhenium in Word
or Excel or PowerPoint you can also
configure it it's going to be at a
spring up or is going to be a Content up
or if it's going to be a mailbox up
which is the third type of app we have
and basically describes how this app is
going to get activated and it also has
an ID that uniquely identifies the app
under on the store what's the store I
show you more or less an assertion
dialogue that there was the surface
there this concept well basically this
XML file its going to get deployed to
what we call an app catalog the app
catalog is you know just a repository of
apps and this can be three basically
three types of Corrado's the first one
is what we call a market though we call
the marketplace a public marketplace we
have a page that i'm going to show you
at the end of my presentation see how
you can actually publish your apps and
sell them there I probably make some
money out of it then we have a
sharepoint sharepoint based catalog this
is just the least the sharepoint list of
has the xml files and finally you have a
file share
just can be a simple of doing you don't
require SharePoint for this you can
actually enable a file sharing your
network and you know drop the XML files
or you'll be set up up and running so
that's it it's a very simple concept
HTML manifest file both are deploy with
the web server error once our report
deployed to an app catalog then you'll
have this ok so this can be as simple as
you know hosting the wikipedia page here
and you'll have it in two minutes you
have an up ready to go but then when we
were designing this technology we said
it will be awesome if we can actually
provide some interaction with the word
on word documents with Office documents
the way to achieve this be a what we
call it an office that but the other
office JavaScript API also known as
office Jas so officer Diaz is a
javascript-based library and actually
you can use to interact with document
content and i'm going to show you in a
few seconds what exactly you can do with
it ok otherwise feel free to pop
questions you know any time no steps to
create your app so first of all you need
to set up your environment what are the
dev tools that you need start creating
apps and the proposition here we have
two ways of trading up the first one is
through an office 365 def tenets also
known as Napa and the second one is
wrong with visual studio well Napa not
by its basically the name we gave to the
visually on the web version right you
just need a browser to start working on
it immediately and then you have the
visual studio offer you can actually
download visual 30 2012 install the
visuals to your tools for office sorry
with the office tools and then you have
all the project templates for creating
apps ok so once you cup your environment
setup the next step is to actually call
your app I'm going to show you what you
can do what exactly what types of
features we are exposing in the API and
finally you have to publish your up to
the marketplace and again it can be the
public marketplace the SharePoint
catalog or the file share i'm going to
show you the most interesting one for
everybody which is the market
now depth at office.com is actually your
friend so this is a web page that is has
all information that we require to start
creating apps and it shows you all the
needs of the gritty details of each of
these steps basically so I'm going to
start my presentation today by going to
these website actually yes we have a
certification process exactly you submit
your app it gets validation pipeline is
if we verified among other things that
for example you're sending the right
icons of the right sizes that you are
supplying you know images of previews of
your app and that the app actually works
and it's not showing you know
inappropriate content if you follow the
the checklist checklist it should be an
easy process okay so when you go to Deb
the office com you actually end up with
this page of he'll show you you know
it's optimized for first time users it's
getting you step-by-step how you can
start doing stuff one of the main things
here is to start the start menu he's
going to tell you step-by-step how you
can get your developer site and so this
is basically a process in which you can
try it for free now right now we're
making a few changes here and that's why
we some mistakes on the registration
process but if you go to this page and
you follow these steps actually view you
as Microsoft employees have you no
access to to the M to an msdn
subscription and if you have an msdn
subscription you can actually get the
developer side for free or else you can
actually try it free here and you get a
30-day trial and after what you're going
to get charged with something like
ninety nine dollars one box per year but
Middlemarch it will be available in
middle of March that's a little point
it's like a few weeks from now it's a
couple of weeks from now okay so the
idea is to go here and go on and say try
it for free and then you're going to go
through
a process here that that well I am
currently logged-in that's why this is
showing this message here well basically
at the end of the process what is going
to happen here is that you're going to
end up with a site that looks more or
less like this remember my name you go
to the side Oh expanding with a
different user so where's my jump to my
here so this is the holdup so let's go
to my sharepoint site is here
and then i have here my credentials my
password there but I don't care because
it's a pesticide you can use it if you
want there you go so you're going to end
up with a site like this so this is
actually napa the visual studio version
on the web and here you can start
creating your apps it's very simple so
so when you when you have your dev
tenants you're going to get a lot of
things here this is the process of takes
around 20 minutes but basically we're
going to to when you the end of the
process that you'll have a site that has
exchanged it has SharePoint has a link
then it has you know you have an email
accounts and its provision with all of
these things that you need to create
apps and then you can actually install a
developer site I have access to the napa
tools or the visuals three on the web so
this is the entry point for that
experience here and when you go there
this is the it's actually napa i will
show you really quickly how you can
create an app here so here if you click
it click on add new project you're going
to see all the types of project you can
create we're going to focus the content
of the discussion today on apps for or
or office not up for sharepoint going to
be the demo 1 2 3 i'm going to create an
app for excel this is an app like for
example the you know the the US map that
i show you earlier today with the
election data the content up in excel
and what you're going to see here is
that you got you're going to have a
bunch of files you're going to have a
well actually two very important file
which is the HTML page you know this is
actually the home page of your app and
it has some content has some some
important things that are already
included like for example for example
this line here it's pointing to the CDN
where the offices of JS file is it's a
basically the javascript library and
then it has you know
a few buttons here that you can do some
out-of-the-box interesting features here
like and if you click on on on the run
project what is going to happen is that
it's going to package your solution it's
going to deploy it into your sharepoint
depth n end so it's going to put the
manifest on the on the SharePoint lists
and then it's going to launch the Excel
web app application so you can start
debugging your solution as you can see
here I'm going to open Excel web app and
you'll see a content tab that it's going
to have a very simple like hello world
app already there when you click on set
data all the data that is this text box
here you can actually then actually
write the sample data into the workbook
very simple or you can read from it when
you click on the get data button you're
going to get the current selection from
here you can start creating your up now
now it's actually a starting point and
it's a good news formula for nap I said
its evolving right very fast so we're
deploying updates here so not so long
time ago just to be that we didn't have
for example intelligence capability and
now we do have them you know you can
type office dot is that obviously the
actually entry point for the JavaScript
API you can actually hear type office
complex you can access to all our object
model and then you know document and so
on and so forth just awesome actually I
find out this this morning that we this
is already supported on and it's great
because we're trying to make this
experience great and we're adding
features as we as we speak well yeah
here is that there are other things you
can do in Napa only Codding your app
that you saw here but you can actually
also if you want to have like a richer
you know development environment you
want to have access to TFS you want to
develop on your visual studio project in
the rich clients you can actually do
that by clicking on this button here
he's going to what is going to happen is
if your app is going to get packaged and
it's going to going to be it's going to
be opened in visual studio on your box
which I'm not going to believe me it
works but I'm going to do it right now
because I don't have the latest version
installed so that's basically I mean
well you can actually there are other
features here like for example sharing
your project so for example you can be
working with with some buddies and in a
project and you can this is a way of
sharing sharing your application with
other person when you click on this
button you're actually going to create a
copy and share it you know with people
carried basically what's going to happen
here is you're going to create a link
that you can actually share with people
and then they have access to your site
and your solution yeah sure yeah anapa
so there are many things that are
supporting visual studio rich client
that are not supported in a pilot for
example TFS the key foundation services
if you have a large team of developers
you want to keep track of issues and
something like we have nice of the pro
to do so that for example is not
supported in Napa nap is limited to
obscure office and apps for sharepoint
and for example if you want to be bought
debug are rich client version it's to be
complicated you know it needs to be web
client base and and but that doesn't
mean there is not a powerful tool if you
want to create apps for office I think
it's you have you have more than you
need here it depends on what you like
more right which will three offers many
many other answer the question ok ok so
the Contra part of this is to actually
use visual studio let me switch back to
my developer server right here and I'm
going to show you how this looks like on
the rich clients if I open visual studio
again on dev the roof is calm there's a
download section and when you go to that
section you can actually download trial
of visuals for your 2012 as well as
office 2013 so you can actually install
it on your on your laptop and create
rich apps by using all the power of of
the rich client visual studio so here if
you go to the file new project options
you're going to see that when you
install the office tools they're going
to be a few project templates for
creating apps Oh for example here I can
create an app for office if I go to
option SharePoint app I'm going to
create an app here there is I don't know
45 and when I click on OK and then
visual c is going to start creating you
know how it's going to ask you what what
type of apps you want to create if it's
at a spring up content up or mail app
this case I'm going to do another spring
up for Excel and as you can notice here
I can actually target many applications
if I am creating for example art ask me
out that's a very important concept in
our platform because we have the vision
to write your application once and use
it anywhere that means that your app is
going to run not only on excel but it
comes to run outside next word and
powerpoint a project and not only on the
rich client versions also another
platform which client for the web client
and in the future you can potentially
run them on and on the ipad version of
offices so what I'm going to do here is
a similar example as I dating in a pub
of this time in visual studio and I'm
going to actually show you more or less
the project structures or creating here
so the visuals who is quitting behind
the scenes these files that I need to
work with on my solution and as soon as
it finishes on the solution Explorer go
and have the similar setup files up to
what the file that I show
unova obvious you can do it I don't know
why you so so lazy today there you go so
you have you have two projects here one
of the bride's house actually is a
manifest file remember I talked to you
about the xml file that describes the
app very simple XML you can see it here
as an ID version provider names and then
as you can see here because it's
actually one of the most important
settings here that remote where's the
stores located what is the app is going
to be what is the URL of the application
and then you also have here set up
things you know you have the script you
have the opposite of jes library here we
provide you the javascript file that
includes you know the logic of the
application and we also include you an
HTML file you have access for example
here to a design be you and something
that you don't have enough as well known
you have like the UI designer stuff and
here you can actually do the start and
you can actually have you know the
regular visual studio experience you can
have for example you can you can define
breakpoints and stuff like that you go
here you go to demo is on the set data
I'm going to I'm gonna head like here a
break point and then when I go back to
my application when I the five
experience it activates the app in this
case is up t start a spring up and it's
going to be more or less the same load
here i'm going to write data I'm going
to it and set data and as you can see
you have all the debugging experience
capabilities so this is a method that
you that we use to actually select data
one of the functionalities of the API
you know select insert day in the
current selection is on through calling
this method and when i call it actually
you can see in excel here I'm writing
the okay so this is the first the first
step to get your environment up and
running now
out let me continue with my presentation
and i want to tell you more details
about the other things you can do with
the API so so things you should know
here is some basic hints is that apps
are nothing but web app web applications
so you can use all although if you know
how to use CSS files html5 JavaScript
rest rest calls XML you know Oh data in
all the web technology asp net so you
can use those technologies in apps now
we are blocking a few of them you know
for security reasons for example you
cannot use activex control because
activist controls but it's a potential
threat okay now when you're creating
apps you need to consider that app
creation as the same challenges and
problems as regular web development what
that means that for example we are
subject to issues such as the same arene
same domain policy so you are going to
call a service from your application it
needs to be in the same domain otherwise
it's a security risk and is blocked by
the browser that happens in web
development is a very common problem and
it happens as well on apps so the good
news is that we have you have we have
the same solutions to those problems so
for example for a cross domain issues
one of the solutions is to actually
write server-side code or to use
technology such as JSON p or other
javascript ways of avoiding cross domain
and you can use those same solutions in
apps as well so now the other thing is
most of the API as you're going to see
in a second it's of icing nature that
that that because as i was telling you
this platform is designed to work both
on the rich clients and on the web
platforms and we don't want to have like
a sink model in which we can potentially
you know freeze the UI and provide like
a bad experience for
developers and of course in web
technologies you're always subject to
calling a service and waiting for
sometimes or it returns and in the
meantime you want to make sure that
you're not blocking the UI so that's why
most of the most important methods of
epi are facing nature another important
thing about office ojs is that you
should not think about if you are for
example a vhdl developer and are used to
have access to a well you know really
rich set of objects to interact with the
p's application that's not the case in
the office of jes obvious obvious is not
a library that it's used for example
deeper office automation office of the
assets it's designed for data
consumption as you see the scenario that
i showed you at the beginning know for
example the map this is reading data
from a table is reacting to some events
of happening as a result of interacting
with that data but it's not not it's not
you know interacting at a very specific
cell level or specific objects of Excel
now we are interested in consumption
consumption of that data and this
release and finally we have to make it
consistent with all obvious applications
you know the vision of right ones run
everywhere you can run your app that's
something that doesn't happen today with
the current models the office
development usually what happens today
is you create a BST or are they
targeting a specific application with a
specific object model in this case we're
trying to move those buyers away and we
want you want the same up to be able to
run cross paths and here's a 22 more
details so obviously is it's actually a
library that exposes many important
objects the first one is well office for
those of you that are jquery developers
you know the office object is similar to
the dollar sign in jquery the root
object that exposes the functionality to
the rest of the api and the first object
there is that what we call a context
object and a context object that the
meaning of that object is when your app
gets activated on the office
applications so it's
some context is available to that app
for example that app can be activated in
an outlook for instance if that's the
case then it's going to highlight some
relevant objects such as such as a
mailbox object in the other hand if your
app is activated in Excel Word or
PowerPoint so what we call a document
centric application you're going to have
access to the document object here and
this of it provides a common common
common access to functionalities such as
reading and writing to the active
selection what the damage that I show
you when you create an app a hello world
depends to a concept known as bindings
so a binding this is like a permanent
relationship with a section of a
document like for example think of this
like for example how charts work we do
sir the chart into Excel you actually
select some data that is going to be
associated with the chart what the
charge is basically charting is the
written dance this is the same concept
save you if you for example in the in
the US election map that map was bound
to some specific a table of data in
Excel so that I can kind of refresh and
the data changes and detect other other
things so a custom XML parts is also
another another functionality that we're
exposing on the EPI and it's used to
access you know XML xml data islands
that are present in the document and we
also expose you know what we call a
setting subject so this is like a
property bag that you can use to store
settings of the app like for example if
you have a background color or color of
your chart and you want to make sure
that the next time the document opens
and activate the app the pillory
selected by the user is persisted then
you can save it as a setting and restore
it when the opposite is activated again
so my last slide here about
functionalities are that there are three
types of apps but I told you hear it
content apps testing apps or Maalox apps
and on the 15 release you can see that
for example testing apps are supported
in Word Excel PowerPoint project
content apps on this release are only
supported in Excel and Excel web access
is the web version of Excel and mailbox
is only supported in outlook or outlook
web access one of the goals of my team
of this release is to actually feel this
table with with X and make make sure
that we are available in all those
platforms sorry not those applications
okay so what are the types of things you
can do with the API so for example you
can read outlook item properties so if
your application is obligation is that
type of application I need to show you
let me show you really quickly add them
up here from mailbox applications
exactly like the link wins like the lint
wind linkedin let me go back to Napa
because here i have a very cool example
of a nap well it's not very cool buddy a
good example so i'm returning my
projects here and / example i have a
mail app demo here so the app the app
see now look behave a bit different than
in other applications in this release
because as you were saying right now
this apps are optimized to the reading
email experience so that means that for
example when you receive an email and
the email has you know some entities
some well-known entities we actually
activate the app so they are actually
application is activated as a result of
finding and specific entities in a
message or example telephone numbers
addresses you know URL so for example of
you if you send a URL with a youtube
video we activate an appt with the the
actual video not gonna be just a URL
that so you can see it right there in
the injure your your mailbox so what we
do here is we actually let me this is an
application that i created i'm going to
run it what is going to happen here
is this app is going to get deployed to
to exchange so remember that I tell you
that your depth tenant has exchanged
sharepoint and many other things so this
outlook apps are deployed to SharePoint
to SharePoint mailbox so what is doing
right now adays I already deployed a
solution here so I am on installing the
previous version and refreshing it with
a new release and then at the end of the
process Nava is going to open outlook
web access and I'm going to be able to
debug my application by by showing some
some information here so what this app
is doing is very simple so if I
configure the settings of this up to get
activated if there was a phone number on
the mail mail message if the if the mail
base is the mailman if the mail has a
phone it's going to be the app can be
activated and then shows you the phone
number that was selected yeah when the
users install the app so you go when you
acquire a nap in the marketplace you
selected there and there's a click that
says like install something like that
and what happens with may log mailbox
apps that those apps are installed on
your mailbox on exchange and yes
and the white taking so long to reply
give it another try the meantime I'm
going to continue with each other and
uploading it takes up a few seconds the
first time you do it and then subsequent
times it's more fast but in the interest
of saving a bit of time let me let me
continue with my presentation so these
are the other things you can do with the
API so as I was telling you in the
outlook case you can actually identify
entities inside an email you can use the
API to you know retrieve the collection
of phone numbers or addresses or we have
like a set of pre-built entities as you
can actually choose out of the box they
will work or you can actually create
your own you can actually defined a
regular expression as you can say things
like you know if you have that format of
numbers that social security number so
I'm interested on that and i would like
to admire or that would be customer
calls or it could be racist or it could
be whatever you you may you may need so
with API you can actually write code to
extract those entities reading and
writing to active selections I showed
you more or less how this works there is
more details around this functionality
here and I'm going to go into the
details now but there are power powerful
features such as for example writing not
only text you can actually write dollar
format like tables you can write HTML
you can write ups open xml like that
document level selection change selected
change event so we have an eventing
model that works both at the document
level so every time you select content
in the document we actually trigger what
we call a selection change event so the
scenario here is that for example you
have a dictionary or a reference app
that goes and looks for Wikipedia
entries and every time the user select
content on the document you trigger you
know the selection or the translation of
those tears
I'm going to let me show you an example
of how that works so I have here a app
start a nap there you go well this is
the mail app sorry guys so right now it
launched on the web access so here's at
the email account of my deaf tenant and
as you can see here I have a mail that
says hey please give me a call and i
have my phone number here so that what
that trigger is that the mail app so
these things here are applications that
that like our apps that i can actually
use for example the linkedin up it's
used because it identified me as a
linkedin contacts if i go and open that
app it's going to go up and lick teen
and i can show the linkage data here as
you can see here I that's my picture of
LinkedIn okay so this is very cool and
you can actually provide your
credentials on for example if you want
to book one of your colleagues send you
an email and is part of LinkedIn you can
actually add it to your contacts and
here under stuff like that my mail demo
obvious as i told you is not as cool as
this one but it provides you with for
example i am writing here that the phone
number that was found you can actually
think how you can use this you can
actually identify a phone number and
probably expose here a way of initiating
like a skype call or a link called do
interesting stuff like that we have also
addresses so we can identify addresses
here this is the address to the party
here is a bing maps no letting them up
it's recognizing that there is an
address on this email and as a result of
that is actually charting work if tori
is going to be it's going to be very
close to here so so used to give you an
idea of how this works i have here an
item that the source code that how it
works is that i can get a reference to
the item that mailbox item when the app
gets activated i get access to the item
in this case I mail item
I can start reading things like for
example the subject the from line the
two line and here i configure this up to
actually read the phone numbers so I
time there's a get entities method that
returns a collection in this case of the
phone numbers that were found on this
message and then I can use that
collection to actually do whatever logic
I need to do in this case I'm just
showing you the message but as you can
see here if I go to properties the
settings for mail apps you can actually
define activation room this is what you
define where your app is going to get
activated for example here it's a set of
here already out of the box you know
entities that we can find for example
meeting suggestion tasks so for example
there's a there's a very interesting
feature that we added this product as a
result of some research we can identify
some words to infer that that someone is
asking you to meet with them you can
actually say meeting suggestion and you
can expose actions related to that
meeting the same way task know someone
asked you to do some task for them you
can actually identify those patterns
addresses URLs phone numbers email
address or contact and then you can
create your your your your own if none
updates feel none of these fit the bill
then you can actually create your
regular expression you have to provide
here your regular expression syntax and
then that is only they know it's going
to get activated then you can have
access to it by using the identity okay
pretty cool sure
now that's an out of the box that's an
out of the box feature he's not enough
it's not a nap oh yeah the question was
when when you're sending an email in
Maui you now looking in all the web
access and you're not asserting an
attachment or north nope no capturing
for example the subject okay yeah yeah
that again the question is if you're
sometimes in another what you're typing
see the attachment and some of that
suggests you today you're not you're not
adding the attachment yet so we're going
to have some the answer to the question
is no that's not an app that's out of
the box feature what we are planning on
adding you know more of these features
with attachments on the next releases
where I was okay so we have a few
minutes left here so I'm going to I'm
going to run you through the concept
that you can do and actually this
something that you can actually find it
will find a few that that i want to show
you specifically but other things you
can do if you are working for example in
Word or PowerPoint is ok you can
actually get the whole document and the
picture that we try to implement here
our services like for example remote
printing you may be able to have an app
like FedEx Office was building an app
that you can actually print remotely to
your closest fedex location like for
example I want to print 1 million copies
of this flyer oh so you can actually do
that but the feature that is required s
obviously to get the whole document so
you can get the whole document and you
can get using API to get it either as
text or as a binary binary file you can
send it over the wire to a printing
service or whatever service you need and
there's a concept that is super critical
for the platform there is the bindings
concept and this is this is how we
achieve you know the parity across
applications that you can bind to office
commonality objects such as tables or
just plain texts or other things so once
you establish a binding you actually
have access to more services and I want
to show you a quick demo of what i mean
by that these are the mother is is
actually important so i have a demo here
it's precoded and i'm going to show you
very quickly how that works i have an
appt i'm going to show you how it works
and then i'm going to i'm going to show
you the code basically what this is all
about this i'm going to show you what
what are the types of bindings and you
can create how you can create those
bindings and then how can you have
access to specific services of those so
let me write some data here
I put here January a month yeah that
we're exposing some cascading style
sheets so you can actually look and feel
the same way as office but those are not
updated automatically unfortunately in
Excel you can have things like named
ranges no examples here if I navigate to
this name you can see that sorry about
that but this is a ballad reference in
Excel so so many things here you can
actually uh let me sir the table here CD
bellevue redmond yellow okay this is
going to be a table let me stir the
table here one column and three rows now
i combined so to the way it works is
think about how charts work no so you
actually can select data and insert the
chart and it's going to show you some
bars or whatever charge you selected so
you can actually keep here to bind to
selection and what i'm doing is i'm
showing you know just the results of the
of my direction here what is the data
that is that is part of the binding you
can actually bind also by prompt you
this type of binding is that you from
the user to select some data and also
say a select some data to charge or
something like that just again apparent
that we see in charts in excel so you
select the data here and you click on ok
and as you can see i'm getting the 10
each other but then you want to create
bindings without depending on the user
selection so the way to do that is you
can actually bind to named item to the
feature that we know us trying to named
item and here I'm binding to this hub
hard code here to bind to the tape to a
matrix name the range name expensive
that is this one I'm able to get the
data from it and finally you can
actually bind the table sorry ah this
one job role is popular some work sorry
about that then I can establish a
binding to a table and as I was telling
you once you're bound to some data here
you can actually get the data of that
binding said the data changes if you
want plus additional functionality like
for example you can subscribe to you can
add columns for example in this case I
bound to this table and I cannot call
them Street I cannot browse I can
subscribe to selection change events
like for example if I I want to
determine when that when the user is
selecting a specific row or sell or
ranges of cells inside this table that
outside just inside of this table and so
you can have complete control of what
the user is selecting side of it so
that's like a primer to how bindings
work ah so that's an important concept
and I'm gonna rub I hate to do this
quickly but what I have to wrap up my
presentation at this point those are
this is information that i can actually
you can actually see and on the website
just wanted to let you know what you can
do here the storing settings is selling
subject that you can actually get on set
data to eat they described in a few
minutes ago and then costume xml parts
have a few slides here that let's show
you
what's what's cost on external part so
it happens to be that if you up if you
crack open a word document a docx file
is nothing that what a zip file that
contains you know a bunch of XML files
inside of it one of those one of those
files you can actually be a folder here
it's custom XML you can drop XML files
there and then the beauty here is you
can actually map some of the elements of
or attributes of this XML file that is
part of the file into you I constructs
in a word document you can actually map
for example the customer to the customer
right there or to the project or to a
table of information you have repetitive
structure so content controls you can
achieve that by by inserting controls
and then mapping the content controls to
specific elements here under control is
basically like a text box inside or word
document and you know with the API you
can actually ultimate you know adding or
deleting custom external parts getting
getting upsetting nodes or actually
describes events and when the notes are
added or deleted you know you can
manipulate basically XML using our API
very powerful feature ah custom internal
parts so this is actually a map of to
summarize what I discuss here what you
can do with the API these are all the
functional areas of the EPI versus
what's available currently in the
platform you can see that word has
almost every selects you know standing
getting data table matrix as HTML
getting the whole document bindings
Excel doesn't support set data as HTML
or XML or you cannot get the whole
document but you can actually create
bindings and settings and so on and so
forth the idea that I want to tell you
right now is that we are actually the
investments that we are going to do in
the future are around so supporting
these these functionalities in more
applications we have scenarios that
require it and we also plan to have more
functional area so that you can create
more types of applications okay so let's
publishing your app so there is a the
first question that many people asked
about this is where should I host my app
I need a place to host it either i don't
know GoDaddy or if i have my own web
server out there for Microsoft employees
this is actually a very easy decision
the recommendation here is to upload it
to usher because if you go to http
subscriptions you will see that there's
a Microsoft employee you have a and
you're entitled to a natural
subscription so you can actually get it
all this day in it you have in current
computer hours to small VMs five
databases you know enough for getting
you started and play with this if you go
to web sweb site windows azure comms
actually I'd like to do this demo but I
don't have time to do it but it's a very
simple task to actually create a side
and then upload your you can actually
export the profile from your assure
website into Visual Studio and then from
within visual studio you can actually
publish your apps into windows are in a
very easy way and then finally you can
go to the once you're done creating your
app you can go to the cellar dashboard
to the cellar dashboard website to
actually publish your application so let
me show you a little bit of detail there
so this is our this is a this is the
seller dashboard when you go to the
website you're going to see that you
have a UI that looks like this no and if
you want to create a new are you want to
sell your note your new up you're ready
to deploy it I want to show you what's
moral is the process of you need to go
through i'm going to go ahead and login
my account i'm not going to tell you my
password but the idea is that you know
once once you go there with your with
your user and password come on way so
slow today there you go
they have my I have an app that I
sometime I gonna publish it's an urban
dictionary app but i can i'm going to
edit the draft and you morally show you
what is required to publish your app so
first of all you need to provide an appt
title we provide the logo quality for
the app this Louis needs to be of a
specific size or was it gets rejected 30
to 90 96 x 96 big cells and then here
you have to upload your xml file when
you create your app you remember that
you're creating and manifest this is
where you upload that for your manifest
that's all we need you know for
publishing an application and then you
can actually say if this if this is
going to be like a trial application you
can actually enforce that you can say a
your you get your getting this
application for free during the next
three weeks or so and you can you can
enabled such types of scenarios then you
can actually add a short description on
a long description and you can add
screenshots and again the screenshot
needs to be a specific size you cannot
have up to 5 screenshots of have your
app works you need to provide links for
your documentation if you have an end
user License Agreement you need to
provide it here subchannel and then
after you're done with that you can
actually do the pricing thing you can
actually say all this up is going to be
for free of my app it's going to be I'm
going to going to sell it by some amount
you can actually go from 149 box to one
thousand dollars and that's it so you
can actually save it as drop put it by
you put it for free now that's it once
you're ready you can actually submit
your app and then is going to start a
validation process and as you know
people here at mega so we're going to
start by dating your app to make sure
that it's not showing inappropriate
content that it works properly and stuff
like that everything looks great then
you will be published in the marketplace
pretty much is my friends how do you get
your money people like meeting web okay
so the summary for
question today is well I'm early show
you how to set up your environment I
show you the dirt like basically two
flavors to create apps the first one is
to use the office 365 dev tenant napa
and the other one is to use visual
studio with office tools you can
actually you're good to go to start
creating your app the second stage of
your process is to coat your app and
here actually actually more or less you
know that the different feature artists
that we have on the API and what types
of apps you can create what is the
functionality that is exposed in which
endpoints and finally once you have your
coolest up ever you're able to publish
it to the marketplace and I show you how
to use the seller dashboard to do it the
marketplace there are two different
experience that are well documented in
our help publishing SharePoint or two
files here in case you are in a new
enterprise scenario finally I have few
links that are that you guys may found
useful so the the FT program is located
there they developed for office that
side is going to be going to offer you
information all the details you need to
know as a Microsoft employee and how to
start creating apps what are the rules
and so on and so forth then we have a
jammer group so we have a if you search
in jammer if you like to use Yammer and
you can go on and search office and
sharepoint developer you're going to see
their information and that we are
publishing there to keep to keep
internal social exposure depth at
office.com is your premier way of
getting help so if you go there you're
going to find all the information that I
gave you today plus common cases a lot
of examples and and you know that's your
source of the truth the seller dashboard
that there's the address of the seller
back door so once you're done cleaning
your app you go to that address and
register as a seller and you can
actually publish your app I sure you can
go to Windows Azure come to once you
have your msdn subscription activated
you can go to usher to activate your
portals and start deploying your web
solutions there and if you have any
questions please feel free to to eat
send an email to ask app at microsoft
com
and the product group is going to be
there happy to to help you be successful
learn yes absolutely you can have like a
charter is just JavaScript and and
actually you can activate it offline but
so those ups the way it works is just as
cached pages in IE we r you have to
activate your app to be connected
because you need to we need to do
validation to the marketplace once you
have that your app at that point is on
the cash and you can actually go offline
if you need to and if you are not
accessing any services you can actually
have your app up and running yeah right
guys that's it for me thank you very
much and i'm going to spend a few
minutes here if there are folks on the
meeting that once you send questions
more than happy to help what otherwise i
thank you very much for your for your
presence here and thank you very much i
hope you find it useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
