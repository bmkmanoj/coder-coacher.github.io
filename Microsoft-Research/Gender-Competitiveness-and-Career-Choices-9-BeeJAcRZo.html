University here so Muriel did her PhD at
Harvard together with Al and she has to
stuff you know she she just tons of work
she has done stuff on options on k
double thinking she's an experimental
economist but they're sort of 22 main
focus points one is gender you know how
gender matters for economic outcomes and
the other one is looking in this room
very late the alonis market design and
gender you know realize one of the most
cited papers in in the last 10 years in
economics and it's both like you know
showing that women and men different
that taste for competition and it's a
very real very readable paper and it's
in the court of John of economics 2007 I
think and it's actually a great pace so
I mean your vision thank you you know
even if you're not a columnist it's easy
to read and it's a beautiful experiment
and this is very much related in this in
the stand of work okay interesting
much for having me Emily I'm going to
talk about gender competitiveness and
career choices and I really give you an
overview over my work on genders I'm
going to talk a little bit about the old
paper and I'm going to talk about how
this relates to to New York work that we
have done and the starting point is as
you see you just look in this room in
order to see large tell the differences
in economic success and this is lasting
effect there's a huge gender wage gap in
the US and in many countries and one
thing that seems to be important oh yeah
please interrupt me I'm happy to take
questions here you can also compete for
questions but maybe have it anyway so it
turns out that for a big chunk of the
gender gap in economic success is driven
by the fact that there are large gender
differences in education it's not a
women get less education they get just
different kinds of education so in the
US for example it is recently true that
boys and girls are as likely to take
math classes and science classes in
school but if you look at extremely high
achieving math students girls are still
highly underrepresented and this paper
you know one option might be that maybe
girls are just I don't know more stupid
she's not able in math i'm also very
prettily correct so if somebody cares
about this apologize so it might be that
girls are just not as able in math and
it's a nice figure by eddie swanson it
looks at where do children come from
that are going to go to these American
math competitions it's less like
American version of the automatic
Olympians and what they find is that
when you look at boys boys come you know
by and large from all over the US you
know you're going to get a very talented
boy popping up you know in the middle of
nowhere from time to time when you look
at girls girls basically all the girls
that go to these American math
competitions come from a small group of
schools so this suggests that you're not
going to pick up the best girls we just
have a combination of good girls
you don't have to be an environment but
I get pushed to do in Europe situation
is a bit rough in schools when children
have a choice whether to take more less
math intensive classes because a much
less like to take math intensive class
there are some countries and your where
I I I recall at least when I started
visiting Switzerland girls were given
unless it wasn't only that they had an
option girls took knitting and boys took
I swear an extra hour or two of math a
week is like 10 year olds and and then
these idiots would say that boys were
better in math I mean it was just
horrifying no no I'm not sure if that's
still true so sweet that I'm a bit
special i mean they also were one of the
countries that had you know in this
oyster countries where we move at least
its own parts could not vote for very
long time but you know even in college
we should pick up us maybe more
egalitarian i can analyze i'm going to
show you just because I just not just
like the word think of meth meth heavy
our classes in the college level I stroy
Europe and also in the u.s. because a
much less likely to graduate from a
support stem major science technology
engineering math and there's some
evidence that is not driven by
adjustability but is it driven by we
don't have a thing so what one question
man had is why do we care about math and
in general science and technology that
one reason is that how will you I math
it's a very good predictor of how much
money you're how success for going to be
later you know we could talk about
literature but has also very so that
economically rewarding to be very good
in literature so that's why we're going
to focus on for now so there are lots of
explanations why we observe these China
differences you know one set of
explanation is discrimination so ever be
you're not going to teach the map then
you're not going to be as good in math
that's an easier you know we don't even
accept them I could be different sim
abilities and here the speaker base and
Swanson it's a nice example there's a
very clear example of showing this this
might not be everything that's going on
it could also be difference in
preferences you know maybe women don't
want to take math intensive classes or
don't want to go to engineering schools
because they also very about the jobs
later on but if suggestion is not not
some evidence it is not just with my
friend then there's a huge psychology
literature on gender differences in
non-communist skills and the question is
you know are these differences robust
and can they have a count for these
outcomes so what's the perfect I true
okay she's anonymous key and if there's
some evidence that women may be more I
tracing and men but not me the obvious
hobbies which relates to math choices
more interesting you guys so it's a
largely to drown gender differences in
risk aversion so it could be that is
tell a difference in risk aversion can
explain why because of different jobs
there is some evidence by dominant five
it shows that people that are more
risk-averse are more likely to hold
government jobs it is in Germany with
the charm it's like this won't be the
problem of a lot of days it's serious
and it is owner yeah that's also true
yeah the promises evidence is very
correlation okay so it could be that
because you wore the save government job
you become more risk-averse so we have
no idea which direction we schools as
Martha said I kind of started
introducing another concept that was
kind of more known in psychology but I
said introducing in economics this is
gender differences in competitiveness
and then you look at the laboratory
literature it's actually the easiest and
almost the most robust and biggest
channel difference you can find it a lot
this gender difference in
competitiveness so what I'm going to
tell you in this talk isn't going to
show you how we can establish this
general differences income
mess in the lab will show you that this
is robust and then we're gonna want to
find out whether you know it's just a
kind of a cool behavioral tell the
difference that we find or can is
actually help us understand some of the
differences in the labor market okay
then I'm going to tell you a little bit
about what AC might want so generally
different single megan is something you
know be adding the baby's development
equalities have talked about this for a
long time basically boys found to spend
more time for competitive games while
girls often play games is no clear end
point like how's your family men also
the spread and saves more competitive
than women but this is just you know the
question is you know what what is this
really driving in terms of economical is
advantage so what we're going to do is
you're going to run experiments in
advantages that we can show that we
don't have to worry about sex selection
issues so it could be that one reason
our women might not be the competitive
is because they want to see you is
children I have time for family our
logic sperm is going to last an hour
it's talking to a problem with my cell
family a la dicha might be that you know
maybe girls don't like competitive games
because they're going to run these boys
and boys are faster so that kind of
makes it a sin to see the advantage
again of our lobby said we're going to
be able to measure performance so we can
ask where the boiler girl or mainly a
woman of the same performance are going
to be more or less competitive the other
advantage is you can rule out
discrimination you know maybe good kids
again girls and feel weird to play nice
boys or maybe the boy from one happy
girl around or as I said could be a
concern sometime cool so the package of
the lab is it's going to be very easy
for us to have a level playing field and
we can exclude a lot of other things and
then check whether even in is every
playing field are we going to find
general differences in competitive you
can also control who lives with me this
week a controller a lot of things that
might drive general difference in
competitiveness yeah come please so this
is the the HMS second paper on general
differences
who's talked about is joint Berkeley
sleazo mesulam and it's a very simple
experiment so let me tell you about we
took 80 students from the university of
pittsburgh on carnegie mellon university
the students will come to the lab and it
would be a group of two men into women
they've going to perform a real task
several times and the different
compensation schemes they're not going
to hear or learn anything about the
performance of others until experiment
is over and we never mention general so
the way we're going to do it is figuring
out tell people this is your group
you're going to put them in groups of
four this is your group but they're not
going to see by the way is at two men
into women you can see each other what
we want to observe is who is sort of
select intro competitive environment so
in order to do that ideally we want the
task where many women are almost equally
good that's not going to be you know a
big general difference in performance
it's otherwise you know we're not gonna
have a big overlap to talk about gender
differences in choices and here's a path
we chose people have to add up five
two-digit numbers for five minutes so
the performance is how many correct
answers you're going to have you're not
going to get penalized for wrong answers
but they're not going to count and I
wonder this is a math task so people
said oh you know how come boys are not
better this on the other hand this is
very easy mathas so I think you know
talk to many mathematicians aventador
miss the best in doing things like that
but the other thing is that this is
something when she will learn ending up
to get your numbers girls actually often
better than boys in school case it's not
obvious that this gender difference in
Mak holds for very easy math class ok
very thing affection or through the use
of
groups of four people and no one
participant notes about the other two
three so the way we're going to do this
is are you going to come to the lab and
we're going to see you're going to
compete a group of four people this is
your group and it turns out every group
has too many to women but we're not
going to say by the way and they're
doing this together okay so here's how
we're gonna do it the first has to do is
they have to solve this problem for five
minutes we're going to save big on duty
several times and one of those times is
going to count for you suppose the first
one is gonna count for me we're going to
determine this at the very end if the
first one is going to count for real
then everybody is going to get fifty
cents for every practice or problem so
and everyone is so so but it's it's in
the groups or not so okay so little
butyl groups you're going to go to the
lab and for this one you actually don't
care about the group just going to say
the first time you're going to perform
this task if we pick his first
performance for famous what's going to
happen is you're going to get fifty
cents for every correct answer okay once
this task is over you actually don't
know if this is the one we're going to
play or not you're going to know how
many useful correctly and you're not
going to learn anything about with
anybody XD once this first task is over
we're going to simply know you're going
to do it again the same time you're
going to end up five digit numbers for
five minutes but now we're going to
change how you can pay you the second
round is used for payment then this is
how you're going to get paid you're
going to have groups of four people
which turns out to be too many two women
let me know maybe don't mention general
and we're going to say the person is
going to solve the most problems that
person's going to get two dollars per
flight problem and everybody's gonna get
mad okay so it's like a winner take on
it's a widow cycle but the price is
depending on how many useful so let's
assume it
so we're gonna take 4000 us as I think
it's going to happen that's outrageous
all right time you don't have any choice
like that before I know I'm just
anticipating okay uh once you're done
with this pass again you're not going to
get any feedback you're not going to
learn if you want the tournament or not
you're just learn this is how many you
did that's it okay so you're not going
to learn who did Hawass or whether you
want to tournament okay so let me just
tell you a little bit about the
performance of the men and women in our
sample remember we have 40 million photo
women the average performance of women
in the peace treaties you know 10.2 of
men is 10.7 this difference is not
significant in the tournament everybody
gets a little bit better this is
actually mostly driven by the fact that
you do it again so people learn not to
use pencil and paper which they have
because that just slows you down and you
know people do about 12 correct problems
then they can also show you depending on
the performance what is the chance that
you're going to be actually the highest
in your group so it turns out if you
have a performance of 12 doesn't make a
video man or woman you have a 30 point
four percent change to be the highest
girls in your group if you have a point
of 13 you basically have before them a
quarter chance of being the highest in
your group give higher performance you
have a you know fifty percent or more
chance to be the the highest perform in
your room remember the tournament you're
going to get a payment is four times the
starters in a piece right so I'm
principle if you are somebody who source
14 then you would make sweetie more
money from the tournament an expectation
piece of 13 it kind of doesn't matter if
you solve less you're going to make more
money from the from the piece rate
had moved five minutes
so turns out the faster the best person
here was like 22 or something but then
we did it again in harvard and there in
a second 35 tibetan in the boss the
arrogant some people are kind of prank
of the joints but you notice your
distribution of how much hypocrisy why
is kept for the mayor's at 18 it was no
we didn't have a manual in 1840 myly14
women 40 some a little bit confused the
men are doing better than women yeah but
it's not significant so this is true yes
but it's going to poison our say it's
not reflected somehow in these
conditional probability so if the men
are doing psyche better than women ya
better woozle condition encore
performance because he's competing with
two men and what it means you should do
a little bit worse this is why these
numbers are not exactly equal but you
can see the difference is I own but they
rearranged his mother the good way
scattered is taught by the fact that
poison it's that great men are better
than women so if have a woman I have a
somewhat unfair competition that's why I
show you this role but it should say
that basically the difference is so
small is a difference driven by extreme
man over no it's just it's a little bit
cheaper to the right
it's just the toilet penance so he knows
the interests of the relevant question
nah we let them choose what is having
scheme do you want for your third and
last performance so if I choose this
rate for my third performance it's easy
i'm going to get fifty cents for every
credits or problem the question is
what's going to happen if i choose fun
of it so what we're going to do is if i
choose tournament from a third time
you're going to perform this task what's
going to happen is that my new
performance it's going to be compared to
the old performance of the people in my
group okay remember the old just see the
tournament so if i'm going to choose
tournement fourth us 3 i'm going to take
the toner and performance of everybody
else from plus two and i'm going to
compare my new one to everybody old one
not including mine if mine is the
highest when you want then I'm going to
win and otherwise you lose doing other
performances no you get more feedback so
i can in the tournament you just know
how many you did and that's it you don't
even know if you want a tournament but
you have to do better in particular then
you say no yeah hooting you said now i
have you been doing honest including our
ability to charge it i come from a
country where we do not have downhill
skiing so this is like you know my own
skate down the hill and now I can decide
if I'm going to be the competition you
know what times are given from the other
people I can ski again and my new time
is gonna count compared to my old time
of yarn anyway make sure you know you
have no idea
have no information oh how good they
were you don't know Thank You relative
to that that's exactly we have 20
information 0 we want you 30 for me you
didn't see the other people's pencils
moving like you were you at all because
you basically have these dividers it's
very hard to see do you know how many
use yes you know how many you're so
pretty looking one no you don't know if
you yeah you know another information
hope you didn't see you also I mean did
you ask these people what they think
their chances with the perfect meant it
so i'm going to show you so one reason
you might think that you choose dif
different you know that i'm more likely
or somebody is more like you chose for
me than me said they have a different
performance or anything good from you
the other reason might be that i just
think i'm going to be better so they're
going to ask them for their beliefs and
i'm going to submit a bit controlling
risk aversion make me another one yes i
was out of control for risk aversion at
the work we have a lot of other conforms
i'm going to show you wanna be figurin
correct Renaud version cuz I was it how
would you not yet but I was gonna have I
just thinking I couldn't tell the
difference i'm gonna i'm going to be a
bit faster this however because I was
good at the second one but I can tell
your homeboys so I said what reasons
I've interrupted wounds because so much
more that's reality in there so what do
we find so it turns out ah you know cool
pudding principally make more money from
the tournament what all of these people
who did 14 or more right if my new
performance is at least as good as my
old one then if I haven't performed as a
14 I should enter if I have a good comes
of 12 I should not enter no you don't
know that but I know that it's false and
if you have a performance of 13 you're
basically different okay so what would
we predict if you think you know if you
think about now in economics economics
is a bit funny you're not wrong she
often assume that you know everything is
what you don't so we can like try to
control for disability but this is going
to be my first approach ok so what may
work predict is that basically a third
of the man and a third of the women
Fernando if we add the people are
different we will predict forty percent
of women and forty five percent of men
anyway but we actually find is
thirty-five percent of women and 75
manager this is huge differences nice as
I said it's one of the biggest soon it's
very
to generate this difference and it's
very robust you don't need a lot of
econometrics to show that this is
significant so let me show you a
database on who is entering as a
function of how good they are attention
people are making decisions they don't
have the coordinate the group doesn't
have agreed no so the nice thing is the
reason we choose it this way is that
when you decide to enter the tournament
I actually couldn't care less about your
decision if you are in my group ok so I
actually don't have to think about your
decision because I just have to beat
your performance so the advantage is
that i don't have to is something i
can't measure i can't measure your
beliefs about what the other person will
do the advantage is here is that this
matter what the other person does so i
don't even have to measure those videos
that's exactly why we do it this way so
one issue I think that this takes away
some of this edible computational aspect
so the census it's obviously a bit
milder than another competition would be
given a busy time big differences that's
ok this is exactly why we chose to do it
this way but but they don't know if
other people in the movie event Obama
yeah but see he doing here but it
doesn't matter because it's but you also
don't know when it isn't have no idea
because they make the decision of the
same time you alright it's a signal if
it's correlated with skill at bravado or
whatever is correlated with skill then
it's the same but you may be the season
the same timing and you live observe
anywhere without a preventable but it
doesn't happen to know how well people
do in this test you know you have that's
exactly right so one one thing that
might drive is differences differences
in beliefs so I'm gonna dress like
obvious things perfect i'm happy too
much like we're going to show you um
okay so who is entering as a function of
the performance these are the best 25%
people I turns out that only about forty
percent of women answer and you know
almost eighty percent of man and even if
you look at the bottom twenty five
percent of people these are have no
chance of winning kitty speaker
basically wait for four and here you
know
come from God they're your CEOs there's
blue ones above eighty eight years you
know you know the bathroom of men were
like you know ended and the best group
of women it's just basically all over
the place so the question is uh this is
simply spoken by beliefs on relative
performance they just know the absolute
performance so maybe this is driven by
gender differences simply use okay so
what we did is after they did everything
they made all these choices are we asked
them remember that possible tournament
what'd you think was your rank think
your first second third or fourth okay
if you're gonna guess your ring
correctly if you're going to pay you a
dollar and otherwise you're gonna get
nothing so freakonomics you want to
incentivize this question so okay so the
two things you can look at one other
gender differences in beliefs and the
second question is well are they gonna
drive these difference in choices so let
me tell you about the general
differences in beliefs it turns out 30
or 40 many things are the best in the
group ha-ah what something wrong shredz
2091 no I mean someone could dip your
hairs different rooms ya creep said yeah
oops are in store for also I got ties be
allowed for you know first and second to
be correct but when you look at those
numbers so it's a good cut off man and
more to missy beliefs and women both are
so low of optimistic when even the women
you know that much more like you think
their first and their last so we find
that both of them are optimistic about
their beliefs but men are significantly
more so the rim it's a condition on
their performance which means
conditioning what they should have said
to maximize the chance of getting a
dollar men are much more likely to see a
low number sit at a very good than women
what if i just i'm risk averse so i'm
just going to head you get my
performance and yes i'm a second and
then you're going to enter the convent
or not i mean either I get one dollar
from the same question or I get money
plus a finished perception for more I
diversity we can put it down if you
could have said in your last you would
also not holiday visa choice of entering
the tournament that would be one way of
hedging right did you actually think
your first but then you're going to say
why don't think I'm first so that
they're going to lose the tournament it
isn't going to get money there so this
would suggest that I would get a
negative correlation between the beliefs
and the chance of any other tools so
could it could it be that these are
actually the beliefs their their beliefs
about their rank that you're listening
but something about their their
self-image the big there they're not
happy to report that they actually think
that their number four so they kind of
delude themselves into thinking they're
better and there could be gender
differences it if they think semantics
say best second third but definitely
knows about that soup that beliefs can
be tired of their self-image in this way
very good question so it comes out so I
think it's in general interesting
question is how people form believes
especially when it's about your own
performance luckily you kissin i just
recently resubmit tomorrow you're going
to resubmit a paper which is exactly the
question you're looking at because out
that people are definitely very biased
when it's about you know something they
care about and in that paper we also
find that so here beliefs somewhat weak
okay because just ask about the ranking
in a peep of his marcos we have much
more precise belief so that we can
actually show that women are very
different than men in forming beliefs
initially but also not leading videos so
you might even very that in the long run
search me take a really long time until
they would converge with sedatives
yeah condition your performance i can
calculate what you should have said in
order to maximize earnings and this is
what you should have said but we don't
have your own seat here but I can I can
regress but you did say on what you
should have said and then either
chambers remain okay now one thing to
note is remember we had seventy-three
percent of men entering the tournament
and thirty-five percent of women
seventy-five percent of men think that
are best in the group and forty percent
of women think they're the best in her
room okay so maybe that's all that's
going on right okay so it could be that
the sol-gel atif it's a competition it's
actually driven by johnny difference in
beams which would behind that's okay so
we can ask whether this is the case so
way to look at this is I'm going to show
you for each belief was it change the
venue in the tournament and then we're
going to have regressions maybe I'd
listen let me show you figure first so
here so can this overconfidence account
for the gender gap in tournament entry
so i'm going to show you for each belief
what's the chance that men and women
enter the tournament so among the people
who thought they were a mess in their
group only about half the women enter
the tournament compared to more than
eighty percent of them among the people
who thought their second in the group
then seal about 25 man the swimmers and
conversion is supposed to believe or how
would you it could also be competitive
articles they'll put another if I think
I'm like eighty percent like interpreted
says there's one guy who thinks easy
except likely to be the best and one
girl who thinks she's fifty percent
likely to be the best so if i think i'm
eighty-percent likely then somehow my
error bars are gonna be much smaller
right where is everything i'm fifty
percent like me then there
largely in this so this is as I said
this is someone weak measuring beliefs
we just ask four categories so in the
paper miss Michaels we have much nicer
measure of beliefs those are have more
subjects you know sort of today well
first of all men mir and is we didn't
exactly know how to ask for beliefs in
an intelligent way as actually everybody
who has economic experiments but it
turns out there's actually a very nice
way to to ask for beliefs when you have
a categorical variables you can actually
do that and then you can get very
precise estimate so we didn't do that
here it was much simpler that's why we
opted for this one we're going to have a
the control which i'm not going to show
you much about on risk aversion is going
to have another control on how you act
on these suggested he needs and so far
there's a basic loop people have given
you contribute on the best i should
enter hundred percent right yeah
obviously I handles it well unless I say
I believe I'm the best but I have a
certain I mean I seriously asking Serena
and uncertain what I can definitely say
that if you are the talk to a person you
should end up from if you have a second
twenty five percent you should not infer
from the key to some people may not know
buddy no they don't know right Emma
study this is what should happen so if
you I think if if you guys with her the
fourth quarter the baby i have no chance
of winning this one takes to be
scheduled now enter the schedule end
zone and it is true depend on one should
enter the works for treatment okay I
just probably just shown I mean the
surprising thing is also not this one
one before is this like that for women
ask for men was a play for monogamous
it's really a flat graph i mean the
impossible self knowledge about your
ability right which is really kind of
surprised so when we control so when we
control for my let me show you the
regressions when we control for beliefs
in addition to the commonality do you
make it well three but it depends what
the truth is miss Anderson so the sound
like a perfect one says check here we go
if you perform this 18 say in you to
please rate you're going to get nine
dollars if you choose following internet
exchange of one away and almost you're
not going to get twice 18 thirty-six
dollars it's a huge difference so when
you think of it as just in terms of even
for people who have performance of 11 or
13 in terms of risk aversion you will
give you ridiculously big gender
differences too much much beginning you
would ever find in the lab study very
good no it's not your business but I was
bored I might say I just I just don't
like the stupid competitions for two
dollars I don't do it on the other hand
if I sort of make hundred dollars i
might survive maybe they're sure it's
two dollars the problem right so if you
saw twenty you're going to be pushy very
40 bucks compete with anybody in fact we
trust them that they have figured out in
a moment money it means something so
that's what I'm saying do it I think
Jessica's card is planted by people just
not like a competition constant the
monitor I mean force is forty dollars
and five minutes
good one no invites yeah Miami Gardens
ended solid surrogates we have not run
in these much higher stakes but you know
some of this question was back to the
question is how much can I rely on is
telling me something there is going to
be correct outside of the lab which is
exactly the point right a second but I
agree with you I mean it turns out in if
you run most experiments if you randomly
small or large estates the way you run
back to six is equal to 40 campus that's
easy it's very hard to get little sex
money to run 56 and views but it's very
easy to move around objects in poor
countries it's very difficult to get
changes in behavior unless it's
something on fairness or I prison but if
it is more behavior that depends on most
if you look at playing different games
okay Mitch are not just driven by
arteries of questions it's very
difficult to get big changes in results
but I don't know anybody would leave
this with lobsters
okay so when you had gender differences
in beliefs so when you add a guy
straight you're going to reduce the
gender gap but you know you don't
eliminate you immediately reduce it by a
lot of third and then we have a last
past where we're going to try to study
risk aversion and feedback aversion or
maybe I don't choose tournament because
I don't want to find out I'm not the
best person it so what we do is we
basically 10 people remember your task
one piece rate performance I'm going to
pay you once more for this task 1 and
you can decide how to get paid for it
either by piece rate or by submitting is
to a tournament so now in terms of risk
aversion you have exactly the same
question as you had been you entered the
tournament if you don't have to perform
anymore that's the only difference how
much red trust my beliefs same thing
okay and we go to measure believes in a
piece rate and I'm going to check do you
submit the peace train to a tournament
or not it turns out when you do this so
I don't have it here but many dude is
submitting the the first piece rate
performance a tournament or not they're
basically no gender differences once you
control for performance and beliefs and
you can use this decision as a control
and you know it takes away some of that
coefficient on the gender gap in
tournament entry so many is driven by
busy just another measure of beliefs and
how you trust your beliefs but it's is a
lot of it so it's not so what you're
concluding is that there is no gap in
risk aversion but there is a gap in
believe in in your abilities and in
competitive instinct as a condition
you believe in an ambulance so we think
from this paper become protease are the
most you know the most important trade
mr. Burton it will seem to be something
else just doesn't explain that much so I
did submit the peaceful wish I don't
have here it cannot really account for
such now you're miss very so this is the
first experiment we did on choices of
competitive or non-competitive incentive
schemes you know there's a lot we can
learn from this but you know the end is
80 people and a specific way for us of
running it so you know you want to see
replications of this but I'm going to
move on to the next study so there's
some more questions not one big return
kaskus so um this is a frame of mind
which I probably have it and it might
explain this so if there's a task that I
think I should be good at you know maybe
a good maybe I'm not but I think I
should you know if I think I meant to be
good at it then I think I should be
entering competitions booth you know i'm
not the best whatever but you know if I
meant to be good at it damn it I'm going
to compete and if I lose you know and
this is sort of what's going on here you
know I think is just a tease if you get
down there to meet some complication we
done something you know some districts
or something or a cooking something um
then maybe you know the women would all
say yes I want to have this hi baby
contest because I believe that you know
I'm supposed to be good at everything
else to do with a diagram so the reason
what reason
itself suppose partial wrong um you know
I guess we make fun of you but it's a
good question it turns out so I
personally have not run this but a lot
of people who are on the reason you know
this gender stuff they came so no one in
economics he said a lot of people better
candidates and we do so first of all is
rosario bucks second people look the
kind of more stereotypical female hearts
and then then the babies are basically
divided in two there are some papers and
find that nothing changes and there are
some papers that find that the gender
gap is reduced and we don't really know
why some tasks work and others don't but
it's not it's not like it general please
so his series of no it doesn't click or
maybe it's part of it okay the gap is
also 10 rated when I give people
feedback about how good you are okay so
his beliefs seem to be really important
a little bit but the question is so the
question is in general you know how
often do you have knowledge about how
good you are when you start something
you but it does actually a little piece
of developments and advocacy is actually
having massive experiences in Africa
everywhere and that seems to be a key
component of
right but I think it's easier to be
feedback about your soul so that lot of
so here's another a lot of people said
we are going to give your test that's
gonna help me understand how will you
learn certain things like now that's a
ways of giving the test what is this is
just a sample the other one is to say
this tell me how good you are in math so
if this test is diagnostic and you know
its diagnostic then what happens is that
people who suffered most seventh time as
you perform those it was in your
stateroom psychology and says that is
stated that instead of exactly so here
so i think it's a it's going to be very
hard you know in the lab here making you
feedback it's very easy because you
notice a way of knowing whether or not
you're actually bringing stewart i've
been into play because you have no idea
what that mean procedures diagnostic
informative and this past you know one
advantage of this house is that this
task basically does not respond to
incentives so you know you performance
doesn't change at all once you're going
to go to different performances so I
have another paper my first paper on
gender differences the competition was
actually at a square this is changing
performance depending on incentive
scheme and then we see that women
underperform compared to men in a
tournament but no oil in the peaceful
but this was a tiny not in a penetrator
so this was a task for the poor
performance of your most people changes
when you change incentive schemes here
we pick the thoughts where the
performance is you know if asked you to
sprint for like five meters or whatever
15 feet it's it you know I'm going to
get a big change in performance so big
that past because there was an advantage
here but you know when you think about
feedback outside of the last that's
something that you have to be no more so
this experiment at the brain did you
tell them would say if they want or not
or you never told you just gave them the
while depending on the ground you could
have deduced whether you won or not
because some people made 0 if we pay the
tournament if you can't has talked ther
there are two things when the water hand
is like you know I could just kind of if
it's competition I could just dislike
competing you know but also I could like
it was like the feedback I'm getting
rather I'm revealed to be the worst or
the best guys i but then i think is made
me do submit the piece rate that also
angels and so that's why we have is
cereal submitting the peaceful controls
and butter 900 understand it because
it's a version and feedback should we
have a little bit to do with how much
you can paint why not necessarily or
something it could be very easy to get
people to perfect could be somehow that
i'm getting paid like you know for many
things and in the end like the full
payment doesn't reveal how much I didn't
a particular task man so they don't get
much feedback I'm but I still might just
like competition you thought I never
learned if I never really learned my
rank you know but I just don't like
competing because I I don't want to
review that I just kind of makes you
uncomfy and I don't want to know that
I'm not the best the four people man so
the thing is that English in his last
treatment I didn't show you in detail
this will also play a role and we don't
find it played a role in this last
treatment so I don't think it's a big
because I but in our experiment we
designed in such that you never learn
right so here this is not the case yeah
you will be the point about submitting
the beast
okay so think of the middle so I don't
have a slider list but here is choosing
the tournament or not okay so remember
everybody did a piece with performance
so the task for is the following you're
going to say now instead of having to
perform once more you're going to take
your old piece right performance so it
has nothing to do this tournament and
you can decide how to get paid for it
eat a piece with or tournament if you
choose tournament you're going to look
at your peaceful performance from the
first task and compare it to the other
people's his great performance from the
first time so once more you don't care
about the choice of others but if you
care about your very about getting
feedback you're going to get feedback
okay very bad whisker burn by meteor
bessemer what if i told you so it's a
little done because I if I tell you you
where the best last time do you want to
enter a competition against last time
you have to be really stupid not to
enter but it's still like this is
reduced when people get feedback so the
stellar difference gets reduced when you
give people feedback on by the way I did
you say it's a Fitbit narration is ready
janiye remedy said it takes a lot of
feedback donation to close that what if
you do absolutely it all gets the best
will you will you take it on oh so okay
so okay I think of that that's not
absolutely that's already a relative
because its relative to the other people
in your group so this feedback people
have paid around be telling you the best
in your group or giving you the whole
performance of everybody this experiment
so all of those color Medusa gender gap
but if I tell you you are the best in
the group and now I tell you you you you
compete against the past performed in
the group the gender gap kids very small
I don't know what it is or not many
people are PDF for now do that because
then essentially if I'm the first I
should take a different sort of all my
neighborhood so here's how the reason
you might not think it is that who knows
how diagnostic you're all performances
of the new performance there are lots of
other reasons why you might not want to
take it completely but what turns out
they said if I give people feedback the
gender gap is reduced quite a few people
show yet what happens if you
fossil hunt if you don't have height so
it's a good question but that I ignored
you so actually somebody else was asking
this question it was a very short man
you can one hikes okay I don't care
about hi this is how what I understand
sir topic is nothing one that much of
the difference between competitiveness
under the supervision described are
related to confidence my mojo to third
Lorenzo it's mostly are complex what
I've been called a self-advocacy which
is a little bit more focus first step
and then the second thing is when you
give woman when you give everyone more
information women are more likely to be
in the tournament then when they have
basically zero information the data guy
disappears for both reasons because
women and two morbid Mendoza Angeles
because if you have a lot of manual ok
you know so many yeah yeah two groups of
people are going to lose a lot of money
here so i feel i feel like i'm having a
hard time thinking this is
competitiveness and having a much more
time thinking of this as i'm not going
to get into a game where I don't know
what the rules are how while I'm going
to do when I hear the question is how
are your results intelligence well be
the tournament where I have no idea how
I'm going to do so if you think that
your IQ is going to be related to how
well you're doing this tub other than a
marketing actually right which is why
that this is no problem so if you think
your IQ is going to be related to how
are you doing this part then that's not
accounting for the gender difference
because if we have a measure of
performance now we don't have a measure
of IQ so in a paper miss Michaels we
actually have a sub group of people so
they have like a kind of a very short IQ
test and if you also have we we have a
sub group of people who run this gender
competition stuff and IQ is not
accounting for the channel what
I meant intelligence in the world not
and not the schedule b day in section
the questions okay more questions to
think about what does it mean to be but
it worried about a complaint in the
constitutes well so on one hand I
thought its kind of audience but you
know yeah that's right understanding
what you mean by yeah I needed this
another way to think of it is that I
think of something like ambition you
know I also think it's always but
ambition is and I have a very hard time
measuring ambition the question is I
think issue ambition and competitive
little bit someone's very correlated and
both of those are concert here I said
it's very wishy-washy matter I have a
good definition of this concept but you
know what which is why you know so it's
familiar with a special things and then
i'm going to show you this is going to
be important outside of the lab so this
is going to be you know so i'm going to
move on to this because I want to make
sure to tell you about this this
actually matters for an economic
decision be curable now what it exactly
measures agree so that might be hard to
think about but I think you know
something like ambition which I cannot
want any I think we only have a good
view about what ambition is you know how
you're going to define ambition how
you're going to measure it that's going
to be very different and the questions
this might just be a measure of ambition
I would be fine for me as well I don't
know how to say I measuring these
competitions I'm gonna call
competitiveness but we know we've had
qualities measuring it's precisely
defined by the measurement which she
calls in right and words don't actually
write those are the same that you have
not taken it could be that men actually
are trained by evolution it's good how's
about relations for the man to be the
razor is actually good so it's really
bad for a busy so I enter this
competition we don't because I've in
aqaba genetics you know the fact that
there is a huge debate on thinking about
is it genetic so is it the environment
and I think it's an interesting question
it's probably going to be a combination
so I think one question at some point
would be how can we change this first i
want to show you it matters you are
going to do that nothing like very
change it she'll show us some errors so
why should we care about this gentle
difference in competitiveness and as an
economics as a special behavioral
economics is quite some new drive to
think about external
and the way people often think of
external validity to say I'm going to
replicate this lab experiment with real
people as opposed to soothe and often
they take like some weird group of
people were like you know what I have
collected some funky things or her you
know inhabitants of funny countries so
like I don't care about this kind of you
know I have a better idea about how
students should behave that we do
perfectly I don't know anything about
and to some extent but we care about is
not finding it with a group of people
outside of the lab but they care about
showing that what I measure you know
this trait that I measure it's going to
help me understand an economic decision
I'm careful okay so this is what we're
going to be okay so the question is can
this non-con be skinny holy
competitiveness account for for example
why women don't choose maths our feet so
in order to do that I two different
quarters Thomas Boozer and hazel hasta
bang we run an experiment with secondary
school treatment the advantage of
running is in the Netherlands is that
why they pre select twenty percent of
the most if the students however they do
this so water is freaking diversity try
with one see students are they speaking
ability prank for the next last six
years of school for the south college
they have at the end of the third year a
choice to make about the track they want
to have in the last three years of
school therefore tracks one is a nation
technology tracked a nature enhance
track economics and society tracking a
society and culture truck this is the
order of how much math are going to have
this is also the order of how
prestigious it is where the best kids go
where the kids with the highest GPA go
mr.
suspension by your energy p so it turns
out you're a skipper what is the most
prestigious what is the order in terms
of pajamas that's the only holding our
people as a good version of the station
it happens to be also correlated with
the GPA which kind of that makes it more
plausible bit significance or procedures
precisely people's opinion of it that's
right what you're going to choose for
your use of high school it's also
correlated with what you're gonna study
afterwards it's correlated with your
chance of actually going to university
and boys in the Netherlands a much more
likely truth the nation technology this
is a very math heavy track and girls are
much more likely to choose the chytrid
society try it's losing track this is
actually such a big deal or enrich the
thought of abandoning this track giving
subtractor these women and then well
then it's ready I'll be studies science
after yeah so what we gonna do is we're
gonna take four schools in a run
Amsterdam we're gonna get in that school
every single child who is in ninth grade
which means before they have to make
that choice about what they're going to
do for the last three years we haven't
go to 400 students and there's some
students who complete so we don't have
the date of everybody so can feel the 60
kids from which we have all the data
there is a line experiments the same in
March April and May is Jenna competition
experiments and then I the end of June
you're going to get from the school the
grace of those kids and we're gonna get
their choices for the last three years
of high school let me go to start next
year so now they're just happen this is
new neutrals shooting it just finish the
first year how you can use the same
adding numbers bigger rig use the same
thing so what we're going to do is we're
going to basically do this telecommuting
experiment like I just showed you they
also asked about the beliefs we're going
to do the risk assessment question may
be different we basically directly ask
them to choose one of five options
either get two euros for in Iran 310m in
euros or pick a gamble between 50-50
chance of three years or year and a half
or four years and 15 or nothing then we
ask them no because math is the thing
that varies the most they after about
how good they think they are laughs
tuition is a 50-50 gamble you're
participating in the tournament to be no
sorry this is just I'm just first we do
dis tournament questions things because
it's something that's it on top of that
we sit upon it you have a choice you can
either get two euros before or you can
pick one of those gamblers and so this
really test for its risks and direct
whistle yeah the other reason like that
maybe let me know if I'm eating
challenge is not to know it increases so
in expectation become a nearest future
you should pick the last one we also ask
them how could you think your iron mac
and we also ask them because I promise
I'm going to have the math grade so here
is the master in ninth grade it
separately a perfect predictor poverty
on that because in order get a good
grade you know it might make this
helpful to be good in math please
windows be helpful to just be very uh
contention about make kind of stupid
mistakes so we also ask them how
difficult is it for you to pass the math
class that's very relevant I taught now
college math to thousands of students
and I hit girls all the time or in the
top 1% of my class I would tell them
they were good at math and they've been
saying no I'm not unlucky or no I'm not
I work
heart I mean it was just an and very
often when guys did badly on exams they
would tell me like anywhere I'm unlucky
I mean it was just it was it was wait
you know since since I taught thousands
of students they're actually having
compiled that it would have been
statistically significant are actually
have data Matthew time some advocacy of
engineering students who start college
and then vacuuming for you later of
engineering right we can say Frank and I
mean I would come on over the last ten
for 300 students and i would tell him
you thought of going on in math and they
take no i'm not good at me which is why
this is why yeah this is one right tote
so I waving you it's very important to
ask those two questions exactly baby
good as we buried that you know you know
what a measure ms.always family parable
this question okay so we're gonna ask it
separately and we kind of control for
that and see where on top of that
because American space of any question
is the right way yeah daddy asked them
what profile your plan to pick just
because some people for we don't get the
data but it turns out this is almost
perfect correlation is what they
actually pick and then they asked em
gauge procedures this question was
whether masculine and then never forget
this data from the school about the
grades and what they actually think you
are set which prefer to the best
students in mass because you know the
vessels but up there you asked and other
not authorize the best for other
customers the test is a man because I
don't in a row and also what drink do
you think you have overall because that
would call it let's do it now because I
see the thing is the funny thing is this
actually happens to be the case in
something Fran so you have a choice like
this is also true then how procedure the
profile is and how much math that has is
very Colin than a slide which I don't
have is there is only one subject that
is taught everywhere on different levels
and that's not they all have Dutch but
exactly the similar we all have some
history exactly the similar the only
subject it is taught in every single
profile but the different levels
so that's why we focus on with math
question
the other thing is presumably you know a
little bit about Harvard Yard we get to
your other kids in your class so but
anyway we just ask this much mushroom
know the the drawback of branding stuff
outside of the lab you said it has to
fit in the class we get one class min
then you know trans like 45 minutes so
it's a bigger the number of questions
because us so this is what we ask them
okay so when you look at the grades of
the GPA of girls is anything live in
higher than a boys on your own it's just
given a higher but your differences on
that big boys are a little bit better
than girls in math but this difference
is not significant it's a great out of
10 is sending the best rate girls think
that math is much more difficult and I
think they have a hard time of passing
the monthlies when we look at the
profiles is a chosen by the trigger in
our sample we find that boys are much
more likely to the end he tried to math
track finding girls are much more likely
true society and society track even
though remember the grades were
basically the same and even though match
my so basically this it's all second
type is trick that's right perfect so
when you look at justice sizes together
compared to the non census is so
merciful it turns out a lot of people
who go to the NH fact allows them become
nurses so now you can talk in the tool
but admittedly weaknesses but so we kind
of think about procedure says if you're
going to have and everyone agrees in the
thought but in the paper in appendix we
compared these two to these two in terms
of diseases ok the results I should see
they're more like this is something it
is true in our sample when you look at
all of the Netherlands is not the case
then maybe two reasons one is an airline
data that I showed you it's a little bit
older but these are kids Telegraph
edition of four years ago the other one
is Eddie says schools in our 1000 these
are largest ever defense is awesome
bigger many more ways from that happen
they really do with economics in society
is the nature in heaven 2015 yeah and
they all agree in terms of precision and
it's still those are not the strident
voice
so when we see the regression will show
you is I'm going to pick the order
physios lessons the average person p and
I mean this literally eight percent of
the membrane is the first eighty percent
agree is the second I'll talk to you if
you have to gender breakdown region 4
profiles producers or dinner in terms of
who's actually in those profiles were
presented is not the truth here is
that's that's what so other the the
numbers of the program doesn't add up to
let's try it again hey I got that like
this is good okay and this I got 100 in
that order because of the s0 so in the
nature of our beautiful profile what
preserver male officer that's great
khali it to me yeah because it's very
sound is gonna be roughly to the one is
pretty good yes so remember I don't need
to change what is this much these are
kids are finished in three years so the
data had from kids are finished three
years ago so there's some changes the
other thing is that deserves 50 minutes
the schools in your own Absalom these
are not schools in anaconda sadness
obviously different zombie if you think
it's about procedures got like the
career choice D then go on it seemed
like major technology might not become
engineers yes sir so it could be what
someone can barely sleep differences in
first so it could be that is driven by
fewer preferences so then you would
imagine that my measure of
competitiveness should I have no impact
which is like I mean that's what I want
to end up getting have the same so let
me show you of it I want to say one more
thing when we also do in a paper but not
on the thought is we can ask for every
cave after every child was the owner of
diseases we can take their own order and
rerun these regressions and reserves are
still the same but for what I'm going to
show you we're going to pick that all
those procedures and fix it so here is
an order for your questions so this says
how much more likely a minor pick the
most prestigious profile or you see is
ignore the highest
it's a this prestigious profile as a
function of my math grades my GPA
maverick math grade in the class or how
difficult I think methods and what you
find is that women are significant more
likely to be less mysterious profiles
case where hand numbers are bad let's
procedures and because it's an order for
regression so interpret these numbers
I'm going to show you how much of the
gap between picking the most and the
least procedures profile is great just a
min female just by being female and then
do you correlate them with the
competitor cuz this here is my bad
english this would answer his question
about or the women picking that just
because they like being doctors and
nurses are they picking it because in
spite of their good grades they don't
think or that they could be that depends
we can even correlate it with them that
the competitiveness in your test so here
are Lawson falling yet for any of my
experimental governments can see him to
show you up for this summer's kids what
can I count for these choices and other
gender differences wants your account
for graves and give it a the beds are
basically the same now be show that the
beliefs are different about how good
they are math but even when you account
for that being female which is fifteen
percent of this gap between choosing the
best in the personal but the programs
like so it's also the difference between
I want to go in today
which is eight percent mail or whatever
sep seven percent male versus I want to
go to make your health which is seventy
percent female so there's deuce it seem
that there's many reasons why this might
happen right but she's exactly whether
it her legs with this thing that she
calls competitive ice and this will
distinguish it so when we look at our
sample of children this quarter children
we find basically what i showed you
before boil the more likely with the
tournament 26 percentage point when I
can be good for me about a third of
ministry from a gender differences in
beliefs and you know like for fraction
by gender differences in risk of money
ok so the in the in this competitiveness
study they look a lot like the longest
study and to show you so now the
question is once I could roll for how
competitive they are is that going to
help me understand the choices they make
so if it's just to be my preferences it
should have zero impact which would be
fine that's exactly what I want to find
out so one way to look at this is I can
break down or what kids are local so I
can look as boys that are very
competitive that edge of the tournament
and I can look at girls it is not enter
the tournament okay just look at this
sad new people and they can ask Allah
making different choices it's a little
bit competitive boys are non-competitive
girls there's a huge Tedder difference
in the trust in it if you live on the
other hand the non-competitive boys and
competitive girls there's basically no
gender differences in their choices so
here we don't control for grace this is
just taking different samples but it's
already suggested how competitive people
are it's going to have an impact on what
you choose to give you some time for
Question afterwards let me show you
another figure on thinking about the
competitiveness may be important but
i'll show you here is the residual of
summer and the final regression very
would regress my choice of aids in the
tournament on my fundamental formance
how good it was in the tournament
overdose on a piece rate was no chance
of winning and plus some residual and
when a plot here is this residual so but
these plots is the average competitive
of people who choose a specific profile
so if I look at for example women or
girls women who choose the nature
technology track is the math havoc track
are much more competitive than girls who
choose the culture and society track and
four boys the difference is even more
pronounced the most competitive boys
you're going to find them among the
people who choose nation technology and
the boys to choose hydrogen society the
numbers we met girls in terms of that
competitiveness okay and for girls all
the numbers are negative origami is
relative to boys they're negative that
negative but see the most competitive
girls go to nature technology this could
also just be like if it's a non linear
relationship if like there's just some
threshold where if you're i'm justing
the this linear regression like people
you know if you guys need fresh holding
function going on than you would get
this what booty
so um yeah I feel it against a monotone
function tomorrow so that's always so in
the that's what I could have showed you
is the fraction of people into the
tournament but the sonic said you care
about you know some people are very good
should end of the tunnel because I what
I want to show you here is that how much
more do you enter the tournament
compared to me when they have the same
performance and is that y0 that I'm
going to brought him to the admission to
these different tracks that they're
choosing was it cut off at some numbers
wasn't a competition or no they can
choose they tried they choose so
basically it's up to them what they
choose but that's not exactly true
because so I went to the French school
system so I know exactly how it works
there so if you are really bad in math
and in Sciences while you stood in a
French system for graduating you're
gonna take an average of all your grades
because that is so heavily greater than
you had such a big weight in the math
track if you are very bad at math they
are not gonna allow you to do the matter
but otherwise you can choose whatever
you want ok so that they're gonna be so
many mutations on what you can do so you
get too bad it's like you know some
people have to repeat the class
individual decision it's an individual
to see us now you talk to your friends
so you know who knows who makes the
decisions your parents you know so they
might be lots of lots of things that
drive it if you don't know that I can
just observe the decisions so I want to
come back something that she brought up
with me some feelings that maybe boys
feel they should enter competition very
respected officer chance does as I
should wait yeah when I was a little boy
my father said I shouldn't wear hand if
it's raining and when I asked why said
because your boy one was your hand free
in the way and so I could well imagine
that it always like forward you should
enter a competition it doesn't matter
and it happens to be these are the same
boys and enter the math track so it
turns out that whatever your father told
you could imagine Magnus about I don't
know but that you kind of internalize it
and it manifests itself in both of those
decisions that's what is shows right is
that not only you can attain to the
tournament you also put it int that
might be fine because in a sense it
always becomes a trade of you which is I
guess what I'm going to show you what
happens if you take this legit you know
instead of aggression yeah so what I'm
going to do is here actually don't put
the recipient in regression I should put
your choice last the performance that if
it also put the residual regression is
exactly the same so here when i'm going
to show you is an awkward regression of
the choices you make as a function of
your performative experiment and whether
you're made of female and then I'm going
to add whether you add to the tournament
or not okay so this we have seen before
almost being female which is nineteen
percent of the gap between choosing the
best in the biz profile once I add the
tournament decision this gap shrinks to
fifteen percent if I have a shrieking of
twenty-three percent of the gender gap
by just adding this one variable which
is very entered the tournament or not
okay so if I know whether you enter the
tournament or not you're going to be
reducing the gender gap in choices by
twenty-three percent once I notice
additional information about this half
is survives if you're going to put
information on grades okay i reduced the
gender gap by thirty percent it also
survives if i put information about how
good you think you're in math if i add
information on how good you think are in
math only compared to just the grace the
gender gap is gonna actually heal
decreased but once i had this
competition Regina got decreased even
more and I explained seventy percent of
the original guard again 17 points18
percent reduction of the original gender
gap once I count four there a decision
by into the tournament
so competitiveness is not going to be
skill that significant age these choices
of study profiles article 24 grades they
were trolling for you know your feeling
on mathematical prowess or mathematical
ability basically controlling for this
competitively so this choice offense in
the tournament reduces the gender gap in
profile choice by about eighteen percent
so this understates the competitiveness
because your preferences / becoming a
nurse of a doctor may also be determined
by your competitive yeah sure that's
right the thing is that it's basically
on top of your preferences so it's
really competitive is me I always
influenced your choice you whether you
want to actually become a nurse or not
that's it but this is in addition to
that you know I have an additional
measure of competitiveness I mean it's
even more important than just
improvising your practices it kind of
directly can explain your choices I'll
call it easy process so one remember
here we just look at a choice i made in
the tournament you know we saw that
beliefs are very important and risk
aversion was somewhat important so they
can also add beliefs and risk aversion
to this regression let me just do this
directly when I control for beliefs as
well adding competitiveness still
reduces the gender gap by fifty percent
when I have just restarted tooth you
know competitiveness accounts for
seventeen percent reduction and when I
add both beliefs and risk attitudes once
I add when the edge of the time is
around and say get a reduction of forty
percent of the general gamba choices
okay we had eighteen percent before so a
big fraction of this impact of entering
the tournament unknown comes from
competitiveness the not come from
beliefs of a misnomer so I would be sure
they said its competitiveness measure it
seems to be an important factor in
educational choices and you know this is
a different way of bridging the gap
between lab experiments and the field is
you're going to use a lab measure to
predict outcomes outside of the law so
when you to show you how I showed you
that this is literature on jelly
differencing competiveness we found tell
the difference in performance in my
original paper we found a Newton's in
choices of compensation schemes there's
a huge literature that shows that these
resins are kind of robust you know it's
very easy to replicate this but are the
only ones afraid is it's somewhat driven
by you can change it if you add a little
bit more female-oriented toss the reason
they care about male-oriented Tufts is
that it happens to be that you no match
for the money area see they're almost a
serious one and it happen to be made us
so a person that's why we look at made
hearts and let me show that this jelly
difference in competitiveness can be
important in the field and can have us
account for choices people make outset
of the case of anything about open
questions or things you know good nice
you want to do next so other people
hopefully can do next is there's a try
to understand a little bit more what
does this competitiveness measure
exactly so I think it's also measure of
ambition and you know the question is
how much of ambition or confidence or
social background or hormones to the Sun
legitimately cemented hormones for women
seem to be also on change on mind you I
am your cycle different papers find
different moments to be important so you
noticing a lot of a lot of work to be
done another question is can we teach
women to be competitive and is that
going to be having an impact on your
choices onset of the love I don't go we
also want to potentially expand the
domain you know there might be other
areas where there may be large gender
differences you know beyond just risk
aversion and altruism which is what
people look at the most like choosing
how the easy path okay here we look the
tournament was peace train but also have
a paper that looks at hard and easy
tasks and you basically get the same
the same results and when you think of
these choices in education it might be
also related to harden and easy task
negotiations you know there's a lot of
behavioral psychology literature looking
at gender differences in negotiations
you know it might be that are something
that that also might be important so too
much competitors may be harmful but but
really I mean the right women are known
to not negotiate well for salaries and
stuff and they're known to not so I mean
certainly some measure of
competitiveness is necessary everything
right or not I agree no the problem is
so a lot of these a lot of these studies
on negotiations romani they're very nice
on the other hand it's also it's often
very hard to know your the outside
option so here is a typical study we're
going to look at MBAs say from Carnegie
Mellon and we're going to check how you
know one is decided to get after work
maybe ask them do you negotiate or not
it has our women emotionless never would
have a husband with local so you know
that's much harder for them to get
dropped outside of Pittsburgh so the
problem is at some point you're going to
have to control the things that can
account for whether you can negotiate a
lot and those ladies have been done to
your definitely have instead of looking
at like moving negotiating in LA type
situations that you described so a live
situation sort of promised so a lot of
the lab situation studies are either
just just here kind of more looking at
vignettes magazine would you negotiate
or not or you do kind of gave here are
the experiments and then it is actually
much less clear what you find so I think
this is something you know finally I
think I think it's room to do more I'm
not what I said is a bad side anymore
right you have reveals pyramids
experience in the real world
during real rain during break in the lab
with limited there's always room to get
a look at what did you say san diego CA
care time step taken what kind of
experiments vessel you think like a
tomato game stuff you know so very
common era manner in which the lots of
things that can happen so one thing may
actually bought a look at this
negotiation on buying or selling a house
see any other options clips and leave
the house so you don't have to worry
about potentially uh you know whether
you have a spouse or not which you can
observe and in denmark you know get the
matching in denmark is that I like so
these northern countries you basically
know everybody about everyday mysticism
you know everything so we can actually
check whether single women pay more for
houses and send them for less compared
to single man you know setting is just a
lot of more more things to be done
against meaning what I want to see and I
really want to push you know for those
of you who are interesting these things
this one way to think of extra believe
is to combine some of this behavior
measures that we have from the lab
combine these with measures outside of
them and I nearly you know the way we do
it here is that you measure the behavior
variable before they make these choices
alternate he said that there some people
said look at those in combination which
is also nice but then you worry about
what is nothing
j participatory so I'm try to think
about policy application all right so
he's like usually when we try to
understand why why it is that we don't
see many women as men choosing you know
science intensive career curricula like
well one of the one of the sort of like
first time the debate is it just because
of differences in preferences that are
sort of talking about intrinsic or is it
because of like socialization we're
telling moment you shouldn't do these
careers and these have different
implications for like you know whether
we should wow how much we should be
trying to encourage women so so in here
like it seems like this measure of
competitiveness also sort of nature and
nurture factors in yourselves can can we
speak some can we use this to think
about sort of what how much were you
want to intervene or more help so one
thing this is really sees it he
suggested the choices of how much math
you have are not just women by how much
you like math may otherwise I wouldn't
have found this then is already
suggested it's not just preferences
about how much you're like mint which in
itself to the present is driven by all
kinds of stuff that happens you know a
kindergartener what if we say they were
sure to mass a lot now what I do not
know is if I can affect your
competitiveness me through sports or
single-sex classes or whatever is that
going to affect your choices or that's a
link at heaven on the other link which I
actually don't know is that when you go
back suppose your woman can you chose NT
sadly you're going to find you even find
yourself surrounded so I don't know me
in three years I continue whether being
competitiveness being competitive it's
going to happen not just under center
choices but also potentially of how when
we do three years later in that class
which is something I don't know so
that's definitely something I would want
to know
the questions but so there are so it
turns out in from the extremity
literature please if you look at his
competitiveness that girls not only are
often on women about competitive in more
female parts but there wasn't more
competitive competing against other
women so that's definitely something
that we have seen so that might be
something that that you could explore
more you know but you know I think
that's a lot more one load before going
to go there so one thing that you could
try to do I mean obviously you know a
longitudinal study you following people
for a long time would help with this
nature versus nurture but also it's
pretty well established that at least in
this country women shift in how much
they like math between the ages of 12
and 14 you know until age 12 there there
doesn't seem to be a large gender gap in
preferences and after age 14 there does
which is why people try to have all
these all of the the interventions in in
junior high school so I'm wondering if
you could do some of the same tests on
10-year olds and 16 year olds and see if
there's a difference and and and surmise
that some of that difference is
environmental and you know so people
have done it for Jenna difference in
competitiveness people looked at three
yards five year olds 70 or 11 yards
three in Austria and you'll find these
daily difference is very early no
actually it's not really careless with
his niche or nurture because I'm not
your window checking see ya oh no
nurture kicks it but I'm saying that
this strong prep I mean when you talk to
10 year old girls a lot of them are
still thinking now there's really great
on when you talk to 15 year old girls
they're not so at least with regards to
math somehow something over get some
change
happening you know if you can see the
correlation competitiveness exactly
right right it's a biggie way all right
so rightly the coppola cultural pieces
of raft why you still competitive you
just don't yes exactly yeah well that'll
be the same manner well you make me
don't study the same man oh yeah could
be geometry it could be that girls
inherently hate geometry but there's
also a lot of inhibited here what we do
is that the most prestigious happens to
be the most math intensive I actually
don't know whether this was written by
Chris to dismiss oh my math intensive
well you could study that by looking at
the people in the NH track and seeing
who chooses to become doctors and nurses
and that would be a measure of I mean
because those are those are similar
feels they're both kind of taking care
of people and and they're both within
the same track and yet there's some
difference in the ambition presumably so
what you can do is we can run its
aggression on your order of how you said
this what is the most prestigious can I
believe that's a basically the same so
it doesn't seem to me but it just
happens to be more societies that man
can density and / citizens is very call
it another kind of thing ever cause it's
exactly so when I Krishna Hare fear
which is when you study competitiveness
you study you study competitive about
mass yeah which is sort of so what it
which started competitive about some
baking pies no no I don't want a gender
specific but I don't want it to be mass
because the mass is sort of the same
thing they addressed I want to study
pure competitiveness race a sprinting
hate mass playing soccer or whatever so
my first day claims a violent sort of
because I want to really get at the
competitiveness so okay so that it turns
out so if I want to do like a bourbon
cask sometimes are still fine
sometimes not I do not know whether the
competitiveness in the bourbon cask
would be equally important for his
choices I don't know that the reason we
picked math so first I you know the
first time obviously the first time
somebody said why do you think math as I
sure any odd numbers is math mutually
this is me far away from which is
exactly the news here you're saying this
is done skater so he turns out it comes
out the generations in line I go to
prison the generations in math in school
appear much much later and a much more
often about really difficult math than
about easy man there are promising may
not know that procedure we did a lot of
caster billy mays olympics in all phases
you know hunting cycling shorts
oh how do you measure how good you are
singing so they promise I need something
but I can measure your performance
precisely these are you worrying that
I'm going to judge a different the
entire men or any commenting how fast
can you turn a certain text perfect so
the sort of publicity pels out that I
would have to bring computer systems
that can do with pencil in papers it's
much easier um I don't know how to type
either um extra you know I don't I don't
know how the time so I think you have
typing it just basically we you know
it's not angry so the question is yeah
what is a good measure of his
competitiveness but i guess what i can
tell you is that this measure happens to
be very cold into business Frances so
this seems to measure something you know
it's not just so it could be that how
competitive you are someone fluid but
this seems to be definitely picking up
an important trade that you have because
it has uniqueness choices you can make
outside but that's hand my defense we
can do one or two more questions okay
you can write but I've never easy until
Friday so given that i know david and
Jacob I'm gonna make people I don't know
so we have a significant in
cross-cultural studies in a steady
cynacia where a lot more women do go
into math at least in mice
but then you know over the carrier there
you go to the talk studies so we have
not done it in Korea of people have done
in China with so they also find some
jelly differences in in competitiveness
in most places people do replicate the
genitive or single entities there's one
study when you look at we are much
larger society where they find no gender
differences in company news it's
interesting which society are so these
are the India oh no different one but in
India some major anxiety earth together
if effective steps in my relationship is
learning his people's willingness to
fail my part of learning just get it
something but you have to work harder
and you know people when they fail at
something they never want to do it again
and a very big effect when people
discuss this and like that has is very
correct or not correct and I was back to
it but you ain't an essay someone can
give you a concrete map is that you
can't figure it out you basically not
figure it out and now the question is
how you know you come back to it in
other and you know this is when i made
about education right this is very hard
to get people and it's crippling like
some people who succeed a lot they don't
want to fail and they just they no
longer can succeed anymore so is this
then study in this soul not we already
saw same technology that's part of a lot
of virtual chunkies this is it's very
important for it so the promise um the
question is how here for me the question
is I want to try some measurements with
some objective outcome so this is what I
did here is a competitiveness now I
think some extent you know like ambition
or even this willingness to expose
yourself to potential failure you know
this might be it the only other than
some little bits on your risk of
leadership
even a close eye on is external that
this is a fact that even internally like
if you believe you cannot do and you
kind of get immediate feedback the
question is do the next time you try
this again you say oh I'm not good at X
and I don't do anything my other
differences for cultural or generate
attentive and maybe this is part of
competitiveness which I think it is very
defensive very different way of viewing
today it's more like the flip side
competitive yeah that's why I don't have
a book I don't have a good definition of
what is measures exactly so this is part
of what I want but I said isn't that
definitely one understand is more you
know what what what goes into this
measure and what is it in correlated
with and I think the some exciting is I
don't think I said been a willingness to
fail but I think you're exposing your
sex oh man I think of this hard was easy
part that's exactly the other two when
you have so there I have a choice
between so in this experiment you can
choose between an easy task and a hard
task in the way I could store the task
it's literally it's not math vs
literature the heart has is harder for
everybody and easier for everybody right
this is steady pretty actively like in
education and somehow correcting for
things like how good you are is
irrelevant with this because because in
a sense this is how much effort you put
into something rather than you could be
very good but you know like my try
something new I managed to get it but
what matters is how willing I'm
fulfilled when I started Richard so even
thinking about how much if you want to
put the image yet they said that another
way to think of that suppose I allow you
to try it out before so how much you
want to work in order to become very
good session is also adding a lot of
these important traits and I think a lot
of that you know I think in a behavioral
economics a Chevy has focused a bit too
much on things that we know I tradesmen
risk aversion it's very simple boy it
would be nice to move home a little bit
think of zombies arbitrates you know the
confidence in even confidence it's
actually a shocking how little work in
economic series on confidence and you
know I think Marcus and IBM and porn who
is also visiting you and tanya was about
here
yeah well the first step is why we
really try to measure exactly you know
precisely how people form their beliefs
and update their beliefs I think there's
a lot of things we don't understand you
and I definitely hope that you know big
moviestar something is very interesting
because you could think of like you know
it's been buying some tasks you know
softer surface easy and sometimes and
other tasks maybe it's hard 10 you're
doing math to have points to type part
of that you know it's a good education
of things you want to teach kids not
that oh you're good at X you want to say
like oh you feel but that's okay it's
important to try things you're going to
fail tell me call it your honor and
that's a coward wek has a big literature
on saying you know you don't want to
take people you're going to take kids in
their smart you want to tend them on
your partner you know Jane you can
actually do as long as in suggesting
this is there's also you know when I
took it over for me it's clear that
competitiveness and math fields kind of
a good coalition but then people say oh
but you know literature is so much more
competitive look at how many job there
sure on the other hand I know matt has
this is somewhat much more absolute
measure I mean you know you know I can
solve it the other person your head now
isn't it do you know you feel so I think
of as being more competitive but but i
can see that other people may have is
different you and I think this is
exactly why we're gonna have this view
with math is more competitive because
you have this ordering of people is you
know it turns out that many on on tenure
committees your own math people have a
much better view on how good you are
compared to other people whereas the
literature that's much more yeah but
does it all still heavily so much about
sure hey reckon so and in fact again
there is data looking at
example post doc said it was worth it
was in Denmark where a female postdocs
basically went they did the coolant
employer requests to see who was getting
fellowships and who wasn't and they
basically did like a regression of the
data showing that woman had to be far
more productive than their male partner
to get the same college if there is a
minority which literature in psychology
and as a rich literature around
education on many of these things that
are sort of which is of course what I've
been drawing on for the last hour that
are sort of complementary to this I
would probably be a really good place to
serve start taking sure I mean you know
discrimination programmer here the thing
is that I basically got rid of
discrimination this relation might seem
important and this is part of it so i
might mean that i don't even apply no
difference between them with their
confidence we have gotten rid of
discrimination right you've externalized
it but self-efficacy it's not
discrimination sivan work right right
there I'm gonna give them this one of my
shows with something else and that's how
fun but we should each year microsoft
