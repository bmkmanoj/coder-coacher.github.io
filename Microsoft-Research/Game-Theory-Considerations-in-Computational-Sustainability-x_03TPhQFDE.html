hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
it's my pleasure to welcome bow and
microsoft research today Bowen is an
assistant professor at nanyang
technological university from Singapore
and his researching interest include
artificial intelligence multi-agent
systems optimization and game theory he
has been doing very cool work on the
intersection of sustainability and game
theory and he's going to be talking
about that today thank you so morning
thanks for coming in it's my honor to be
here so today I'm going to talk about
some two piece of work on kind of
applying game theory to computational
sanity and this is jordan work with my
students from China and Singapore and
it's been published in each case 30 in
each KTN amos 15 this year so let me
start with a brief introduction about
this research work I'm doing so I
basically focus on research on game
theory for security in most of my work
is about game theory for security
basically how to apply in game theory as
a framework to models there in the game
between terrorists and the Security
Agency we try to come up you fish in
allocation of security sources to
protect k infrastructures such as
airports ports flights the step size and
as recently we just extended this
framework for like to protect forests
protect white knife those type of new
domains so that's number one the other
one I was working is about bargaining
and its applications to I guess which
one sorry application to some real were
plication sand for allocation allocating
resources as well so today I'm going to
talk about another branch of work I'm
doing which is about computation
sustainability this network is more
applied work and today I'm going to
explain two lines of work sounds like
this one is not working two problems
which are kind of is you need and the
first one is for optimizing efficiency
of Tanks a systems in the second where
is about some recent work on your next
trick vehicle charging station placement
so I'm gonna start from the first one so
this is a real world problem I observed
after I when I was working in Beijing so
after i finished my postdoc and USC
Southern California in Los Angeles into
some 12 I spend my day in Beijing to
work and chinese academy science then i
am living in beijing now one problem i
found is it's super difficult to take a
taxi especially during rush hour I
waiting like two hours to wait for a
taxi but i still cannot attack see I saw
taxi is driving by empty but they were
not stop they just do not want to take
you lots of people observe that so i
guess as you are now tanks the system is
extremely important it's huge and it's
fully disputes and decentralize because
each thanks israeli somehow they're kind
of self-interest because they are driven
by the revenue they want to earn more
money normally the transistor system is
efficient and hard to manage and
optimize so that that's what we're
talking about so this what's happening
in Beijing as i mentioned i just could
not find can fan tanks during rush hour
then a lot of people observe this issue
then people start to think about whether
it's because page in we just do not have
enough taxes but the government said now
we have in
taxis but what's happening is during
rush hour so we see something exists
this is like one day dear Josh are we
see not sub customers are waiting for
taxis in on cue Nexus but and see at the
same time lots of taxis are talking and
big parking lot or just pocket another
street they just do not want to work so
then after that every time when I took
taxi I start to talk to the tanks driver
what's happening then they told me in
Beijing there the attacks if the affair
is basically determined by the distance
but we all know that the traffic
congestion is extremely is traffic
extremely heavy in beige interior char
but the affair is always the same during
the day which means during rush hour
they cannot move fast they cannot earn
money but during rush hour even they are
driving slowly but the gas cost is even
higher you have this experience when
you're stopped and drive stop drive the
gas cost is much higher so if they work
during rush hour they will lose money so
that's a phenomena then we start
thinking about perhaps you can somehow
solve this problem just using this
simple idea just increase the fair price
to Russia this extremely simple and it
has been used in many other countries
neck Singapore the country i'm leaving
now so in singapore from 4pm to 8pm they
have the fear is increased by another
twenty-five percent basically text
drivers can earn more when they work
dear lush are so but it probably is how
much should be the optimal price that's
the problem we're trying to solve now so
basically we we need to solve the
problem we need to model this thang SI
market we need to model the taxi drivers
there
revenue as well as you know how you know
we will not do more optimizations how
the efficiency is perfectly by the fair
price this is super complete complex
tanks these systems because there are
many factors with complex
interdependencies my customer demand
congestion naval travel speed customer
waiting time for instance if the the
fear is too high obviously not customers
will not take taxi because it's too
expensive also if the congestion is to a
congestion naval also is determined by
the number of taxes taxes on the road
right more taxes then the congestion
would be even worse in also travel speed
or see our faculty by many other factors
so come with a complete complex system
and this changes over time because the
norm of the amount will change over time
so a shower the demand is higher normal
t-money's higher in inertia is as we
just mentioned tanks drivers or super
Street HPS dispatch system or you just
have a flat rock so what do you mean
like get a central dispatch system for
no no no it's fully disputed neck in
Beijing thank you well that's something
we have not considered in this paper
that something's you're in new I guess
that would be something interesting to
New can the new technology a grouper or
other signs how that were affecting the
ou-texas systems but for here we just
assume taxis are just driving on a road
if you see a tank you just ask them to
stop and take taxi but that should be
something interesting to extend it this
mod
do you know what kind of a pricing model
we were at wise or I do not know to be
honest I guess that would be something
something interesting I heard some
people did some work on that but it's
not published 22 new can howl o / you
know will affect the efficiency of a
taxi system sounds like this result is
quite negative but it's not published
but I guess it's quite interesting to
explore corrugated paper is yokai by a
Shiite some people like they interviewed
some extra drivers of how they perceive
the surge pricing and how they actually
work so they gave some assumptions for
that and also we also have time as the
price factors so let me just continue
Texas driver we assume their strategic
they just want to optimize their
objective to earn more money but
obviously they also have some
constraints as I just mentioned
self-control perfect driven and they
also have some scheduling constraints
for instance they cannot work for 24
hours per day they have to take briefs I
guess that's why in Beijing lots of taxi
drivers they choose to take a break
during rush hour because you have to
have dinner for instance that right time
for them to do that so well for more
during this market there has been not
work in the transportation science
literature for modeling how different
factors are fake each other what what
would be the dependency the step since
we just follow the ideas from the that
literature to build their their system
model then we need to deal with the
strategic taxi driver in solve this
problem so this is maximum equation how
we model different factors you just
fully glory the details but all the
equations are from
transportation science literature how
different factors will reflect each
other how the number of drivers how the
travel speed is determine how they you
know how the witching time is decided
based on the number of normal traffic
normal cars the number of normal cars in
number of taxes and driven it everything
so we have this type since both the idea
from transportation science and this is
pretty much the system model we're
basically issue how the different
factors affect each other so we have
this fair price f then we have the
number of sort of customer system
efficiency which in time travel speed
load condition this step since I will
not talk about details but they're all
interdependent I guess basically the
problem self it's like a pine Ava
optimization problem so what we want to
help is to help the government to decide
the optimal fair price to maximize the
efficiency of the taxi system what do we
mean by efficiency it is a number of
serve customers we want to maximize that
number now after we decided if you're
after the government decides a fair
price like rush hour how much you will
charge per kilometer then the texas
drivers they will play the game to
decide what is their optimal schedule
their strategy the earth strategy will
definitely affect the system efficiency
so this that's why this is like a binary
optimization problem then the higher
level the government decides a price and
in only about tank see players taxi
drivers play the game and they just then
i compute equilibrium and execute a
creamer strategy and you couldn't bear
strategy basically depends on it the
variable in the
navel the the tax market the fair price
and which will affect the system
efficiency is this clear mm efficient
occur near the number of serve customers
is there always more customers than they
can be served well I guess number one is
that is just the one we use in the in
our current model but obviously this can
be extended to many our sins to combine
different since this is reasonable
because any beginning if you if you want
to minimize the number of unserved
customers then that's easy you just set
the price to be infinite extremely high
because nobody wants to take a taxi the
number of unserved customer is 0 which
is minimized so that's why we want to
somehow maximize the number serve
customers so and each time point given
you know the the current situation the
fair price is a congestion level we can
compute how many people want to take
taxi that is a demand and with it the
amount only some number can be served by
the system that's something we want to
maximize yes you put another metric
system what you may pass you like the
number of customers that were served per
unit of three okay oh we all okay so
this is equivalent because we just treat
the number of served customer during
each hour yeah so it's kind of
equivalent yeah okay
so so we consider the tanks to everest
behavior the step saying is i think i
already talked about that let me talk
about tanks driver strategy tank is very
stylish basically it's a schedule
they're pure strategy schedule basically
it says one example is what pure to work
and then what what pure to to take a
break my example is i get up and five
work for three hours and take for a
break full hour and start work again for
an hour for and take a break for another
two or something like that it's a
schedule so then they have many
schedules and this will exponentially
increase with the number of periods over
a day let's see one day we divided this
day to 24 periods in each pillar
difference one hour then we the schedule
which means which our high will work
which are I would take a break now
something exists and the each drivers
straight edge basically it's a mixed
strategy it's a dispute over the pure
strategies different type of schedules
so each schedule has a perp unit perp
unity so it's appropriate distribution
in in given the probability distribution
x.x I let's say we have em pure strategy
for each driver and we know the
distribution then based on that we can
compute the number of Tanks drivers and
each period right because here in our
current model we do not differentiate
different tanks drivers we assume they
all follow the same strategy that is
there something we have not considered
the difference between different taxi
drivers so you know given each thanks to
our stretch we can compute an each
period how many taxi drivers their work
on the road then based on which is P
then based on that we can compute
you know the congestion everson exact
and obviously for each text driver they
want to maximize compute the optimal
distribution to maximize their utility
function which is their revenue okay so
as we know as a destination trains the
drivers they have some scheduling
history for instance they cannot work
continuously extremely long time every
day they might work for and most 18
hours and also they cannot work for okay
continuous work for more than maybe six
hours and they have take a break and
also the everyday they cannot work for
more than 18 hours sometimes you have
those type constraints so this
constraints are used to generate the
feasible schedules of the taxi drivers
so as I just mentioned this is basically
by naval condition problem we optimize
system efficiency and taxi drivers
optimize their eternity so from the
government perspective we are the same
variable is f which is a fair price in
each each time period in with that each
tankers driver they compute the
equilibrium zero option price given the
strategy of other tanks drivers and the
third prize decided by the government
yes so that simplifies is setting a not
so some difficulties number one is as we
just mentioned thanks to our strategy
based exponential increase with the
number of periods that's something we
have to deal with so we come up some
different solution algorithms so I'm
going to briefly talk about tree
algorithm number one is an from schedule
measured then which is published in each
have a certain then we have
number two and number three which is
published a mess this year so so number
one number two which only consider
constraints the two concerned I just
nation but in fact in some other
settings we might have many other
constraints especially in cities in
China for instance in lots of cities the
government set up can students such as
if you work until 4pm you have to
continuous work until seven or eight you
cannot switch you have to continuous
work because the government observes
that not tax drivers they do not want to
take passengers in a journalist are so
if you work on three or four you have to
continuous work something like that they
have those type constraints for instant
market recognition cannot switch in pic
time the step sayings so then we also
come up as a new approach which is can
handle this up to our constraints so for
those first to constrain we can come up
polynomial time algorithm and for this
one it's extremely hard in we come up
some algorithm which is not a polynomial
but still very efficient when we try
different settings okay so because of a
time I guess I will not talk about the
details but give you with a high near
will taste of these techniques we use to
solve this problem so the first episode
which is called antrim schedule
basically each n term schedule the
definition of schedule which is a
continuous working section yes schedule
so for this is a pure strategy we have
three and room schedules the number one
which works from one two three four then
the second one is from 56 from seven
eight nine so what we can see is even
they're the number of pure strategy like
this will exponentially increase ways
you know the number periods but the
number of animal schedule which is
polynomial which is much smaller so our
key idea is instead of computing the
distribution of these pure strategies we
compute the probability of these animals
gauges which is much easier to solve and
after we compute this we can do them
back to get the probe unity speaking of
those pure strategies so that's the key
idea and we can prove if we can compute
this optimal optimal perp inning of this
animal schedule we can get exact pure
strategy mixed strategy distribution
which is man choose this the probability
distribution over the annum schedule so
that simplifies the problem that's how
it works so that the first episode the
second episode is we just can the the
the consumer the to constrain we I just
mentioned and we come up a linear
program are so the key idea is is
motivated by the to the plantation of of
polytope so for each part hope there are
two the plantations one is based on
extreme points the other is based on
half space so if we look at this problem
if each schedule can be treated as a
extreme point now so our the second
approach we use is we just convert the
interpretation to to the vertex
definition to have space representation
and so forth is a vertex representation
each vertex is a pure strategy a
schedule it's something like this
but the number of then we have an
arsonist half-space reputation of the is
constraint the number of has the number
of concern is much much smaller that's a
key idea for solving this are for
solving this problem so half space
representation is much much more compact
as compared with the vertex depredation
so i will grow the details but basically
we come up this so basically here says a
convex polytope has many vertex but much
for your assets for instance and n
dimensional cube we have 2 2 to the
power of n vertices but only to an
assets so we just convert the vertex
which vertex is the schedule into the
half space exactly exactly because
because because of this two constraints
we so far we just consider to constrain
to one number one is they cannot work
for two now per day number two is they
cannot continuous work for two now so
there's some special structure we have
proofs in the paper in our paper see a
optimal is a presentation of the
half-space corresponds to the exact
location based on the vertex ok
constraints in this case will play super
500 makes this much complicated we
cannot apply this anymore yeah strange
that is that that's true obviously those
two are quite simple so only number one
is you cannot work for more than 18
hours per day number two is you cannot
continuous work for more more than four
hours so those are two where is
reasonable but extremely intuitive
constraints so but if you can see the
other apt or constraints we cannot do
that I guess that's why our anthem
schedule herbage can work after you
compute the probability over a drum
schedule you can go back to you
fan is a corresponding mixed storage
because this too concerned are simpler
but if you can see the object constraint
you cannot do that you might not find
their mixed village which can give you
the perp ending of the animal schedule
ok so this that's the idea the half
space representation is quite simple is
something like this and and we can now
we can solve this problem extremely
efficient so another approach is another
problem is now we start to consider some
other object constraints as some concern
edge estimation in that case we can
choose that the existing two methods
cannot work anymore so then the problem
now we need to go back to the the exact
schedule the vertex definition of the
strategies which is too too big and we
cannot solve that so then we come up
this absolute called floor or a so the
idea is somehow very similar to column
in generation in solving large scale in
a linear program problem or optimization
program so we start with a small pure
strategy set a small number of vertex in
this vertex reputation of the stratus
base we try to construct by doing that
we have a small problem and we solve
that problem and then we find a new
strategy which can be used to improve
the solution if we can find that we end
it to this small problem this isn't
predation and we continue to do that
until we cannot find a new vertex new
pure strategy which can improve the
solution of this problem if we cannot
find another one then it stops when we
find out the optimal solution it's very
similar and the basic idea is similar to
column generation but we have to tune it
to make it work for our problem so
that's the high level of idea
we used to solve this problem so we did
some experience based on the garment
data for instance in for Beijing we can
easily find in the data about the
traffic everything from the government
reports basically we have a song x
results and it will also see the how our
price can improve the system efficiency
and we did find there could be fifteen
percent increase in terms of system
efficiency and we also find that if we
have other constraints as and irma can
obscure constraints we have to turn to
the new algorithm because if we just use
a solution based on the two simple
constraints the solution might be may
not be good so I'm not going to talk
about details but with some high no idea
so it helps so any questions so far or
you can ask me questions in the end so
now I'm going to move to the second prob
yes I guess um the travel time is also
included into the fair oh yeah yes how
what kind of business you go there's
also different oh yeah um I get your
nuts we are not kissing relapse so this
is very interesting because so in China
did you consider that but that has been
a small weak because what because tanks
drivers they may play with that if you
that part is too big you know they want
to earn more revenue so the government
is very sensitive there is that
component but it's very small would be
the driver selecting your out that is
gonna take a long time for ya yeah
exactly because take it raw that's gonna
be far away so that you can
with respect mr. that's true i think
these things you know basically the
driver has the experience is it might
know which route is more vulnerable so I
guess normally they will not do that
otherwise a customer's could complain so
I guess that's not the biggest issue
except yours you do not know that CD
your strangers then they might do
something yes possibility is that
there's one route that is the shortest
but it's very but yeah very congested so
yeah yeah 22 so it there this is very
interesting problem and there has been
many studies so basically we just lord
that part because their their money lots
of interesting things could happen okay
sorry is there any possibility that the
constraints like we should consider a
coupler like c1 just won't bc one of
course or of course I guess c1 c2 are
quite reasonable I guess they both
happen in every city every scenario but
there may be some Erica students depend
on the current policies that the
connection markers you connect you this
type since ok so I'll get you move to
the second problem this is also some
real-world problem i found this problem
where I move to Singapore Singapore is
trying to introduce more electric
vehicles because we all know it has many
benefits they sign contract with some
companies and they were introduced your
neck took vehicles perhaps starting from
passes then you know taxis then the
government's need to build charging
stations
now so if the charge at home sorry
there's some problems with the slides do
it will take a much longer time but if
the chuck in charging station it's very
fast so now it is point five hours but
actually they just need five minutes
based on some new technology it's super
efficient so definitely there is a need
to build charging stations in the city
now the question is where to be a black
so that's problem we are trying to look
at so the problem is somehow similar to
the the tax efficiency problem in the
sense still in hand with a high level
it's still buy Nevel optimization
problem and higher level the
government's decide where to put
charging stations after that drivers car
drivers decide work charge they're still
playing game it's more it's somehow
similar to congestion game somehow
because they're still self-interested
they make their best best choice in
consideration of other sins I guess the
question is how to how to handle this I
guess we hope that this approach can be
used to help the Singapore government to
decide where to build charging stations
so still motivated by your work club so
there's something special we want to
consider in this problem singapore it's
a very small country where a small CD
from the west to the east if there's no
traffic 30 minutes you can drive through
the country where small but traffic
congestion is a big concern to the
government the government tried
everything to innovate the congestion
and we're thinking whether we can do
something smart by smartly allocating
the charging station we can somehow
improve the traffic congestion
because people will if the charge that
will have some effect on the traffic
congestion one simple example is if you
put all the charging stations at
downtown so everyone need to church in
downtown downtown is already extremely
crowded or highly congested if they
drive to downtown to charge then it will
get worse so that's something in your
mind perhaps we can consider that and
something we want to optimize your
locating the charging station so this is
a man pub Singapore since the modern
episodes we use here we divided the
Singapore cd2 since that's a problem we
want to assign a number of B of chargers
two end zones such a minimize the use
cost of all the v's I will talk about
the usage costs inator so uh in I will
talk about the problem modeling and our
solution so the modern part is the basic
ideas Nexus we divide is a country in
too many zones each zone can be 3d as a
small error in singapore's you basically
have 28 zones or something and each song
we know we have lots of data about how
many cars there are people's trembling
panting those type scenes so we can
easily get data then we can do
experiments based on those data so we
divided the country the city into many
zones and each zone there your cars EV
cars and their engines and in total we
have beach others and each dome we have
some v's and we have some chargers and
XR is something we want to optimize we
want to that's our decision variable
that's our mobile and the charting cost
of each EV basically depends on the
travel time if I charge how much time
how much what's it's hammer time
and that's one in arson is a congestion
a coon time and the charging station
because if there's a charging station
there's so many cars we are waiting then
the Korean time is a cost so each zone
they congest the charging straight edge
of each zone is the property of charging
and different zones for instance for if
I'm leaving and the zone to so for this
simple scenario so my strategy would be
charged and his own two ways propene ep2
to charge station is on tree and whisper
bidding p 2 3 and charge and some one
and with that probability so that our
strategy the strategy face of each EV is
a zone so then we can formulate this by
never opens nation problem in in higher
level the government is trying to
optimize to minimize the social cost the
social cost could be innocent so in our
model we consider the congestion or the
cost of all the EV drivers could be
anything or any different combination
with different weights whatever let's
some sense the government try to
optimize and each EV is try to minimize
your charging costs as i mention
includes the travel time perhaps the
coon time could be something else for
instance how much the distance they need
to travel not just char more time
because that could be something
different okay so let's still quite
similar to the model for the taxi system
efficiency optimization problem now
still we need to solve this equilibrium
in the bottom in the in the second level
in the Norn avo well here we just
consider are they have a budget in terms
of the total number of chargers they can
put but could be innocent for instance
in this song we can only build and the
most five
or in Arizona we can build and most at
least 10 or something we can put into
that into the optimization problem yes
well okay that's that's a decision
variable I mean you're talking about the
data how many how many UV cars in each
zone so for the experiments because we
know how many cars &amp;amp; H zone then prams
we just assume ten percent of cars will
be EV cars so we just use that model
make that assumption I mean I'm just
income like how the other gasoline
stations for for what for the gas in the
gas stations how they're built I do not
know I guess that's because those
stations were built not all time ago I
guess obviously it's not decided by some
agron perhaps just they have observation
we need more gas station and this
necessarily just build one chopped 2
miles over time for the comment beyond
reasonable tea clattering gasps oh well
that a good one you're talking about
they can stew into those type since I
guess for instance perhaps for some gas
station they have animated space they
just could not and more EV charging
station in that space and also obviously
we have to think about the cooling time
although step since but yeah I mean if
you're talking about other constraints
that definitely something we can
consider if you are talking about it for
instance construction costs if we put in
gas station perhaps that's cheaper
whatever we can add the step signs into
this this framework hey
so that's pretty much our model I guess
the problem of this the difficulty is
still how to solve this problem I guess
the most difficult part is the bottom
level we're trying to compute the
equilibrium so we consider Nash
equilibrium basically nobody wants
divide to another charging strategy
probe in this version now how to specify
that constraint let me just explain it
with a high level nashik converse is
giving your charging distribution probe
in this version if my ukrainian
distribution is X I have no incentive to
choose another X prime so which means in
the constraint we have to say for any x
prime x is better but the problem here
is X prime is a distribution the space
is in finite we just cannot need
infinite number concern into this
problem that's the difficulty of solving
this problem what we did in a very high
level we started looking the the
structure of those constraints and we
convert this infinite number of
constraint into a set of finite number
constraint which are equivalent then
we're able to solve this problem that's
invaded high level so I guess the
problem is we have you know in my number
of constraints so yeah so National mercy
is so each of us is a driver you have a
strategy which basically say is the
probability of charging and this charge
stationary charges stage natural
criminals is for each player given your
strategy I have no incentive to choose
another one so if micron mustard is X it
has to I have to have the constraint for
any x prime x is better but X prime is a
continuous because it's a probability
distribution they're just you find a
number of constraint that's not that we
cannot specify this
since into this you know whatever bye
Nevel you know linear or non convex so X
prime is we have to we have to represent
the Nash equilibrium as constraints but
if we want to different that they're
just in fact a number of constraints
yeah because we're assuming they're
playing magic remember because it did
evic drivers they're playing game there
because they are competing because too
many drivers come to the same charges
station a coon time could be huge this
is the agency's problem right yeah we're
trying to help with the government to
decide where to put chatted station the
gold problem is very complicated but
you're saying we have queuing
constraints and other thing that makes
the problem very non linear that's true
that's true well they're basically in
transportation science or those types
and there are many equations some are
nonlinear deafening some are convex and
I guess in your model we use some the
most widely used you know the Prudential
orders type scenes from the
transportation science literature to zip
present you know how different factors
will affect each other okay so this is a
creator we used in simple division so as
I just mentioned national currency is
given X I have no incentive to change to
X prime but X prime could be quite
different from X in terms of I change
their probability for each zone so here
we just consider simple deviation we
only change the charging station into
zones so that's so for instance uh let's
say my Ukraine must read so I guess the
simple deviation is here so
delta p2 which is my division I might
change my probe initi and each zone for
instead of p21 there are P due to their
p23 that is a division normal division
but now we just consider simple division
basically we just consider changing
charging strategy and two zones for
instance here of the second line we just
change this strategy in zone 1 and zone
2 lets the third one we just change one
and three so um what we shoe is that
given the problem we proved that if for
a driver affilliate driver has no
incentive to make a simple deviation the
driver has no incentive to make a normal
division then we can convert the
original problem we're we specify a Nash
equilibrium as normal division two
simple deviation which those two
problems are equivalent we further
analyze the simple deviation and convert
still we have a new finite number of
constraints but in the end we can
analyze this problem and we can turn
this into a finite number of constraints
but I will glory the details you can
find our funding in the paper so now in
the end we come up we can zipper in this
problem as an optimization program and
in the end we can come up solution
algorithms to solve this problem because
of the time I wake Laura the details and
we different searches this is on time
comparison and we compare this with many
benchmark approaches in turns out our
approach is better in terms of
optimizing the system efficiency the
government efficiency the government
objectives the social cost so that's
pretty much the two problems and veda hi
know they're definitely many future work
to do for instance for the text this is
from official optimization your current
model we do not consider we assume all
times
drivers are the same obviously we can
consider heterogeneous taxes and taxi
drivers and so we are soon each human
beings everyone is food international
that that is not realistic so I know MSR
has not people doing urban computing you
know this type since you should have
lots of data about how he pins will make
this in such scenarios then you could
put human behavior model into this model
and obviously we have not considered the
impact of up based services like uber
and admin our sins and also we just
consider a whole city perhaps the CCD
lots of spatial memories can be
considered as well so for EV charging
station still human behavior in arson we
are working on now is assuming that next
Singapore the charging station have been
decided now whether we can do something
to optimize the traffic by changing the
price and each charging station that's
something we're considering now which is
still quite as realistic because traffic
is just huge problem for Singapore the
biggest problem for Singapore because
city needs are complaining the
government is trying everything they
could to help with you know the
congestion whatever in our thing I want
to point out is the second problem you
know this is called a placement problem
the Singapore government is also
interesting in some other sins they want
to know the Chester done some ground co
about similar problems they want to know
where to build schools were to build
hospitals so that they can help with you
know the traffic the people do not need
to you know take a long way to go to
school or go to the hospital obviously
when for to solve these problems we need
to build a preference model how people
will make make decision based on
different factors and then try to
optimize our problem so I
I feel there has been also work on Big
Data try to just make give people
suggestions just purely based on the
historical data but our switch is more
from model-based approach we just assume
people are fully strategic they will
always compute the cranium so I guess
there should be something in the middle
based on some human modeling behavior
modeling and with some you know the
scheme theoretical model I think that
could be more realistic because his
tiered data only the prints they passed
but people we always play games we
always when we make decisions we always
consider what other people might do so I
believe there should be something in the
middle try to combine both to make the
knife you know everyone's knife much
better I think there should be lots of
work coming down in this I was the
emerging error thank you so r any
questions please let me know thank you I
think this human our site in all of this
is the worst super important for
implementing them in the real world so
for both systems how does the solution
of the optimization is something that
you can describe to a taxi driver or to
a person who wants to use a charge
installation easily okay this is how
you're not paid or it is dynamic
changing every day what would be a good
way to kind of Express the outcome of
the system to the users um okay so what
do you mean by outcome for example the
taxi of system efficiency optimization
system optimize these parameters of that
fail yep no action right so now you need
to express the superfecta driver so that
drivers can make a decision about you
working at rush hour how does that
interface dating this time I look like
types of drivers you mean tell
passengers yeah because there's a new
fare system books right yeah yes is how
we are going to do is it is it something
easy to extract to them or is there a
challenge in kind of making them
understand how their that's a perfect
question so for our model we basically
just try to compute the open price for
the usher I think that's something which
can be easily understood by drivers and
citizens obviously we can consider more
complicated cases for instance we come a
price for each period and but that's
more complicated so for transportation
science there has been lots of
interesting human behavior study him
except experiments as remembering in
some cities in Europe then people come
up this idea a tournament decide new
price every time we take a taxi you just
negotiate with a taxi driver that's
extremely flexible what's happening is
nobody wants to take taxi why because
human beings we want some predictability
if we feel that's not something
predictable we will switch to other
since we were tactic passes or a subway
is the step sense but that's something
very interesting so obviously if you
want journey I guess human behavior
modeling is needed here you if you want
to make extremely complicated pricing
scheme which is not realistic it's may
not work in practice I guess that's
something you need it I guess we just
consider maybe just rush hour price and
normal our price that's it I guess
that's either in let people know this
you know once then guess that something
can be easily adopted by the government
and accepted by citizens
it actually estimates how much fear you
have to be actually ok so its like
before hand you will be like prepared
like okay this is some one on one of
bacon so you can decide whether you want
to take the axiom so yeah there has been
some interesting human experience to
study people's behavior human beings are
extremely complicated yes would you work
well I every time I when I was taking
except always talk to them they feel
this is good research do like they will
think about to work during rush hour so
if the price is higher against this will
definitely work but I did not talk to
the government because later i just went
to Singapore if I stay in Beijing I with
I think i would definitely talk to
government perhaps it could consider
something exists but I guess the key
takeaway message here is for any problem
of emulation problem whatever evolved
human beings some games theoretical
thinking is needed because we were kind
of somehow strategic in making decisions
thank you
