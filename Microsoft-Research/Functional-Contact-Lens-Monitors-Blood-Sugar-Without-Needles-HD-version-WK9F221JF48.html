to call it is the it's a new area of
research where we're trying to really
make the computer ubiquitous trying to
make it behind the scenes you may be
using it and you don't even know that
it's there imagine being able to overlay
digital images on the real world
seamlessly at any given time I'm walking
through the hallways of this building
you could overlay directions and arrow
and the floor that followed me around
the building when I walk into a grocery
store a natural user interface will be
customizable to me so when I walk in the
things that are important to me may be
missing on the shelves of my cupboards
are the things that pop out at me
walking down the street I could put
people's names up people that I
recognize people that I might want to
recognize information about them the
possibilities are endless
the project we've been working with
Babak Parvez and his lab at the
University of Washington we're calling
the functional contact lines in the
healthcare domain what we attempting to
do is to build the contact lens that can
monitor the health status of the person
we're in there people were not convinced
that this was doable a lot of people
consider science fiction and destiny and
Microsoft Research were rarely on
convinced that this is a work hard and
they were willing to work with us and
support us very grateful they did that
my name is Kevin McFeely and I was
diagnosed with type 1 diabetes 30 years
ago my two children also have type 1
diabetes I'm used to testing myself six
to eight times per day but boy when I
think about my children I mean you have
a spring-loaded needle that's coming
into your finger and it hurts some and
that's hard to watch sometimes it's
really hard one of the functional
contact lens would allow someone like
Kevin to do basically the pop this
contact lens in and to never have to
worry about measuring their glucose
levels again we've been able to put a
glucose sensor on a contact lens and
show that it can detect glucose at
levels that are found in the tear film a
broader group actually has design a bit
small radios that can interface with
this glucose sensor and send out the
information wirelessly thinking about
the functional contact lens for my
children I think that would be
incredible monitoring their blood sugar
through their tears as opposed to having
to prick their finger six to eight times
per day that's really cool and given
that my children are diagnosed that so
it's a young age it does have the
potential to help them live a longer
healthier life whenever you work with
very competent informed and capable
people you learn so that really has been
my experience working with Microsoft
well in which we don't think about
physical or digital being different at
all
is one that I think we're marching
towards and is really exciting too I
think what's really exciting about
natural user interfaces is the fact that
it will give us all enhanced lives it
makes us more of what we are
