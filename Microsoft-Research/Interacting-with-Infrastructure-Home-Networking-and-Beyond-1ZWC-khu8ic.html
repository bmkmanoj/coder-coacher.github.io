you
image and is now at the computer lab
right here I'm treaty tell us about his
work on home networking that he did
while at round booty okay thanks thank
you for having me back i should say i
guess i'd say i've just started the
computer lab I've moved down from the
University of Nottingham the work of
describing here was carried out while I
was at University Nottingham so it was a
episode project involving Nottingham and
some of the collaborators including tip
so the talks going to be about the
experiences we had during that project
some of the things we did and then how
that's leading into what I expecting is
the things I'm going to be investigating
for the next couple of years at least so
it was sort of my current agenda I guess
you'd say the basic question that
started off with this project was it was
about home networking so what it turned
into was how to redesign infrastructures
to be accessible and manageable by
non-expert users and it was focused
particularly on on Wi-Fi networking in
the home or networking generally in the
home I found an interesting project to
join join when i arrived at nottingham
so it had already started about about 10
months 11 months i think before i joined
nottingham because it was mixing a very
human centric techniques like ethanol
feeling so on with actually trying to
build technologies build home reuters
technologies deploy them and get them to
work in real life as it says there is a
three-year project was funded by the
epsrc than rcuk at the university to
Nottingham glasgow and imperial college
and then BTW and microsoft research with
the industrial partners in it and we
also collaborate in a bit with georgia
tech through this so they're kind of
co-conspirators in this the motivation
for the project was really the
observation that domestic networking is
a problem so I will do the traditional
thing now hands up who's got a Wi-Fi
network or other network technology at
home hands up who's really happy with it
and finds it utterly satisfactory in
every respect hands up who has to go and
help other parents siblings children
manage their networks at home yeah you
see it's kind of the traditional sort of
proportions there
so the argument we'd maker think is one
of the reasons that these technologies
are difficult for people to deploy and
use in domestic context is that most the
technologies involved have been
appropriated from other contexts so
they've been taken from managed networks
typically whether those a broadband
weathers risp networks or whether their
corporate networks where you've got
experts and you've got experts engaged
in the process and managing them and
making them work efficiently and
effectively so people know what they're
doing they know what everything means
they know how to interpret stuff and
we've taken all these things just drop
them in the home and expected people to
kind of catch up and this has forced
people in the home forced at least
usually somebody some individual at home
to have to become some kind of net admin
or system administrator and this is not
something that most people want to do I
think it's fair to say so the kind of
the sort of the way we approach this was
how can we how can we try and make some
of these technologies a bit more
intelligible to people and so this was a
learning experience for me learning the
difference in the word intelligible and
intelligent so the aim here is not to
try and make home networking automatic
and automated so you never have to do
anything to it because the chances are
you can't do that you can't do that
successfully and when you try and do it
it's going to work some of the time and
that'll be great then it's going to fail
and now the disastrous because you won't
have a clue what's happening you wanna
have a clue how to fix it or how to
engage with it if you can make it
intelligible if you can turn it into
something that people can engage with
make am fix and they can understand to
the extent they need to then you can
make something that's a lot easier for
people to manage in their particular
context in their particular home in
their particular lives and take into
account all of the different differences
around the way it's used the aim here is
not to automate everything it's to make
it possible for people to use it
effectively and to manage it themselves
the sort of context we were dealing with
so this is the sort of vision people
have Oh future or at least it was a
vision some people had of the future um
who's got children here anybody with
children recognize that sort of picture
your house ever that tidy so this is a
lot of these visions where I think we're
not fully informed by reality
this was the kind of thing and some of
the ethnographic studies of a dog that
you see when you go and take photos of
people home networks and home computing
environments obviously a little bit
dated now who has CRT's anymore but
they're quite messy quite complicated
bits of trading cables things plugged in
other things plugged into other things
plants sitting on top of things it's
this is not a corporate managed
environment right it's not a data center
this is certainly not a data center and
these are the kind of things that we
found in the houses that were went to be
investigated right people are taping
bits of cable to the stairs and so on to
try and get connectivity in two
different bits of the house and there
were the extent that there are companies
or at least there are journeyman join us
who will come and make you cabinets and
install your gear in the cabinets and
clip it all up and make it tied in give
it door so you can shut it away so it
doesn't like a big mess in the lounge as
an example being here so there's there's
a lot of them there's a big difference
there I think between the vision people
have of the way things are going to be
and how things actually get deployed and
used and managed and part of this is
about taking that into account I'm
trying to think more about what actually
happens same kind of things apply in
people's heads to some extent so
conceptions that this was a diagram
drawn by for the ward family house you
can read them in the corner the ward
family house networking diagram it was
entered in the cisco competition it won
an award best home network as you can
see this is quite a.m. this is a
substantial home network there are
mixers network storage jet printers
there's a catalyst 2924 switch in there
this is I think not your average home
network there was a project done
actually strictly outside homework
slightly before I joined the project
where the aim was try and get people to
sketch their home networks so these were
a couple of the sketches that came up
with though people came up with when
they were trying to see if their own
networks so in the top left there you've
got the more technical of the to the
partners involved in this and it's
pretty hard to read now but you've got
some basic idea of what's going on there
so the internet there's SBC provide the
cable connection
and as dsl modem there's a print server
hub Rueter there's a printers attached
by wires to the print server you've got
some Wi-Fi connectivity so there's
there's an understanding of the devices
in the network and how they how they're
attached and how they managed the less
technical of the partners had a picture
of the house on two floors there is a
front door there's a table with a laptop
on and then there is a bed with a laptop
on as well if you could read some of
those words you would see things like
creating energy waves that communicate
with other computers and I think maybe
eat our frontal lobes it's one of the
comments made and crazy waves that fight
with our neighbors crazy waves so
there's a bit of understanding of
interference there and this can be a
problem other home networks around in
the area may provide a problem but as
you can see it's a lot less of a
technical conception of what's going on
there's a big mismatch here and these
are the tools that people mostly build
to manage networks and they're not
really going to fit with the carnot
conception on the previous slide right
the idea of understanding timelines and
graphs and pie charts and not that we
like pie charts to polish your topology
diagrams and so on these are it's going
to be difficult I think for people to
match up with their experience of what's
going on so you end up with I don't know
what some of those things are short
people in audience do not some of these
more complex y5 parameters are but I
certainly don't and really giving people
these sort of tools to manage these
things it's not it's not helpful amusing
visual joke and so what went on in the
project there were there was basically
ethnographic studies of about twenty
four homes in total this is over I think
more than the strict lifetime of the
three years of the homework project and
it started doing some of the
ethnographic studies prices so twenty
four homes in the UK and in France I
believe variety of ways of engaging
without so tehnology tools getting
people to talk through what they've got
semi-structured interviews getting
people to describe give stories
basically anecdotes about problems
they'd had issues that have occurred and
the point of all this was to get an
understanding of the problems people
faced in real life it's not gathering
statistics ignition data it's trying to
get some of the richness of some of the
complexity of all this out in the open
so we can start to think about what we
do it as a response to it and so we're
looking at how people use their home
networks and how people manage their
home networks the color the headline
figures from all this so home networks
are very heterogeneous they're very
fluid and they're very mundane so it's
heading this collection of devices 5 to
15 devices per home in the homes that we
looked at at the time that you can
bridge was reported as being just under
5 so that's kind of this feels like the
right solid number quite a lot of
different devices so pcs laptops mobiles
but also games consoles media streaming
devices cameras radios and the number of
things here is only increasing all the
time the number of types of thing is
increasing the number of things is
increasing and you know Internet of
Things revolution taking off and all
that device ownership and access rights
are very fluid so there's relatively few
devices in the home where only a single
person ever uses it possibly your phone
perhaps you're less likely to learn that
all the people maybe but in most places
you know tablets would get shared around
so in our house the kids like using the
tablets play games on and occasion I
have to dive in and stop the
three-year-old buying things online
tuned because he's managed to get out of
the interface from the game that he's
playing so it's very fluid things are
getting passed around and shared it's
hard to be able to say this device
should be managed like this because it's
always used by the father in the house
so it's always used by that one of the
kids in the house and digital housework
has become this unremarkable feature so
somebody in the house will be
responsible for managing the network
right that'll be just something they do
from time to time though then they'll be
used to it so people come round they'll
be the person who gets finds the Wi-Fi
password and gets people connection if
you want to do that so it's quite a.m.
it's become a normal a normal feature
and this sort of happened over the
lifetime of the project I said this was
over a three-year funded project about
five years work in total and over that
time Wi-Fi really did become just
default standard assumption it would be
there
out of all this data there were sort of
four key challenges that we kind of
extracted from an understanding of what
people were doing and challenges to the
infrastructure that's being provided so
the first ones consumption so it's how
do we control and understand the
bandwidth of use of the network they saw
something people wanted to be able to do
sort of quotes that we got from some of
the interviews I want to see an
accumulative historical record of
bandwidth use so the current month week
day so I can see patterns of use other
time in this particular case this
household they have an international
student who came to stay with them and
that student was doing a lot of video
watching from sites of a base in the Far
East and this was blowing through the
bandwidth cap the bt applied to this
household and so they wanted to get some
visibility into that so they could then
go to the student and say look it is you
that's causing this could you you know
bug next retainer in a month to cover
the exit the increase in the banner it's
that we need the second one is so I'm
getting a cold song will be coughing a
lot second one is monitoring performance
and understanding activity so there was
a sort of an ongoing need to when
something starts happening you want to
get some visibility into that so in this
case the quotes are saying you know you
occasionally say is somebody torrenting
right it's affecting streaming video or
whatever is somebody must be doing
something what's going on at the moment
who do we have to go and tell to stop it
right who do we have to go and tell to
do that later on in the evening the
third one is mapped prioritization so
there were several at least a couple of
households where one of the parents
might for example work from home and so
they have the strong view that if they
were working from home they did not feel
that they should ever be interfered with
because the kids are decided to start
uploading YouTube videos or whatever it
was they wanted to be able to get on
with their work and not be affected in
any way and so those need to prioritize
I need to make those decisions and
dynamically during the day you it wasn't
enough to say now between nine and five
this is going to be the policy that
could be a bit too static you want to be
able to make these decisions on an
ongoing basis and then finally there was
policing so this is quite a common theme
children on facebook when they should be
revising for example and parents desire
to stop them going on facebook when they
should be revising or at least have some
way of negotiating
rolling that kind of behavior in this
particular case it got to the extent
that one of the mothers i think it was
bought a 3g dongle for her son so that
when he went to visited friends house
she didn't have to ask for the Wi-Fi
password at the friends house because
she knew that his son's friend's father
worked from home and so she didn't want
her son's activity on their network to
interfere with his working from home so
it was easy just to buy him a 3g dongle
and then it didn't matter when he went
visited he couldn't possibly interfere
with with use of the home network so
these are challenges consumption
monitoring prioritization policing so
what we tried to do to see to
investigate how we could address these
we focus attention on the home router
because this is a single point of
control singapore them access in the
house and it means we don't have to go
and start fiddling about with the 15
different types of client there are out
there and trying to understand how they
work and miss configure them and break
people's experiences and so the idea was
we build a home route to drop a home
Rueter in as a replacement in the house
essentially settle the existing home
reuters just as a modem and then deploy
it deploy a bunch of interfaces to it
and see how people used it see what
people did with it so we built a
platform some might say this is slightly
over engineered using open flow to
provide a DHCP server DNS interception
under control API and part of this was
an excuse to fill the open flow part of
it was because a lot of the existing
Linux api's this was based on the next
platform and not particularly good for
doing this kind of interception I
thought I find them difficult to deal
with so I thought I'd try something
different so in the home roots that we
had that basically the three technology
chunks that are in there we had a bunch
of software to do monitoring and so the
homework database and the USB device
monitor I'll come to in a bit that was
where the basic kind of statistics
gathering on the traffic the monitoring
and traffic took place and it presented
that information in a way that we could
write apps that would use the data that
was being made available being observed
through the homebrew turn the work was a
control interface so as I said this
provided dhcp server custom dhcp server
provided dns interception and it
provided a restful api so that we could
write apps to use on devices in the
network to interact with and man control
the Rue
and then we had traffic forwarding was
the standard condom that Linux bridging
and open V switch code there's nothing
specific interesting in that and
subsequently I had interned come in and
replace the homework database which was
it was a streaming database that was
developed by Joseph Entek and folk at
Glasgow which was quite interesting in
that you could download kind of automata
into it that would do computation on the
raw stats that were coming out of the
basic monitoring devices there and to
produce other kinds of statistics all
the kinds of data you might want but all
of the you is that we actually built to
interact with this thing just use the
basic flow table there was a ethernet
table with our SSI stats in it and there
was a dstv table to tell you who'd
connected which devices connected and
got which addresses and it turns out all
of those could be replaced by just using
the OpenFlow statistics messages that
were available through the open force
which anyway we built this thing went
through three iterations in total we
started deploying it from iteration 1
and they were deployed for four to six
months usually in the household so it
was quite long attitudinal deployments
and one of the reasons for that because
it in some sense it just makes your life
harder right you've got to manage this
thing and people you've got people
living with a device you've built that's
going to potentially break their home
network and when it does they get really
cross so having it making it reliable
and well engineered enough to work for
four to six months at a time did make
life more difficult the problem was if
you don't do that you get these kind of
dis novelty effects so a home network
displays traffic displays allowing
people to see what was going on had this
novelty affect everybody was very
interested to start with and within a
couple of weeks they'd had enough of
looking at it and they put it in a
drawer not bother anymore so they'd
ceased to engage with it so you get this
kind of burst of interaction at the
start where people get interested and
then once they've got some idea of
what's going on they put it away and
ignore it and so we needed to leave
things deployed sufficiently long that
they would actually encounter problems
or they would have a need to go and
interact with it again so something
would come up otherwise we weren't
really getting any real kind of
interaction with it it was interesting
that surfacing traffic usage
the phrase there was introduces domestic
discord so the network is a it's a piece
of instructor using the home and it's
intertwined with the moral ordering in
the home so when you start showing
people how the networks being used this
is not a completely neutral neutral
activity so having you know spouse's get
cross because they could see that the
other spouse had gone to the loo but was
actually using the network for example
right because they wanted to check their
email it wasn't appropriate to check
their email at the table that sort of
behavior right where you start to see
what people are doing by showing them
what the network's doing and this
becomes difficult can become difficult
but always become difficult candy and it
sort of least this idea that managing
the network is part of managing a
household so it's just part of what
happens people want to see what's going
on they want to get involved in this to
some extent because it is part of their
everyday lives as part of what they're
using but it can be quite difficult to
allow them to interact with it because
things like privacy in history so the
Rueter is collecting all this data is
collecting data about who's doing what
when they're doing it which devices are
doing it one of the types of activity
that was observed was that parents might
want to go and say to the children show
me your browser history I want to see
what you've been doing you told me you
weren't going to go and do that I want
to see what you've been doing well
that's kind of okay because you can do
that you can go and ask the person and
talk to them and get permission to do
that and see it you know have a
discussion about it when it's being
collected in the background and you can
just go look at it without having to ask
permission that changes the the
relationship changes the interaction
there and in fact at one point it's
arguable it also violates their human
rights so because they got everybody has
a right to privacy even as a child I
believe so it was quite it was it's sort
of doing this fairly what you might
think I was fairly boring deployment of
just a homebrew to actually started to
surface quite a lot of different
problems in this space so I'll talk a
bit now about interaction with
infrastructure so the things that we've
built the you is that we built to allow
people to do different things on this
network to try a try and address those
four challenges that came out of
observing what people were doing so they
are listed there and I'll go through
them in turn
so legibility so this was a baron of
that Knoll summarize the first so
legibility was allowing people to
measure and interrogate what was going
on so letting them see what was
happening and in a way that it could
make some kind of sense of putting
people in the protocol was allowing
people to interact as part of the
existing protocols this particularly
happened with dhcp so is it it was
changing the way that this is why we had
a custom dhcp server there were two
reasons for that one was we wanted to
change the way people interacted with it
so rather than having to pre configure
and set up in advance these are the
devices and these the addresses they're
going to get we want to allow people to
stop and think of them at the point
where somebody's trying to get on the
network get an address are we going to
allow this to happen or not the dhcp was
the easiest place we could do them and
the other reason for wanting a custom
server there is we wanted to deal with
the problem that too much gets short cut
at the ethernet layer and you can't
because of the way the monitoring of
structure worked we couldn't see all the
traffic necessarily so by handing out a
separate subnet to every device that
connected we could force everything to
be re-routed to make sure we saw all of
the traffic getting services close to
users allowed greater control and
configuration over how those services
were deployed and use this was DNS in
particular so what names are going to be
resolved will what sites are going to be
you're going to be allowed to connecting
we did some work looking at the physical
how to exploit the physical arrangement
of the home so this is something that
for example wouldn't be wouldn't be
reasonable to do in a large corporate
network it doesn't make any sense but in
the home you can do things with the
physical region where you can say well
if you're inside the house if you're
inside the front door and you've got
physical access to the router if you're
doing bad things I've got bigger
problems and then my home network so we
will use that physical action a physical
interaction as a way of allowing you to
control the network we provided a policy
Network policy definition interface
which somewhat to my surprise people
actually used and did define some
network policies that they deployed in
their home networks and actually made
use of again it was about simplifying
the interaction to the point where it
was something that was relevant to what
the people want people involved wanted
to do and then finally we looked at how
to try and fix device association Wi-Fi
Association because that was one of the
big pain points that came up in all the
observations he made that
getting devices on the network
particularly devices like well the
classic Internet of Things example of a
fridge but games consoles things that
you don't have keyboards on essentially
typing in long pass phrases and things
like this is awkward on those devices so
we tried to do something that would fix
that so sorry I'm going to keep doing it
so the legibility we looked at fairly
simplistic things just showing which of
the active devices and which of the
active protocols so we use the homework
database time series database captures
this traffic information real time can
capture user interactions user actions
at the same alongside network traffic
and then there was a simple notification
service that allowed people to be
notified when certain things happened we
build this we deploy this it was useful
in the case for example of the student
the foreign student who was watching
videos from the Far East it allowed the
thing was the mother in the household to
see what was happening and go be able to
go and have that discussion with them
about what was going on that worked
quite successfully that was something
that people found useful even though
it's pretty simple and it seems quite
sort of naive the presentation though is
better perhaps than showing the standard
sort of engineering view where you've
got lots of Wiggly timelines or you got
pie charts nearly that's sort of to
engineering focused this is something
people would look at and go oh these are
the top three device at the moment
what's that doing there shouldn't be
there I'll go and talk them as part of
the interaction on this in this
interface we also guarantee that you've
got some metadata about the devices when
they connect to the network so you knew
who's the device awards for example this
was the control panel interface this is
about getting allowing people to connect
and control connection to the network so
the dhcp server essentially when it got
to the point of receiving the request
instead of just say yes or no would fire
off a notification to this this was a
html5 interface viral notification which
will pop up something in the central
column saying this device is requesting
permission you want to allow it to
connect then drag it over to the
internet column and you'll be prompted
to fill out some metadata about it you
don't want to allow it to connect drag
it over to the left-hand column so again
very simplistic kind of interaction but
it allowed people to exercise the sort
of control they wanted it allowed people
to deny devices access to
network after they'd been permitted so
when you have you know kids get their
friends round they all get connected so
they can have what I think used to be
called a LAN party and play games on
various computers and you can then drag
them back off the network when they go
you don't have to leave everything
configured for them the other thing that
was interesting with this is that
left-hand column would show devices that
are not allowed and this would include
devices that weren't actually trying to
get access to you but we're simply
visible because of the Wi-Fi broadcast
going on and a lot of people were very
surprised and quite interested to see
just how many Wi-Fi devices that were
around them one household in particular
that was near the top of the hill with a
bus stop outside would get you know 300
devices going past with every bus right
and they were sort of surprised to see
how much activity there is around this
so it's kind of surfacing this quite
invisible piece of infrastructure which
people some people found quite
interesting I found it quite interesting
when we went to sick on with this as a
demo and realize that we're about 3,000
devices that were going to be displayed
in that column which meant that that had
to be fixed it wasn't the UI was not
designed to display three thousand
things in that column it did not perform
very well when it tried to the third
thing I talked about was the idea of
bringing services close to users so
trying to get things nearer to the
context they're being used in rather
than leaving them to be set up in it's
very generic fashion so this was locally
determined name resolution so users
could police internet access by setting
up rules that would control what names
could be resolved and therefore what IP
addresses could be connected to this one
wasn't deployed for any length of time
but it sort of showed some of the things
with it we could kind of demonstrate
some of the things you could do if you
start to think about customizing how
these as I said normally generic
services run and operated by ISPs are
operated if you can get them customized
to the use that's being made of them by
the individuals and I think you could
use this as an example looking at the
kind of the stuff that David Cameron set
up with a sort of the porn filtering and
so on where that's a very generic
decision that's been made for the entire
country essentially by a small set of is
piece and it's inevitably going to make
false positives so I think they've been
cases there where for example
sexual health advice websites get
captured by that sort of filter and
being able to control that on a bit more
of a dynamic basis with more input from
the people that's actually affecting
might be a useful feature to provide
physical nature of the foot of the home
so physical devices give you this
ability to provide a kind of ambien
awareness so you can drop a thing down
on a coffee table that was the little
thing on the top right there was an
example of a thing that was constructed
to do this the LEDs light up according
to various measurements being made on
the network so i think the green ones
were signal strength Wi-Fi signal
strength at that place in the house
there were also flashes that would blue
flashes I think we come up when devices
were allowed to connect to the network
and red flashes where devices are denied
access and this was sort of interesting
that you could set it down and it would
give you an idea of what was going on
without being too intrusive so you
weren't having to consciously monitor
and manage the network it just gave you
a general idea of what was happening the
other thing we built was the idea that
using the idea that people are used to
physical access control so they use the
idea that you have a key and you can
lock something and then you unlock it
with a key and you get access to it so
we use the USB monitoring system in
Linux so that you could take a key with
some metadata in the file system plug
that into the router and that would
affect network policy essentially so it
would permit access to a particular
device and this was the sort of way that
we felt we could implement policies that
a couple of the households wanted which
were things like you only get to go on
facebook after you've done your homework
that's quite a hard thing to encode in
traditional network policy rules but if
you can do something which says you
don't get access to facebook until one
of the parents plugs in this key to the
router and only they have that
particular key nobody else has that key
and that allows you to get access to it
you can begin to make this quite
interactive quite dynamic in quite
context-sensitive how people are going
to control their network
this was the policy interface we
provided so this was a comic strip
sequential art policy interface so it
was how do you set up the route so you
can help people control the network
prospectively so they make some
decisions in advance about what they
want to happen in certain circumstances
by setting up as a comic strip interface
it kind of made it possible for normal
people to engage with this and to think
about what they wanted to have happen
and Express that so the way this this
interface works three panels at the top
on the top left you've got subject being
defined so you could basically tap that
and it would flip through the people in
the household and it would flip through
their machines in the household their
devices you've then got the middle panel
sets of condition the one being shown
there is activity between two times and
activity within a time range but you
could also set access to particular
websites or you could set bandwidth
consumption I think the third one so
when a particular device uses the
network between particular times then
the final panel says the action that's
going to take place so you can that you
could either block devices from the
network you could think you could rate
limit devices and there's warm that I'm
going to forget yeah I'm just going to
forget it but you essentially you could
you could exercise fairly simplistic but
quite potentially quite intrusive
control of the network so you actually
block someones device from the network
completely as a result of action taken
by a completely different device for
example and then the panels on the
bottom were just sort of to illustrate
what was going to happen so that they
you didn't interact with those
particularly didn't actively do things
with them this was sort of interesting
because two of the households did deploy
this and they deployed what we thought
was going to be the nuclear option which
was they actually they what they
essentially set the policies they
deployed were if I think in at least one
case it was the daughter's laptop access
his facebook then block it from the
network and they didn't even go over the
notify option it was just it's off write
this off the network now and that was
kind of interesting because we hadn't
thought that would get used because it
did feel like too stringent a punishment
almost it was like this this was going
to be difficult if that happened a
notification surely that was that
that was the third action was
notification so we could cause the
system to send you an either a tweet or
a text message or push notification
variety of sorts of notification could
be given to say such and such has just
happened but they actually chose the
blocking example they they booted off
the network completely but it turned out
that that wasn't the end of the matter
this wasn't again it's not like a
corporate network situation where that
happens and that's really bad and then
what do you do next what it happened
what happened as a result of that was it
triggered that child involved go and
talk to the parents and say I don't know
what happened there really sorry can I
get back on the net worth it was
apparently there was a discussion about
how important home it was not spent to
time to Facebook but it was just part of
the ongoing this is this thing of it's
just about managing the household
medicine network is managing the
household it which is part of that
ongoing discussion about appropriate
behavior I think the issue here is that
you doing a study on something which is
so fast moving what you say three years
ago is true today they just say our
sudden I just meet you Newton phone so
you're providing the parents of false
view that they have stopped them using
facebook in fact or they're going to do
is use Facebook through a different
medium so that what the root is no
longer the gatekeeper to the internet
than 22 to give that impression is to
give a false impression so these
deployments were a few years ago so at
the time I don't think it was a false
impression and what I'd say now is that
it's this is I what I'll come to towards
the end is I think this is an example of
where we should think more about
infrastructure technologies and the uses
people make of them and so I wouldn't
necessarily say you go and do exactly
this now although I think with the phone
example there will be other means that
you have of trying to manage that so the
use the amount of one of your children
are spending on that for example
depending on the age their app it's
something you may give them more or less
control over then it might get to the
point where you've got a 16 year old at
home and if they want to go and use
Facebook and not do their homework
you're not going to stop them doing that
by any reasonable means right it's about
them starting to take responsibility for
their own actions and what's going to
happen as a result of that so it there's
it's kind of it there's a spectrum here
and this was something that
was that was interesting deploy at the
time and worked for what it was at the
time but yeah I wouldn't try and do this
now and say this is going to stop
children accessing facebook and that's
the only way to do it but on the other
hand you know if they've got limited
bandwidth on their phone is they're
trying to do lots of video things on
Facebook maybe that's something that's
not going to work so well for them and
they would prefer to do it on the Wi-Fi
so it's again it's not about stopping
them and that's the end of the matter
it's potentially about by there in
convincing them or causing them to think
about what they're doing or not do have
accident or whatever so there's a much
richer set of things around it and
simply saying this is a policy and you
will not do this that make me said it
does is it does sort of mean and senses
that the things are moving so fast that
and then these studies very difficult
because of this this thing about the Sun
says that what was a policy is now a
false belief to some extent simply
because there are so many routes around
a lot of these things and there are so
many different ways of accessing this
and it is a and also the fact is a lot
of the example you've given were due to
limitations i mean like 34 years ago you
know just getting a printer on Wi-Fi was
a nightmare whereas our own old house
you have all these issues with you know
again I mean BTW hook is so much better
than things used to be so so all these
limitations are on bandwidth they're
going away very quickly and it is it's
very difficult to do these types of
studies when you've got this sort of
massively changing technology so i just
moved into a new rental house and
deployed bc network service for the
first time i would disagree that all
those problems are going away i did not
find it a good device to try and
interact with setting things up and for
example setting the parental control
stuff on that which was done initially
and suddenly discovering that one of my
laptops no longer worked because when
you set the parental control system up
you can no longer need dns resolution to
anything other than BTS dns servers and
i happen to have one that was set up to
result through google's public servant
some of these things some things get
easier but it's not at all clear to me
that they've been fixed and things now
work but it is the problems change
quickly I think yeah I think the way
that the problem service themselves
changes quickly I think the claim i'm
going to make towards the end is that
some of these things can be addressed in
it the level that will hopefully fix
them for longer many of the questions
about the final one was the Wi-Fi
association this was a project carried
out by a PhD student mind called Anthony
Anthony Brown who i believe is currently
due to submit this thesis on friday that
will see so the idea here is that the
problem here is how do you get devices
associate of the Wi-Fi network and it
can be really awkward particularly for
devices where you've got to interact
with the games consoles and stuff where
you've got kind of 1d inputs and it's
difficult to type in a big pass pass
phrase the way all those systems
currently work and this includes things
like WPS and push button and so on is
you're getting credentials from the
rooter into the device so you pre
configured the router that's got the
SSID set up that's gotta pass for a
setup and you need to get that
information into the device and all the
devices are different ways of doing this
and it's a pain so we kind of figured
okay well we could turn this problem
around if we pre configure the devices
and we envisage this might be done at
manufacture time with unique
cryptographic generated pass phrases and
SSIDs then all we've got to do is get
that information from the device into
the router and then the Rueter can do
something in response to that in
particular it can spin up a virtual
access point with those credentials and
then the device will automatically
connect to it so that was kind of what
we did and so we observed that again
physical security in at home this is not
something that's going to be deployed
out in the wide world necessary it's
going to be inside a house where it's
may be difficult to get access to these
things pre-configure all the devices
with SSID and password and co down as a
QR code stick nap to the outside the
device may be on the bottom of the
device you're really concerned about
security and then when you want to
connect it to the network take a
smartphone or something else with the
camera scan the QR code it conveys those
details of the ruta ruta spins up a
virtual access point device connects the
virtual
this point and this seemed a more
straightforward mechanism that could be
deployed more universally than all the
different ways that you might go about
configuring devices now so we built this
and we're a know that this was a lab
test rather than the in the world
deployment but we asked people to
construct a network using the classic
printer but also a squeezebox radio on a
laptop running windows 7 and we were
comparing WPS direct specifically push
button the BPS WPS direct and multi now
which is this system at the bill Randy's
to the 16 participants 10 ml 6 female 10
of those people with a home network
administrator for their household 12 of
them had never used WPS before and 6
have never seen QR codes before this is
only about 18 months two years ago hope
network sizes devices size in terms of
devices range from 3 to about 15 and the
mean there was slightly above what the
UK average was at the time but it was
all right sort of numbers one of the
things we had to do to run this study
was to rewrite the instructions for at
least the printer in particular because
it was exaggerated but only slightly you
had to go like through 17 layers deep in
some configuration menu to get to the
point where you could push the button
the WPS director works it was a software
button it wasn't a physical hardware
button on the outside so yeah that took
some time the data we collected from
that lab study showed that hopefully
unsurprisingly certainly we were pleased
multi net seems to work more efficiently
so people could get things configured
and on the network in less time using
our system than using WPS direct the
other thing that sort of interesting
from this is the use of instructions
went down over time so with WPS direct
because a lot of these buttons that you
have to push to do this are actually
software buttons you have to go and read
the instructions to find out where in
the system you get to you have to get to
to push the button in order to start
that process off the thing with the
multilateral system is it's the same for
every device find the QR code scan the
QR code devices connect the network so
we found quite rapidly after doing this
a couple of times people stopped needing
to read the instructions
whereas with the WPS direct thing
basically people continue to have to
read the instructions unless I think in
the case of two users they knew how
Windows 7 worked and could just get it
on the network anyway so that seemed to
improve things so I think before i got
there any other questions about homework
side of things in the home networking
stuff so that was you have a second QR
code special QR code on the bottom of
the router and the software the app you
download in the stolen device uses that
QR code and the route to trust that QR
code more so that's that that's kind of
the blessing of the device you get the
app by installing that from an app store
you get ya Oh yep so that's why that
sorry that's why there's two QR codes on
the bottom of the router so one is the
QR code that links to the app in the App
Store the other is the QR code with the
special credentials for the router so
you can go to any kind of barcode
scanning app that you happen to have on
your device which most people did scam
first one gets that gets your smartphone
for example to go to the App Store
download the app app gets installed
what's the absence store few then scan
the other QR code on the bottom of the
router and that's got the special
credentials for becoming a blessed
device that can configure the router and
then you've got a blessed device which
you can now go and scam other devices QR
codes and get them onto route so that
was the bootstrap processor so for that
device you've got to scan two things and
install an app why not just use in SC
between the smartphone and the
esthetician see the staffer you could do
that if you could tap the device and
then go and tap the Rueter for example
so you can get the smartphone connect to
the router by doing that but you want
some mechanism of getting other things
click to the router and some people put
their riches in the loft for example
which makes it less accessible and some
devices of fridges which are too big to
go and tap so yea though I think the
interesting thing to my mind about the
way this worked was it was about getting
credentials from the device to the
router and really the QR code in the
camera mechanism was it was easiest way
to prototype it but there are there are
other things you could do I think to do
that
passwords that people use adobe xbox now
you could actually just take I've
printed out QR code at home with my wife
my name and password on it so then you
visitors can actually come up to it and
Sam I've gone to yeah you could show
that to the xbox or whatever it will
take that as Wi-Fi password yeah episode
for some devices this is dom i think BTW
used that system for a while for the
home hub as well so that you could take
any device and go and scan it but they
seem to stop doing that now at least
last time i looked don't know one so
that was the experience of the in the
homework project so i was a set of
deployments we did of different things
to do with in front of different ways of
getting people to interact with
infrastructure and the interest i found
in that was that the idea of trying to
build user-centered infrastructure so
taking things that you traditionally
think of as very stable and hidden and
shared so this was a photo i took at the
pavement when there was some digging
what's going on showing some of the
different infrastructure that's
underneath the paper you don't think
about it doesn't get fiddle around with
very often and trying to look at the
differences of that sort of
infrastructure to computer networking
forum work seemed to show is quite a lot
more dynamic and fluid and complicated
and messy and tends to be more
customized to the particular context is
deployed in so my claim for this and
this is what hopefully will be my
general do interesting research and be
really good is that homework
demonstrates the way we build these kind
of technology at the moment doesn't
really work terribly well you kind of
you sort of incrementally make them
better and better but there's still
fundamentally difficult for people to
come to terms with and use effectively
and i think that there's this scope for
work to be done where you think
differently about how you design these
technologies if they're going to be
deployed into context where non-expert
users are going to have to manage them
in particular then you think about
putting people at the center of this
process to begin with and think about
what information will they need to be
able to see in order to be able to make
sense of this and use it without having
to become an expert in its management
and use and this sort of started I guess
because I was in a very good HCI group
but not
as the systems go on the HCI group and
hopefully here I'm going to be the HCI
guidance systems group and this will be
an interesting flip and but it does
require this mixture of approaches a
mixture of techniques because there's
different sorts of data to collect
different sorts of data to analyze and
yet you still need to do the engineering
and do the deployments and prototype
things and get them out there to get
people using them the kind of the big
umbrella under which I'm fitting this is
it's about getting people interacting
with data so that human data interaction
or human-computer interaction there's
lots of systems so you can think of many
where data is being collected about you
data is being collected about your house
your household your I don't know not
long now driving usage driving patterns
etc I'll be already and there's very
little visibility into these processes
very understanding of them and
understanding of how to control them and
how to interact with them and so the
claim we're sort of making is that when
we're building these large data
processing infrastructures which are
going to affect and observe and manage
the way lots and lots of people normal
people are behaving and all people
interacting with the world there are
some things that should be borne in mind
when you do that and these things we
think the way we turn this our
legibility so the ability to see and
understand what's happening and what
data is being collected about you and
how it's being used the ability to have
agency in these systems so have some
capacity to apps you may not choose to
act it may be something you don't care
about but some people may choose Tim you
need to have that capacity built in so
that you can engage with stuff and the
gauche ability so the ability to change
your mind to come in and out of these
systems to make decisions and then
change them at a later date the couple
of things that I'm trying to spin up
immediately as different things to build
here is the idea that I think it would
be interesting to enable people to
operate their own infrastructure so
rather than just saying hey Microsoft
Google you run it all for me I trust you
I trust you with everything forever try
and build systems allow people to run
some of their own structures so to
deploy their own systems and think about
what are the hard things about doing
that and how can those things to be
addressed so the particular thing
technology I'm trying to apply there is
the Mirage technology from Cambridge
who's heard of Mirage I know anil's
given at least
on toolkit the idea there that because
everything is much more tightly
encapsulated and bound up than it might
be traditionally much more in a sort of
App Store type model almost where you've
got a thing you download and you run and
that's it you don't go and do lots of
other things to it you don't have config
file sitting in / Etsy or windows
system32 or whatever to control things
you don't have the registry to fill
around with lots of interactions you've
got single unit kernels that have
everything bound up all the
configuration or the code or the state
it might be possible to use those to
give you a more sort of app store model
for deploying things like a personal DNS
server or a personal web server will see
um the other while one of the strands
here is about making such more legible
so one of the things that we sort of
observed with homework project again was
that the vocab you was all wrong so
thinking of people people don't think
about using the network per se certainly
by the end of the project it wasn't I'm
going to go use the network it was I'm
going to go and do the shopping and the
network was incidental to this it just
happened to be that was how it was being
used and yet none of the monitoring
stuff that goes on none of the
monitoring capabilities you've got in a
network certainly the home network
allowing you to see that shopping is
being done they allow you to see that
some data is being transferred between
this device and that IP address and if
you're very lucky you might have a DNS
name associated with it but that's
really about all you get with that right
you don't get to see this is shopping
happening this is banking happening
these are the different activities and
so there's no there's a big mismatch
between the terminologies and the
vocabularies that you can use at these
different layers if you want to allow
people to manage their own
infrastructure needs to be in the terms
that they want to manage it so the
interest the interest I have here is how
can you make the instructure more
legible how can you make it make sense
to people by thinking of it in terms
that they use so there's an EU project
that's ongoing where we're starting to
do this by initially we're doing some
deployments of some interfaces which
will allow people to annotate their
network usage with what they were doing
at the time so we can get the kind of
the vocabulary out of them that they use
to think about these things and then the
aim is to apply magic machine learning
techniques to attempt to learn what the
activities are that are taking place
from a hue
point of view when you observe certain
sets of things on the network this is
some very initial attempts of doing this
and it kind of shows that I think here
user for is sort of being detected more
alive leaving the other three users for
the user for traffic so it was sort of
working ok there and I think user one
wasn't doing too badly turns out in this
case users two and three we're never
detected lively at all they were
absolutely terrible so it's a complex
problem we're working on it but there
was some hope I think the initial
results seem to suggest that there's
some hope you might be able to do
something now that people's behaviors
are potentially detectable from the
network activity and that's it any other
questions in the hope that sorry in the
home network experience said do you see
any case in which the children outsmart
the parents for like you know you cannot
use Facebook but I can use a proxy the
better I can bypass the policy or I can
I don't disconnect the author and use my
you know my friends all done in these
kind of things I'm not aware of anything
got reported but then they wouldn't be
there were I think yeah I'm not aware of
anything up reported it wouldn't
surprise me if some of that had happened
on the other hand there is it they're
not actually malicious actors right
having that sort of security model view
on this is probably not the right way to
think about it there's a recession is
that but I think even from the child's
point of view it's not necessary the
case they just out to get everything
they possibly count there is a there in
a social environment that you know there
are things they're expected to do and
not expect to do and they kind of know
that and they they work with that so I
think it is it is sort of dangerous to
start thinking about this in terms of
malicious actors for example in a system
it's not the right model to have
for it this is terrific tour governess
and so amazing stuff you talk about we
try to increase agency for for people's
one of the three things that legibility
agency in one of the third my gosh
certain things you talked about this you
know making networks intelligible rather
than intelligent so that people could as
it will ask the right questions or when
things go wrong can you talk more about
those aspects like China so because even
even when you show them you've got
you've got systems whereby they can
easily drag things left or right to
allow it as well presume point they
still had trouble with that were they
better able to formulate questions to
then ask for help that wasn't something
we looked at explicitly so we didn't
unfortunate collect data on it one of
the things here was that the the way
that the studies were done is we didn't
have somebody living with them for the
four to six months so we wouldn't
necessarily see those things I was about
what they talked through when they were
into nothing on a weekly basis
essentially like problems that were
there was a then understood why boy did
I would have a I would expect that they
would have had more understanding of
some of the things that were happening
so things like just having more of just
having a better conception of the fact
that there are lots of devices out there
around in the in the space around you
having understanding of be able to look
at something ago that device is really
busy or that protocols really out to
just you sort of get more of a sort of
background understanding what's going on
but I wouldn't be able to say that there
actually been able to diagnose something
better or give a better fault report or
anything I can't say either way I don't
have any data but no interest to you to
see if people are able to do that better
yeah yeah so that for example when they
call the helpline their version of
what's going on is is you know more I
was more understandable by there
deal of the problem yeah that is
certainly of interest I think no at NAPA
so I think one of Microsoft's interests
in why they were involved in the project
the there were there are two things I
could say that one is so one of the
features that we often talked about
building I think did actually build but
couldn't get a deployment scenario where
it made sense to test it with the idea
that you could have a button on the
rooster that will allow you to hit the
bottom and that would take a snapshot of
everything that happened for the past 30
minutes and then you can send that as a
part of the fault report essentially it
was quite interesting paper w must 11
think it was from AT&amp;amp;T where they
deployed a similar kind of thing with on
their cell phone network so you idea was
you have an appt i think it was on the
cell phone so when you start
experiencing cool problems traditionally
if you want to report a fault to their
network you have to phone them up and so
you've got a call problem on your cell
phone you can't find them up and so you
have to wait till you get home if I'm up
later and you can't do it outside
business hours and so they weren't
getting enough information but by having
an app on the phone that you could just
hit a button on it could send the report
either then or later it had to and they
found they actually got us I think it
was 30 minute advance warning before
their fault detection system discovered
a Fault in their cell network because
people were starting to experience
problems no get in his early
notification effect so I think there's
this sort of that there is interesting
things around that and the other thing
was there's a PhD student who still
Nottingham who was looking at the idea
was to try and build a time-traveling
return so rooted that would snapshot
enough of its state and understand
enough of the snapshotting estate you
could go back in time because one of the
problems is people something goes wrong
on the network something stops working
well and it could be your route or it
could be the internet and they go on
fiddle and they fill the configurations
and do something to it and then it works
a bit and then it stops working a bit
later and they fiddle again and the
thing just gets completely mashed and so
the I'd being able to have some system
that would allow them to go back in time
and say well it certainly was working
correctly two weeks ago I'll go back
there and have that kind of flexibility
was another thing we felt might help
people to do that sort of management and
that fixing fault potentially
