of Microsoft research part of our idea
is part of our collaborations part of
the culture here it's almost
embarrassing to say this but just about
every project that actually ends up
gaining a lot of notice in the public
has had some spark injected by an intern
interns have an immense impact that MSR
every one of our projects has interns
involved with it they solve core
problems on our projects they bring in
creativity that we don't have ourselves
I think of interns as a way to inject
new knowledge and new abilities into
every project that we do interns play
people role in our collaboration
relationship with academic community
they allow us to deepen our
collaboration with University so
internship program it's integral part of
how we do our business how we do our
research and our culture when you come
to Microsoft research as an intern I
advise you to not only pick a problem
that you're really interested in working
on with your mentor but explore the
wealth of expertise around you make the
most of the opportunity in being in an
environment so rich with talent and
expertise being able to meet with people
in industry and actually working towards
something that actually happens is
something that normal academia does not
provide basically the tools that I use
are made by people that are two or three
offices away which is really cool I get
to talk with them I get to discuss ideas
I get to actually start new research
areas and stuff like that it's just
amazing to be here I ended up having
three female mentors who were all able
to provide different perspectives that
really brought the whole internship
together they do so many different
things here a lot of other places have
an agenda right you only do research
according to your
business or something that really
restricts the types of things that you
can do and MSR is really awesome because
you have all those next-generation
things happening you know in five to ten
years it'll be the next big thing so
usually at school I do a lot of
interviews and observations and then I
write down what should happen with a
design of a technology but this year I
said I'm going to actually make
something so the project itself is a
scarf that reacts to your emotions if
the scarf knows that you're saying can
it do something about it can it warm you
up and soothe you or if it knows you're
excited can it play some music so in my
intern project I developed a new
fabrication technique for 3d printing
that allows user to adjust the shape of
a 3d printed object even after for
vacation outside of your core work
there's a lot of options to have fun
with your fellow interns we have ice
cream socials we have go-karting we have
hiking we have all sorts of things you
can do outside the building definitely
take advantage of those have fun with
your fellow interns have fun with your
mentors the people that you meet here
the other interns are people that will
probably be in your community for your
entire academic career and spend the
time spend the time going to these
activities hang out with these folks
just casually have a beer with them and
you'll be surprised sometimes the best
idea has come out of just having a very
casual fun afternoon with a with a
friend and you're just talking about
something and something amazing comes
out of that then Crillon ever the people
that we hire they were interns here they
got exposed to the joys of doing
research as a place like Microsoft and
the joys of seeing what they do just
reach hundreds of millions of people
