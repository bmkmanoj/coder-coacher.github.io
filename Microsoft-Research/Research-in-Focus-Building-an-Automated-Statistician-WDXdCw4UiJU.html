hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading

lectures freely available
we're about to take a deeper dive into
the world of statistics as we once again
put research in focus and joining me now
is professor zoom and ghahremani of the
University of Cambridge and just a
reminder professor grant money will be
taking your questions so please submit
your queries through that chat tool it's
right over there submit those questions
and a welcome zubin I understand you're
going to talk to us about building an
automated statistician it sounds like
something I could have used last week
when my taxes were due maybe a little
automated help on calculating deductions
but seriously what do you mean by
automated statistician hi Chris yeah so
an automated statistician is meant to be
an automatic system that can take data
that somebody gives it and it can make
sense out of the data it can try to
understand that data visualized it and
maybe even feedback to the person that
gave the data some interpretable
explanation of what's in that data are
there sort of weird thing the data
outliers the statisticians call them is
their particular interesting structure
in the data what kinds of models are
good models for the data so I'm very
excited about this so there's the
overview can you give us some examples
of what such an automated statistician
might do so just in terms of machine
learning one of the things that I found
over my career and machine learning is
that people come up with a lot of
different kinds of models that could be
applied to data and it's a very humid
intensive laborious thing where you know
a scientist or somebody in commerce or
even just the sort of a user of the
internet that has some interesting data
would really need to interact with this
specialist of some kind and our goal for
the automated statistician is really to
be able to get that special
lists out of the loop to get the
computer to do something intelligent
with that data so to give you an example
you know one of the most commercially
interesting kinds of data these days is
data from recommender systems you know
the kind of thing where you are shopping
online and you've bought a few things or
you viewed a few movies and the system
is recommending to you you know new
products or movies that you might want
to buy now underlying all these
recommender systems that everybody is
used to using our machine learning
methods but those machine learning
methods have been handcrafted by few
experts and each company might hire a
few experts to do that sort of work for
them and what we want to do is we have a
huge space of interesting models in
machine learning we want to be able to
come up with ways in which algorithms
can take new data like for example this
kind of recommender data which is you
know thousands or millions of users and
thousands or hundreds of thousands of
products and sort of imagine a big table
of data like that they can take that
data and automatically run lots of
different methods on it and come up with
good interpretable hypotheses for users
companies and even scientists so
recommender systems like you said is
something that we're probably already
familiar with even if we didn't know
what it was like Netflix it tells me
what movies it thinks I might like based
on what I watch and it thinks I want to
watch my little pony because my
daughter's been on there all day long so
that's the sort of thing we're talking
about right okay oh yeah that's one
example yeah so how do you brain other
examples I'm sorry I'm stomping on you
here I just want to know how do you
train a computer to parse all this data
effectively and with you know minimal
human intervention as you said well so
the the great thing is that I mean this
is what not just myself but the whole
field of machine learning is is working
on we're working on developing
algorithms that learn from data and as
you've heard from Sebastian in in your
previous interview one of the
foundations
of all of this automation of learning is
this idea of Bayesian methods a sort of
automatic methodology for computers to
do reasoning under uncertainty and so
that's the core of the method that we're
going to use in our automated
statistician obviously that's a pretty
difficult concept my brain isn't as big
as yours can you help me maybe
understand it with some simple examples
ah yeah I would love to actually and you
know the history of how I stumbled into
this is that is kind of interesting so
maybe I'll tell you a little bit about
it that from a personal point of view so
you know I started out interested in
understanding how the brain works kind
of building computational models of
brain function and at the same time
trying to build artificially intelligent
systems something that a lot of computer
scientists are interested in and
nowadays with big data you know we're
suddenly looking at really practical
problems like this automated
statistician now the really beautiful
thing for me is that this idea of Bayes
rule underlies models of how the brain
might work models of artificial
intelligence and how to get computers to
handle big data so the idea of Bayesian
statistics it's actually very simple it
says that probability is the way we
should represent uncertainty and
learning from data is all about
uncertainty uncertainty given the data
that you've observed in terms of what
predictions or recommendations you
should make and the mathematics of
uncertainty is very simple as laid out
by Thomas Bayes in the 1700s probability
theory and bayesian statistics is just a
follow on from probability theory it's
just like you know Newton and calculus
is sort of the mathematics of rates of
change probabilities the mathematics of
uncertainty another one of those phrases
that got me scratching my head that
nonparametric probability can you
explain that yeah
so so my own research puts together two
ideas one of them is this bayesian use
of probability to represent uncertainty
and we need that to build intelligent
systems big build recommenders build
automated statisticians the other thing
is this word non parametric and
nonparametric is such sort of bitter
jargon but just to explain it simply
it's the idea that the world is a
complicated place so our models
shouldn't be simple linear models from
high school or you know college
textbooks they should be flexible models
that can capture a lot of that
complexity in the real world and
nonparametric sits just the technical
term that people use for these flexible
models so we need these flexible models
and we need uncertainty and probability
we put these together we can do amazing
things so if I understand this correctly
it's entirely possible that I don't
you're working to teach computer to do
this sophisticated Bayesian
nonparametric probability analysis you
just feed them the data they come up
with the inferences right sorta yeah
that's right and you know we want to
hide all that complexity from the users
and the companies that might want to use
this kind of thing because you know not
everybody's going to want to be an
expert so all that complexity should be
behind the hood and the interaction with
this automated statistician should be as
natural as a conversation or report a
written report about your data with some
pictures and things like that so you
know we are not trying to sell the
complexity to people we want things to
be easy to use I would imagine though
that this is a rather major undertaking
and involving many different disciplines
in a fairly long time frame right yeah
yeah this is a this is a big project you
know it's been sitting in the back of my
head 40 many years but now is really the
time to get going and you know there's
so much excitement around this area and
I'm not the only one I'm collaborating
with lots of people a great team of
colleagues at MIT some friends at
Harvard you know
I work with Microsoft and Google and
there's just a lot of excitement around
doing this kind of thing and the other
interesting thing is you know this isn't
just about users and companies it can
also have an impact on the sciences so I
work a lot with scientists from
different fields like biology and
economics and you know cosmology and
they're all sitting on piles of amazing
data and they want to have tools that
they can just you know feed their data
into and at least that the first pass he
gives them some reasonable
interpretations of the data so in the
long run that's what I'm shooting for of
course it is a pretty big project you
mentioned there the long run so I won't
count on having that atomic Don do my
taxes next year but what are some
concrete applications may be that you
anticipate from your automated
statistician so you know the beauty of
some of these things is that you can
build them and then different people
will use them in different ways sort of
like you know if you're if you're
building some some web infrastructure
you don't know how people will use them
if you put out some data you don't know
how people will use it you know if your
google and you put out maps people use
them in all sorts of ways so we want to
make this very open we're going to build
a tool and different people are going to
hopefully come in and try to upload
different kinds of data onto our
automated statistician and that'll just
throw up lots of challenges we'll have
to keep doing research to make sure this
kind of thing works on people's
different kinds of data but we're not
working on one particular application
we're trying to build a generic system
where you might be able to feed it a
table of whatever your favorite data is
maybe an Excel spreadsheet you know
maybe something else and it's just going
to try to make some sense of it and and
give you something back so you know
recommenders i mentioned scientific data
you know things like
genomic analysis data might be an
interesting case study something I've
also worked on biomedical data in
general like you know if you're
correlating certain genetic factors with
diseases that's a very common type of
data a lot of people analyze and we'd
love to be able to provide a tool that
at least does some initial analysis for
people we're not going to replace the
specialist the experts but we're going
to be able to help them out and we're
going to be able to hopefully help meet
the huge challenge in terms of data
scientists that you know the world needs
over the next few years fascinating
stuff zubin we are out of time thank you
so much for taking some time to chat
