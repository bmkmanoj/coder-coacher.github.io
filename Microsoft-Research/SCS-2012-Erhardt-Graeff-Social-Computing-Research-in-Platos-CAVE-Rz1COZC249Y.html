member of the web ecology project and
the web ecology project is a
collaborative network of people that
basically hack on social data in order
to study online culture for fun and as
you can imagine this has brought up a
lot of ethical quandary regarding
research into this day and I wanted to
share a personal kind of story of this
ethical quandary for myself and all of
my best stories involve me being injured
so that's not this one start back in
2004 I was a research internship at the
University of Alaska Fairbanks and I've
ever been to Fairbanks Alaska it's apps
that we would do and all of my fellow
interns and I were totally excited about
getting outdoors and I'm not like
English I've never really done before
and I'm exploring the campus on my
mountain and I wasn't that good at
making decisions about whether I could
go over a certain hill or not and so one
kill I went over was actually more like
a small cliff and I'm going to cast my
handlebars fell on my head and broke my
collarbone and it was pretty ugly I've
never actually broken a bone my body
before I left this photo in black and
white because anyone you know make the
gory details of the colors that are
actually being produced by my chest you
know freak you out but within a week
after having this injury I had to do my
final presentation as an intern what I
was actually doing that someone was
working at the Arctic region
supercomputing center and doing some
really cool stuff with a professor named
Eve okey okey and she was pretty
interested in these immersive
environments they had a discovery lab
there they called it which had a came in
part manado know if you know this
virtual reality technology cave
automatic virtual environment but allows
you to explore a 3d world that you build
you know using a supercomputer all these
projections and walk through so we were
building
additional Japanese home in 3d and we
had like the traditional mats and the
payment on the shrine in the corner and
she wanted to use this for culture and
language teaching chance ending it for
flash cute if you like flash cards in 3d
space that has a kanji and kana and the
pictogram on there so you can learn the
words while exploring through this space
and the idea to bring a whole group of
people into this cave and really allow
it to have that experience and I love
this idea and it was only made possible
because of the system which took data
from you using a couple of your kind of
simple devices a head where piece of
these radio frequencies to tell you
where you were in the space and then a
one that will allow you manipulate the
world in explore it that way and eight
years later I think about Alaska
Logging's i still have pins in my right
shoulder from the surgery and I've been
thinking a lot about in terms of the
ethics of research because well I don't
have access to a million-dollar cave
anymore I see these caves and the wands
me use manipulate them everywhere there
are smartphones right you know the
iphone has the capabilities of creative
mercenaries that allow you to explore
this spaces in new and unique ways and I
see these as almost nested right you can
have caves within caves when you connect
this up to your social network which I
see a lot of youth on research using
right and it kind of freaks me out in
one way because I see a paradigm shift
happening where I remember the discovery
lab will not exploring the world and a
little bit of Dana helping the system do
that I feel more and more like the
spaces in these new caves are actually
exploring us with all the data that
they're collecting and that kind of
freaks me out because I know that that
data is no longer going into
supercomputers in the same room as me
and powering the display it's actually
going up into the cloud
operations at these sites and from a
privacy standpoint in our personal
research view that causes me some
ethical concern but also really excites
me going to be honest as a web of
colleges were really interested in
experimental data space is how can we
turn like 70 new platform like Facebook
into a lab where we use the ability to
serve to survey all the people that are
on it to really understand the context
of behavior and culture that's happening
there and so I'm excited about sexy you
know opportunity here one of the best
examples i think is deborah stored at
the media lab he had a TED talk where he
talked about basically putting cameras
throughout his entire room or through
every room in his house and recording
all of the voice voices of his son was
making right after being born and he was
able to trace the evolution of the
language of this some being able to say
the word water in both place and time
using this technology and you know as a
researcher studying you think bullying
how awesome would it be able to grab all
the data from from cell phones from the
social networks from the cameras during
the school from the cameras up on the
size of the school to really understand
that phenomenon of course this raises
some real questions you know if I could
do this should I do this and then of
course as an academic if I want to do
this is that anyone in this room that
can help me write the IRB out can be
really tricky if you have any ideas
please you know tapping on my shoulder
by that's a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
