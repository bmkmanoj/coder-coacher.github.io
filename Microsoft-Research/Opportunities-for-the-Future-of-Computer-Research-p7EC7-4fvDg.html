to what you might read in the popular
press which is that computers are great
and everything has already been done and
the field has matured what's the need
for doing more research quite the
contrary we're at the very beginning now
where things can really speed up
exponentially because we finally have
enough computing power we have enough
understanding of basic principles that
we can really get some where the
excitement is just going to build and it
means in particular that some of the
core technologies that Microsoft
researchers have been working on for a
number of years as well as colleagues
elsewhere are going to mature to the
point where they can come together and
create a hole that is much bigger than
the sum of the parts
you
each year microsoft research helps
hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
