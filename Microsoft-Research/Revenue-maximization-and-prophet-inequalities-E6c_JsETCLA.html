you
good afternoon so for for me as a
student in Jerusalem Hebrew University I
often heard about profit inequalities
that were a very popular among the
statisticians there so it's great to see
them occur now in this topic so Val Lucy
van will tell us about revenue
maximization and profit inequalities
yeah thanks you all so this is based on
joint couple of joint works and a bunch
of other work that has been going on in
the past six years on this multi
parameter value maximization and I will
acknowledge this as I talk about them
okay so what's the setting it's a very
simple setting you have n agents m items
and each agent has some value for item
valuation of I agent I for item J is VI
j and this valuation is of course
private knowledge only the agent gnosis
value for the item and these valuations
are drawn from distributions which are
public everybody knows about these
distributions and the Assumption
throughout the stock is that these the
ages are all independent okay so for
this talk I am going to focus on unit
demand agents yearly demand agents are
those who are interested in buying at
most one item which means even if you
give them a whole bundle set s their
valuation is basically the most valued
item in that status okay and so what do
you want your goal is to maximize
revenue by doing some matching between
this agents and items it should be a
matching you should not give any agent
more than one item and no items will be
given to more than one agent so this
so for example when you go shopping for
a hotel for example you run one more
than one hotel okay so this is a
multi-parameter revenue maximization
problem multi-parameter because each age
and has more than one private parameter
okay he has value for each item so he
holds em private parameter Syria by
using okay so formally we are studying a
multi-item auction problem you have n
unity malaysians em items and you have a
matrix F of distributions your goal is
to get a seller optimal action so what
is known it's not about this so it's
very well understood how to design the
optimal auctions in single parameter
settings for example if you set M equals
1 when there is just one item you know
what to do to get the revenue optimal
auction and then myosins were quality
basically shows us that you can reduce
revenue maximization to welfare
maximization okay if you transform
values to what is called virtual values
which is the distribution dependent
transformation of values after that on
virtual values we just run the the Cray
option or the VCG auction and that will
maximize surveillance what he said for
single parameter settings but this
completely fails to extend for multi
parameter settings okay in particular
you get some rice insides there from my
sins mechanism for example the automaker
is always deterministic okay such kinds
of things fail to extend to multi
parameter settings leavin single
parameter settings is very rarely used
as this mechanism okay so all these
questions can you get some sort of
structure and understanding for multi
parameter settings also
there is no cellar here which is one
seller I mean by not iid so the the
distributions could be different for
different items ages and everything it
is just independent parameter is the
private parameter all the VA JS rate
each agent VI agent I has VI 1 VI do it
will be am so it is more than one okay
so if you just when m is equal to one he
holds only one private parameter in
those cases you know how to maximize
revenue yeah so it'd be nice if you can
get some sort of understanding of how
optimal mechanisms look like in multiple
matter settings so in Vincent monitoring
what they say is that you can't do this
basically what they show is that even
for independent distributions the class
of all optimal mechanisms is basically
includes all possible fact almost all
possible mechanism so you can't get any
nice characterization of optimal
mechanisms so one of the takeaways of
the stock is that you can get some nice
guidelines about how near optimal
mechanisms look like okay if you're
willing to relax optimality and look at
approximately optimal mechanisms okay so
what we show is that very simple posted
price mechanisms which are not like
normal auctions traditional auctions
which ask people to bid and then decide
whom to get allocated to allocate and
then what they pay instead you just put
prices on items and agents come and
choose you know whether they want to
take it or not it's a
take-it-or-leave-it offer simple post
price mechanisms are actually
approximately optimal in multi parameter
settings they're good in single
dimension settings and they extend to
multidimensional settings okay and they
are also widely used of course everybody
just see prices in most of the settings
single dimension is same as single
parameter yeah multi-dimensional
multi-parameter okay so this is the
outline of the talk the main tool is
basically understanding these multi
parameter preferences these are complex
objects and that is why it was difficult
to you know find out how much you can
extract optimally settings so we are
going to reduce this multi parameter
problems to a single parameter problem
this is a first step then the goal is to
develop good posted price mechanisms for
single parameter settings and that is
where I will make the connection
profit inequalities and then show that
these mechanisms can also be generalized
multiple a bit ascetics okay assumption
throughout the talk as I already said
this this F is a product distribution
okay for simplicity for the first part
of the talk I am going to focus on
single agent settings which means that
it's just VI here the second index stop
there is only one agent right so you can
think of v12 BM and these are all
mutually independent i will briefly talk
about correlated values towards the end
of the talk so so this is a single agent
sitting right there is one agent and
these M items and you want to construct
a revenue optimal or near optimal
mechanism in the setting so how do you
understand this multi parameter
preferences will use the approach
developed by fuji Chawla jason hart lane
and Babak lane work in 2007 so what they
say is that you don't understand this
but you can construct a related single
parameter setting which we do understand
well and this is the related single
parameter setting so when you have one
agent it's for items think of this is or
break this age and it to four
representatives okay so each
representative is interested in buying
exactly one item so this multi parameter
agent is broken into four single
parameter agents if there is only one
private value that the agent is hiding
and you now retain the same feasibility
constraint as in the original city okay
the original setting the feasibility
constraint was that he is a unit demand
agent you can give utmost one item it
feasibility what's the feasibility
constraint it's basically some set
system over the edges right over agent
right impairs you maintain the same
feasibility can state here hear you say
that at most one item can be allocated
okay and so we are basically in a single
item auction problem in EM agents and
one item one agent m item has been
transformed to M agents and one item
okay so this is the rated single
parameter setting okay so what about
this setting the claim is that the
optimal revenue in this new single
parameter setting is at least as much as
the optimal revenue in the original
multiparametric sitting okay and what is
the intuition basically the single
parameter settings these representatives
are going to compete with each other
right they act independently
whereas the original setting the agent
made a joint decision for all the items
rate he will pick the item it's
maximizes its utility here these
representations are not going to say
that oh that guy has a higher utility so
I leave this item for him right so you
can use the competition to get more
revenue that is the intuition and that
can be formalized but I am going to
continue that this base this upper bound
holds only for deterministic mechanisms
surprisingly it fails for randomized
mechanisms although it holds for
constant factor and that is something I
will get to the end of the talk okay but
if you take deterministic
multi-parameter mechanisms then their
revenues upper bounded by this related
single parameter sitting okay so that's
what they say ok but so what right i
mean you have this single parameter
setting you know how to construct the
optimal mechanism in the single
parameter setting versus mechanism but
what to do with it right you need
something to apply to the multi
parameter sitting and you do not know
how to use this madness mechanism what
is the main challenge here which is
basically to eliminate competition right
in this single parameter setting there
is competition the original setting
there is no competition this case
looking for his best interest by
choosing between items so if you can
design a mechanism so what is
competition basically there is
competition there is room for collusion
agents can say that the seller is using
competition to extract revenue from us
so people can collude and bring down
revenue so if you can design a mechanism
which is robust to collusion which
stephanie does not go to the collusion
then you can use the same mechanism in
the 24 addressable roughly that is the
kind of mechanism we looking for so
traditional you know direct revelation
mechanism very submit the bids and then
you do something that's always subject
to collude her leg myosin sorbic Reese
second price auction etc are all set it
to collusion so that is what we need a
collision resistant single parameter
mechanisms which can be applied to multi
parameter settings and the candidate we
pick is the portion price mechanism in
single parameter settings so you have
think of one item auction you have n
agents instead of asking for bids or
anything just say that i have a price p
i4 agent I ok and an agent's would come
in any order an agent I comes he faces a
price P I and if the item has already
not been sold he can choose to buy it at
that price if his value is higher than P
is a rational agent he'll bite that's it
okay so we are going to counter revenue
as the revenue you get in the worst
ordering okay so if you have a gin 21
days and two and these prices phase and
one comes first then he'll of course
pick the item we will get ready for to
compost will get a rebel three and i am
going to count the revenue from the
worst our ring and that is precisely why
this is collusion robust right so what
does collusion mean so here age and two
can tell agent one look I am getting
utility of three you get utility of one
so if I go first I will pick the item
okay and I have split it into half and
half so you will get 1.5 I'll get 1.5
but if you go first you get it totally
f1 so we are both better off if I go
first that is a collusion here so what
does you know if people call you what
does it amount to it basically amounts
to people coming in a different order
rate is in twos coming ahead of agent
one but we are counting our revenue from
the worst ordering possible okay so
basically that is why it's collusion
robust so if we can design a design a
poster price mechanism which is
coalition robust in this sense it you
can approximate the optimal revenue from
the worst ordering then you can use it
to the original multi-parameter sitting
right so obviously the extends to
multiply business what I'm saying now so
if you put these very same prices in the
original setting that agent will pick
the item which maximizes VI minus P I
obviously this is better than you know
getting the worst possible orderings VI
right in the single parameter setting so
what I just said is that if you can get
an alpha aprox single parameter posted
prices that basically implies alpha prox
multi-parameter pushed price mechanism
so the question is do porsche price
mechanisms perform well in single
parameter settings it so to do this I
will give a quick to slide overview or
characterization of truthful payments in
single parameter settings okay what they
look like so if you know if you are
designing any truthful mechanism for a
22 mechanism single parameter settings
so I am going to talk about patient
incentive compatibility but essentially
same as the ordinary truthfulness beige
incentive compatibility means that you
are truthful in expectation over other
people's valuations but it does not
matter you just drop the expectations in
that incentive compatibility so what are
the
requirements for a mechanism to be
truthful it just says that the expected
allocation function should be more it on
ok which means that if the probability
of me getting the item ok over other
people's valuations is something now and
if I increase my value then the
probability of me getting right up
should not fall below ok it is no
smaller and the payment should satisfy
this formula it would look weird but it
is a nice interpretation if you draw the
allocation curve the area to the left of
the curve is the payments so any
whatever be the mechanism whether it is
for surprise or direct revelation or
whatever if you are developing a
truthful mechanism then these two
conditions have to be satisfied this is
a characterization so this this sort of
interpretation is nice for prices but it
doesn't tell me guide me how to design
the optimal mechanism through this from
this revenue is basically some of the
prices rate so you want to match miss
revenue and that is precisely what
Madison did basically expanded the
expectation switched order of integrals
and go out an integral which is some
clean thing which is dependent only on
the value and a function of value ok and
you call this function of value is some
function but you'll value and this
integral is basically expected virtual
value right it's expected virtual
surplus so this is directly telling you
how to maximize revenue if the expected
payment is equal to expected virtual
value you basically should give the item
to the person with the highest virtual
value set X i equals 1 as I agent to the
highest versatility and this word is my
sins mechanism right this
Myerson yeah
so what this basically says is you get
the values apply virtual evaluation
function you get virtual values for this
in agents then run Vickrey auction okay
so it is saying only thing is that this
virtual values could sometimes be
negative okay so if everybody is
negative you don't basically serve
anybody the crazed auction will always
serve somebody this need not always
serve something okay yes always you can
do I on the effort yeah okay so that's
enough for me to talk about performance
of posted price mechanisms in arbitrary
orderings right what I wanted to do
initially was that agents could come in
any order and I want the worst-case
revenue over orderings I fixed the
prices beforehand and agents could come
in was further and I want to say that
that revenue approximates optimal
already okay so bears on this
characterization that the revenue over
the pavement is basically virtual values
I can think of agents coming as virtual
values coming to me okay it is it
becomes basically a virtual world is
coming and saying that I'm going to
serve this age and is basically picking
that virtual value right so you have
these random variables or virtual values
arriving q an arbitrary sequence and
your goal is to pick the near maximum X
I you do not control the sequence but
you can control who gets picked so that
is exactly the setting in profit
inequalities okay in profit inequalities
you have n random variables and these
are drawn independently from some
distribution fi for I random variable I
and the profit he knows all the random
variables ahead of time and therefore
his revenue is always max over I of all
these random variables and he gets this
expectation and if you are a gambler you
don't know what's going to happen the
next day and you have to pick or drop
something today if you drop it you can't
come back to it if you pick it you stop
you don't see the next day then can you
compete with you know the gamblers of
the profits revenue that is the profit
inequality question and Samuel car had
this beautiful result in 84 where she
said that you just set a single
threshold okay not different there
should just one threshold which is the
median of the distribution of max over X
I and then pick the first random
variable which exceeds the threshold
okay if you do that then you're expected
profit is at least half of the expected
max value which is for the Prophet gates
so you get half of the profit by the
single threshold ok so this directly
translates to our setting because of the
interpretation through virtual values
okay so what exactly is happening you
have these virtual values coming to you
and I am going to put a threshold on
virtual values okay it is a single
threshold on virtual values i will pick
the first virtual value exceeds the
threshold okay so what does it mean to
put threshold and virtual values it
basically means that you put a threshold
on values by inverting this rate but you
invert different people according to
their specificity larly function so
inward differently for different people
so there are different prices for
different people and this is the
threshold on values obviously that
translates to an agent picking or
dropping rate in agent looks at the
price and if its values above the price
you'll pick the item otherwise will not
pick the item okay so if you use the
median of max over I of partial values
then you get half of the optimal revenue
okay there is a simple connection to
profit inequalities and these mechanisms
of course since they do well in single
parameter settings by the earlier
argument they also do in it multiple
video settings so this is the half
approximate this joint work with shoot
each other Jason hotline and David Malik
okay so what was crucial here I'm saying
this because I will come to this later
the profit in the profits threshold the
threshold you use is non-adaptive okay
if you keep on adapting the threshold
for each item based on what happened
before then that is unacceptable for us
why okay for single parameter settings
it is okay because what it essentially
means is that i will change the price
for age and to based on how agent one
reacted but for multi parameter settings
where there is one agent and n items it
is not acceptable because that is like
saying that i will not tell you what the
price for item 2 is here is item one you
pick it at this price or drop it if you
want but later based on how you react i
will tell the price for item two that's
completely unreasonable because you can
reason about what l'agent will do is
completely in the dark about the future
prices ok so you want non-adaptive
prices you can do not have two prices
for single agent and
items but for more general community and
feasibility constraints you do not have
this non-adaptive thresholds okay so
what is the extension to multi-agent
settings is basically very similar to
single agent settings you have these n
agents and there we broke each age and
it will copy similarly here also we the
single agent was broken into copies here
you break each agent in two copies
maintain the same feasibility
constraints okay if some subset of edges
was feasible the same substance is
feasible here the same argument will
basically go through that more
competition implies more revenue single
parameter settings although you need to
be slightly careful it's not as
straightforward as single agent settings
again this fails for randomized
mechanisms will come to later the other
thing I said was that you can use the
single parameter mechanism at it
generalizes to multi parameter settings
and that happens here also except that
instead of putting your price for this
one age and you need a price menu for
each agent you need to price p IJ which
is price given to agent I for item J you
have these n times m prices and the
holder how I measuring revenue agents
can come in arbitrary order and when
agent I comes his menus given to him and
he picks his favorite item at these
prices and next is it comes ok so if
agent one comes first is value for item
10 to five and 10 and these are the
prices he'll obviously pick item 2 which
gets a utility of 10-6 for for him the
first one gets only to pick item 2 which
automatically means that only item one
is available for agent too ok and if
agent 2 comes first it gets reversed and
you get much lesser revenue you get only
four but we count only that is the
revenue or the worst possible ordering
and again you can you know look at the
single parameter setting the only thing
is the feasibility constraints in single
parameter setting is now become more
complicated earlier equals just one item
auction now you can have partition
metroids and general things so what do
we get for these general single
parameter settings with all these
constraints for K unit auctions you got
a factor of two there has been a lot of
work afterwards for example this prop
factor 2 is basically coming from profit
inequalities right for single item it
was 24 K also it will be too
and Cyril I showed that in a very nice
paper he showed that you can get
arbitrarily close to 14 K item auctions
if K goes to infinity okay and for the
matching problem which I showed of the
first slide it gets into the parameter
which is 5.83 for this constraints and
for general Metroid's we got order of
log rank of the Metroid this was later
again improved by Kleinberg and Weinberg
because they have an improved profit
inequalities for Metroid settings
although the point to note about it is
its adaptive prices then you can ask now
how does that have two prices work I
just said that adaptive is a problem the
beauty of the thing is there are
multiple agents the pies for age and two
can depend on price for agent one but
within an age and the price is not
adaptive the whole menu is presented to
him without being adaptive so they can
argue about incentive compatibility etc
but it is still open whether you can
give a profit inequalities for Metroid's
which is not adaptive you do not change
you can put multiple thresholds but it
is not adaptive you set thresholds once
and for all and then you can't do well
with post price mechanism if you go
beyond material settings that also we
show okay so that's the story basically
for deterministic mechanisms you have
this so okay the problem is basically
that the gambler is going and seeing n
random variables and the set of all
random variables you can pick should be
some independent set in a Metroid okay
right the setting episode attorney is
one uniform a droid right and this is a
que uniform matter and this guy's saying
that you will get arbitrarily close to
one in a carry permit right the other
natural question is you know he is the
same better analysis that's all saying
yes and you continue yes you are
comparing against the gambler prophet
who knows all these things that he'll
pick the top yes yes yes yeah exactly
okay so the other thing is here reader
the prophets the gamblers profit was
getting arbitrary explosion
approximation factors are getting a
little close to one can you get the same
thing here when in terms of the rank if
the rank increases in general obviously
you cannot do it because I can create a
big partition matter which is a union of
many uniform Metroid's and this uniform
Metroid might have small but can you put
some nice restrictions on motorized and
then say that for these Metroid's the
Prophet you get kids arbitrarily close
to gamblers profit as the rank increases
ok so that is another open question for
my droids profits profit yes so the
approximation factor gets arbitrary
flows to ok so for the rest of the stock
I'm going to talk about you know what
else can you do so where else can you go
can you generalize to randomized
mechanisms what happens to this argument
where it breaks what what happens if you
go beyond independence and what happens
if you go beyond unity mine settings ok
so all these things were essential for
our proof unit demand settings
independence can deterministic
mechanisms ok ok so does randomization
help ok so first question in single
parameter settings it doesn't it is a
very nice thing the optimum we can is
always deterministic but in multiple
emitter settings it does ok
no there's always a way to do my sins
without randomizing yes you do you make
it asymmetric correct so that's yeah
that's why I used to say that there is a
way to do the single parameter mechanism
optimally deterministic okay so what
does the randomized mechanism look like
in a multi parameter setting okay so
deterministic mechanisms when you have
just one agent is just focus on one
agent it's already complicated
deterministic mechanism is simply a
price menu okay so you put the price p1
for item 1 p-2 for item 2 and this
basically splits the whole turf of
valuations into some regions where item
one is bought some reason your item 2 is
part what do randomized mechanisms look
like you can do two things one thing is
to say that I will pick a price menu
randomly okay that does not do well of
course because if that does well then
one of the price for you should do well
okay so what does well is actually price
men over randomized allocations okay
which we call lotteries so instead of
saying that you can just pick item one
at price p1 just pick item to a price P
to you can also put these kinds of
things in the menu where if you play TV
price p i will give you item 1 with
probability Q one item to with
probability Q 2 okay so you have to be
willing to risk it just like how you do
in price line rate for cheap flights you
do not know which flight they are going
to book of its fertile you're going to
book you pay the price after that it
will tell you which hotel you got booked
or which price you got okay so the
assumption is that the agents are risk
neutral I definitely need this which
means that i am going to calculate the
expected utility when you buy this
lottery as q1 times v1 plus q2 times v2
minus p okay so what are we done by
adding this lottery you basically have
created a new market segment okay though
a few of those guys who are buying item
1 and item to earlier will now move to
this lottery okay then there is those
guys who pay item to item one so you
better segment at the market we're doing
this and one will expect that if you can
do this sophisticated market
segmentation you will get better revenue
okay and that is exactly what is
happening
and the thing is this happens for even
very simple settings let's look at one
agent two items and iad uniformly
distributed between five and six this is
from Tanis who this and in a
deterministic mechanism the optimal
thing to do is put a price and it turns
out to be same price both agents items
and if you put these two prices and also
add a lottery at just four cents below
the price of these two items then what
will happen is this new segment will
come up and these people who are buying
these items earlier will now switch to
the lottery which is a loss for you
because a lottery is selling at a lesser
price okay these guys are paying p star
now they are paying something strictly
less than P star but the gain is that
there is a new segment which was not
able to buy anything before they are now
able to buy the lottery because it's
priced somewhat lower okay and it turns
out of the gain outweighs the loss and
you can get a factor 1.1 improvement
okay so this makes a question so what
happens in general rate can I put keep
on adding lotteries like this and keep
on segmenting the space this is one
segment you can keep on it we can add
infinitely many lotteries and segment
the turf so nicely that you just give
infinite improvement okay by how much
can renovation increase 70 the first
attempt would be to just go back to what
we did for deterministic mechanisms okay
so what I said was you break this item
into four representatives he was a
multi-parameter agent this guy's a
single parameter competition has
increased and therefore revenue has
increased okay that is what we argued
for the deterministic sitting the same
thing should go through here also it
roughly the competition is increased
here also so it should get more revenue
and that is what we thought for a long
time okay none of the examples we had
basically broke this n be a kind of
shark very constricted example where in
spite of the competition the single
parameter mechanism optimal revenue is
strictly smaller than the random is the
optimal mechanism seven in the multi
parameter settings okay and again this
happens for a very simple setting one
agent to iad items the distribution is
so-called equal revenue distribution
which means the probability that you
value exceeds X is exactly 1 by X and in
order to truncate it a 10 what is the
optimal single parameter mechanism 7 you
what is the mechanism first eight so one
item auction rate there are two agents
with these values
and you is a one item auction and even
if it relax the constraint i am saying
that you can sell two items instead
right you can serve both agents you can
get at most 70 of one from each agent
because first any price p you said he'll
buy the probability 1 by p and this one
plus one is two utmost to you can get in
single parameter setting but here is a
lottery menu in the multi parameter
setting okay three lotteries in the menu
the first lottery is what most agents
preferred because it is a small price of
two and a half the second and the third
lotteries are meant for people who are
very crazy about one of the items okay
so this is how the turf looks like now
most of the people will buy the lottery
here this region one there are some
people who have very large value for
item one so they go to region two and
they are ready to pay a price of three
and buy a 10 could be huge but it's a
small set that is this similarly for a
item 2 and this lottery actually naughty
men who gets revenue of 2.2 sense and it
is more than two okay so there is a
factor 1.13 gap between the optimal
single parameter mechanism and optimal
randomized mechanism okay but thankfully
this doesn't scale more so we are able
to show that the optimal single
parameter mechanism is at least half of
the optimal randomized mechanism if this
is joint work with which each other and
David Malik and here is the proof so the
optimal random is mechanisms I don't
know how it looks like it could be some
menu it could even have infinitely many
lotteries in the menu so take that menu
okay I am going to call this LMP
multi-parameter MP it has several
lotteries and one such lottery is gender
lottery is q1 q2 p okay you will get
item one with mobility q night if you to
NP this basically generalizes to any
number of items what I am going to focus
on just two items given this lottery i
am going to construct a mechanism in the
single parameter setting okay that has
good revenue that is comparable to this
that's what i am going to do here is the
mechanism for single parameter settings
so remember in single parameter settings
we have broken this one agent into two
representatives right so now i need to
tell what each representative gets here
is what i am going to do for each
lottery here i am going to create one
lottery and put it in the set LSP one
another lottery and put it in the CL sp2
meant for these two representatives so
this lottery says you know i will give
you item 1 with probability Q 1 I will
go to represent a 21 and say i will give
you your favorite item he is interested
only in one item right the
representatives each are interested only
one item i will give you your favorite
item with probability Q 1 and Q 2 the
item to your anyway not interested so i
will slash the price from P to P minus Q
2 v2 okay so this can be done only after
people reveal their values and similarly
for agent to I do this okay and what's
special about this lottery menu but
special is that if this agent decides
that this lottery was the best lottery
for ml then the corresponding single
parameter agents both will buy these two
lotteries because the utility is
preserved right the utility here was Q 1
v1 plus Q 2 v2 minus P is the same
utility here it is q 1 v1 minus this
price P minus q2 which is the same so
what are original isn't chooses to guy
also chooses that much is clear so what
I want to show is that this mechanism
revenue is good okay MSP so what is its
revenue consider any value V 1 comma V 2
and let us focus on the case where v1 is
at least p 2 and the revenue is of
course the revenue you get from LST 1
plus the revenue get from LSP to which
is of course at least the revenue get
from the first lottery menu and what is
that that is exactly the price rate he
buys the lottery so you get a revenue of
the price which is P minus q2 v2 ok this
is still less than P the original
setting you got a revenue of P here you
got P minus q2 v2 so who knows rate this
could be very small and even if you add
this revenue is again p minus q2 v2 so
you have to p minus Q and v1 minus q2 v2
I do not know what is that right how
does it compare to pee but the idea is
that this Q 2 v2 is at most v2 rate Q 2
smaller than one unit demand setting and
this is the revenue of the second price
auction in the single parameter sitting
right so V 1 is greater than v 2 and v
crazy auction will get you v2 so this is
the revenue of the second price auction
and single parameter setting so what
this guy falls short off is bounded by
at most Vic raise revenue so what I sure
now is
that for any lottery menu you give me
its revenues upper bounded by this
single parameter mechanism which I
constructed and the second price auction
and this is that most twice the original
okay so that's it and hereafter you can
go through the old story so there we
said that the deterministic mechanism
optimal deterministic mechanism in multi
parameter setting has the two
approximation here it becomes a four
approximation because you lose another
factor to okay so it's the same portion
price mechanism can approximate the
optimal randomized mechanism to a factor
for so that is all I will say about
randomized mechanism ok the next thing I
want to talk about is you know what
happens if you go beyond independence
particularly independence seems
unrealistic in unit immensity great unit
demand means you're basically
substitutes it I said hotel as an
example you know how very unrealistic
that you have completely dependent
values for different hotels on the other
hand if you are 0 for arbitrary
correlations Patrick beasts which each
Allah Bobby Kleinberg and Matt will show
that you can get unbounded gas between
deterministic and dynamics mechanisms
okay so what happens is that they
construct these wicked distributions for
which you can construct one lottery menu
for every point the support of the
distribution you can construct a huge
support and then you can keep on
increasing revenue through this the
funny thing is this happens even for two
items one agent to item that is a
simplest setting one item you cannot do
any randomized mechanism so arbitrary
correlations are not allowed so then
what is a good model of correlation for
substitutes okay so this is something
I'm interested in one model if we came
up with this work was this what we
called as common base value correlation
okay so because these items are all
substitutes right say three hotels now
what is the functionality side by hotel
it gives you accommodation so let us say
that people have some common value for
accommodation and after that each would
hotel has its own speciality maybe
Edgewater is close to beach Hilton has a
good swimming pools and maybe Wi-Fi is
good at Holiday Inn and maybe you have
separate additional values for these
things what we say is that there is a
common base value V naught for getting
served
and then additionally there is a VI for
each speciality these VA's are all
independent V naught is independent but
this is out they are correlated this is
a common baseline correlation this guy's
a business traveler and he cares about
Wi-Fi case a vacation here maybe catch
more about beach but with this kind of
correlation mild correlation but suit
substitutes you can prove that you know
the optimal dynamics mechanisms revenues
only within a factor AE to the optimal
determines the same post prices will
give you a factor rate constant factor
approximation so what are other forms of
correlation which you can tackle the
rope'n question but you can tackle
arbitrary correlations so I leave beyond
independence question their next
question is beyond unit demand okay Yuri
demand also very crucial in doing this
for example I said the cue to v2 was
lost and in general its baby going to be
sum over j not equal to i star the
biggest one of q j VJ unless all these
qs sum to 1 you cannot bound and that
will give you a factor k instead of
factor to i said so you cannot go beyond
unit demand with the same approach so
what can you tell about audit
evaluations there are other things
submodel valid other things but we don't
even know how to do additive okay again
the same story for additive evaluations
surge you heart and normally son show
that the gap between randomized and
deterministic is unbounded and they show
that if the distributions are
independent you can get an order of log
square in approximation this was later
improved by shin Ely and Andy and Yahoo
and which is he how they give a order of
log and approximation improve the order
of log square n and still a constant
factor is open if you give a constant
factor then this will make the story
exactly the same as the unit demand
story the same unbounded gap correlation
same constant factor with independence
so this is open okay so that is the
story for additive evaluations and of
course beyond additive nobody knows
what's going to happen so all these are
interesting open question have sure is
going to have intense activity the next
few years then what about combinatorial
feasibility constraints right instead of
the same
constraints the matching constraint was
just an intersection of partition
Metroid's what happens if you go to
general matrix this I already mentioned
this Bobby claim bergamot Weinberg
showed that you know they develop profit
inequalities for metal feasibility
constraints give the same factor too but
these thresholds are adaptive okay so
that so what are the open questions
there are several open questions but I
am going to just focus on things which
are directly related to the talk okay so
one is this unit demand settings okay
there is no need to go through this
reduction to single parameter settings
and go earth that if you go through that
you cannot do anything better than to
hear anything better than four here that
is the end of the idea they rained you
can extract more than that so can you do
better than two okay in fact the pitas
is open but even anything slightly
better than to even 1.9 is interesting
to me because it is going to be a new
idea same thing for randomized and for
additive evaluations constant factor
itself is open as I said Britt again p
test is also open and the gap between
randomized and deterministic is open
because the speed has could be through a
randomized mechanism metroid profit
inequality is again i already mentioned
can do to non-adaptive thresholds and
the other thing is profit inequalities
for correlated distributions so one
might think that correlated
distributions are leaking more
information there for you no profit in
equality should do well it put
thresholds a too well but there are
examples where it performs as bad as
possible so for arbitrary correlations
you can't tackle so for what kinds of
correlations can you give profit
inequalities which give constant factor
approximation so the these are things
which are directly related to the talk
yeah that's it yeah thanks for listening
single parameter so handle case when
institutions are not regulars or virtual
valuations are not increasing mm-hmm yes
because I can look at and virtual values
those are my random variables now just
apply profit inequalities on I investor
values that's it only thing is you have
to be careful about seven your ironing
virtual values these guys have some so
how do you invert the function rate i am
going to inside put a threshold and
virtual one is because i am going to
invert it the how will you invert when
there is a flat region you should invert
it either using this end or that end so
you can never change the probability of
allocation in an iron region you should
not pick the prize in between okay as
long as you do that then you are good
that is all there is to that profit in
equality is basically this so you have
these n n random variables a profit can
see through all these random variables
ahead of time it picks the biggest one
you as a gambler are competing with this
profit you do not see the future but
still you know you are saying that I
will do at least half as well as the
prospect so that is the profit
inequality this is originally due to
kangaroo justin and Garlin they said
that the best stopping rule can give you
a half approximation but these best
stopping rules could be complicated what
Samuel con showed is that the simple
threshold stopping rules are already
good they'll give you the same half
approximation in the half estate very
simple examples this profit in quality
wood over you showed with one over one
minus one over root K something like
that right under which conditions is
this is a key item property equality
which means that the gambler can choose
K random variables nek he wants ok so
the original setting was that once you
choose you stop rate you don't see
anything the next day here you stop
after the KH thing you choose just set
free surface pressure yes
you can do it in that factor of maximum
overall first Shh yes right
if you knew everything out of time you
pick the top cake yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
