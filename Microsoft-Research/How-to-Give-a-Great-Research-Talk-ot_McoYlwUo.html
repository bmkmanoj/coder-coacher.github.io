you
with simon jones ii talks i don't really
have to introduce you now i've already
done that
thanks a lot for coming back and giving
you a second talk on how to give a great
research talk of course we can put that
into context a little bit with what
they've told us this morning and see
whether the two of them agree and what
we learned from both sessions or whether
they're any conflict points but they
will also join us in a minute so we can
have a discussion about some points as
well okay and we have to so that we fit
should finish at four right that's why
yeah that's fine okay so this is a
controlled experiment in the sense that
I was in London this morning so sadly I
was not able to come to Dave's sessions
that like that together they were really
good so you get the chance to sort of
see two completely independent views and
you can you can judge how they how well
they fit together so same rules of
engagement as before so you on Tuesday
you a great audience but didn't just sit
there like bread puddings and and wait
like you who sort of came back and made
comments and ask questions as the talk
went along and that's good right so
please do that again I know it's this
this time it's not the morning it's
after lunch and you know we've really
been saturated with talks but
nevertheless do try try okay so this bit
is about your paper has amazingly being
accepted for the conference so now you
get to give your talk so I'm mainly
going to think about a kind the format
of a um you know a kind of 20 or 30
minute conference thought there's sent
many essentially all the same lessons
apply to a kind of one-hour seminar talk
as well in in a department somewhere
so mostly then I want to focus on um you
know trying to think about why it is
that you're giving this talk but it's
awfully easy to be a bit woolly about
that what to put in and more
specifically what to leave out right and
Anna and also I want I want to give you
a reason that you might want to tune
into this talk right so so here it is
what why should you care well so many
talks particularly their presentations
off the paper may be quite good that the
presentations are not very exciting you
go along to the you know it's the eighth
presentation that day and somehow it
doesn't set your blood racing through
your veins right so the general standard
is you know is not that great in quite
simple things just like with writing a
paper can make your talk I think a lot
better
and this is good right and moreover this
is not just good for you because people
then you know like like your tour but
it's also good for the world because
your ideas are communicated more
accurately and in a more exciting way
and you more ever you get the benefit of
their feedback and finally it's a it's a
kind of talks amazing like this is the
chance when you have the at least mm
modulo laptops undivided attention of a
series of people who might actually be
interested in what you have to say and
as I was saying for this is their most
precious commodity and they're
physically in the room with you so this
is the sort of golden opportunity to you
know have some informed dialogue with
people select to kind of don't waste it
really worth paying attention to this
it's commit communication exercise so
back to here first thing want to say a
bit about purpose all right and in
everything that I say I'm going to speak
quite a lot about to go to computer
science II talks but um anything to do
with you no exaggeration styles and
stuff you should listen to Dave this
morning right my slides are terrible
form a sort of typography point of view
I just go for the content so you listen
today for that and outdo me in that
respect so why are you giving this talk
so here are some bad reasons right to
impress your audience right there you
are in front of a you know an audience
you would like the most units who would
like to seem very clever right and
bamboozle one somebody told me the other
day that yet on Tuesday that many social
science papers are written in this way
maybe presentations though as well I
can't really believe this but it should
be bad nor is it about trying to brain
dump everything you know about the topic
on your audience and this does happen my
people sometimes give talks in which
they sort of you know they're so excited
about their topic they just tell you
everything they know all at once and
that's very indigestion nice you need to
be a bit selective and that comes with
not presenting too much technical detail
because that can overwhelm your audience
as well so these are sort of non goals
to present everything or to impress them
here are some things that I think are
goals right you want to convey just like
in your paper but now you've got a
captive but perhaps less well informed
and less motivated audience
for a paper you have our audience that
isn't captive but there um there may be
a bit more motivating your audience in a
room here is that's a bit less
motivation but they are physically here
in the room with you so you want to give
them some idea about what you're taught
you you want to convey to them your key
idea I can just convey some intuition to
them so that even if they leave the talk
and they never read the paper and they
never see it see anything else about
your talk again they have taken away
something that was valuable to them so
this is the last thing I said to make
them glad they came right and presumably
that means that might mean glad you know
it was funny or I you know we've kind of
a it was lively presentation but it
would be better if they took away some
some ideas that they thought that was
kind of interesting actually I might be
able to use that or at least it was
intriguing so it's it's also a good way
to think of it is it's a kind of
advertisement for your paper right so
often when you're giving a talk you have
a research paper behind it you know
maybe in the Proceedings of the
conference maybe something you're
writing at the moment that has much more
detail and so you could think of a talk
as a kind of a loss leader or sort sort
of advertisement that makes people think
oh I would really like to know more
about that in hallelujah the author has
so you know written a paper about it too
so I can go read the paper do you want
to leave them sort of salivating it's
like you know the taster menu and then
they want to get go back go back and get
the real thing ok so far so good so this
is why why you want to give that why you
want to give you a talk so focusing on
these things they kind of seem obvious
and yet when you think about them when
you're writing your talk they do change
the way you give it I think and what you
put in now your audience here they are
pouring in your audience are the
audience you would like were there when
you began they have read all your papers
right so they've eagerly been following
you're on your research progressive but
each of your papers have they come out
they're just they're just they're there
they're there they're following your RSS
feed they're reading your blog posts and
they're just waiting for that next paper
right and they're very familiar with the
technical background all right they know
all about AP morphic by functors and
moreover they are ready like it's it's
the morning there they've been for their
morning run they're full of
energy this is the audience you want so
what is the audience you get right your
purse it in every dimension right there
they're late they have never heard of
you
they they have heard of you know by
functors but they kind of wish they
hadn't
and and moreover they're kind of dozy
right because they've been they've been
sitting in a windowless room for six
hours listening to talks you're kind of
at the end of the day of a research
conference and they'd be is that eating
chocolate for the whole day so they're a
bit overwhelmed all right so what are
you gonna do what's your goal so your
goal is to kind of take this audience
and kind of wake them up and make them
feel they're glad that they came to that
talk right and they're taking away
something exciting from it that's it and
that they wish they could wish they
could read your paper so this is the
sort of overall story right about what
you're trying to do I want to say a
little bit about what to put in what to
leave out and about how about
presentation style to help orient and so
starting with what to put in how you
might achieve this goal so far so good
any any observations or questions so far
okay so here's what I try to put into a
talk a bit of motivation to explain sort
of why you might want to listen to the
talk and then a lot about the key idea
and pretty much nothing else in an
hour's talk you might have room for a
bit else but basically for 20 minutes or
so or 25 minute conference talk you
don't have them for anything else at all
so I want to say a bit more about both
of these things first motivation right
so I figure that when you first I think
believe David heard this to you this
morning what did he call it the hallowed
something the hallowed ground of
cognitive dissonance or something yes
well anyway the verse 2 minutes are
important 90 seconds okay well we we we
disagree on 30 seconds worth but so so
you would you don't have very long to
engage your audience but I think Dave is
right that you do have that moment at
the beginning at which at the beginning
of the talk they do look up they look up
for meaning their email or reading their
proceedings they're willing to engage
with you but you have to give
the reason to stay with you in the first
90 seconds or two minutes right so so
it's it's you've got to do so quickly
and so these are the questions those are
in the backs of back of their mind they
may not be thinking explicitly but they
are so what are you gonna do well so I
try to give you one example right at the
beginning what about my second slide was
why you should listen to this talk all
right so I actually wrote that at the
top right why should tune into this talk
and you can do that too
right you would treat your audience is
grown up so I know you're going to read
your email in a moment but I want to
tell you why you should hang on and give
me a you know give me a chance here
right so you can you can even do it as
explicitly as that but that is the sets
of subtext for your first 120 seconds or
90 seconds so here's a a couple of
examples right of intros that I think
might you know work quite well and you
can imagine ones that don't right so
yeah what's it Java class files a large
oh you know gives a little bit of data
here and they get sent over networks
could we use some language or where
compression technology better than gzip
say to squish them down so that we could
send the same information over using you
know fewer bits and therefore get them
there quicker yes I'm going to show you
in this talk how by using language aware
technology that knows what it's
compressing rather than generic
compression technology I can do sort of
25% better and therefore get the
programs running faster okay so you can
say that in about 30 seconds you can
give a couple of examples in the next
minute and your way so you know means
you've given them a little hook you've
given a bit of data but you made those
claims remember when we're talking about
writing a paper I was saying make the
claims early right this is you're making
the claim bit in your first couple of
minutes if you can here's another
example concurrent programs everybody
knows that in concurrent program
programs finding synchronization errors
is really hard I'm going to show you a
you know a scalable technique that finds
a certain class of synchronization
errors and does so very bustling and
then you might give an example or two to
illustrate what you mean by that but but
what you don't want to do is just to
give the first two minutes of sort of
general blather right about the general
area before you get anywhere near what
you're going to tell them okay that's my
it so it's motivation so I call it
motivation because you want to leave
them motivated right it's your two
minutes to make them feel they want to
stay with you
okay so what do we have we had
motivation and key idea as motivation
what about key idea so this is you were
you will remember this from Tuesday
right in your paper by the time you've
finished you must know the key idea and
you must make sure that you know your
leadership is absolutely and no doubt
about it and in a talk it's even more so
and you may have to refine it even more
paper you know you have quite a lot of
bits in a paper you have fewer bits in a
talk so you have to remorselessly tease
out what is the one thing you would like
your audience to go away with so
sometimes I actually produce a slide
right that says you know this slide has
the key idea on it or I jump up and down
I say if you're gonna remember nothing
else about this talk remember this slide
actually this is the one that I would
like you to remember right it's a bit
all but self-referential but
nevertheless it's a good idea to do that
with your audience because then even if
they have been reading their email
looking at all
oh what is the key idea you know it sort
of it gives them a reason saying now is
the moment to listen okay
and another very helpful thing about
this is that once you've written that
slide or little slide sequence that says
here is the key idea the rest of the
talk kind of almost organizes itself by
the slides before put you in a position
to articulate what the idea is and the
slides after are giving more evidence
that the key idea works or more
background but you know just more detail
to fill it out I make sense but until
you know what it is you can't use it as
an organizing principle so let's see so
so another thing about key ideas a key
idea means something that is kind of
specific so sometimes you find talks
with a more-or-less surveys they tell
you a little bit about a lot these talks
are seem worthy but they are always dull
so I call this a sort of broad and
shallow this this guy is light and for
my money it's always better to do things
that are narrow and deep so you you as
it were a giving audience some meet to
change the metaphor right not just sort
of superficial stuff
and that means you may need to sort of
sink her you know a mineshaft into your
paper your paper maybe covers more but
instead of covering your whole paper to
a uniform shallow depth pick some aspect
and cover it in more depth okay so you
can so I drew the picture kind of like
this because you want to give your
audience some sense of the territory or
make some claims that the the paper will
cover this area but then in your talk
you say I'm going to focus down and just
study this particular example or this
particular aspect and I'm going to show
you in some detail how that works and
then you're going to have to take my
word for it that the paper covers you
know another couple or do two or three
more things that broaden that mineshaft
out to particular to cover more
territory
DUSU what I mean but what's bad is if
you cover the whole spate structure of
the paper to uniform depth because that
almost invariably means you leave your
audience hungry right you leave your
audience with only their claims
they have nothing to take away they're
all they all they know is well he claims
this and he claims that he's given a
tiny bit of detail but really there was
nothing to bite on all right so give
them give them some red meat I mean
sense of you experience talks like this
where you just kind of think oh well yes
kind of I suppose but the detail really
helps and it's okay at the end to say
and I've seen people do this often in
conference talks and it's quite good
idea particularly the conference up
where there's a specific paper that
backs it they may say if you read the
paper you will find out about X Y &amp;amp; Z
and they do that in kind of 60 seconds
so all they're doing is giving you a
quick menu but then this is at the end
of the talk so they had the intellectual
scaffolding to make sense of what
they're saying you say that at the end
you can say here's what you'll get from
the paper kind of like a contents list
for the bits that I missed out from the
talk that can be quite helpful okay so
this is what to put it and this is how
to put it in so when you put it in what
are you going to do for this narrow but
deep thing it's the same as I was
explaining for when you're writing a
paper start with the example spike the
moment a paper I said start with
examples and then move on to the
generality in a talk it start with the
examples and you won't have time for the
generality all right that's pretty much
it
actually you might hope that if the talk
goes well you know that you can give you
examples and then have room to state a
general theorem or sort of be able to at
least make more general claims but
partly what I mean by this now of a deep
thing is at least for the example you
can give enough detail to make the
audience feel I understand how that
would work and then your your more
general claim can be and it works in a
more general situation and you can
identify what that is okay so but if
you're short of time and you will be the
temptation is to leave the examples out
because how can you deny your audience
the glorious I know wonder of seeing
your general result but if your audience
sees the full glory of your general
result and has no clue what it means
communication has failed it is as if you
had never told them so it's much better
to successfully communicate something
modest than to unsuccessfully
communicate something grand that's what
it comes down to so here's an example of
an example this is a slide from a talk
that I gave really quite a long time ago
now and it was about exception handling
in a purely functional language in fact
in a lazy language now you may remember
exceptions when you say you know throw
some exception and it bubble sort of
bubbles up the control stack somehow but
in a lazy language there's no defined
order of evaluation so it's not at all
clear where the exception handler would
be and our talk was about how to deal
with that so all I was saying here was
making a general remark here exceptions
have to do with control flow and lazy
languages don't really have control flow
in the same way and then I immediately
jumped into an example for solution one
right I have a sort of general statement
used data values to carry exceptions
that's very short general statement but
then rather than try to explain what it
means I just use an illustration a
particular example and by the way here I
didn't vocalize this bottom line right
but it was just a little remark on a
slide a little citation of related work
that somebody who knew what they were
talking about would say oh yeah that's
the right thing to site so you can cite
related work in your slides but I would
typically not make a meal of it but it's
an example of doing that
okay that's it motivation key idea
supported by examples if you can do that
successfully and convey from your mind
to the mind of your audience
and intuition for what your main idea is
success okay I'm going to say something
about what to leave out but you're all a
bit passive today so maybe it is the
after lunch thing towards observations
so far all questions yeah never add any
formulas oh so so so I want to say a bit
about formalism in a second so formalism
is really important so when I go and
sometimes conveying intuition is aided
by formalism so I'll let me say come
back to formalism in just a moment yes
it's a good question because I don't
mean say fluffy vague things the whole
time right this is this is saying fluffy
vague things the whole time this is
being specific concrete precise about
something like yeah okay yeah combining
two different approaches biology what do
you do when you combine the two
different approaches biology of computer
starts he means so there's a bit more
background you have to give in
interdisciplinary fields isn't it to
give good talks that's what it boils
down to but you see all you have to
think is I have 20 minutes of my
audience's attention how can I make best
use of that now maybe in order to
understand anything about what you're
talking to us and a little bit about the
computer science a little bit about
biology and it might differ depending on
the audience maybe if you're addressing
a computer science audience you need to
tell them all biology and vice-versa I
don't have any easy answers for you just
to say that once you know what your key
idea is you can make it maybe organize
your
to try to to get to that and it's tough
some key ideas it easier to scaffold and
get to than others Dino no silver bullet
well so what if your talk really is only
relevant for three members of the
audience I would resist that assumption
right because you have the rest of the
audience right and they're stuck with
you right so maybe you should think of
your think try to think of your talk I
think okay so maybe my talk really can't
be very much about my paper at all
but the truth the honest truth is there
really are only three people who will
care which case you might want to frame
your talk a bit more broadly that would
engage a few more people and then you
know halfway through user to zoom in and
say okay the rest of you at this stage
if you fall off the wagon it's fine I'm
just going to you so in other words
don't I think it's really a shame on all
the other people in the room if you find
yourself forced to focus on that very
narrow audience very early because it
loses the medium of a talk right it took
to her to a larger audience and I may
hurt you because the bit you're most
excited about is that now a focus bit
but you kind of owe it to them to give
them some cycles of maybe tutorial
material and what's the most interesting
thing about the you know the development
is leading to your idea even if it's not
your idea what's the most fascinating
thing that you found on that on the
journey that you would like to share
that might be one way to think of it
okay all those say yeah yeah you
mentioned to avoid stating the obvious
but us for instance your example
previously you said concurrency yeah
yeah we cool two spots yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah so not very long so so
you say this this kind of statement you
just say is really just positioning your
whole work in in some territory so you
don't want you know you know you want to
say we all know guys that can come
programs really hard to write and that
bugs are extremely difficult to discover
because they're so reproducible like
that's it you know it took you ten
seconds to say that will you position
yourself but if you take another three
minutes to say that that's bad why
because everybody's thinking I know that
I know that get on with it right so a
very quick positioning but then
immediately focus on the bit that you're
after
zooming in like it is like Google Earth
right the bit that when you go from
seeing the whole earth to sort of
zooming in on where do you live from so
assuming in on Paris like that that's
that orientation that's quite helpful
right if you just see Paris close-up you
think well am i right so it yeah good
question let me tell you something not
to put it that people often do the first
thing is the outline of your talk
how many talks have you seen like this
they start off the very first slide
it's the outline of your talk hole and
then moreover or even worse they're
always put up this like they read
through it kind of line by line you know
I'm going to tell you about synthetic
Epping morphisms and then because that
seems to school they can't bear not to
say you know another 20 seconds work
about what synthetic epi morphisms are
which none of you nobody understands at
this stage and then and your own
everybody's going to sleep this is
remember your first 90 seconds and
you're burning that hallowed ground on
the table of contents which nobody
understands it's it's like the the
section about my the structure of my
paper is as follows same thing yes at
which case it may be nice to have a
table of contents to show the might not
be about so this is what's going to be
disguised story else maybe skip ahead to
here
maybe I'm not going to be at all as
opposed to having to go through all the
slides right right so so let's see you
think you might want to put one of these
slides into an online version not not
what you present but what you post later
yeah yeah I'll hide it well don't skip
just hide it you know so it doesn't
appear at all don't distract your
audience if you possibly can
no distractions so and but but not
having an and not having an outline
doesn't mean no signposts
so here I've been giving periodic sort
of orientation things to say I'm sort of
shifting gears now to a sort of a new
section that's quite helpful sometimes
people have a kind of a table of
contents with a kind of and they put a
signpost slide like this with the whole
table of contents with you know
highlighting the one that they're up to
now that can be quite helpful so quick
signposts to help orient your audience
as you go through that's fine
just don't spend your first 90 seconds
on it that's all and never pause for
very long yeah well because you're
concentrating so the question is what
worm what's the difference between a
table of contents and the bit that I
said you should do which is why you
should listen to the talk all right well
provided you're orienting what you're
presenting there around this is why you
should listen to the talk that's fine
right but this is not oriented it's
simply a table of contents it's been
like what's the difference between the
structure of this paper is as follows
section one is about that sale and the
contributions are blah right so it's all
that the difference is what your intent
for this slide is if this is the best
way to explain why an uninformed
audience should listen to the talk go
for it
that's your goal what is the best way to
explain to your audience in the first 90
seconds why they should listen if that's
it fine yeah
of creating slides in which this
outlines slide is something like slide
number six or seven so you have the
title yes it right the problem and movie
idea and then you jump to this one and
say well we already discussed about the
background what it's going to next is
way better it's much better to do your
intro first I've got people engage and
then start giving signposts but even
once you do get that signpost you know a
whole slide with content don't spend
long on it like you know ten seconds or
something or 15 seconds just to say you
know now that was kind of it about here
you know about a third of the way
through we don't go back I'm not going
to show you but it's a bit of this but
don't look through all the ones you were
about to do but I've got to
don't even mention them so go no further
than where you've got to when you're
explaining that but that's fine yeah
sometimes people put it up in very tiny
font at the beginning and there's or but
what you should not do let me tell you
one thing not to do do you know at the
bottom sometimes people have slides that
say three there slide three and
sometimes that can be quite helpful
because then an audience later can say
on slide 12 you know you had something I
didn't understand that can be but
sometimes it says
slide three out of 52 and that's
terrible because the audience are
thinking what you know where 91/30
percent readers at all my 10% into the
slides and they start doing this
calculation constantly will he ever
finish right 52 slides
oh my goodness me so it becomes a great
preoccupation for your audience please
don't do that I never ever give the the
number of slides was you're going to cut
them if you run out of time yeah it's
okay definitely we should not abuse out
my slides that we should not have bad
outline slides but in pay engineer that
alpine slide to be a nice one yeah and
actually it can be a nice progress bar
to show it every now and then yeah right
so and I think it's more polite to your
audience to actually know where your
signpost good so progress bar good so I
just see the outline slide then actually
you know if I'm not really interested
into your evaluation section or the
details of your design I may just look
out and yeah that's fine but well I
think the main thing I'm saying it's not
it's not never show anything like this
but do not stop here in your first 90
seconds and spend time talking about it
that's that's the point I've been to
talks women we've been five minutes in
before we've left this stuff I am
completely lost it happens that's that's
the main thing do offer signposts in
whatever way seems best to you could be
our place line book slide where you know
at the moment where our audience has the
pension you know is is in our
presentation yeah well you know when the
attention is you know if not that good
we'd then bring the off point slide
basically now I'm gonna switch to
something yeah yeah so yeah good one of
the things that you might be missing
here is that your time is really
precious and a conference talk this talk
so far has been fifty percent longer
than a typical conference talk you've
been thirty seconds or a minute on high
you actually don't and lost it it and
something like this even if you spend
ten seconds on people are trying to read
it don't prevent it on the slides that
people don't have time to read while
they're listening to you okay I think
we're agreeing furiously right progress
bar good not too much detail and do not
pause and spend a lot of time because
your time is precious you have you know
twenty minutes
that's not long if you spend one minute
hard enough said okay like right none so
what it's another thing not to put in is
a slide about related work we talked
about this in the but so if papers who
said put related work at the end for a
talk a conference talk I'll probably not
put a related work slide at all right
mainly because for most of the audience
it won't make any sense
right your audience is broad at this
point and it's not helpful that's again
like in the paper that's not the same as
saying you should not acknowledge
related work so as you go through you
just mention you know
into just in passing or on the slide
like I did in an earlier one just
mentions and stuff and if it in response
to a question then you must absolutely
know your stuff so if somebody says but
what about you know green and black you
say yeah that was fantastic then it
relates to us in the following way so so
your responses to questions must be
articulate and you know it and support
it but I don't think it's worth spending
again with your pressures twenty minutes
a long time going through this okay that
is for the paper
yeah so that's so the the the
observation is that some people can use
related work as a motivational slide and
say we start from here and we've but
these guys can do this this and this but
there's a missing piece and we're going
to add that so that's fine if the goal
is that is the shortest path to
motivating your audience so the goal is
motivate your audience and get them to
understand the problem and where the gap
is the goal is not to make sure that you
have mentioned x y&amp;amp;z see what I mean
that that's that's the point though the
next thing that you must not put in is
too much technical detail right so you
know you've seen talks like this what
are we gonna tweak what are we leaving
out outline slides related work and lots
of technical details so this is speaks
to a question about formalism if you put
up a slide like this you can see the
audience going they sort of go oh right
and so just a few of them will go aha
now we see the meet they are vanishingly
rare you know vanishingly rare most of
audience will slump in their seats when
they see this No
so nevertheless some of this may be very
interesting if I have a something like
this I actually might put up a slide
like this at some point to say look the
whole type system fits on one slide I'm
not expecting you to read this at all I
just want you to get a sense that it's
not that big you find the details in the
paper and then I might but I might do
that after I have shown so I might pick
one of these rules right you know
perhaps this one and it might sort of
blow it up to full screen and talk
through that rule in detail
so I do something in detail and then a
whole lot of other stuff I don't have
time for right so so the formalism is
important in computer science computer
science out you know has tons of really
good insightful formalism behind it but
I would be selective about present
present one bit of formalism you know
thoroughly as it were and then say and
there's a whole lot more that you can
read in the paper well that'd be my
approach to it but it's awfully easy to
do this why is it awfully easy to do
this because every one of these typing
judgment rules is drenched in your blood
it's the same as with the the paper
stuff like the blind alleys I was
telling you about this is in the blind
alley but nevertheless it took a lot of
work to get to that point and you are
reluctant not to share with your
audience how wonderful it all is and yet
it's counterproductive to do so right so
resent specific aspects by all means and
do have some more as a back up side so
sometimes you'll get questions from the
audience so they kind of have a
technical nature and it's quite helpful
to be able to flick to a slide so here's
the whole system and yes this is the
typing rule that I'd refer you to in the
paper as it were you so it's quite as a
backup slide but it's a it's a terrible
temptation to present too much technical
detail okay so much for what to leave
out so I want to say a little bit about
presentation stuff right so we heard a
bit about what to put in a bit about
what to leave out now about just
physically getting on a presenting it
well so this is another slide to imme
remember nothing else from this talk if
you've got to remember this right but
when you are presenting your ideas to an
audience your principle mechanism during
our presentation for making them
receptive to your ideas is to appear
enthusiastic now the great thing is you
probably are enthusiastic after all you
spend a good fraction of your last few
months or years working on this thing
and so unless you're exhausted you're
probably think yes this is the greatest
thing since nice bed and you've got to
share that sense with your audience
so I can't tell you how important this
is because it kind of it dramatically
increases your audience's receptiveness
it's like flowers you know those
pictures have sort of sunflowers they
sort of droop at night and then the Sun
comes out the flowers sort of go like
this and they kind of open up and and or
you you can if you sit at the front and
look at an audience when somebody else
is speaking you can almost see the
flowers opening up when the speaker
appears to be excited to engage with
what they're speaking about and you can
see this droop and retreat into their
laptops when the speaker appears to be
you know deeply unenthusiastic about
their topic and says well you know
convey submission well you know I'm not
very interested in this and almost
certainly you aren't very interested in
but here I am anyway so I suppose I'll
tell you about it you know subliminally
people never say that but subliminally
they can convey that impression and
another big thing of course is that if
you appearing at these things often to
do with sort of physical moving around I
get yeah I think you talked about this
this morning about sort of presentation
styles but actually I find that the
business about moving around not being
stuck at a podium somewhere it's very
helpful for making me feel more relaxed
as a speaker so it's I encourage you to
do it and I know this is a personal
thing right some people find it very
much more difficult to kind of exude the
enthusiasm because they know then just
naturally more and kind of understated
people you know I might sort of you know
a congenital and exhibitionist so so
it's easy for me to seem enthusiastic
but I just have to beg you that even if
you're very modest person who is
typically very quiet you have to kind of
just train yourself somehow
but for these 20 minutes you aren't
going to make everybody believe that
this is the most important thing in your
life and convey that sense then it's
really but that's the biggest thing you
can do to make them receptive to your
message of course you have to have a
message to write but it's no good if
they're not receptive to it so you need
both okay that's it this is the big
thing and if you're not enthusiastic you
cannot expect them to be okay
the next thing about presenting the talk
is be familiar with it like so I've
written write of slides of the night
before and indeed I used to
quite often write my slides more or less
than night before or at least polish
them up and this was in the days when we
vote on acetates and you present them on
an overhead projector so there were
physical objects now it's even easier
like you can you can sit in the talk
before you can still be modifying your
slides alright but the important thing
is that when you're presenting your talk
you want to know exactly what's going on
you don't want to be so I'm being I'm
being bad today right I have a couple of
times I've sort of gone past where I
intended I had to look to check what my
next lie was about that's very very bad
right you shouldn't do that you should
be so familiar with your talk by the
time you present it that you know what's
coming next and you don't do any sort of
forward and back stuff that makes sense
and you could you know you can set your
computer to show they the next slide and
cues like that but the important thing
is that the audience should not know
should you know it should appear
seamless because you are deeply familiar
with the exact order that you've chosen
to present okay and actually and I think
it's quite cool if you can put in a few
references in your talk of reference or
two to a talk that was earlier that day
kind of cool shows you were listening
okay so another thing that people often
do at the beginning of their talk is
they make an apology of some kind say ah
you know I'm a mere worm I don't feel
very well qualified to adjust this
audience or you know my computer broke
last night so I hung all the results
that I was hoping to give you or my
flight was late or my my son died
somebody actually gave a talk I said my
son died so I'm sorry I'm late
everybody think why me why you here at
all your son's dead this is in the days
when some computer made workstations and
he meant that is that with workstation
have fallen over those okay
now but the important thing about this
is don't apologise but your audience is
deeply uninterested in your shortcomings
they're just not in that interested in
you they're interested in what you have
to offer them so it's just the waste of
time and it makes it sort of sets you
off on the wrong foot
just remorselessly remove all apology
okay even if it's richly deserved if you
should nevertheless remove it now next
thing about things there you are sitting
in the front row right and your previous
speakers going and they seem to be fully
confident enthusiastic the audience is
engaged and you're sitting there they're
thinking I'm not sure I can actually
stand up
all right because your legs are doing
that wobbly thing and you're breathing a
bit fast and actually it seems in
serious doubt whether you'll be
physically able to stand up I have felt
like this on numerous occasions in fact
I can tell you from experience that it's
very rare to be unable to physically
stand up it really feels like that
so you can normally do it so the but but
nevertheless there is this moment at the
beginning of a talk at which things are
a bit you know that the moment at which
you the person has introduced you their
eyes swivel to you you know you've got
that hundred twenty seconds and like
sort of you know the headlights finally
focus on the rabbit and then what's
going to happen so my suggestion would
be to script that first little intro
right so I hate it when you if at all
possible
do not read your talk right everybody
knows this is bad if you're just sitting
there reading your talk it but but for
the first 90 seconds or so you may want
to actually in advance right out your
exact words and learn them right partly
because this is the hallowed ground all
right so it's important to work on that
but also because if you know what to say
then then by it's like sort of getting
the aircraft launched off the runway if
you can just get going then you'll be
fine but if you sort of stumble in that
beginning bit it can be awfully
discomforting for your audience as well
as you actually so just try scripting
that first little bit but try not to
script the whole
if you can possibly avoid it okay and
don't worry about it right everybody
feels like this everybody feels like
this you are the previous speaker felt
like this before they started all I say
is it it gets a little bit better with
time not all that much but a little bit
better and it certainly gets better
during the talk so if you are you know
so enthusiastic about what you'll
explain soon you're sort of lost in the
subject and you kind of lose your fear
of your audience because you think are
so wonderful right so try to cultivate
that okay now Dave will have talked
about and being seen and heard so I just
I'm going probably going to reiterate a
couple of things about that but just um
speak to the back right so I'm wearing a
microphone but I think I would be
audible at the back even if I wasn't and
that's a good baseline sort of
hypothesis to use pretend that you
haven't got a microphone and sort of and
maybe he would have talked about making
eye contact that's very important and
you're being very all be very good with
me about making eye contact
um spotting somebody in the audience who
is nodding right so my friend here what
is your name
every Vita a retail club visa so it
loudly so everyone can hear alright
there you are sorry I'm unable to
pronounce your name but you are very
good at nodding at me and this is so
nice right - sometimes you find that
member of the audience who is engaged
enough they just sort of every now and
again they'll just kind of do this and
that it's kind of somewhat somewhat
unconscious in the case in your case I
know it's somewhat conscious you're
trying to be encouraging that's very
nice of you right so but but often
you'll find it somebody in the audience
who does that and you can make eye
contact with them and kind of you know
because you're forming a little bit of
rapport with them but you must you know
yeah and don't don't just make eye
contact with the same person all the
time
because otherwise they begin to feel a
bit like a rabbit in the headlights
right and um but um it can be quite
encouraging I think to one to find
somebody who's good at that and and
what's your audience for questions so
sometimes you get so wrapped up in your
talk that you forget to look for
questions now in some talk format like
conferences it can be difficult to take
questions during the talk but
in many settings it's fine and it is
really a really very good idea I want to
say next so questions are the most
valuable thing you can get in a talk
when you get questions you know that you
are succeeding all right not you are
failing to communicate you are
succeeding in communicating because
someone hasn't felt engaged enough to
you know to start a dialogue with you
about what's going on right and so if
you respond to a question by sort of
doing a blush off and giving the
impression that you have you know your
plan for the talk you know we're
marching down the plan and please don't
distract me because it's my talk right
then who wants to learn to talk like
that right you want to say this is our
talk this is our chance for a little
dialogue so it's fantastic if you can
then you know not only encourage
questions but respond to them positively
say that's great question and in a sort
of non dismissive kind of way respond to
it and then maybe ask if there are any
others and sometimes that will mean that
your talk gets a bit off the rail so you
don't quite have enough time conference
format you don't tend to get questions
in the middle so then you know what
you're doing but for a seminar you might
have to so but if you if that happens
that is a good thing if you had so many
questions that you're unable to finish
your talk that's probably good at some
point you may have to say actually we
really hadn't got to the good bit yet so
I love your questions but I really want
to get them and please let me get to the
good bit yeah that's okay right because
your audience does it also wants the
good bits but you can truncate the end
okay so it's much much better to have a
well engaged audience that is it you
know excited in case we do that then but
not reach the end of your talk then have
a disengage one but you've presented
everything to them but you know what
happened they always just went away all
right so let's see I put this in after
just just recently about being a the
reverse side of being a good audience
member right so be one of those people
people who nod and do ask questions and
I put this bit about asking questions
because in fact at Microsoft I'm one of
the people who asked a lot of questions
and people often say to me I'm really
glad you asked that question why I sit
there immediately
the moment I start to lose contact I
start asking questions and it's often
fairly early in the talk and so
sometimes the speaker will give me the
strong impression they don't want to
hear from me and anymore and then will
be I'll close down and start reading my
email sometimes they'll respond but I
but I feel that I'm beginning to get to
the point where I'm D railing their
whole talk right and there's another
segment of the audience that really
knows a lot more about the subject that
I'm going to mess up that doesn't that
so it's kind of you know I'll stop
asking questions then because I go to a
lot of talks that aren't in my exact
area but I really urge you to take the
responsibility on yourself in a talk not
to wait for the speaker to ask for
questions but to proactively ask
questions and to start doing so early
right and then then sort of respond to
how the speaker then responds to you
yeah in a twenty minutes conference talk
it's know that you can't do that right
because the sort of conference format is
so set down least in my field right you
know it goes 20 minutes 20 minutes 20
minutes and everybody scripted their
talks pretty precisely so the format is
an uninterrupted presentation followed
by questions but in any kind of
departmental seminar kind of situation
with this you know a group of 20 or 30
people absolutely and sometimes in large
groups like this is a larger group or
maybe it even at a bigger conference yes
yeah oh the abuse it so people always
ask this what about people who are
either awkward nasty or you know
completely what's the word they will not
let go so know so first line of attack
first line of defense is is you sort of
trying to respond constructively to
begin we'd say so and then you say no
I'm really happy to talk to about this
line of questioning but if I follow it
much further we won't have time to get
to the main point of the talk and I'd
really like to talk to you afterwards
why if that fails then you have to start
looking begging Liat your chair right
the person this should be somebody
hosting your talk right you kind of say
help me out here it's pretty rare if
you've sort of shut them down with that
I'd like to talk to you afterwards now
so don't put up with letting your talk
be derailed right you must not do that
but because it's your it is your talk
you're you're kind of taking
responsibility for conveying the key
message to audience so you don't want to
let
that beep sent out of the window yeah
okay well how helpful you can make MIT
but maybe you can say then ha maybe at
this point some of you are getting a
little confused and I've lost you you
know would somebody like to ask a
question that's great when the nada
stops nodding assuming they're not just
going to sleep right sometimes they're
not as are simply dozing off oh you have
to be careful that but if you know when
they stop nodding that can be a clue
that something's going wrong and then
you can really stop and ask you don't
ask them personally right you just say I
have a sort of sense here that maybe I'm
losing touch with you right you plural
that's fine yeah what do I want to say
how much don't say not very much so got
I got four minutes to say three things
just about slide present presentation so
the more that you done with tape make
sure you use one of these they're
tremendously liberating because they
allow you to move around so you can
change slides and make sure they don't
have too many buttons right some of them
have dozens of buttons and it's easy to
press the wrong one and the screen turns
upside down and goes green you want ones
that have forward and back that's it and
bring backups of everything so always
that you know you assume that your
laptop will have broken by the time you
were presenting and always make sure
that it's going to connect to the
projector before your talk I can't tell
you how many times I've set in this
embarrassed moment at the beginning of a
talk of which somebody's fiddling with
the projector you've got to be there in
advance and if you're following somebody
else go there before the session make
sure it works it will still break but
nevertheless at least you tried two
things about slides and then I'm
finished please don't do this I hate
this right there people do this and it's
as if they're telling me is an audience
member I don't really trust you to
listen to me if I show you everything
I'm going to tell you on one slide so
they show it one bit at a time I for me
that great tip is a personal thing but I
find that a very distracting
presentation technique I'd rather just
showed me
the whole thing just occasionally
there's something you want to reveal
right you know like that's happened a
couple of times other slides well I've
had a little gap lab put something else
up but didn't do it very much so that's
just my advice to you take your take it
or leave it but the one the one point at
a time I don't go with it at all and oh
my goodness
now something very weird just like and
I'm sure Dave told you this I just don't
use animations at all except if I'm
doing something like an animating and
algorithm to show you how the pointers
are moving one at a time or something
like that but never thought well
personally never fur just Oh PowerPoint
can do this isn't it cool all right
they're arcing it being 3:58 exactly is
you've got to stop on time so this
applies a conference talks you'll be
kind of your conference chair will
almost certainly cut you off if you go
on too long in departmental seminars or
more in more informal situations it's a
little bit harder for whoever's running
the talk to say it's time to stop now
and they may you may start to
gesticulate a little bit but it's very
impolite to your audience to carry on
past the timer which they believe the
talk finishes and it's also ineffective
because what happens is that you get to
the point where they think that the talk
is going to be finished and it's not and
they start thinking oh you know what's
that there's an extra point that I was
going to or isn't isn't that still going
to start they stopped listening they
become dramatically less receptive at
the appointed time
so though it's ineffective to carry on
and it's food and I have the worst of
all is the speaker who says he's gone
for an hour it's now three o'clock and
and they go to the they look at the
chair and say they're visiting from you
know some very important University they
say ah
Scarlett you know I've just got another
ten slides and they're really good you
know can I go on and what's the poor you
know local chair to do the who in the
house to do and so the rest of the
audience is going absolutely not
Scotland you know
but scarlet it sort of goes oh yes that
would be fine thank you
we'd love that just don't do this right
say so so say it's difficult
I've got you do have to you may have to
sort of skip something to get to a bits
that you really wanted to do before you
finish but you must finish on time now
if at that point you know the audience
proactively says our desperate to hear
more than they are fine right
well they ask a lot of questions they
ask questions once you into question
time then you in the hands of the
session chair again this is an informal
situation you can say I'm in your hands
now we'll stop whenever you like but I'm
happy to answer questions so as long as
you care to go on that's fine right and
then then your thing if onus is not on
you so okay so this is very very
important finish on time and we have
like so I'm just going to leave you with
the sort of thumbnail something okay
thanks I mean I think it's fitted in
very well with what Dave who sues and
the back there observing us discussed
this morning and there we'll have time
for just a couple of questions now
anything else it's something I was sort
of implicit in your talk but you didn't
really cover in any detail during hints
or suggestions on ways of preparing the
talk so one way is to write a script or
to write the slides or there's there's
some sort of magic that you need to come
up with to have those 20 minutes worth
of things to say if you've got any
thoughts on them
do you know how to develop your sort of
and one thing they do is kind of give
practice presentations to other people
that's really useful but I think you
meant even before that how do you come
up with your storyline as it well is
that what you meant yes how do you come
up with a story down in the first place
well I suppose again I do I keep police
van I watch repetitive but this because
it but it was it's important I imagine
I'm speaking to somebody with the
whiteboard it's my friend you know how
would I tell them something about
whether I've got them for 10 minutes or
20 minutes what would I tell them and
and then of course then I might refine
that in the light of trying it out but I
can't I can't I think I can do any any
better than that that might be a
selective path through your paper that's
important thing but then it is worth
trying it out of course so you know if
you're giving a talk do do try it out on
your friends try it out you know in
persons particularly if you got very
limited slot one question over there
hi thanks again friend another really
great presentation I did enjoy this
morning's presentation and this one but
I do have a concern so I have a
background in film and in film for
example there's a very famous protocol
for writing scripts that's called the
Fritz Lang one they tells you exactly a
recipe for a successful script it's very
similar to what we've heard today in
terms of having like a recipe to the web
to convey a message so Fritz Lang will
tell you in a minute one mean one page
equals a minute in film I'd say I tell
you in the page 13 there comes the first
situation for the point that we changed
the story Nathan it tells you exactly
data and most of the Hollywood films a
you watch respect the frayed line
structure what happens is that users
viewers are used to that so they this
research shows that you expect that to
happen and if it doesn't happen you get
a bit stretch but it also allows you to
kind of like lose the magic of expecting
the moment when something difference can
happen so for that reason a lot of
really creative film directors will use
their own script that is totally
different to create different types of
sensations so I see that something
really similar is happening to TED Talks
in the beginning we were all like oh
this is not really nice and now we're
kind of used to it now comes a joke now
it comes a kind of real weird moment so
what do you think is the limit between
having a really good recipe the voice
and being extremely creative and making
something that's different and it will
make people be interested in what you
say just because you did it in such a
different way oh I don't know you are
way ahead of me well you actually know
something about you know communicating
with people right well as I don't I'm so
so so I'm not this part I don't agree
with fight so I think that anybody who
is truly enthusiastic about their
subject can allow that enthusiasm to
escape them right and so I would love to
know how to take your you know your
knowledge about how films work and apply
it to research talks but that's kind of
an interesting question you maybe try it
out try it out on a few people see if it
see if it works so so I think from a
thermo kind of professional
communication point of view I'm I'm Way
behind you
I just have this this sort of single
sort of one bit worth it which is that
have an idea and share it with
enthusiasm
everything else is subordinate to that
and maybe you can maybe even help do a
better job about the how to share it
stuff as you will see day-day will tell
you my slides are completely not from a
slide a point of view I mean Comic Sans
yeah I just wanted to add something to
the question about how to prepare slides
or just make just tell how I do it I
don't know where it's good way to tell
it so I normally just print out my paper
and just read it carefully and just mark
everything that I want to tell people in
my talk and then I have a sort of idea
what I want to tell them and it just
takes lights and put like really more or
less a copy two sentences from the paper
and just put them in the slides to get a
feeling for how long that is and what
ordered you to take and then have a
basic structure and then I really go
through the talks like by slide thinking
of how do I want to tell them do I want
to leave the sentence do I want to put a
picture in so what is best to represent
that I don't know whether that's a good
technique but that helped me a lot to do
my slide so may be good just to follow
up on that so I what I suggest to do is
basically come up with some very you
know short story but create the set of
slides empty slides just with titles and
punch lines saying this is what this
slide is going to say and this is the
takeaway message
right and then once you have a story you
can easily fill in the gaps that's good
thanks okay I think we'll finish them at
the question session now great thank you
