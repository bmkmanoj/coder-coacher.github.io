you
hey good afternoon everybody welcome
welcome thanks for joining a great honor
to have professor stiglitz with us he is
sold out tonight a town hall and
essentially sold out here at Microsoft
so we appreciate everyone coming in just
as you can notice on the calendar coming
ahead a pretty eclectic mix we hope your

not read professor Douglas entire bio he
would not get to speak if I did that but
he is the professor at Columbia
University co-chair of Columbia nervous
universities Committee on global thought
also the co-founder co-president of the
initiative for policy dialogue at
Columbia in 2001 as many of you know he
was awarded the nobel prize in economics
he is also was a bunch of the 1995

Journal of economic perspectives one of
his books has been translated into 35
languages to give you some sense of his
global touch so we're gonna have time
for Q&amp;amp;A he's going to sign some books
after but please a big Microsoft welcome
professor joseph stiglitz
well thank you very much for that
introduction of course there's any
caught to an economist being sold out at
a zero price is not particularly
convincing but I'm glad all you gave up
some of your lunch time you know when
you write something that gets a
attention even if it's the wrong kind of
attention sometimes you know that you
said something important and so a couple
of days ago I guess I was pleased that
the Wall Street Journal wrote an attack
against me so obviously I gotten under
their skin they were complaining about
my complaining about inequality they
thought there was too little bit
equality and I thought there was too
much of course you know this is not
about eliminating inequality it's that
the level of inequality in the United
States and the wage generated is
actually bad for our society bad for
democracy and even bad for our economy
and and this book the great divide is
about the great divide in in our in our
society in our economy which you see all
the time manifest itself in lakhs a
different way the riots in going on in
Baltimore are in a sense of
manifestation of one aspect of that
divide I hope we'll have time to talk a
little bit about the TPP the
trans-pacific partnership the the trade
agreements that the president is
misguidedly pushing I I think I don't
understand why he wants to make great
divide bigger but that is what the
consequences of those trade agreements
will be so I'll talk about that a couple
of my essays in this in this book
actually deal with these trade
agreements and why they are so bad and
it seems this is called the political
action
it is the major a a major issue of
political action today but let me go
back a little bit and talk about how i
got into economics and how and how I've
come to write a series of books in this
area I grew up in Gary Indiana which is
many of you may know as the major
industrial town was a major industrial
town on the southern tip of Lake
Michigan its history reflects the
industrialization and the
deindustrialization of the United States
it was founded in 1906 it was a real
company town evidenced by the fact that
the name Gary the town was named after
the chairman of board of u.s. steel be
like Redman duquoin cakes ah so it shows
you the nature of what was going on and
when I was growing up what I saw was
enormous amounts of discrimination lots
of inequality and episodic unemployment
with large numbers of my class makes
their parents being laid off every three
or four years and you sort of saw this
kind of hardship what I hadn't realized
when I was growing up that this was the
Golden Age of capitalism this was the
best period in America's history and
this is true for many countries around
the world in terms of inequality the
period of the the several decades after
World War Two was a unique period in our
history where we grew very rapidly much
more rapidly than we did since 1980 but
we all grew together every decile saw
its income increased those at the bottom
increased more than those at the top so
there was a narrowing of this divide and
the subject the great divide is really
about what's happened in the last third
of a century in the last third of a
century things took a different course
and this great divide open
I entered economic I was going to be a
you know a real scientist and I wanted
when I went to Amherst College be a
physicist and it was only in the last
year at Amherst that I decided that
without really motivated me was this so
concerned about social problems and the
study of inequality and that's what i
wrote my thesis about at MIT with the
two great Nobel Prize winners pop solo
and and Paul Samuelson I mentioned that
in part because the economics profession
for the most part has paid almost no
attention to inequality it's been you
know I I was unusual and my teacher Bob
Solow was unusual in in writing their
thesis about inequality but people like
Bob Lucas at Universal Chicago actually
said just a few years ago that it the
worst thing for an economist to do was
to talk about inequality he says was the
that that it was invidious was sort of
like Mitt Romney saying that you should
only talk about inequality behind closed
doors in quiet voices and you could
understand why he said that but I've
come to to explain a little bit later
why why economists had this view and why
exactly very deep in the economics
profession that's beginning to change so
when i when i published the the key
article and out of my thesis and in a
journal called econometric ax uh it got
a you know some attention and it's still
the basis of a lot of research but it
got a much less attention than when i
published an article in vanity fair a
couple years ago and so as I tell my
students if you want attention Vanity
Fair is a much better place than
econometrics and the title of my article
actually is a brief
Marie of a lot of what I'm going to be
talking about the title of the article
was of the one percent for the one
percent by the one percent you know a
paraphrase off of the Gettysburg Address
well after I wrote that that article
which went viral I got asked by the New
York Times to curate a whole series of
articles in the New York Times about
inequality called the Great Divide and
that the Vanity Fair articles the New
York Times articles are the core of the
Syria essays here but what I tried to do
here is is to put these together with a
lot of discussion about to try to weave
them together to tell what the story is
about the Great Divide how we've gotten
here the the dimensions of inequality in
the United States which you know is it
takes on many many aspects and I'll just
be able to touch on some of them the the
causes of the inequality the
consequences both for our economy for
our society for democracy and then what
can be done about it and a backdrop of a
lot of what I'm talking about here is
what's happening in other countries I
emphasize that because you know a lot of
people talk about American
exceptionalism and in this is one area
where we are exceptional but I'm not
sure we should be so happy about it we
are the advanced country with the
highest level of inequality and the
lowest level among the lowest levels of
equality of opportunity so let me go in
uh I want to keep about half the time
for for questions let me try to just
fairly quickly go through seven way a
number of ways in which our
understanding of inequality has changed
dramatically in the last ten years the
first relates to the observation i made
a few minutes ago that the 50s was the
Golden Age of capitalism the
uh-uh one of the great economist of the
mid-nineteenth mid 20th century with
simon kuznets who was the ghana Nobel
Prize for his work on creating the
national income counts GDP you know
those numbers that that that you hero so
often but one of things that he did that
was very important was called kuzmich
law he didn't call coos can swap became
known his crew stencil off and that was
in the early stages of development
inequality increases but then it
decreases you can see that in China
parts of the country like the East Coast
take off before the rest and so you get
a you get a divide opening up but then
as the countries develop more the
lagging parts catch up and inequality
goes down and that's exactly what
happened in the United States we had a
lot of inequality in the 19th century
actually even through the roaring 20s
but then it started to fall dramatically
and that was the picture that we had
when when I studied nmit but suddenly
beginning around nineteen eighty who's
next all got repealed it wasn't an act
it what I'm going to say is that
actually was an act of Congress but but
it got repealed in the sense that
inequality started to grow and it grew
enormously and went back to the high
levels the peaks that it had before a
big question is why and this pattern is
more true of the United States but is
also true of other countries to Apophis
ease about that both of which have some
degree of truth one of them was that
were there was something special about
the period after World War two we just
bought the word together there was a
kind of national cohesion and that kind
of national cohesion just changed the
way our society
functioned I mentioned before that this
was the period of rapid economic growth
but that national cohesion could allow
the top tax rate them top marginal tax
rate of most you probably don't remember
this most of you're too young to read
but the top marginal tax rate at the
time was 91 % numbers you know when
we've talked about increasing the
progressivity we've had a big fight
about whether we can increase the tax
rate at the top from thirty six percent
to thirty-nine percent with some people
saying be the end of our economy we had
a top marginal tax rate of ninety-one
percent and it was the fastest period of
our economic growth and that money went
for a lot you know building the national
highway system investments in technology
the sputnik respond the response to his
foot Nick lots of things so that's one
hypothesis the other one is the 70s was
a period of a lot of turmoil it was the
aftermath of the Vietnam War the oil
price shocks the result of that we had a
lot of inflation and people said we
needed a new economic model and Reagan
came forward with a new economic model
which is called supply-side economics
many of us were very suspicious we we
knew something about economic theory
more than Reagan did and we knew
something about the data but the the
theory had a certain coaching see to it
it was two ideas one lowering the
marginal tax rate at the top from that
level of 91 down to 35 big change would
free up would provide incentives and
then stripping away the regulation would
give the space and we'd have a more
dynamic economy it was understood that
that would lead to more inequality the
argument was though that these forces
would lead to a bigger economic pie and
so even if those in the middle when the
bottom got a smaller slice
a smaller share the size of their body
slice would be bigger what they were
right about one thing it did lead to
more inequality but they were wrong
about the other that is growth actually
slowed and now we've had a third of a
century of experiment and most of us who
believe in experiments say that after a
third of a century you ought to be able
to make inferences about what's happened
and if an experiment fails you ought to
change so to show you the the
grammatical out differently from what
they had expected median income in the
United States the median half above half
ago a median income next X suggested for
inflation is lower than it was a quarter
century ago median income of a full-time
male worker is for decades ago median
income of those at the bottom is lower
than it was 45 years ago so an economic
system in my mind that doesn't deliver
for a majority of its citizens is an
economic system next failing and our
economic system unfortunately has not
been delivering is not leading to higher
incomes for a majority of our citizens
and this is not because productivity has
stagnated actually in the last 35 years
productivity of American workers has
doubled what had always been the case is
that wages tracked productivity when
wages increased productivity increased
roughly in tandem but another aspect of
American exceptionalism in the last 35
years first time in basically economic
history productivity goes up but wages
don't and so that leads to to question
what is going on and I'll try to come
back to that very briefly later on but
that something big is going on
it should be clear from the from the
these numbers the second big change in
in the way that we understand inequality
is related to and I in economists like
to talk about trade-offs just basic
vocab way basic economics Arthur oaken
who was chairman of the Council of
Economic Advisers under President
Johnson wrote a very influential book
called the big trade-off and he said
inner the big trade-off is between
inequality and economic performance and
so yes you know we could all criticize
inequality but if we want to have more
equality will have to give up on
economic performance grow through you
know we now know that's not true that in
fact greater equality and greater
economic performance are complements not
substitutes they work together and this
is you know not just a view that you
might say left-wing softy people like me
feel this has not become part of the
mainstream the International Monetary
Fund the IMF which is not known to be a
radical or organization it's basically a
reflection of financial markets has been
arguing strongly that high levels of
inequality like that of the United
States interfere with growth stability
overall economic performance and when I
say that it's not only that their
research has shown this they've been
going around the world preaching this
you know they're it's not just words you
know that they thought just something
that they view people feel I was in
China at a meeting between madam will
guard who was they had managing director
the IMF and the Chinese leadership and
she said their inequality which has
grown to a very high level was in a
major risk to their economy so
really they really believe it and and
again in the book I talk about a number
of the reasons the channels through
which these adverse effects are realized
the third idea why only get across is
relationship between opportunity and
outcomes when this debate about
inequality began a few years ago some
conservatives like Paul Ryan said we
don't care about inequality of outcomes
what we really care about is equality of
opportunity now I wish you really
believe that but the fact is that
America has the least the lowest level
equality among the lowest levels of
equality of opportunity of the bank's
countries now how do how do we measure
this what do we mean by that whether a
number of different ways of of measuring
this the the simplest number is
correlation the correlation between the
income of the child and the income and
education of the parents the life
prospects of a young American are more
determined by the income and education
with parents than in other advanced
countries so I tell my students you know
there was one absolutely critical
decision you Joyce you have to make and
that is choosing the right parents and
if you get that wrong it's all over the
but it shows up in a lot of other
statistics brings things a child from a
parent at the top who does poorly school
is going to wind up doing better in life
in terms of income than a child for the
bottom who does very well in school so
it's really an impediment to have made
that first initial choice wrong
me again what we discovered is that this
is systemic uh it's not only true in as
we look across countries the countries
with the highest of the lowest level of
equality of the lowest level of
inequality the most equality have the
most opportunity which are striking
about this is that most Americans think
of equality of opportunity is a defining
characteristic and most others look at
us and there are obviously when I say
this you know a lot of people do make it
from the bottom to the top but when
economists or social scientists talk
about that they talk about the
probabilities what are the life chances
you know sure there are exceptions their
exceptional people but it-it-it the
probability of making it up from the
bottom to the top is just very low if
you're born at the bottom this is not
only true as I say if you look across
countries it's or even true within the
United States counties in the United
States stakes in the united states which
have the highest level of inequality
have the lowest level of equality of
opportunity and as I say again this is
an important research area economist
have been studying what are the channels
what are the reasons when the mechanisms
by which this occurs education is
obviously an important channel those who
uh you know if if you don't have a
college degree I the numbers I gave
before about how the stagnation and
income an average if you don't have a
college degree incomes over the last 25
years for those without a college degree
have gone down about twenty percent
adjusted for inflation and yet those are
the bottom the probability that they
graduate from college is very low and
that's what is it you know teaching at
Columbia you know we work very hard to
do we say we work very hard to make sure
we have economic diversity and yet when
you look at
the highly selective colleges even
though we have needs buying the mission
and we have enough wealth that we can
give a tuition you know free tuition
free movement board to anybody from the
bottom who can make the grade our
elementary and secondary school systems
are so unequal that only about eight to
nine percent of those in the highly
selective College come from the bottom
half of the population and almost all of
them come from the top quarter of the
population the the fourth idea I want to
talk about very quickly is that as we
look across countries there are huge
variations in the degree of inequality
that has one very important implication
the laws of economics are the same our
global you know you we all live in the
same world so among the forces leading
to more inequality that everybody's
talked about are things like
globalization and technology for those
forces of globalization technology are
universal the outcomes are very
different and then the question is why
why American exceptionalism why have we
wound up with more inequality more any
you know more inequality after taxes and
transfers and actually at the very
towards the top in terms of before tax
and transfer the answer has to do with
our policies and our policies related to
our politics so it's what we do and
that's a theme that I talk about a
recurrently in the book it's a matter of
choice it's not the choice of the
individual books a choice of our society
what as a society what actions we take
and it's not a question of what we can
afford because societies that are much
poorer make choices that lead them to
have more equality let me just give you
to two examples i think that that
highlight this point the first example
is at the end of world war two i
mentioned before we
that there was this kind of solidarity
we were a much poorer country than we
are you know over 70 years we've grown a
lot in addition to that he had an
enormous amount of debt that we had to
take to fight the war our deck GDP ratio
was a hundred and thirty percent and
just to put it in a frame Greece when it
entered into prices in 2010 had 110
percent that GDP ratio so if you thought
that was the determinant of one's future
of life we would wear should have been
in a crisis mode but that wasn't the
attitude we had we had the attitude that
a real resources are people and we ought
to invest in those people so what the
country did is to say everybody who had
fought in the war which was every
able-bodied person and a lot man and a
lot of woman who get a free college
education that was the GI Bill and that
investment help bring us together and
helped fuel the growth that we had in
the subsequent years helped make us the
middle class society that that we were
the unique you middle class society that
we were in this period just recently
President Obama has talked about making
a two-year Community College available
to poor children and let me just say you
know the cost of the community college
is a fraction a fraction of the kinds of
what we were spending then where we
would put people through Harvard you
know Columbia any any school in the
country that they could get into and
many people are saying we can't afford
it obviously we could afford not only
community college we could afford a
college education for everybody but it
is a matter of choice it's how we frame
what we do with our money with our
resources another example is that I have
an essay one of the advantages having
been
chief economist the World Bank as I get
invited to go all over the world and
talk to government officials and and you
know sort of a you might say tourism of
a particular kind and a couple years ago
I went to Mauritius which some of you
mean I was a island off for the east
coast of Africa one of the probably the
most successful country inn in Africa
and it's still very poor let me make it
clear it's very poor but this and you
write in an essay you never know what
reaction you're going to get and this
was one though my articles that got
downloaded the most in over a million
and it got some furious reactions why
would I said in there was something very
simple mauritius even though was a poor
country provided free for your college
education to everybody who could get in
they said it was a the basis of our
future and a lot of people said well if
you want to if you think marisha is so
great why don't you move there that
wasn't my point my point my point was a
really simple one that if Mauritius
could afford a four-year college
education so could we uh the the choices
that we make effective structure of our
economy and they affect the structure of
economy in a whole sort of way in a
number of ways they affect the degree of
inequality they effective agree enemy
quality both in terms of a protection of
workers weakening of labor unions but
also CEO pay weaknesses in the middle
just to give you a couple of statistics
that highlight the way the country has
changed not that long ago the average
CEO pay to the wages of the average
worker was 20 21
the average is 301 it's not like they
suddenly became 15 times more productive
relative to the increase in productivity
of workers and again it's a now aspect
of American exceptionalism we've led the
way I can tell you from my friends in
Europe they like the American model who
are my friends who are CEOs in Europe
they like the American model and they're
trying to you know but but the
consequence of this of course is when
you get a larger share of the national
pie there's less to spend on investment
unless to pay workers and so it's not
it's not a zero-sum game it's actually
become a negative sum game because when
we don't invest as much and there's
strong evidence now that we're not
investing as much our economy gets
weaker those are just a few examples and
I have time I can go through some more
but I see time moving on quickly that's
one resource that we can't so a fifth
observation I want to make a way we've
come to understand it is I describe all
the you know the way our economy
operates those are a result of all kinds
of rules and regulations that we pass
deregulation of the financial sector
corporate governance laws antitrust laws
laws that affect the trade laws we're
going through a debate right now about
trade and those trade laws are designed
to weaken workers and to weaken
environmental regulations make health
care their health care more expensive a
whole set of things that are going to
change the legal structure the economic
structure in the United States and it's
been done very quietly I mean would be
quiet if we weren't for the fact that
some of us are making noise those are
examples oh how the rules and
regulations you know affect inequality
and affect the way our economy operates
well these are political decisions
whenever you have the level of economic
inequality the United States has that
economic and quality gets translated
into political inequality particularly
in a democratic system where where money
counts and where you get to change the
rules to make money count more so one of
the things I point out is that we've
gone to a democracy which is more
accurately described as one dollar one
vote than one person would vote and that
of course has consequences and among
those consequences are the consequences
for inequality I've emphasized a lot
about income at the top but i want to
emphasize it's not just about the top
not just about the bottom you know more
money is going to the top people at the
bottom more people in poverty and
they're doing much worse but what is
getting a lot of attention now is the
Visser a shin of the middle the median
income I said has gone down there are
fewer people within fifty percent of the
median plus or minus so that means more
more is going going into it are going
into the tail we are becoming a bigger
divide the great divide is getting even
larger and why that's so important is
that we always be and visit yourself as
a middle class society that's no longer
true and the basic ASP things that we
think of as the core attributes of a
middle-class lifestyle are increasingly
out of reach lots of data to support
various elements of that of that
assertion the final point I want to make
is these problems that have grown so
great over the last 35 years when this
might say this experiment that began in
nineteen eighty these problems will
won't be resolved quickly they won't be
resolved by small tweaks to our system
so you hear you know some of the things
that are being proposed are symptomatic
relief really important but they are
symptomatic relief so like raising the
minimum wage is important but it's a
symptom of a way an economic system is
working that doesn't deliver for the
bottom so you know I think it was great
that Seattle is raising their minimum
wage the evidence in economics is so
clear now that it doesn't have the
adverse effects that people have said
before that the used to be that the
person work in the minimum wage was a
teenage kid working you know after
school very large fraction of those at
the minimum wage jobs are the sole
earner in the family and you know in New
York City we sort of you know you
minimum wage a little over seven dollars
and on were you working a full-time job
that gives you an income of around
15,000 a year you cannot live in New
York City on fifteen thousand year you
can't live on twice that if you have two
earners of 30,000 or you have two jobs
you can't live on that and that why it
was why I was very heartened mayor de
Blasio on earth day on Wednesday
announced a commitment to move 800,000
Yorkers out of poverty and a key part of
that was raising the minimum wage over
the next decade that's a big deal moving
you know it was styled after the
Millennium Development Goals that
succeeded in reducing the number of
people of poverty around the world he
said let's set a goal and let's make
sure we we achieve it but so that means
we have to focus more on trying to
understand the underlying structures
that have let America to have this
exceptional level of inequality but
we have to win edition focus on how do
we make sure that those elements of the
middle class lifestyle are attainable
that kids can go to college that people
can own a home that they you know can
get access to health care all these
basic ingredients that we have full
employment and we've had a Federal
Reserve thats focus more on inflation
than unemployment so what I want to
leave you with is this notion that where
we've arrived has not been an accident
it's been the result of a large number
of decisions about the structure of
economy that have led us to a more
divided economy but also an economy a
society that is not functioning as well
and that I I mentioned before that that
this was an experiment in a way that
began around nineteen eighty I want to
end it on a note of urgency the
decisions that we make now will have
consequences for decades to come so if
we continue business as usual inequality
will continue to grow and in another 30
years will be an even society evidence
about this is overwhelming and so if we
change tack we won't get the kind of
society we want right away but at least
we can temper this these extremes and
try to recreate the middle class society
the country of opportunity that we used
to think of ourselves as being thanked
yeah janet was my students and one of my
first PhD student so I feel uh and and
uh one of the essays that are here I was
very involved in and trying to make sure
she got appointed and explaining why
inequality was a responsibility of the
fed and why the way they had been
conducting monetary policy and
regulatory policy had been a major
contributors to the growth of inequality
the fed is supposed to focus on
inflation employment growth but
historically is focused mostly on
inflation if you have high unemployment
workers suffer obviously directly but
they also suffered indirectly because if
there's a lot of slack and labor market
it forces wages down but it's even worse
than that and and just a couple weeks
ago I went and gave another talk at the
Fed describing how was that they had
been a major player in creating
America's inequality so and there are
many many channels it was a whole hour
talk so I don't want to but let mention
one aspect as we were responding to the
crisis of 2008 9 we went to quantitative
easing one of the main channels by which
quantitative easing worked was to create
a stock market bubble
the hope was that if you made the people
in the upper 1% you know the stock
market is old overwhelmingly by the top
I mean all of you own some shares
indirectly or directly but if you look
at who owns disproportionately the
shares it's it's the top wealth
inequality is much greater than income
inequality and ordinary Americans in
their retirement conks tend to hope be
be more conservative and hold more bonds
and particularly t-bills government
bonds so when they lower the interest
rate as they did those prudent older
elderly who depended on government bonds
got wiped out their inking went down to
zero but meanwhile the top people in the
upper 1% did very well it was another
instance of trickle-down economics it
had a very small effect on you know
that's why q we didn't work very much
because they save a very large fraction
of their income they're not spending it
what they didn't do whether they should
have done is try to make our financial
system actually work the way exposed to
work so years after the crisis began
leading to small and medium-sized
enterprises was still twenty percent
below what it was before the crisis and
they focused all on the New York banks
the big banks paid no attention to the
smaller banks which are
disproportionally related to to engaged
in small and medium-sized enterprise
lending for small businesses okay so the
fact that they were focusing on the top
and the big banks and left the smaller
banks go over 500 went bankrupt but a
lot of the others were in bad shape is
an example of their Darrell you know
where they're where they didn't do what
they should have done and again another
reason why monetary policy didn't have
the effect that it they should have
another element of their failure
was one of the ways they addressed the
crisis of 2008 was to encourage banks to
consolidate what did that mean less
competition what is less competition
means it what it means is the ability of
the banks to exercise minak monopoly
power you saw that actually when the Fed
lowered the long term interest rate on
average a very small fraction of that
only a fraction of that got transmitted
to borrowers a lot of it went into the
coffers of the banks so the transmission
mechanism by which the Fed encouraged
more homeowners got broken because they
are failure to address monopoly in the
banking system so those are just some of
some of the arguing's so I think she
spot on talking about inequality it's an
important it's a key part of our economy
and I mentioned IMF says macroeconomic
management requires focusing on
inequality and it's mostly the
conservative of congressmen who have
been working hard to make sure to talk
about it okay sure obviously both of
these are important but let me talk
about one of the reasons why there's
this link between inequality of outcomes
and inequality of opportunity a lot of
that has to do with our education system
and that's why programs are mentoring
are important the over the last 30 35
years a mirror
another change in America is that we
become more economically segregated you
know we've we've done a little bit about
reducing racial segregation but we've
actually become more economically
segregated with that means that poor
people live in poor neighborhoods rich
people live in rich neighborhoods why
that's so important for the issue that
i'm talking about is we have a unlike
France and some other countries we have
basically a locally financed education
system so that means that if you live in
a rich suburb you go to good schools
well financed it if you live in a poor
district you go to poor schools that are
not very well financed and that was one
of the reasons that you get this huge
educational divide people graduate from
college and people who don't so that is
one of the problems that that that we
haven't been able to affect we deal with
mike is now working so i went to find
the mic so i get to go first but thank
you so much for coming and I thought in
your book it was so interesting about
this story about your billionaire dinner
party you know and the outcome and I
don't know if it's fart nakano where's
the shorts are coming or not but from a
standpoint of affecting policy and
politics with that being the outcome of
that dinner and just pervasive in thomas
piketty's book etc how do we those think
those in the room were all politically
active were part of the MS pack but what
do you see the galvanizing factor for
people like ourselves to become as
involved in the policy processes the
mcdonalds fast food workers and the
reason why I asked is I've never been
involved in politics but I've been
working a lot with shamas Sawant use the
city council member and led to the
fifteen dollars an hour wage and the
people that are running against her now
it's it's sure they go big money let me
let me just assume most you have not had
a chance to read the book yet so let me
just talk a little bit about this
introductory essay I tell a story about
New York
a very divided city and those who know
New York there's the east side the part
of New York east of central park and the
west side and those are like two
different I jokingly say that they're
like two different countries a big big
divide although recently what's been
happening the real estate prices
actually on both sides so i won't i
won't exaggerate the divide but every
once in my I mean I do get him by i do
go across the park i live on the west
side and and and i got invited you know
uh to a dinner party of a wealthy friend
of mine who is very concerned about
inequality and the fact is that when you
see an equality of this the magnitude
that explode you had it's hard not to
get engaged in the topic so and she
happened with like some of her
billionaire friends many of whom had
inherited their their their wealth and
uh you know the story you know in the
beginning i was good little struck about
how they they were one moment talking
about lazy people and then the next
moment went to talking about where is a
better place to put your money to avoid
taxes the cayman islands or some other
tax shelter in another island but the
real striking thing was as the evening
went along a number of these
billionaires started talking about
remember the guillotine and they went
back to French history where extremes of
inequality had grown so much that there
was a revolution the French Revolution
and the point of this was what I found
so interesting was it wasn't compassion
that was driving them it was the worry
of the Baltimore riots becoming a
greater than
it was we have to remember you know we
who are running the country and the
world have to remember that we cannot
allow inequality get out of extreme what
was so interesting about that is
implicitly they were saying we are
running things I thought that was so so
telling now the what what leads to
engagement it seems to me as i said
before part of this is the extremes that
to which the country is going that most
people realize that this is really bad
for all of us and then there are always
the specific issues i mean a minimum
wage is an amazing story because seventy
percent of americans believe that there
should be an increase the minimum wage i
mean how could you not believe that
given those numbers given that the
people at the bottom have not gotten a
pay raise and a half a century you know
in a country that seems to be getting
richer and yet we can't get it through
Congress and that's generated this kind
of national movement at the local level
let's do something about it if
Washington is broken we can do something
of the local level and and it's been
very heartening the issue that's really
engendering I as I go on around talk in
the gendering enormous amount of
interest excitement right now is a the
trade agreement because it's complicated
but it's a big deal and people are
understanding that the Obama
administration is asking Congress for a
blank check and it's a blank check
that's going to be good for the next
seven years whoever is in the White
House after 2016 and it says whatever
Congress whatever the trade negotiators
negotiate it set up or down vote and the
answer is there's never been a downvote
so whatever they negotiate will have to
live with and some of the things that
they're negotiating are
you say appalling that's the only word
only just mentioned one one example I
could go out I could give our lecture on
it because lecture some of you may know
about the open war in the 19th century
it was one of the initial trade opening
I people from China all know about it
because there was a trade imbalance in
19th century China produce lots of
things that people in the West wanna
bite China like porcelain and West
didn't produce anything like China
wanted so what happened there was a
trade deficit and if you follow the
discussion trade deficits are a problem
so then your UK in particular found a
solution will export opium to China and
as my business students at Columbia
understand opium has some very good
property in particular when you're
developing new products as you hear no
repeat purchase is really important and
opium is designed to encourage repeat
purchase so so and then China figured
out not such a good idea for China and
they said no more opium and the West
said that's an outrage the right to
export opium was a basic human right and
we went we and that Europe supported by
the United States went to war went to
war twice and guess what they won the
war and they got concessions and opened
up the market again this is the
beginning of free trade by the way a
trade opening so the your government us
dr is now having what i call the 21st
century opium war the president hasn't
advertised this a lot obviously because
a little embarrassing but what is the
new opium a product that has a similar
notnot quite as bad as cigarettes
cigarettes kill and how is that involved
in this trade agreement well there's a
peculiar there's a provision a very
important part of the agreement that
says that if you pass a regulation that
lowers a company's profits with the
profits would have X been expected to
have been you have to compensate the
company those who are lawyers I know
some people here are lawyers that's
called a break ohtori taking our courts
have consistently rejected that Congress
has consistently rejected that uh I know
about this because in when I wasn't
administration we've brought against
this obviously if you have to compensate
every time you regulate yarn I can't
have any regulations so under this
provision and then the Jude occasion of
the dispute is done in private
arbitration you know the basic function
of society one of the basic thing is
public Couric's open transparent it's
part of what would defines us as a
democracy but this does secret private
arbitration highly paid lawyer
arbitrators anyway under a provision
that's identical to what's being put in
the trade attracts Pacific Partnership
urgh way and Australia are being sued by
Philip Morris what was the terrible
thing that they did they did this
outrageous thing of laban the package of
cigarettes and saying these products may
be hazardous to your health and in
Australia they went the further step of
actually showing what the lungs look
like if you smoke and the consequence
was that people were discouraged from
smoking and Philip Morris profits went
down yes that was the intent you know
that was why we passed that they passed
this regulation
that that to discourage people from
smoking and yet if Philip Morris wins
these suits and they have a lot more
money than Ordway does it will be
impossible for them to pass to have
these regulations to protect their
citizens in this particular case you
know org way can't afford and
fortunately Mayor Bloomberg is paying
for their legal costs so can you imagine
and Obama wants to make this for all the
environmental regulations all the health
regulations all the regulations about
safety so if you want to know why
Elizabeth Warren and most people who are
not controlled by the corporations
happen to have their blood pressure
rising at this trade agreement it's not
because we're against trade or open
society we're against changing the rules
of the game in ways that are going to
hurt ordinary Americans and ordinary
people all over the world simply to
increase corporate profits thank you
very much actually thank you very much
