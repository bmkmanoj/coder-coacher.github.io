in the e science team at Microsoft
Research Redmond and I'm going to spend
a few minutes talking to you about a
project we've been recently working on
called holograph so the way we're
interacting with pcs is changing its
changing from the from keyboard and
mouse to two-dimensional touch tip to
multi-touch and we're on a cusp of
starting to interact with data using
three dimensions using three dimensional
in air gesturing one of the things that
I would like to show you today is a I
dia that we have of taking data and
playing with where it can sit above or
below a two-dimensional screen because
we don't have holographic screens just
yet so let's have a look at the demo so
what we're looking at here is a is a
three-dimensional globe that is sitting
above the screen and I can interact with
that using using touch on the screen in
this version of the demo but I can also
play with where this image sits above or
below the screen so for example I can
move it below the screen and have the
project as a virtual window onto a much
larger world but we can look at other
types of data here and so let's take an
example of a three-dimensional model so
here for example and we have a little
model of the spaceship that is sitting
again above the screen and from an
engineering perspective it could be
really interesting to be able to reach
into a three-dimensional model and start
interacting with it in three dimensions
one of the real goals of a holograph is
to start looking at data that we can map
out geographically and do that in a way
that is three-dimensional so this is a
graph of city population across the
world and we can explore this world by
moving this data set around in two
dimensions through this virtual box that
we have sitting below the screen and I
hope here is that by doing this we get a
much easier insight into gaining
information from the data that perhaps
would be harder to do if you were
working in two dimensions and of course
we can work with with spatial data as
well and temporal data so here for
example is a recording in three
dimensions using Kinect
I just play this video you can see that
this is a familiar scene from it from a
science fiction movie but it's three
dimensional data that changes over time
and from the perspective of the user is
effectively a holographic image that
sits above the screen
so in summary holograph gives us a way
of both visualizing and interacting with
data either above within or below a
two-dimensional screen plane in a way
that appears three-dimensional to the
user we hope this will give the user a
greater insight into the data and take
some steps towards interacting with more
pervasive data around today using
natural user interaction thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
