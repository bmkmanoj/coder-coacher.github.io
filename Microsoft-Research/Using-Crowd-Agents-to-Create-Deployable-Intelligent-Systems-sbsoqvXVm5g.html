you
hi everyone it's my pleasure to
introduce waterless a key um he's Walter
is a PhD student at university of
rochester he's working with Jeff Bingham
and James Allen he is the second time in
turn at MSR he is also a microsoft
research fellow voltar is mainly working
on interactive systems that are part
that are powered by the crowd and
machine intelligence and he's going to
tell us today about those systems and
the work he's been doing with us here at
MSR awesome thanks I sure see ya so
today I'm going to be talking about how
can you use crowdsourcing to actually
enable robust interactive intelligent
systems that reversal enough to be put
in the wild with real users and see you
know what happens so this is work in
collaboration with both Jeff Bingham and
James Allen and I'm going to start off
today with a little bit of a background
on human computation then I'm going to
go through some of the existing working
crowdsourcing something that's kind of
laid the foundations for what we're
doing these days and then I'm going to
look at how we can use this crowd agents
model that we propose to enable truly
deployable intelligent systems a little
bit about future work on that front so
human computation is in many ways a
field revisited in his book when
computers were human david alan grier
kind of outlines the history of
computers not as you know machines
necessarily but kind of the role of a
computer or the word computer back when
it was someone who did computations and
its really it was is a very interesting
history because of course this role goes
way beyond machines so eventually people
were replaced by machines because for
raw calculations for simple simple math
machines just really can't be beat by
people but there are still things that
humans can do that computers can't yet
and so we're seeing a resurgence in
using people in a computational process
now more recently you get a lot of human
computation kind of in the form of
crowdsourcing but even crowdsourcing is
it new right distributing to a large
group of people is what the Works
Progress Administration did in the 20s
to compute large scientific tables and
they even had workflow processes that
we're focused around distributing the
the types of task in that each worker
was doing in a way that prevented
similar errors so that you could
recombine everybody's answer and get a
more reliable result but so some of the
the differences between that and when
you hear these days is well crowd
sourcing is now an open call it might be
on the web it might be to your user base
and IP to just anyone who wants to come
along and help but in this case we're
often warned about these malicious users
especially in kind of semi anonymous
online work you don't have any
guarantees that this person on the other
end will actually do your task well
we'll do it correctly or has any
expertise to do it so you get quotes
like this so workers are inherently lazy
and will avoid work if they can workers
need to be closely supervised and a
comprehensive system of controls
developed a hierarchical structure is
needed with a narrow span of control at
each and every level working for workers
will show little ambition without an
enticing incentive program and will
avoid responsibility whenever they can
this is a very pessimistic view of
workers but the interesting part is this
is not about web workers this is
actually from 1960 and it's talking
about regular full-time employees
McGregor was at MIT Sloan I believe when
he wrote this book but but Theory acts
the way he saw it was not necessarily
the full answer and I'll I'll get back
to this before the end of the talk but
it's just it's just kind of an
interesting idea that we've already
looked at work flows in the same light
we've already looked at workers as
having needed these these tight controls
and incentive mechanisms so what's
different now what do we know now that
we didn't know 30 40 more years ago our
people smarter
they suddenly overtake computers in
their ability that's not it computers
can still do what they could do much
faster in fact if anything the gap has
closed between computers and humans what
we do have is more technology around us
more computer systems more distributed
systems that all can communicate with
each other and the user in a way that
lets us integrate people and the way
people work in a different way so if you
think about a traditional workflow model
right a traditional hiring model you
hire one person and if you want to make
your system more intelligent you want to
answer your queries with human
intelligence that maybe you have that
person sitting at a desk just waiting
for you to ask a question and they wait
there all day and maybe if you hold odd
hours you have to have multiple shifts
of people just being paid to sit and
wait of course that doesn't really work
but now with online labor markets such
as mechanical turk you can hire a person
to do a very short task and there's
someone always available on demand in
fact you can even get a lot of people on
demand and parallelized tasks that would
have been impractical to paralyse before
because you would have needed to hire
all of these employees full-time now
there are differences here of course if
you hire a full-time employee you have
some guarantee at least some expectation
that they're going to be around but
unlike traditional employees crowd
workers might come and go as they please
you never know exactly who's available
and often you don't learn enough about
any individual worker to really have a
guarantee on their expertise now you can
least get these workers fast and you see
work like like adrenaline and quick
target that have looked at actually
being able to bring in a new person but
you don't know anything and slowly about
that person so the traditional fix to
this is to take your task and break it
up into a lot of different little pieces
that people can complete quickly and as
long as they're completing them quickly
then you don't have to you know worry
about this high chance at the leave
before the end before they
the task is accomplished but if i
distribute this to a group of workers
then I don't want three answers to come
back most of the time this time I want a
single answer for my question so you
have to start looking at ways to combine
the multiple workers which might provide
you with more confidence but in a
reasonable way so sometimes you might
average sometimes you might take a vote
and select an answer but either way
you're getting more confidence than you
have in a single worker by using
multiple people now there of course
different ways to do this so the once
the task is complete you can put it back
and select the new one but there are
multiple ways to do this so for some
tasks instead of looking at completely
parallel workflows where everybody gets
the same piece of information they
complete it and then they all compare
answers in the end essentially or the
system compares answers for them we can
start to look at systems where there's
an iterative process you get slightly
better answers as you take a task and
pass it from one worker to the next to
the next and eventually you converge on
an answer and you you can mark it as
done and move on to the next piece now
this takes a little bit longer but you
might be able to get more expertise in a
lot of cases when when you have people
building on each other solutions so in
addition to to just flat models like
that you start to get more and more
complex models soylent used to find fix
verify paradigm to have one group of
workers select the task pull it off and
then have a different set of workers
actually identify what the problem is or
what a solution to that problem is they
can finally pass it along and have a
different group of workers verify it
because one of the problems with an
iterative model is that at any point if
I'm passing it along from one person to
the next one of the workers could simply
delete the content or make a change that
makes it worse and makes it harder for
other workers to complete their task
this kind of verifies that at least
within each loop you have some
improvement
okay so now that we have the crowd and
we can even get reasonable responses
back from them what do we do with it
right great we can we can bring human
intelligence to bear on problems but
what types of problems are most
interesting and for this we look at
artificial intelligence because in many
ways to have the exact same goals and
they've kind of dreamt up what they want
but maybe not maybe don't have the final
answer so there's a lot of overlap in
interesting problems here so just as one
example conversational assistance have
been a goal for a very long time so so
Eliza was the late 60s I believe the
problem with systems like this were that
they were very very constrained so you
had a template of what kind of
interaction the system expected and if
you didn't get that then you cannot all
bets were off if I start asking Eliza
about booking a hotel then all that
happens is we end up getting into a very
shallow conversation about who was
messing up the conversation first and
even if you fast-forward to today we
have much better attempts of
conversational interaction with systems
like Siri or if you're a little less
concerned with portability Watson um but
in in both of these cases they're still
looking at very specific formats for the
conversation they're still looking at
very specific use cases if nothing else
but what we what we want is
conversational assistants who can
actually help us we want in whole
intelligent systems I can not only come
up with you know what our solution is
but they think you can think about our
intents think about why we're asking
this problem and maybe even answer a
question that we haven't asked yet so
things like conversational systems are
are something they can make people's
lives a lot more convenient but there
are roles where this type of intelligent
interaction can actually be much more
powerful can actually have a
transformative
act on the daily life of users so
Jeffrey my really focus on assistive
technology for this reason because being
able to provide a blind user with a way
to interact with their desktop through
conversation alone or being able to help
a motor impaired user using a predictive
keyboard that actually has a better
sense of what you're typing activity
recognition for for cognitively impaired
and older users who might need a little
assistance and prompting throughout
their day to safely live unaccompanied
to things like captioning and
transcription services for classroom
settings where students who are deaf
need to be able to follow along with the
lecture but it's very expensive right
now to provide this using a single
expert human and even to things like
visual assistance where you can / blind
user can query their environment and
find out more about their surroundings
so what I kinda take away from this talk
i really hope is that we can power
intelligent interfaces this kind of more
broad goal but most examples that i will
show you apply these intelligent
interfaces to specific assistive
technology problems so remember this is
the the basic model we have right take
task break into pieces send to people
but how do you control an interface how
would I break this task up into a lot of
little pieces that individual workers
can control when this problems actually
what got me and into the crowd sourcing
space because I looked at and I said
well I mean I understand human
computation you take a problem that your
algorithm doesn't quite solve you put
some people in it and then you get
yourself a mission accomplished banner
and you're done uh but it doesn't seem
to quite work for this interface right I
could I could break the task up by
button let's say I could have everybody
controlling an individual button but
that doesn't really get at the heart of
the problem we don't have any
consistency between controls if you
imagine this is a controlling a small
commercial or like off-the-shelf robot
but you can see one of the one of the
options here is to extend the camera and
that's great but if somebody chooses to
do that to look over a barrier well
someone else wants to drive under it
you'll break off the poor camera so we
want consistency between actions we want
like the whole of what the system is
doing to be self consistent and also a
bit but backing out if we had things
like breaking it down by frame and I
have workers look at the current
situation they say maybe I need to drive
forward then we ask a whole different
set of workers okay now what do we do
next again we have no consistency now
across time and save across the actions
that are selected so the difference
between this and a normal task is that
it is continuous we have a person who is
interacting with the feedback from a
system and they're getting this feedback
as kind of constant input right and what
they want to do in if this is just a
typical end user they'll take off a
piece of that task now maybe in the
interface control it's knowing when to
press a button or knowing how to react
to some situation and they'll do perform
a task and provide is input back to the
system now another problem is that even
even that model is not as simple as it
sounds because if you're not able to
keep taking new tasks they're not going
to slow down the environment is not
going to change because the way we
selected to control the system has to
wait for a set of workers to come back
so if this worker holds it too long all
these tasks are going to back up and
we're going to end up with incomplete
sessions or where something's going to
be missed in the environment in general
you want if we want to crowdsource this
I we can look at just paralyzing the
input all right so then the same type of
task division only now we're doing it
with continuous streams of tasks so the
task comes in each worker takes off a
piece but then what we can't give the
system three inputs at once we can't we
can't even actually know that the
workers all grabbed the same
piece of the task maybe they saw a
different problems so it's really this
combination step that gets tricky and at
high level what we do want to do is just
merge them back together but what that
looks like is very domain dependent so
we started about trying to fix this by
wanting to abstract away the crowd
entirely so what if we could look at the
crowd what if you look at collective
intelligence itself as an individual
entity we call this crowd agent so
internally you have some specific kind
of there are two mediators a task
mediator and input mediator the task
mediator handles whatever your whatever
breaking up a problem in your domain
looks like passes that to workers in it
the input mediator takes the workers
output and combines it all back together
but of course both the task and input
mediators are going to be very
domain-specific so we have to start
thinking about what do these look like
how can you generalize this this model
but going back and so I'll say real
quickly on by providing a single user if
you can behave like a single user if you
can take input continuously and and
provide output as a single stream you
can see the inputs and outputs are
basically identical to what you would
have if it was really just an end user
so we don't have to change the
environment we don't have to change the
the task that's incoming in any way we
can start to communicate with existing
computer systems or existing users in a
very natural way and we just have to
process this all internally so looking
back at at the example of the robot so
this is kind of one of the first pieces
of work we did and I'll have the
citations along the bottom there so if
anybody wants to kind of follow up I'll
be happy to answer any questions but
that might be a nice resource so what
we're looking at is even more general
than just controlling a robot how can
you control the interface that controls
the robot right how can you actually
take any UI that's out there and control
it with the crowd so what we came up
with Legion and Legion allows you to
select a piece of you
or interface right here just drag a box
around it and then you'll set some
parameters like price and a small
description for workers and you'll set
what keys they're allowed to use and
what mouse input they're allowed to use
the system automatically starts to
recruit workers from mechanical turk and
when they arrive at the page they see
this little bit of information you've
given them and so you see a quick
description some of the keys that they
were able to use and then they're given
what is essentially a remote desktop
connection to the system however of
course we mediate their input so that
one worker can't just start controlling
someone else's computer ad hoc but the
way we we figure out how to combine this
how we compare people to find out if
they're doing a good job is actually to
use the the group not as a set of input
votes we're not looking at how many
people just pressed up well it is a
majority so I should I should go up
instead we use it to select a leader and
then we give the leader short periods of
control what this does is it'll
essentially allows people to overcome
small small decision points right where
you get to a point where you don't you
can make two equally good choices you
can't get agreement in the crowd because
there's there's no communication in this
case between the workers we just want to
see what people would do but we allow
ever seen control to kind of get around
that point and then see if people start
to agree with them again so as we go
each worker is is providing some input
and you can see that we switch from
yellow to blue here we always ignore the
red malicious worker at the bottom
because there's just not enough
agreement the way we calculate this
though is actually to to take the input
from a single worker and compare it to
the aggregate so we look at every input
that was given over that time span which
is usually about half a second to two
seconds look at all the input we say
which part of that was theirs
we can compare this by looking at the
vector cosine which is essentially the
projection of the vector of input from
the single user on to the crowds answer
and we assume that the crowd is correct
yeah so we have to get all this this
whole bunch of it but before you
actually decide to be the leader
yes so but what we do is it's
essentially the vote for the next period
so we go through and everybody provides
input with one person in control right
as soon as you hit the next piece we use
the voting duda see I want the robust
you go right left yeah I have to do all
that in my head without actually no no
no so we're letting one person control
the specific instance but we're looking
at how much they agreed with other
people who were concurrently controlling
to select who the next leader is going
to be for the next one second span so
you're you're being rated based on your
historic performance and then we pick
the best representative from the crowd
going forward yeah but that's a good
point Thanks so so and using this week
do more than just kind of denoise the
crowd we also looked at this kind of fun
application of letting people play
single player video games as multiplayer
and it is just it was kind of
interesting we can start to do I think
the reason I'm interested in this work
is really we can start to use multiple
Legion systems concurrently so we
actually are averaging across different
subsets of the the controller here so we
don't want everyone to have to agree on
all of the actions if you want to
control a piece of the system maybe you
just want to work on like special
abilities and then jumping or whatever
in a video game you can work on just
that piece you don't have to participate
in the larger task you can specialize or
you can collaborate with others and if
multiple people are trying to control
the same subsystem then you can get the
averaging yeah
and kind of stealing that their input is
not
yeah so if the person says go right I
want to go left then I see is going ride
and I kind of need to make a decision
again right yes you have to kind of
adapt to effect yeah how is that
mediation um so it turns out that in a
lot of these cases if you have
reasonably low decision point well so
basically a decision point is any point
where you could have equally good
options if you have a reasonably small
set of those throughout the course of
the plan then you'll diverge very little
from the crowd if you're trying to do
the right thing so if we're driving to
the teapot here they can avoid the
obstacle and in more or less one way now
there's a little bit of leeway in there
but if you start to disagree too much
then either you have a radically
different plan from the rest of the
group right or or you might just not be
giving a valid answer in terms of so the
short answer is you actually don't
always notice that's not listening to
you except for in select cases and when
you do you can see that it basically it
acknowledges your input it's not that
the system didn't hear it you see that
yes you pressed forward but it does tell
you the workers are informed that
they're working as part of a group so it
says right now it's listening to the
crowd we heard you're up but we're going
to listen to the crowd for this this
moment and because you can't take tooth
largest step away from what you were
just doing the replanting process for
people is very simple so if it if it
takes a slight right there's not a huge
cognitive difference there
making come in from the same person
wears at the time
so part of it is that we want to
continue this decision process
throughout and what you get is because
we're ranking similarity the people top
all tend to agree with each other so
even if you switch who is in control for
that small moment the the general plan
is is usually the same but the real big
advantage is yeah you get to make these
decisions online if you stop and vote
first it greatly slows down the system
if you have to actually react to things
in the environment it slows it down and
what we were able to show actually and I
don't have the the chart on here but is
that compared to other simpler common
input mediation strategies this actually
is not only faster but more reliable so
the average time if you just gave it to
a single person tends to be a little bit
slower is like ten twenty percent faster
sorry ten twenty percent faster than if
we did it with the crowd using this
mechanism but they only complete forty
percent of the time and our trials i
think we completed a hundred percent of
the time using this so you get both the
kind of the combination of speed and
reliability other other approaches that
were similarly reliable took two three
times as long often to even complete a
simple task do you have a alright so see
ya so we can be applied to two other
interesting domains but one thing that
Legion kind of relied on is the fact
that all of the workers could
concurrently complete the same task and
we do so in a somewhat consistent way
but what if your workers are not
actually able to do any of the any of
them are actually able to do the task
itself and we say this problem in
captioning professional captionist
seeeeee are really highly trained two
years of years of training in classes to
be able to take 300 words a minute which
is actually physically impossible on a
regular qwerty keyboard they also have
to train to use these courting keyboards
their standard for machines essentially
few have ever seen one of those so we're
not going to find any of these people on
Mechanical Turk we certainly are not
going to find five of them and if you
consider that
the average stenographer charges
something like 100 to 300 hours an hour
for their services we don't really want
to find five to run concurrently but
using the same model right where we have
the task broken up and then sent to many
different workers we can actually just
have workers type what they can and we
can divide up the task or just kind of
have people self select from the task it
turns out dividing is a little bit more
consistent because you get natural
saline see saliency adjustments
throughout the stream so I for example
might always caption the first word and
everybody else in this room would too
but we might miss like the tenth word
after that so we can divide up the task
we can ask people to type however fast
they can 40 to 60 words a minute is
plenty and then by using multiple
workers and an alignment process that
stitches everything back together we can
actually still cover the complete stream
so we can get this full answer and what
we do is use multiple sequence alignment
there's a separate paper here that
looked at how we can use an a-star
search to actually improve this to the
point where we can run it with in under
a second and get some error bounds on
the the correctness of the alignment
itself and this works very well and if
you think that what we are looking at
here is maybe three to five workers able
to cover 300 words a minute then Steven
then if I'm paying students who can type
that fast or mechanical turk workers
reasonable wage maybe ten dollars an
hour there were fifty dollars or less
per hour to get the same service that we
would have been paying 150 for before so
you can make the end this is also able
to make the problem approachable by more
workers so I couldn't contribute to
professional captioning even if I really
wanted to even if I would charge less
even if you know what no matter what I
did I couldn't do it but by lowering the
barrier to entry using this system what
we're able to do is say that we have a
much bigger worker pool and we can make
this service available much more on
demand
what you end up getting if you go into a
university for example and you ask them
what would it take to accommodations for
a deaf or hard of hearing student should
just get captions in the classroom and
it turns out you have to give at least
24 or 48 hours notice that you need this
and you have to be on file in advance
with the with a disability service
office just to be able to get the
support and it's because they can't
schedule anyone any faster they're not
always available and they might be
overbooked so we can actually make the
service not only cheaper but more
available by using non-expert workers
and so so kind of along the same lines
looking at tasks that individuals cannot
complete themselves we have activity
recognition the problem here is not that
people can't identify the activities
just like they could hear the the words
on the other inscribe the problem is
that they can't input the information to
the system fast enough so if I want
labels for everything that's going on in
the scene right now most of us would be
pretty hard pressed to be able to type
that as it happens and as they switch
from one action to the next especially
one into action level not just activity
level so what Legionnaire did was it use
the same type of process to run a lot of
these you take the same stream we
color-coded so that workers can focus on
an individual and then you type as many
of the actions as possible now this is a
lot more general we don't divide up the
task in any specific way according to
time we just let you watch the stream
and you type as many tags as possible
what workers will see it kind of on the
side of the video will be labels and
they see what other people have typed
previously what the system's guess is
because we're actually starting to get
to the point where we're integrating
existing machine learning techniques
here in the form of a hidden Markov
model based activity recognition system
and that's going to not only allow us to
try to take a guess with the system and
then have it confirmed by people but
it's actually going to let us learn over
time so the crowd is no longer providing
kind of its own standalone service it's
providing a training service
we don't want to be monitoring people
forever using just the crowd what we'd
like is when something new happens we
can bring the crowd in on demand they
can cope perfectly fine they know what
you know a payment looks like as this
person reaches for their wallet or
leaving the room or whatever they can
identify this even its you know all the
different forms it comes in when the
system can't so they give an answer
system learns okay now I've seen an
instance of that and where we're
starting to work on systems that
actually allow the crowd to give us a
little bit more understanding about the
same problem where we don't just want to
know what the label is but we want to
know what what it means to have
performed that action in a given order
so it wasn't necessary to do one thing
before another and we start to get
dependency relations between all this
and again we can use that to train an
existing system and that gives a lot
faster so for the systems yo sorry good
you lately one just the crowd to do
converge on a granularity of
actions um yes although what we were
doing is we were trying to focus them
under granularity so we actually provide
like two or three examples that might
not be exactly in the space so for
monitoring this room we might give you
know kitchen labeling examples just
because that's what we thought of off
the top of our head but people are able
to kind of take the line making
breakfast instead of cooking eggs and
finding pan or lifting pan or something
like that and they can map that on to
the new domain so we prompt them a
little bit to tell them what we want but
yeah they are able to converge and
they're even able to converge to
consistent labels because once we have
kind of a guess put into the system we
actually left the system proposed as a
worker and I'll get to that a little bit
later but they proposed as a worker so
between sessions you can make sure that
you say making breakfast instead of
cooking eggs because that's kind of the
label that was agreed upon and people
tend to not change the answer unless
there's something wrong with it so if it
seems like a Bible answer they'll stick
with it okay so in all these systems
that we've looked at so far we are able
to give natural language commands to the
system whether that be in the case of
these examples for activity recognition
or directives on what control or what
the goal is for Legion in the control
task and we even capture that we can
actually capture people's speech using
something like Legion scribe but what we
don't have at this point is the ability
to get feedback so we want the crowd to
be able to clarify a task clarify what
they're supposed to be labeling in
Legion if they're if they hit a blockade
and they can't go past maybe we want to
while driving a robot say maybe we want
to let them ask the requester ask the
end user what do you want me to do here
should I go find a different goal should
I keep searching should I give up and
save battery because especially dealing
with users who may under specify the
problem you don't have this the whole
point is that you don't have this this
formalism up front we want to actually
let people just naturally request things
um so the question is can you I should
get natural English feedback with the
crowd it makes sense that you could uh
but you again don't want six or seven or
102 parallel conversations you want one
conversation you want one clarification
process and often in real time so to
look at this we made a chorus now of
course is the system that actually
allows us to do exactly this a lot just
have conversations at the crowd and it
does so by by having multiple workers in
the background all proposing and voting
on each other's answers so that the
crowd is actually sell filtering in this
case and what you see is the
conversation that the end user sees this
is actually a hybrid view right so this
everything in white here know if you can
see that is something the crowd said but
everything this conversation appears to
the end-user appears in the final
conversation ah to make sure that
workers are consistent and are actually
able to be on boarded since we don't
know when people are going to connect to
internally we also provide them with
this working memory that'll have some
kind of passed notes to each other about
what important things have happened in
this conversation but the way we so this
is how we can maintain consistency
across multiple sessions but how we
maintain consistency with multiple
workers who might want to have different
conversations you might have different
ideas of what the solution is is we
actually have a back-end that lets
people vote on specific answers and
there's a point and monetary reward
system that just uses a very simple
incentive mechanism to make sure that
people actually get bonus for
contributing useful answers and and this
bonusing actually allows us to do two
things one it allows us to select just
the consistent answers I know kind of
hard to see that these are these are
pink but just the ones in blue boxes
were actually accepted and so we have
the ability to to vote on these things
but the the ability to actually
word people dynamically for their
contributions allows us to pay workers
appropriately within this continuous
model so you might do a completely
different amount of work you might stay
for a completely different amount of
time than another worker but instead of
kicking you out and making you take a
new small task that asks you to you post
a response or something um we let you
stay attached and we pay you based on
how much you do during that time now
what we were what we tested this on this
is going to appear at whist this year
what we test this on is actually
conversations with you a dozen users who
are asked to come in and kind of follow
the script but the underlying task was a
search test they were trying to find a
piece of information they were trying to
plan a trip they were trying to just
maybe even have a general purpose
conversation to help them make a
decision so one example is you know
should should you get a dog in an
apartment this is not something that you
can just kind of go banter with an
existing system like you can't talk to
Siri about if you should get a dog it
will simply search that question and it
can adapt and you actually get a lot of
very interesting serendipitous
information finding where because we
have multiple workers they'll come
across more information than then they
would have as an individual and a lot of
times that information is actually more
useful than the answer to the question
was that was originally asked so as an
example in testing we saw one time they
were the person was asking what are
different places to visit in Houston and
after they got a list it said great how
much does each one costs so they wanted
a set of prices to come back what one
worker ended up finding and the group
promoted and passed through was actually
a thing about a city pass apparently
that gave the user all of the same
activities that they were looking for
plus a few extras and was cheaper than
giving the individual prices so didn't
this isn't didn't just do what we asked
but the workers were actually able to
figure out that what they came across
was a better answer and propose a
responsive slightly different question
but
not just a conversational partner can
actually act as an interface and we
started to look at applying this to
other domains where we want continuous
interaction with vizwiz so viswas is a
system by Jeff Bingham at all at the ten
other people that allows blind users to
from their cell phone ass take a picture
ask a question about that picture and
then get a spoken response from the
crowd it's actually voiceover that speak
to the response the crowd just provides
text this is this is actually an
extremely popular system right now we
have had this out for I think two years
and it's answered over 60,000 questions
and had five or six thousand users I
think as the last time I checked and you
can see like the types of uses that
people have for this right so maybe it's
trying to figure out what denomination a
bill they have maybe it's reading the
what the stove is set to or reading the
nutritional information off the back of
a can and while the system has been
extremely successful there are
situations where an image alone is just
not enough information it as you can
imagine is very hard to frame images or
for a blind user so they might take a
picture of part of a package ask a
simple question so what what are the
cooking instructions in this case and
the crowd gives the response like well
the instructions are on the other side
okay fine they can't tell so they flip
the box over there's no real tactile
clues as to where this answer is so I
flip it over and give an image now a
completely different crowd of workers a
completely different set of workers gets
this question they don't know that the
user was just on the other side so they
look they say well there are no cooking
instructions in here flip it back over
and this can go on and this I think it
was almost a 15-minute interaction and
yet it's such a simple question right if
you had another person next to you that
you could interact with you could very
easily get this answer
because the tasks are broken up because
the crowd does not have any continuity
between it between the different groups
as a stirring hmm it becomes very
difficult to answer even simple
questions so what we did was we built
chorus view which essentially took the
conversational interaction of chorus and
linked it to streaming video so that you
can now much like having someone on
skype you can actually have a
conversation about some item so you look
at this here what the what the worker
sees is a continuous video stream they
can take some screenshots that they need
to kind of take a look at something a
little bit closer but then they see this
conversation on the side and it's just
chat messages only the user is going to
interact with the crowd via voice so you
played this little message here the
question and then provide answers and
you can say that this one was voted in
but but this one is not because one
person already found the answer well the
other just couldn't read it again kind
of going back to the similar to the
serendipitous discovery it turns out
that a group of workers even with low
quality video streamed over the web can
do a very good job about retrieving this
information because it turns out that
somebody takes the screen shot at the
right time or somebody sees a piece of
information can interpret a piece of
information recognizes the package in
some cases so what we were getting is
responses that we as the designers
couldn't have answered from video but
some crowd worker was able to and then
you can see that this type of
interaction allows the user to take a
picture or not will not take a picture
but start the stream Eames somewhere on
the package and then if it's wrong they
get an adjustment ok well rotate to the
left maybe it's rotate until we tell you
to stop maybe it's rotate 90 degrees
once I do that we're using the same
crowd the same group of individuals who
know what just happened know what pieces
of the package that checked um can kind
of get more perspective because over
time you you can understand what you're
looking at right even if you can't make
out the specific piece of information
and you get responses a lot faster and
this is this is going to be at assets
this
okay so what so what's next well we want
to finish kind of formalizing this model
you can think of this in terms of being
a dynamic system or modeling this using
control theory but we want to know like
how can you what can you get out of this
crowd agent model if you formalize it
maybe people are too uncertain but you
can still give some error bounds if you
assume you know something about the
workers themselves and hopefully this
isn't this isn't a very flat assumption
like a lot of incentive models are where
people will strictly optimized for some
fact uh and then we want to start really
deploying these systems in the wild we
have been able to use real users to test
these things but we haven't just seen
what happens if you give people an
intelligent interface and I don't I
don't think anybody really knows yet
right you've always had these very
limited scope very limited release
systems Siri at least had a large
release but only handle something like
15 functions and they're reasonably
straightforward and then we need to
address some of the security and privacy
concerns that this brings up because if
you look at all of these systems you
know we're streaming video to the crowd
we're giving you no personal information
maybe about location so we can find a
restaurant via chat again so this is
video we're streaming audio to the crowd
we have all this this visual data either
even in the form of images which might
contain information that you didn't want
to share either personally identifying
information or something like catching a
credit card in the background of a
picture or catching something about you
know maybe a mailing address because
there's a letter left on the desk here
on so it's very easy to capture
information that we maybe didn't want to
make public so that's what I've been
working on this summer and I've been
working with Jamie and AJ on this and we
started by really just wanting to know
what are the threats um if you think
about attacking a system you would need
one malicious worker to be able to find
out information from a task so if
somebody accidentally captures their
credit card it only takes one person to
corrupt that
um but if I wanted to actually give the
wrong answer if somebody takes a picture
of a can of peas and you want to make
sure that that person really thinks it's
a can of corn for whatever reason um if
you want to provide which it might
actually matter for a few reasons and
all this other stuff but I what you
really need is a majority right so the
two different manipulation types but
where we can find workers for this and
admit I should point out that this is to
find a piece of information but finding
the task that contains that piece of
information is much more difficult you
probably have kind of a needle in the
haystack problem so you don't you want
one worker per task maybe but you need a
lot of workers to find those task so in
either case you kind of you have a
bigger benefit from having a group and
one of the easiest places to recruit a
group of users is the crowd itself so
could we actually attack crowd powered
systems with the crowd so the first
thing we look at is how could we extract
information we want to go we want to get
that credit card I've stopped using my
own I want to use somebody else's now
that's that and we set up this task
where when the worker gets to the task
they are asked to click this big button
and that immediately forwards them to a
task posted by a different requester and
and that's just a very simple like you
know tell me what's in this image maybe
it doesn't even know maybe the requester
of this inter task doesn't even know is
is this target here is being attacked
and we want to know can we get people to
return as the same information to the to
the attacking task so the first example
we looked at was this hopefully very
easily easily identified fake credit
card it's it's not real it's drawn the
number is 1 2 3 4 5 nobody is going to
really confuse this with someone's
actual credit card and we want to know
our workers more or less willing to
answer this question compared to
something that looks like a real card
now this actually is not a real card but
they didn't know that and it looks
pretty real you know this person is
holding it up it's even got the hologram
and everything
so what do you think like can we get
workers to do this malicious task or
they somehow perfectly ethical yeah so
so to get the ethical task you know it's
kind of complicated we have a lot of
information here that we want copied out
sixty-two percent of workers will
successfully give us all the information
we wanted but as soon as we make this a
potentially harmful looking task drops
to 32 so that's kind of interesting so
workers are paying enough attention to
this task and are making some
assumptions obviously about maybe we
aren't linked maybe we don't own both
tasks right because we certainly didn't
post the same requester they have no way
to know that we're the same person and
obviously they they think that there's
harm or at least this appears to be the
case now what if instead of taking
information out we actually want to put
information in so what if I just want to
give the person the wrong credit card
number or maybe translate the word
incorrectly leave reCAPTCHA had a
problem with this with people just
typing in other words so now the attack
task is even simpler it says don't even
bother don't don't come back and tell me
what they said just tell them that this
word can anybody talk about this word
says anybody want to take a guess okay
so it's a little ambiguous it could
easily be a gun or fun or sun or lawn or
fur I somebody know son so tell the
person that in requesting the task that
this is son hey kinda you know see that
sure on the other hand our second
condition was look at this word and I'm
sure more people can make it out also
tell them that son right it's basically
the same and so 75% of people were
willing to say that this was this was
the word son seems kind of viable until
you consider that if not if it wasn't
suggested only twelve percent of people
actually said that this was the word son
most people actually thought it was a
gun it turns out okay but you know so
they're suggestible maybe maybe we bias
them a little bit maybe we convinced
them that this was the right thing to do
maybe they were just willing to listen
to us because it didn't seem harmful it
seems like that's a plausible answer not
not as many conditions over here they
can't really think that this is a viable
answer and sure enough we see we drop to
just under twenty eight percent of
people who are willing to give us the
answer we asked for when it's clearly
incorrect so this is this is on some
levels promising right it means that the
there are workers out there who will see
this as being a kind of ethical decision
to make between these two different
tasks and will respond to different
rates or maybe they just you know they
don't want to risk it they wanted they
want to do what they're told by the
inner task um I mean let me stay there
for a second so that was interesting but
we still have you know 30 or about
thirty percent on each of the crowd
that's willing to do whatever we just
ask them to do so what can we do about
that thirty percent what can we do to
safeguard against that part of the
population now typical workflow or a
typical way to post a task is you start
you have some potentially sensitive
information you send it to random people
on the internet and you have the
potential for bad things to happen what
we would like to do instead then is pass
this sensitive information try to hand
this past the sensitive information to a
filter and then using that passing you
know filter out all the in from the
pieces that we don't want the crowd to
see come up with a more anonymized task
which is then passed to people in the
internet and we get our task solved
without having to sacrifice privacy okay
so as an example of that let's take this
real simple little piece of text let's
pretend you know this is hand written
out or whatever and hi Bob here's my
username and password Alice now anyone
who has been anywhere near a
cryptographer cryptology class anything
ah knows that Alice talking to Bob is
recipe for disaster it never ends well
and there's always Eve who's some are
off the side listening in waiting to
steal that information the problem here
is that we can't just encrypt this
because Eve is mixed in with the rest of
the crowd and we don't know who the who
the eavesdropper is and who is just
trying to help us complete our task so
what we'd like to do is anonymize this
information we take out all the
sensitive pieces and now he has nothing
to do the problem is this also limits
the potentially limits the crowds
ability to solve the task but if I get
like a response that says well I've
parched your piece of information you
have to fax in here and it says you know
username and password both their stars
well that doesn't really help me as now
the end user my information wasn't
processed directly kind of my anonymized
information was parsed and now I got
something back that wasn't as useful to
me because I don't know which pieces
were used here so we go a little bit
beyond just filtering and what we want
to do is actually replace the sensitive
content with semantic tags and this will
hopefully allow us to track
each piece of information with the
system on the back end and then when
workers actually refer to a piece of
information like oh okay well you know
female names user name is such and such
now the system can repopulate it before
the end user and sees it again and they
can kind of see with some degree of
security exactly what they expected to
and they put something into the system
right it comes back as well Alice's
username is a start but the crowd
doesn't get to see that okay and we want
to we want to do that by actually
dividing this up into small pieces maybe
only giving each crowd worker one word
at a time and having them slowly filter
and complete the task as the oil filter
and replace these semantic tags as they
go so if I see a name I can label that
as such and if I see maybe I don't know
this is a user name until it backs out a
little bit and we get increasingly
larger context for a piece of
information and we filtered as soon as
we can all right but even if we filter
out all the information this is kind of
going a little bit beyond now beyond the
internship here and beyond what we've
previously discussed so if you can
filter out this information we have like
an anonymous crowd who can give us
responses that good response is they
don't reveal any personal information we
still have a scaling problem with
crowdsourcing if you know it kind of in
the extreme imagine if everyone on earth
had a crowd powered system running from
their phone doesn't where you find the
people where do you find 10 people to
power every person's system even with
timeshare he just doesn't just doesn't
work out right now that's pretty far in
the future but um but even for cost
reasons we probably want to minimize the
amount of people we hire for these tasks
so can we actually increase automation
can we use this same model that allowed
us to stop thinking about the crowd as a
collection of noisy workers and just
look at it as a single entity that gives
us a reliable answer to actually provide
training data or maybe
go beyond providing training data and
provide understanding structure to the
final system now within the crowd agent
model itself what we can do is when we
look at this general process right we
have a bunch of people well a bunch of
entities completing tasks and they're
doing so in a continuous system but the
model itself doesn't actually know
whether this person is a human or a
machine so if we can start replacing
some of the contributors some of these
noisy contributors that whereas i'm
assuming with noisy automated processes
even if they get the answer wrong our
expectation is that this the system as a
whole by using agreement with human
workers you can kind of catch these
errors maybe provide good and put
themselves we don't have to in this
merging process propagate that error and
what this means for an interactive
system is that we're able to use the
system use the system which may be
flawed or only partially capable AI in
the background so we can complete a
piece of the times we cannot the entire
thing and all of the noise generated by
that all the wrong answers are removed
from the system they never corrupt the
end users experience so even if we have
to pay a little bit more every once in a
while for more people we can do that
hopefully as little as possible and we
can do that in a system that never looks
like it makes a mistake or at least has
a reasonable error rate let's say
whatever we expect from from humans so
just to briefly recap here I started by
talking about some of the the background
of crowdsourcing and how interactive
systems can go beyond this kind of
divide and batch process model that has
has been mostly a completely pervasive
so far in crowdsourcing recently um and
then talked about how we can really use
this crowds agents model to go beyond
just simple interactions of the crowd
become more interactive with our systems
we actually power intelligence systems
that can speak back can have
conversations and can be consistent
across long ranges of time and how that
starts to point to kind of
truly intelligent systems that we can
put into the wild and right before I
finish up here I promised I'd get back
to this quote so you know it's kind of
this is kind of interesting because i
think this points to kind of the
interesting future of crowdsourcing or
something that we as a community should
look at going forward that is so this is
actually wrong empirically for from
years and years of practice managers
don't think this at least not anymore
right if you if you impress your
employees if you take each one and say
I'm going to micromanage you so that you
never waste a second and and you put
these systems of control with a narrow
span of control on workers they don't
actually work more they're not actually
more productive right and McGregor
didn't actually believe that this was
the answer I believe this is part of a
spectrum and kind of the other side of
this was what he called Theory Y and
that says workers are self-motivated
workers want to be doing a good job they
have some pride in their work and what
managers are supposed to do is not put
them into these rigid structures of
control but actually just enable them
and I think you know for people working
here that's that's certainly closer to
what their day-to-day experience is then
then being told every min of the day
what to do and maybe having to file TPS
reports home but I think just now
crowdsourcing is starting to get away
from this thought and come into this
belief that workers can be leveraged in
different ways can be leveraged maybe as
more self motivated employees if you
just compensate them fairly it'll be
interesting to see what the crowd
community can learn not just for
management science but also from
cognitive science psychology operations
research and all these other fields that
I think have I said a lot of the
precedent in the same type of work but
with a in a different domain we're now
crowdsourcing can come and extend this
to more complex tasks more dynamic tasks
and and really change the way that we do
business
so thanks and happy to answer questions
yeah what if you had a crowd where the
crowd collectively was initiating attack
did the system have an ability to defend
itself so for example if you had fortune
or anonymous there's somebody kind of
come out so so the quite well so if
you're looking at the the method for
creating a private task like the
filtering that we were looking at that's
kind of going through a self-selected
crowd right so we're putting this on
Mechanical Turk if anonymous wants to
then try to corrupt Mechanical Turk it
passes that back of faith yo your your
crowd source is only so large naturally
so like you say Fortran or say all
reddit or a group of Reddit decided they
were going to try and attack this system
but they could win theory over run it by
simply being the largest group of users
by being sixty percent of the users yes
they could overrun in each particular
taxes right have a way to identify
feedback crowd from users to say this is
wrong and then you get enough of these
things and you say by our source has
been compromised right now and then
appliances system so it's possible that
because we saw this difference where
some workers were willing to to kind of
back out of a task and they were
actually passing a payment to not
complete that task that we saw so the
either the extraction of the
manipulation example it might be
possible to have workers who asked
workers to essentially flag information
like that so maybe we get a very small
percentage of the group coming back and
saying I see what other people are doing
I see that this is a problem but then
you have to make it transparent to other
workers what people are doing in general
if you have to take over sixty percent
which even just 51 percent of the crowd
there's a certain cost implied so you
can always you can always just kind of
ratchet up how big of a workforce you
can also use unknown good work forces so
if maybe I have a small internal
employee pool and then i'm using the
crowd to kind of do the really heavy
lifting
ah the filtering task can be done
internally or buy more trusted workers
and not actually give access to to those
kind of groups or to any service that
could be corrupted by those type of
groups that's one way didn't you you
showed that people are less willing to
do a task they think it's a bad thing
like the credit card numbers are they
more willing to do a task if they think
it's a good thing like helping out the
same person right so I do not add that
side but we actually have initial data
kinda from survey results trying to look
at if we give them a set of if you give
workers a set of tasks right it's all
the same task but they're just little
bits of flavor added so this task will
help a blind user or this task will help
a large corporation or you know whatever
and looking at the the fact there is
seemingly a preference difference people
will go for the assistive technology
application and certainly an experience
we've seen workers go out of their way
to come back and ask us you know if you
have another task let me know so so yeah
there is some bias there and we're now
kind of working on experiments to to
show that coming back to our last slide
about how comes it workers are extra
I think behave the works that people
doing jobs also changing like people are
more engaged like it kind of changed
from being a little thing at the factory
to maybe more an intellectual job or
something that keeps your mind occupied
or it keeps you in yes um I don't think
there is a progression like that in
crowdsourcing tuber it it has started to
being these very small things where a
single person is not really very
intellectually challenged about what
they're doing but hopefully we will give
them tasks like building more you know
yeah not any more engaging yeah these
small pieces some kind of one thing that
will have some fun for the influence too
so in my experience I think it will
because if you look at some of the
feedback that we've gotten from workers
in these continuous tasks where they can
kind of they can stay for longer periods
of time we're not constantly
interrupting then we're letting them
kind of invest what they think is
necessary in the task so if you want to
go and really do a lot of research to
bring an answer back to chorus that's
great and will try to reward you for
that but but it's not necessarily like
you could just give the basic answers
you can opt in when you want to answer
in when you don't want to answer that
kind of thing we give a lot more freedom
we give a lot more kind of providence of
the data against you really not seeing
the the individual worker contribution
but the worker themselves sees that they
get more points and things like that so
there's I think a lot of different
levels of engagement and a lot of
different levels of kind of commitment
to a specific task because you can stay
for a longer span so so that hopefully
is even supported by the continuous
model but I agree yeah you're using the
crowd easy to train the hidden Markov
model for the
the video yeah did you find that to be a
reliable method of training well so what
we were doing there is actually having
the crowd come up with label sets that
were exactly the same as an expert would
have so they're basically it's a
correlated time range with a label so
because and I kind of mentioned this in
the my answer to John because we can get
consistency across the what we were
calling the activities by taking a guess
with the system and trying to like you
know pull people towards consistent
answers then we could kind of real able
making breakfast every single time we
saw a different type of a different
course of action that went into making
breakfast we were still able to come up
with the same label so the system could
get trained it didn't have like 400
different labels for a single activity
so then at that point it just kind of
