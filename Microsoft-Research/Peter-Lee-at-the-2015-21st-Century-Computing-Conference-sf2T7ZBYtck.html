P Tony
Wow hello it's it's such a pleasure to
be here and let me say on behalf of all
of us at Microsoft it's such an honor to
build on our deep partnership with Cheng
hua university and bring you today's
conference on computing in the 21st
century really really a deep honor for
all of us in today's conference you're
going to hear lectures from some of the
most respected and accomplished scholars
and researchers in computer science and
people who have accomplished things and
contributed to human knowledge in ways
that have made a huge kind of impact on
all of us in fact some of the things
that have been accomplished by today's
speakers have resulted in innovations
and technologies that are in your hands
and in your pockets right now but maybe
even more importantly are behind the
scenes invisible in the cloud in our
roadways infrastructures in our power
systems so much of what has been
accomplished in computing over the past
25 and 30 years has resulted in what my
boss Harry Shum refers to is the
invisible revolution all of the things
behind the scenes that just make our
lives better make us all productive and
give us new ways to entertain and
educate ourselves research is really at
the heart of all of those kinds of
innovations and for that reason research
really matters a lot to Microsoft and so
what I wanted to do in this opening
lecture for 21 CCC is try to give you a
little bit of an idea about why research
is so important to Microsoft and at
least one point of view about why
research matters to innovation and how
innovation can be brought to impact to
make our lives and our industries better
and so let me just start with something
that's very very important to Microsoft
now Microsoft of course has a lot of
product we have a search engine called
Bing we have an entertainment device
called Xbox and we have a cloud called
Azure we have many many things but of
all those products the one that's most
important to the core of Microsoft is
the Windows operating system and this
summer we had a very very important day
when we released to the world a new
version of Windows called Windows 10
that happened in July of the summer and
that in many ways is possibly the most
important day in the history of
Microsoft and that's saying something
because Microsoft as a company's over 40
years old now on that day that Windows
10 was released to the world our CEO
Satya Nadella actually wasn't in the
Microsoft headquarters in redmond
washington instead our CEO such an adela
was actually in africa in kenya
reviewing an initiative that we have in
kenya that closes the digital access
divide and uses advanced technologies to
bring the internet and new educational
and productivity opportunities to
millions of people who have had trouble
with that access in Africa and so that
was really an important statement by our
CEO on such an important day when we
were announcing our most important
product that he was in Africa and it was
also a very proud day for me as a person
who works in microsoft research because
this particular initiative uses a
wireless networking technology that we
refer to as TV white spaces and the idea
of TV white spaces I won't go into too
many details but the idea of TV white
spaces is to use television frequency
bands in order to provide very very high
bandwidth and
long distance wireless networking access
at very very low cost and it's called
white spaces because if you look at the
way the television frequencies are used
in most of the world it's very dynamic
exactly which parts of the frequencies
are inhabited by signals changes over
time but if you use very clever
algorithms and powerful database
technologies you can keep track of where
these openings in the television
spectrum pop up dynamically and can use
that in order to transmit access to the
Internet and so we were just very very
proud just in addition to launching a
new important product called Windows 10
to have one of our research projects at
Microsoft Research being highlighted in
a review by our CEO in Africa but we can
ask the question on such an important
day for the business of Microsoft why
was our CEO doing this and that really
gets to the fundamental heart of the
question heart of the question that I
want to really address today which is
why do we do research why is it
important now that is a question that is
more important to the world than just
Microsoft every country in the world
today is thinking hard about how to get
more innovation that's a very big
discussion in in China and it's a very
big discussion in the United States last
spring the president of MIT wrote an
important editorial in The Washington
Post and in that editorial and he was
speaking directly to this question of
how do we get more innovation an
editorial was important because the mit
president dr. arrived actually pointed
out that innovation actually comes at
its heart from doing research but the
world has been changing and so in one
statement in his editorial he said in
the past two deck
aids or in the past five years I'm sorry
the United States has undergone a
profound shift in how it develops adopts
and capitalizes on innovation and those
shifts have prompted a desire to go
faster to have bigger impact and to get
to impact on the real world much faster
than we've ever done before and that is
created very difficult pressures in the
United States traditionally a lot of the
best research has been supported by the
US government but in this new world the
MIT person points out that government is
no longer able to effectively supply the
kind of long-term funding that leads to
the kinds of results that new companies
and products need and so this is a very
difficult problem and very similar
problems also exist in China so how do
we think about research and how do we
get the most out of the research that we
do now that question has gotten so
important that in the technology
industry today computer industry more
and more researchers are being hired
directly into companies to just do
research and think thoughts about how to
create new innovative and disruptive
futures two years ago Mark Zuckerberg
whose CEO of facebook actually went to
one of the premier academic conferences
for research and artificial intelligence
called nips and he spoke the language of
AI researchers which is very impressive
and announced the creation of a new
basic research lab called the Facebook
AI research lab baidu also announced
about the same time a new research lab
in the Silicon Valley devoted to basic
research and artificial intelligence
these labs are new entities that are
trying to take foundational research the
basic research the discovery of pushing
the front
years of human knowledge in the hopes
and in the expectations that the
research results are going to lead to
new innovations that can be
commercialized by these companies
companies like Facebook and Baidu and of
course they're not the only ones amazon
the United States also has been
investing in research they have a
research lab called lab126 that has been
hard at work trying to invent and
understand new kinds of device
technologies and they've been having
some trouble because they get pushed
very hard and sometimes the innovations
they come out are not commercial
successes and that leads to a lot of
reorganizations and a lot of anxieties
and of course google also has been
investing in research in google research
and in Google X and again as research
labs like this are pushed so hard in
order to go faster and produce
innovations faster and produce products
faster sometimes the things that get
produced aren't completely successful
and there have been some struggles in
all of these places and so we see that
at national levels in countries like
China and the United States as well as
at the level of individual companies
there's a tremendous faith in the idea
that research can lead to new
innovations but also some trouble we
haven't quite unlocked the secret about
how to do this the bottom line is that
right now what we see in our industry in
the world is that research is our best
hope for new revolutions and new
advances in our industries and research
especially in machine learning and
artificial intelligence is being looked
upon as a driver for new industrial
revolution and so in today's 21 CCC we
chose the theme of AI as a focal point
but when we say AI we really meeting in
the Broadway it is not just the idea of
intelligent agents and machines that can
see and hear and understand like people
do
but also all of the computing
infrastructure in databases it networks
in human-computer interfaces and and
really the broad spectrum of computing
research that ends up being incredibly
important in pulling all of this
together in a way that is going to lead
to some value and so what I'd like to do
is just give a high level picture of how
we approach this within Microsoft
Microsoft has invested in research for
almost 25 years founding 24 years ago
the Microsoft Research Organization
which today now is over 1,200
researchers and engineers spread out
over a dozen labs around the world our
largest lab outside of the United States
being here in Beijing and so what I like
to do is take a concrete example and
show how we approach doing foundational
research the nature of that research and
how we try to extract value from
Microsoft and for the world out of that
research so let me start with machine
learning now the first thing to do is
just to give a picture of what machine
learning is about is we can imagine a
machine learning system a machine
learning system is some kind of system
that is able to learn from experience
and today we can think of experience as
data so we want a system that can look
at lots and lots of data and produce
answers or programs that that accomplish
some task so for example we can have a
machine learning system that accepts
lots of speech input maybe it's speech
input of someone speaking in English
maybe it's data sets of many many
different people speaking English all
labeled with what they're saying and
when we take that speech plus the labels
the transcripts of what the speech means
we call that training data and so if we
have an appropriately development
machine learning system we can take our
English training data and feed it to the
machine learning system and produce an
output which is
a piece of software sometimes you call
it a model a trained model and that
model then can run hopefully on a small
device like a smartphone so that it
accepts speech input and produces a
transcript of the speech possibly with
some errors and so this is the general
schematic of how one might use machine
learning to create a system that can
understand human speech now one of the
amazing things that's happened just in
the last five years is that we've
unlocked some secrets in our research on
how to build machine learning systems
that have the property that if we
provide more data and that data might
require very large amount of
computational power to process that as
we feed more data into a machine
learning system the capabilities of the
speech recognition system improved so in
other words the more training data we
provides the machine learning system the
fewer errors our speech recognition
system produces and that revolution has
made it possible to create the
technology that probably is in all your
pockets if you have a smartphone a very
smart for now you have speech interfaces
that are remarkably better than they
were just five years ago and they're
better five years ago because of
advances in machine learning but these
advances go further than that we can
take that system that's been trained on
English and we can give it Mandarin
training data and when we train that on
Mandarin data we get a system that
understands both English and Chinese
speech generating either English words
or Mandarin words and remarkably even
though we have trained this English
system on Mandarin only that training
and Mandarin improves the English
performance and then if we take the
system and train it on French the
Mandarin improves and English improves
and so we get what's called the transfer
learning effect in
transfer learning effect has been
another thing that's been absolutely
remarkable advancement in our basic
research in machine learning that has
led to just remarkable advances in the
practical application of speech
recognition systems this graph shows the
result of this this is a graph that
shows the progress in the accuracy of
speech recognition systems from 1993 to
just a few years ago and so on the
x-axis you see the year by year test of
the best systems in the research world
and on the y-axis is what's called the
word error rate and so the word error
rate is basically you can think of like
this if you were to all try to write
down what I'm speaking right now and
then later we check how many errors
you've made how many words you've missed
transcribed that would be the word error
rate and so if you look at this graph
you can see at the beginning in 1993 the
best speech recognition systems
basically didn't work they had nearly
one hundred percent error rates for open
domain speech but because of the
application of machine learning over a
period of about a decade up until about
two thousand there was very rapid
improvement to the point where in about
the year 2000 the best speech
recognition systems at Microsoft
Research and at universities were
achieving word error rates of about
twenty six percent you can think of it
as getting one word wrong out of every
four spoken and now you'll see that
there was a long period where there is
no discernible improvement and I'll say
something more about that later there
was a lot of intensive research during
that period from 2002 2010 and then
suddenly we passed a tipping point and
around 2010 there was again a major
advancement in machine learning in the
application of very very large data and
computational power using something
called deep neural nets to create
another major improvement we're now
today in the laboratory several research
groups at microsoft research and other
University and company laboratories are
in laboratory conditions achieving word
error rates of under seven percent
probably better than any of you can do
in real time and that's just an amazing
achievement so machine learning has just
absolutely transformed how we're able to
have a computer here and understand
human speech that blue sky kind of
thinking that curiosity driven work to
just understand what processes
algorithmic or cognitive are involved in
are saying human speech have really
resulted in these advances in our
understanding of machine learning
systems and algorithms and have led to
these kinds of improvements those
improvements were very important to us
in Microsoft Research so important that
some of you might be worth at four years
ago in this very conference in Tianjin
China at 21 CCC the founder of Microsoft
Research Rick Ratched was on stage and
for about five minutes used an advanced
speech recognition system to speak in
English but have his speech come out of
these speaker systems in Mandarin in
real time i was there in 2011 sitting in
the seat right about there and i just
remember how shocked the audience was I
was sitting actually near some of our
researchers who were working a system
and they were very scared not knowing if
the system was actually going to work
for the founder but luckily it did I
remember looking for several further
rows back and seeing students actually
with tears in their eyes being able to
see the magic of someone speaking across
the language barrier just to give you an
idea of just how magical that is what
I'd like to show you is a video
demonstration of the power of that kind
of simultaneous translation system and
this is a video Dempster
that was recorded at just about the time
that this demonstration in Tianjin China
was made
hello you have I'm really pleased to
have this opportunity wolf enclosing

then she thanked each other woman side
to achieving lynching the moon shelf
thank you she is yet
by the way it's always a little bit
scary to give that kind of demonstration
in front of a crowd that actually
understands Mandarin and I am aware of
some of the mistakes that were made by
the system and I could hear some
chuckles but it there's still sort of a
magic here and actually one of the
things i find so wonderful about
computing research is that we can start
from really foundational basic blue sky
research just trying to understand the
structure of human speech trying to
codify it in a machine learning system
just really understanding it at these
foundations understanding it
algorithmically understanding it
mathematically but then in computing
research what's so wonderful is we can
take that understanding once we believe
we have some understanding and turn it
into some kind of technology we can
invent something and actually write
programs and build machines that
actually codify that understanding we
can create new phenomena and that's a
shift of what i call the shift from blue
sky research to inventive or disruptive
research i can't think of any other
field of endeavor of scientific research
where we have such an amazing ability to
easily shift doing our research
endeavors from kind of blue sky thinking
to inventive or disruptive thinking it's
just such a wonderful thing and when
people try to understand why computing
research is so important to the concept
of innovation I think this is one of the
keys and then of course working at
Microsoft Research what is even doubly
exciting about that is that sometimes
when we invent things we have the
opportunity to deploy those inventions
to the world we can join with product
engineering groups and business people
in a big company like Microsoft
and try to deliver brand new services
and products that really enable people
we can start to realize the dream in
this case of eliminating the language
barrier between all Internet connected
people and so one of the things that's
so exciting is that just last month our
skype product for Windows now has
speech-to-speech translation as a
built-in feature and while it's for
windows today over the next few months
we'll be rolling this out for other
platforms for iOS and Android and and
the like already we see with speech
speech translation in skype the amazing
ability of grandchildren being able to
talk for the first time to grandparents
that live in a different country and
speak a different language or we're able
to for the first time see people working
in some kind of NGO in Nicaragua
speaking only Spanish conducting
business productively with people in New
York City or because of the facility of
speech recognition we now have in
microsoft research itself husbands and
wives where the husband may be hard of
hearing may be deaf being able to
converse through skype with their wives
in a much more seamless way and so it's
just been absolutely magical to see the
shift now from blue sky research to
inventive or disruptive research to
mission focused research and deploying
this of the world and the challenges the
research doesn't stop because to bring
something like this to hundreds of
millions of users of skype is not just
an AI challenge but it is a massive
database challenge it's a massive
distributed systems challenge it's a
massive software engineering challenge
and all of those things just hatched new
basic research questions and problems
that we work on now every day and it's
of course not just skype but now in
all of our mobile applications are
increasingly becoming voice and speech
enabled through through the same sorts
of advances now I wanted to get back to
this and point out something that's very
important now Skype translator was
released in skype for windows just last
month and you might think that that's
very fast because we made a
demonstration for the first time in
China of the speech speech technology
just in 2011 and so only four years
later we have a product that seems
pretty fast and it is fast we worked
very hard but the fundamental research
that enabled this stretches back decades
and in fact I just wanted to highlight
this long period of about 10 years when
we were very hard at work in Microsoft
Research and in many universities around
the world trying to understand the
structure of human speech and yet for
that long period of 10 years not seeing
any practical improvement in deployed
speech recognition systems and this is a
fundamental characteristic of research
and one of the reasons why investments
in research over the long term are so
important and why it's so challenging
because every day during this long
period we were actually learning new
lessons we were doing research around
the world and yet it took the
accumulation of a decade of lessons and
insights and maybe some luck before
suddenly we pass a tipping point and
have a rush of new practical
improvements and so the point there is
that research is a long game and for
countries and societies that aspire to
be leaders in innovation the supporting
infrastructure the government's and the
agencies that are tasked with sparking
innovation and supporting research must
understand that it requires patience and
longevity and stamina in order to
realize the benefits
now another thing to say about research
is that when you work on something as
fundamental as machine learning machine
learning as a fundamental idea spans
much much more than just speech
recognition it's a very general concept
and so if you use the Bing search engine
you are actually using a machine
learning system because the Bing search
engine is reading all the documents on
the World Wide Web reading all the
queries that you type in looking at what
you click on in respond to those queries
in order to learn the structure of the
world wide web and it's doing that using
machine learning algorithms that are
strikingly similar to the machine
learning algorithms in something like
Skype translator yesterday we launched a
an important new video game called halo
5 and if you play halo 5 and you want to
find a game on on the network with other
people who play like you do we use
machine learning to observe your style
of play and match you up with people
that you were very likely have the most
fun with again that's machine learning
we have new devices like the Microsoft
band and the Microsoft band is able to
track my heart rate the number of
calories that I'm expending and they are
the amount of oxygen that I'm taking in
and it's doing that amazing amount of
stuff with just a little bit of sensing
again using machine learning algorithms
and for companies who are big customers
of ours we have been using machine
learning to study the documents within
the corporates corporations Network and
emails and meeting schedules in order to
figure out the most relevant documents
and people and tasks for each worker in
these companies and that's all done
through machine learning so machine
learning just has this kind of broad
ability to augment human intelligence
and give all of us the capacity to do
much more I don't know how many of you
recognize this passage it's a very very
strange passage but in case you don't
know what it is this is the passage that
you must type in on your smartphone if
you want a chance to claim the Guinness
World Record for text messaging speed
and so very kind of surprisingly the
machine learning algorithms that we use
for speech recognition can be adapted
very simply to allow you to on your
smartphone have a new method of swiping
text input that allows much much faster
text input and so we adapted our speech
recognition machine learning systems to
the problem of text input on smartphones
in order to capture the Guinness World
Record for text messaging speed and so
I'd like to show you now is a short
video of the world record attempt here
it goes one two three
don't
he's going to check the text them
congratulations Fotolia after the
lecture dr. binding Guo will demonstrate
his ability to capture the world record
for all for anyone who asks the point
there is the surprising and unplanned
really unanticipated outcomes of
research just speaking personalized
research who they are the most fun
they're the ones that get me excited
about research but also it's a practical
matter there are often times the most
valuable results from research and the
reason they are often so valuable is
that the unanticipated or unplanned
outcomes of research are oftentimes the
ones that can surprise or disrupt others
when you create something that's kind of
wasn't intended that was surprising you
have the chance for doing something
disruptive and so another thing that is
very challenging for countries and
societies that are looking to research
as a driver of innovation is that
there's a tremendous urge by company
leaders by government leaders to want to
plan research and to say we are going to
fund research for a specific outcome and
then to be completely blind to any other
possibilities and while that can
sometimes work it can also create the
danger that you miss maybe even more
important to spin off a fax from
research and so research requires a kind
of open-mindedness to kind of
unanticipated outcomes now and this was
absolutely true in all of the research
that we tried to drive in in Microsoft
Research I mentioned about the Skype
translator and of course we had the plan
directed by our CEO Satya Nadella to put
our speech speech technology into skype
and we have been accomplishing that plan
very successfully with a lot of hard
work but a lot of unintended outcomes
have happened as well and those on
intended outcomes lead us to a fourth
type of research which I call sustaining
research this is a photograph of a
research meeting in our labs and I I
want you to just imagine in your head
what kind of noise is going on in this
meeting this is a meeting where people
are laughing they're talking over each
other they're interrupting each other
there's a lot of back and forth and if
you think about the kind of speech there
it's a kind of speech that's very
colloquial very friendly I would say
even intimate and this is important
because when we worked on the Skype
translator one of the things we
discovered is that our speech processing
systems are models for speech and for
translation didn't work too well and now
what was the problem why didn't they
work well well as it turns out most of
our speech systems and our translation
systems and this is true for our
competitor companies and most
universities have been trained on
lectures on speeches on testimony from
the United Nations they've been
optimized to understand the speech
between strangers conducting very short
business transactions like a person
speaking to a hotel clerk or to a taxi
driver or to a waiter in typical travel
scenarios but if you think about Skype
you have two people talking to each
other who are oftentimes very very close
to each other their co-workers that are
working together across some language
divide trying to accomplish something or
negotiate something it's a granddaughter
talking to a grandmother it's a kind of
intimacy that actually deeply affects
the speech modeling and the translation
modeling and so what we've had to do in
understanding this and doing the
research on speech-to-speech translation
for skype is really
all of our speech and translation models
to account for this highly
conversational intimate interaction and
the payoff for doing that is not only
having a system like Skype translator
but now having new language processing
models that give us a chance to actually
capture even the kind of speech that
goes on in a meeting like this and for
company like Microsoft this can have
gigantic commercial value because a huge
part of our business is actually
enabling businesses and companies have
more productive meetings and more
productive office workers and so the
sky's the limit now that we've
accomplished this and many of you here
are probably familiar with the chat bot
Xiao Weis and at closer today a shallow
and Han will say much more about this
but she'll Weiss is another realization
of the lessons that we learn from these
systems that give us a way to converse
and interact with people in a way that
is just much friendlier much more
personable much more intimate and so
we're just learning so much about how to
make our interfaces much more human and
so when you look at these modes of
research we start from blue sky research
that blue sky research might spend
decades but every once in while we're
able to take our learnings and invent
something that could be disruptive like
a speech to speech translation system
and then if we're very lucky and we work
hard we might have an opportunity in the
company like Microsoft to productize
this into a system like Skype translator
by engaging in a mission focused way
with product engineering groups and then
the research doesn't stop there but in
fact they're always unanticipated
unattended outcomes where we're
constantly wanting to improve our
understanding and improve the technology
but also finding new applications that
lead to new insights that lead to new
opportunities for blue sky research and
so in the microsoft research management
approach we think of this as an
innovation pipeline that we always want
to make sure that throughout our
research labs
we have very good activities going on in
all four stages of this innovation
pipeline and in terms of our investment
strategy we plot this out in a two
dimensional investment map we're on the
x axis we have investments in research
efforts that are on a schedule either
short or long term schedule as we go out
in the excesses we have investments in
research projects that are more open
ended in terms of timing and on the y
axis we have investments in research
that maybe are in response to a problem
that is given to us perhaps by the
company or some product team or maybe by
society and as we move up the y axis we
have investments in to solve research
problems that are much more open ended
the open-ended search for truth and
deeper understanding and sometimes
beauty and to explain this then to our
shareholders and to our CEO we put names
on these quadrants where in the lower
left quadrant we have our mission
focused research in the upper left
quadrant we have our disruptive or
inventive research and then in upper
right quadrant blue sky research and
sustaining research in the lower right
or to put it more succinctly we have a
mandate to be smart be fast be
responsive and be the best at everything
that we do and so all of the leaders in
Microsoft Research are obligated to
understand how their investment strategy
will lead to impact across these four
quadrants and ultimately to give me
great things to brag about and deliver
to to the world in all four quadrants
now I concentrated on one AI problem
which was language processing and
translation but I could have given
exactly the same story in a whole range
of other areas in video processing in
digital access in image processing and
deep neural nets in computer
architecture in software verification
validation in databases the list just
goes on and on the possibilities are
just tremendous
the basic point is that no matter what
the field of endeavor in computing
research that research idea plays a
central role in all stages of this
innovation pipeline from blue sky
research to inventive research to
mission focused research all the way to
sustaining research and at least in the
way that we think of driving innovation
impact out of the research activities in
Microsoft Research and in our
collaborations with great universities
like chinua we try to think about how we
can hit all four stages of this pipeline
I'd like to close by saying that
throughout the day today we are hoping
that many of you will be inspired to
think about the possibility of pursuing
careers in research one thing to say is
that it may appear as though we have
solved all the world's problems already
and that it's just too hard to get
involved in and make your own advances
but in fact we have just barely
scratched the surface the computing
revolution has just barely begun there
is so much more to do and if anything we
need brilliant new people entering the
field now more than ever to have any
chance to advance our understanding of
the research turn those research results
into innovations and then maximize the
impact of those innovations to as our
CEO likes to say empower every person on
the planet to achieve more so I hope
some of you are so inspired thank you
all for listening
