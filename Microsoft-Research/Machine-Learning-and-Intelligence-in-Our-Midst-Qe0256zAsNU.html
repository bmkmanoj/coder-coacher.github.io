Horvitz distinguished scientist and
deputy managing director at Microsoft
Research well good morning well we're
certainly having some exciting times
these days with what's happened over the
last let's say 25 years in the amount of
computation and memory we have at our
fingertips the incredibly unexpected
connectivity and data from my point of
view putting myself in my grad student
shoes in the 80s and potentially most of
all and stunning and interesting I think
is the are the advances in our ability
to to learn and reason from data as well
as to do perceptual things to listen to
observe to recognize with vision systems
and acoustical systems these days lots
of opportunities and directions come
from these advances and they're only
increasing and I think right now we've
gone superlinear I mean things are for a
while we would say sublinear and AI
artificial intelligence but we're moving
quickly at a fast pace and things are
accelerating and it's very exciting for
somebody that myself and my colleagues
who've been struggling for many many
years in this field on the dream of a I
I headed to start a little bit up with
some background in the 1980s you might
take those a kind of a revolution in
artificial intelligence when we started
as a community looking very carefully in
some ways rediscovering probability and
utility a decision theory for many years
AI had gone into the world of logic
based systems logic reasoning which
fabulous work and theorem proving and so
on shunning the notion of uncertainty in
many in many many ways in the 80s
there's every discovery of this
methodology that what you see here is a
Bayesian model or Bayesian network that
we created my team at Stanford in
1985-86 or so what you see here those
nodes are variables in this these are
variables or observations you might
capture in an intensive care you
at a hospital and up on top here if I
can grab the mouse I have a mouse that's
moving here well anyway up at top our
causes things you worry about with
illness in and physiology in an
intensive care unit in the middle are
unobserved variables you can't see very
well like catecholamine levels at the
bottom you are observables and the idea
is methods were developed to take any
subset of observations you might see
like heart rate and blood pressure and
propagate that information through these
models to give us probabilities or
things we cared about make decisions
based on that now in the old days we had
to we didn't have very much data so we
would build these by hand sitting with
an expert for days and days would turn
out in the latter 80s and into the 90s
the community developed a number of
methods that could take large amounts of
data because we actually began having
access to this data and developing
procedures for learning those kinds of
models let's say for three variables
here and structure that could be used to
make predictions in the world with
procedures like search searching through
a space of models and finding the model
that best explain the data here you see
in the with the red their circle there
and those models can be used not just
for making for inferring hidden states
of the world like the intention of a
user for example doom entering a query
or a particular disease process active
in a patient or what the state of
traffic will be on on five north in two
hours but also to go from these
predictions to actions in the world by
embedding them in what's called a
decision model that balances the costs
and benefits of action under uncertainty
so we look at this interesting pipeline
data to predictions to decisions as
being critical both in business and
consumer applications of a variety of
kinds the advances we've already been
seeing and touching daily in in search
and advertising online in recommender
systems that tell you which book you
might buy given the books you've already
purchased and so on just a few years ago
those applications when we develop them
a Microsoft in the early 90s when I
first started here at research
we're considered quite exotic I would
show people a recommender system and say
look at this toy site using commerce
server 2 point 0 with our new technology
we call collaborative filtering watch
what happens when someone surfs the web
and they look at these toys and this toy
site look at these toys recommending and
being recommended and people would
applaud in the audience that this is an
exotic concept now you know our aunts
and uncles are worth daily working with
the web and you're feeling the
recommendation engines and so on beyond
search and online services though seeing
quite a bit of activity and advancement
in speech natural language gesture
recognition as you see from our
offerings like the Kinect other kinds of
places coming around met and their
advances have going on in that front but
newer applications are coming to the
fore in terms of recognizing activities
that you would think only people would
recognize from a distance for example
deeper understanding of the intentions
and goals of people working with
software or walking in the world if for
example emitting GPS signals of with the
permission understanding what's going on
in its one's life their mood even
understanding cognition of have some
time today I'll talk about some work in
the models of human cognition space but
it's some core work in transportation in
health care and the environment we sing
some some interesting innovations and I
want to talk about a few cased a couple
of case studies to give you a sense for
the end to end of some of this research
in some easy to understand applications
like traffic flow in healthcare and then
we'll spend a little bit of time towards
the end of the that the presentation on
what we call intricate of AI as opposed
to trying to do monolithic efforts in
vision or speech there's been an
interesting trend and we have some
sister groups at universities around the
world we have a close sister group at
Stanford University where we take parts
of the best of breed of work in
different areas of AI like vision and
speech and activity recognition and
planning and robotics and we think we've
these components together to
can get more than the parts in a hole
and even understand what it takes to
build new kinds of Integrative
experiences and intelligences from
components and we've seen these kinds of
things become ready for daily life let
me start with a case study in
transportation that we gives you a sense
for a tech transfer at Microsoft and the
experience we had so I don't know where
everybody comes from here but I can
guarantee you even being a person that
was at Stanford in the bay area for many
years with traffic was horrendous that
no place is worse than Seattle well we
all will sort of have our our pet cities
for complaints about traffic and so this
it was just you know on our team we had
expertise machine learning and we
thought you know back in there it was
this is basically around two thousand
three or so he said you know can't we
take the traffic we're getting the feeds
we're getting from the Seattle highway
system the little you know red yellow
and green dashes and dots you see on the
highway it's being sensed by that by the
but the traffic department combine that
with incident reports this is a
telegraphic report kind of like kind of
a very brief but sort of a natural
language about what's going on on
different aspects of the highway system
with accidents weather feeds were now
available we had major event schedules
like Marineris games in Seattle and the
idea of combining these heterogeneous
streams into a single database and then
saying let's actually take the big
database of about four years of data and
now build models that for any segment on
the highway system could predict the
flow in the future not now but know if
I'm planning on leaving in an hour for
example what's going to happen and we
both a little app called smart flo in
those days and distributed at Microsoft
that's a green disk there you see though
the red one here those little plucks
appearing by the arterial system our
visualizations of how many minutes until
the clog melts say see here ten minutes
on the right side 30 minutes in the
middle there the green meant how long it
would stay open until a clod and we're
very excited but if you feel
you know distribute the Sun on
smartphones we offer that the system
would actually give you the maximum
light time the bottleneck would last as
well as the standard deviation sort of a
sense for the error the system's own
confident confidence in its inferences
now we actually then starts to start
thinking about wow how do people
actually use devices in the real world
well most people you know in Seattle
fashion themselves as traffic experts so
we thought about this when should a
device come forward and buzz you and
this led to a whole research project in
itself on what's called user modeling
which is going to be a more and more
important area in the machine learning
space to understand users deeply so in
this case we said we have a system with
a world model in this case the traffic
system understands it can predict the
future of traffic over the next hour for
example in different parts of the
highway system that's running we'll call
it the world model and it's generating
probability distributions looking like
little histogram here it's never look
totally certain but it has an idea
here's the human being let's say this
the semi expert experienced person in in
Seattle who knows the traffic system on
the way home looks outside it's raining
out and so on those time of day and day
of week and he or she has their own
probability distribution about what's
going to happen and what we thought
would be interesting is if we actually
give our systems knowledge of a user
model that would explain what people
might think here it is a guessing now
and together reason about what when is
it important to tell somebody something
that they don't know exactly which is
interesting direction i think for AI we
call that complementary computing how
can i compute in a way that takes into
consideration the way people think i
guess we did with the traffic system it
corpus a model of surprise so we
basically our system understands well
people understand major events whether
time of day day weekend holiday status
and the real world outcome here we can
actually take 15 minutes sections of
time for every street segments on the
highway system in seattle and by time of
day and day of week and get a sense for
what's expected and then look at
outliers flows where you wouldn't expect
them
like it's jammed it's a it's a it's a
it's jam-packed at two p.m. on sunday
afternoon in a place that's never they
never ceased traffic or it's slow it's
it's fast going tonight in the rain I'm
405 north during rush hours we should be
unexpected and the idea is to take these
human surprises and create a data store
we're learning at a different level now
we're learning what events would
surprise people and looking at the time
of day and day of week and looking at
everything in system can see which is a
lot bigger picture then then people see
including the history that traffic
accidents the flow of of clogs through
the system is a dynamism there but even
more interestingly we said let's go back
in time let's say 30 minutes and look at
what was happening before the surprise
occurred such that if I could make an
inference we can build a model with
machine learning that might give us
would call a surprise forecasting model
this basically tells us that people will
be surprised in 30 minutes when they're
not even surprised now so it's a little
symbol of saying the system knows that
you the commuter are surprised about
this delay this over here means that you
will be blown away that in 30 minutes
you know this this area 405 north near
the Wimbledon tunnel is wide open so the
system is actually no understands people
now it's coming forward and buzzing them
and so on and people on the way home a
decade HD stock on a desktop computer
set up their commutes their am commuting
p.m. commute and this and this tell the
system only let me know when I'll be
surprised by a clog on my route on my
way home in 30 minutes so that was a
smart Flo and it was quite successful we
had several thousand users internally at
Microsoft when we first put this out we
could we logged them by by contracts we
enlisted how it was working and so on
and then one day I was driving along on
the highway system heading four or five
North i had my in-laws here we're taking
them to a vegetarian restaurant
had been to before and we were just all
of a sudden stuck in traffic on the
highway and I said that's interesting
you know it so stuck I have a GPS system
in my car i'll go on the side streets I
can route around this traffic what was
even worse the side streets were worse
and most context-sensitive traffic
systems assume Oh highway clogged I'll
take that offline and side streets are
smooth and flowing at speed limit they
don't realize that we have to consider
the whole the whole the whole ism of
traffic in a city area so we had this
grandchild you said okay in most cities
big cities in the world these days is
the North America we sense the major
arterials the highway system but we
really need to know all streets you know
all surface streets plus the highway
system to route effectively through
traffic so the grand challenge to my
team was can we make the complete
highway the sensed highway system a mega
sensor for all traffic in a region
understanding the properties of the road
and the weather and other contextual
features if you could you can do routing
and the one of these search algorithms
like called Dykstra or a star the
searches we depend on in our GPS systems
these days in our cars and in our
pockets you can do that effectively and
so we set off on our moon mission to see
if we can do this with wrote apology big
maps of the highway of the height of the
highway and surface speed systems
whether time of day and so on and to do
this well we needed to basically go out
and get data so we had highway data for
four years we ended up in those days
handing out GPS devices these were
Vickers on phones yet at the time and we
said to Microsoft employees and their
spouses volunteering drive around
Seattle just take it for a while and we
had about a million kilometers a hundred
thousand trips we started doing our data
mining and the idea was can I learn the
personalities of streets street segments
I haven't even seen before with this
model from data that i have that joins
together the highway flows with the
surface street flows this was you a
little bit of the model here it's a
little hard to see he right now but in
general we have different types
of relationships we have databases that
tell us about how roads join together
how they flow for example how far away
is a current surface street from a
clogged on-ramp to a freeway in a
routing this in routing distance
computed real-time relationships and so
on and this led to a prototypical clear
flow now clear flowy let out internally
at Microsoft we're told we told Craig
Monday and Bill Gates if all of our
colleagues go use this and we watched
how well do these things work and the
system more clear flow and people this
is an example of how it works see they
say when you know you're where you're
going when are you leaving and the
system will actually go out and show you
the traffic and even ran in this kind of
mode work it would show you we wouldn't
really wanted to do this a B Pepsi Coke
comparison so we would show on the Left
the clear flow directions and timing
estimates and then the time mat point
the default and even showed how each one
thought about the others routes is kind
of interesting to watch so it uses could
inspect and play with the experimental
aspects of the system it's in left clear
flow is saying get off the freeway going
north and get on the surface streets
while Matt point says stay on the
highway system this isn't work quite
well we formed a virtual team with the
product group over over a bing maps and
within a year and a half we fielded
clear flow across North America 272
cities so now if you have a windows
phone this is the default inference you
can also get it on maps bing.com if
you've resisted buying a windows phone
the the basic idea here is that it's
it's it's reasoning of every few minutes
we assign Road speeds to over 60 million
street segments across North America
with these probabilistic models learn
with machine learning what's kind of fun
about it it's like if you have a few
months ago when we first went on to the
Windows Phone one of the research the
research engineers on my team actually
the days Jason team came up to me and he
mentioned boy this is discovering my
secrets i'm not sure i won't give these
away where I get off the the freeway and
go around
get back on again and clear flow is
figuring all this out so you know it's
like doing this we'll see how that goes
as more users use the system and a thing
is to learn to adapt but it was a big
success story for us in actually getting
one of the largest applications of
machine learning out in the world and in
the hands of users today for a while
when frisky night was called clear flow
on on big maps not just called traffic
sensitive routing here's an example of
on the big maps here a key decision you
make in Seattle pride often is so I take
the bridge and if so which one and
secondarily do I go around the top and
see I don't forget to go from the east
side to Seattle and it's just as an
example of one day here which says oh
here's the here's the best route without
traffic 15 miles 24 minutes but 50
minutes coming from from clear flow
estimates in current traffic conditions
and if you click click on see best route
based on traffic it says you know I know
this is coming to it but go go over the
top and that basically will be 35
minutes and it's basically computing
that that would never be faster in you
know if you had good traffic but you
need to actually know how fast that is
going as well and we're in for doing
inferences across the whole road network
in Seattle let me now take go from that
case study to one in healthcare you do a
similar kind of sense for another
project that's moving from family might
say daily nuisances of getting from here
to there to some very very high stakes
and critical problems in health care so
we looked at said we look at several
problems in the health care area one of
which is the challenge of reducing
hospital readmissions where a patient
will be discharged from a hospital and
then when by definition these days
within 30 days is readmitted to the
hospital with the same problem this is
this has been a hot potato it's been in
the political world people talk about
well this is a sign that our medical
system really need to be fixed a couple
years ago
an article in the New England Journal of
Medicine analyzed data from 2004 and
they found from that Medicare data that
twenty percent of patients were bouncing
back within 30 days after discharge from
the hospital and thirty-five percent
within 90 days if you believe these
bounce backs are preventable which is
actually another question we can ask the
estimated cost of Medicare that year was
almost 17 and a half billion dollars for
the for the bounce back the care for the
bounce back so we basically got involved
working with a hospital in washington DC
area and very closely with that team
it's one of the top 10 urban hospitals
in the united states they've done a
remarkable job of collecting data for
over a decade and as an example they had
data on 300,000 emergency department ed
visits and the data is very very
detailed admissions discharge transfer
chief complaint free text age and gender
diagnostic codes even labs and results
medications vital signs procedures even
rooms people were in as they moved run
the hospital fees and billing about
25,000 variables are in this data set
it's a brooch a large data set we
thought we asked the question can I
build a model with the method I talked
about before search through this space
given the data with a machine learning
algorithm and build a predictive model
that can predict for example in this
case ed a patient is discharged from the
emergency department and bounces back
within two weeks and the variables
lighting up are the variables we find
are the indicators they help us
understand its gender it's like
diagnostic codes how many hours in the
hospital age and so on or for example
fast back within 30 days and understand
that beyond this kind of these kind of
respect a predictive model we can
actually run that predictive model the
way you do this is you say I'm going to
train up a classifier or a printed model
from data with a machine learning
algorithm from eighty percent of the
data often the first eighty percent and
then for the last twenty percent I'm
going to hold it out from the machine
learning algorithm not going to see it
in fact to the classifier or the
automatic method we build
from the machine learning we're going to
make believe the twenty percent hasn't
seen yet our new patients coming in to
give us a sense for how it's going to
look in the real world and that's what
we mean by this train and test we hold
out some test set there and then we
actually see how well it works and we
actually often build in many fields of
machine learning curves like this what
you see it here is the false positive
rate the x-axis and the true positive
rate and you can sort of pick up a
threshold and operate at different
points on this curve for example a
hospital might say okay I like this
point here I want to basically catch
capture all the patients or three
quarters of the patients on the y-axis
there in five percent or so that who
will bounce back within 30 days I
realized because everything nothing's
perfect I'm going to tolerate a
25-percent false positive rate people
that wouldn't have bounced back but I
thought there's still a flagged as risk
risky patients the other thing you get
besides testing a run-time classifier
that you can use is you can look at the
data here and the systems will tell us
these algorithms what are the important
variables so for example you might say
okay well in the emergency department we
do see many pregnant women who are
vomiting and they come in they're
nauseous that's a common occurrence
heart failure I highlighted here is
there is a recurrent challenge and but
we wouldn't have known without an
algorithm going through all the free
text in the in the patient records down
here that the patient records that
contain in the free text of the chief
complaint fluid the word fluid appearing
is a bad sign for staying out of the
hospital and the algorithm has figured
that out and it's using all the
information in the classifier you just
saw so this project has been very
intensive we've built many will say
numerous spective models for health care
including different kinds of discharge
within different parameters the
emergency folks like to say I want to
predict if this patient will bounce back
in three days with the same problem to
the emergency department death within 30
days in patient discharge too impatient
again in 30 days and then congestive
heart failure and also infection a
hospital-based infections
common problem to predict in advance
that patient will come down in the
hospital with one of these nasty bugs c
difficile mersa and VRE it's actually
itself in the top 10 causes of death
United States is hospital-associated
infections and very expensive we also
built new kinds of models remember
that's a prize model for traffic that I
talked to you about this is a surprise
model for for a confident physician so
what this is saying here you can't read
it all just to tell you in words here is
that this model will was trained on data
of the form and will predict patients of
the form this patient you're discharging
right now from the emergency department
will bounce back to the hospital in
three days with a primary diagnosis
nowhere on the current chart surprise oh
you want to look at what I think your
think the patient will come back in
three days with you can peek now if
you'd like and you can make mention
showing this to physicians and so again
it's you can imagine a confident vision
not wanting to look at the system and so
on but imagine telling the physician we
have a system that will compute the
likelihood that you've missed a
diagnosis here and even light up a flag
when this likely that goes high and it's
been fun working with the emergency
department positions on these kinds of
models and the patients that are that we
see that have this particular
composition / / the the outcome and have
them speculate why what happened I could
have so much you have seen it a mile
away was was with one of the classes of
patient and another one was boy I'm not
sure how that happened how we missed
that one and so you can imagine how this
goes it's a very interesting model to
think more about these kinds of models
in there in the real world not to tell
us things we know but to tell us things
we're likely don't know so we actually
just see you know but the back to back
to the story unfolding here we've showed
these models work well we work with our
health care team Microsoft amalga
product team to actually build what's
called readmissions manager forum Olga
and when you go to the real world we
face all interesting challenges for
example this engineering challenges well
you know you guys had thousands of
variables in your model you had you
could afford offline to to run these big
studies we have back you know real-time
needs we want to you know go over each
patient in half in hospital every few
minutes and update the probabilities for
various effective models so we had
basically back off and we look at these
curves that I mentioned you before and
look at how much do we lose by let's say
going down from 500 features down to 37
features for example understanding the
engineering trade-offs there so we went
live in June with the system our first
customer and the system actually trains
locally on data at local hospitals and
you see in this column here I just
highlighted here the probability that
those patients will bounce back with
sorting by that right now and to use
these two went out in the middle of
watching how these systems work in the
real world in fact not just that but we
actually are are the next phase of our
work is saying it's not just about the
probability it's what do you do about it
and this is a hole deep analysis we've
been engaged with going from the
predictions to the decisions and in fact
one of the approaches we're very excited
about is we can compute given this
training and test holdout data in a
hospital setting what's the expected
value of the system being immersed in a
legacy hospital by watching doing a
cost-benefit analysis on a holdout set
for example given a decision to invest
more in a patient with a who's at high
risk for bouncing back to the hospital
such as a post discharge special program
keeping them longer for observation and
so on these are all decision analyses
you can do dynamically and you can then
run the whole system and simulate what
it would do in the hospital with a
holdout set and get a sense for what we
call the expected value of the overall
system I've always been very excited
about this concept by the way of
characterizing the true genuine value of
a cut
occasional solution that's sitting in a
large complex environment I think that
gets to the heart of of you might say
even sexier artificial intelligence
projects why did this intelligence
evolve how can I make this robot better
than that robot and so on this is an
application in healthcare space so
speaking of these more exotic
applications I wanted to start off with
no transportation healthcare before I
dobe into richer applications that mesh
together vision and speech natural
language and this gets back to the area
that I mentioned a bit earlier
integrative intelligence with a nice
team in this space so with this with
work in this space the idea is to mesh
together natural language processing NLP
motion control speech generations pick
your addition planning learning vision
and inferential methods you might say
that the goal here is in part to build a
comprehensive systems with a whole is
somehow magically greater than the sum
of the parts and this is a kind of maybe
a dream of AI that if we bring together
a vision and speech natural language and
inverse kinds of reasoning and learning
that there'll be some synergies among
these components if you wove these
together weave them together in a in an
effective manner so our main project
what we're exploring this interactive AI
notion is called situated interaction
the idea is to have systems that can
reason about teams in the physical world
often you literally have you have
multi-party not it's a single user for
example like a team of surgeons in a
physical environment or I think maybe
the first way you'll see situated
interaction solutions in the world two
or three people in front of a billboard
and the billboard knows they're there
and gets a sense for who they are is it
a family for example or someday you'll
be pouring some yellow scituate
interaction system in your kitchen
you'll be working on a recipe and
system will say you can go ahead and
pour it now but very slowly here this is
a problem have your actions being
observed in having scaffolding being
provided by an intelligent chef for
example you know and I was like this
example like you come home from the
theater and you're very confident during
your your stay your date with your wife
or husband that you know the robot with
taking care of the kids things are going
just well back it was educational set up
goals that evening and you you knew that
you'd get called if there's a truck any
trouble you know at home or the neighbor
would have been called so it's not so
scary and this is the year twenty thirty
nine and it's really just okay and you
have a really great row button it's
fabulous with the kids and so with that
dream in mind we think about what we
might do so one project we had was
called is called the receptionist
project and we did was that I don't have
my mouse here to click on these videos
so Brad Weber mouse you'll trigger if
what's going get some audio there too
okay so we put up camera several cameras
with some disclaimers and signs in the
entryway to Microsoft Research these are
both 99 and you see the receptionist
here you're seeing some vision tracking
people ordering a shuttle people have
different tasks and so on we can make it
move ahead to the next slide here but
the idea basically was you think what
the problem faced by a receptionist at a
Microsoft building people are coming up
someone's a shuttle more people coming
together some people seem like they're
in a group maybe they need a single
shuttle maybe I'm here to visit somebody
and so we watched how receptionist
handle the multiple tasks of a limited
domain but fairly complicated in terms
of the the humanity and you and
understanding you would need to get
through this well do a good job with
this and this led to us sticking through
componentry in terms of software and
hardware we need to come up with even
the basic competencies of seeing one or
more people
engaging them tracking goals of various
kinds listening and understanding with
speech was coming from and this led to
our first prototype we call the
receptionist and we're actually believe
it or not getting ready where near ready
to feel this at one of our buildings for
real not to take over all receptionist
sponsibilities but to start with some
key tasks like handling shuttles for
example in a very natural way for not
just single people for groups of people
and and we may be a sense for how this
this works I'll show you a short piece
of a video and if I stop it you know
before I get to the anklets on waste too
much time on that we sort it up about a
year and a half ago when we first
developed the system because i want to
say show people where we've taken this
now and what would let that roll the red
dot is the actual gaze of the of the
news is we have a little lower they're
coming onto the project on your project
SP that's her gaze and you see we're
looking at the hi my name is laura and
today I'm he remembers properties net
with shuttle reservations what's your
name I'm dying this is eric watch on the
right side mask she meet you do you need
a shuttle yes which building are you
going to I forget where are we going I
think it's building nine you sure yes so
you're going to nine right yes and this
is for both of you right yes I'm making
the shuttle reservation for building 9
42 people in case you want to correct
anything say or press star over the
system looking at attention you visiting
someone yes I think I'll help you
register in just a moment okay excuse me
sir yes so the system is getting it is
actually working with multiple parties
it's under actually when that third
person walked in the system actually did
this to that person and came back to us
so it said I know you're here and then
it it when it watched our attention and
so these things are very subtle issues
to watch people's attention and
understand that you can now look away
and work with somebody else while people
are talking for example we did a bunch
of work on making the system better in
terms of the nuances of how it deals
with a group setting we have a trivia
game we created where the system plays a
host of a trivia game and people engages
multiple people call it had did a number
of studies with people from the outside
world coming in to help us I'll give you
a quick sense of how this works is for a
little bit of this video tiny bit of it
yes question look in the only country
with a one color flag when color is it
grain do you think things yes that's
right so farting at one correct answer
now on to the next question in the u.s.
in hospitals have a red from what sign
do they use in the air at room
solid blue circle is that okay no so
what before answers red crescent moon
yes so just now when that that young man
said yes she just looked at him in and
raised her eyebrow like okay and we have
a view from the machine but it's very
interesting all the jest all the nuances
the system is looking at understand the
pacing and control even understanding
someone's talking to themselves not say
the system is this a challenge problem
we put this trivia system he actually is
up on our third floor right now around
the hall around by this clock the area
people walk by and people will come over
to the system and now play with this we
watch them and record them and over
their permission and it's very
interesting interesting to watch and see
how this all goes lots of ice footage
showing how people get engaged and so on
in this case one person i won't play the
video now but one person is playing and
he gets a couple questions wrong and
system says I think you need bit of help
hang on a second hey can you help this
guy and he's here in joins in its very
just to watch so that work led to a
really fun project will we get even
deeper with the embedding of multiple
components called the personal assistant
and this is by my door and I actually
use this rely upon this daily the idea
is to is it now layer in multiple
components a number of which we've built
on other projects over the years in fact
several of these components work
projects in themselves for example
coordinate since 2002 I've had the
coordinate server doing machine learning
and reasoning about where I am and how
long until I get there if I'm not there
yet it's fabulous in fact the system
actually shows you a little some of the
inferences it's making at a particular
moment it's saying well I'm speaking
right now near in my office but I'll
probably stand speaking in six minutes
and I'll be home and a few hours and
still at work I'm available on these
channels here and so on I'm talking
again i'll be reading email in three
minutes it actually very good with that
it's really funny how good it is what i
get back to email again so these
inferences have
used by a number of projects we've had
to do coordination among people and so
on it computes how busy I am at any
moment and that's one of several
components running in the assistant now
let me just run this video to give you a
sense for how the assistant works by my
door handling my scheduling and people
coming to see me okay okay okay oh are
you looking for air yes are you Dan and
hope yes talk to calendar I'm is virtual
admin I know he had meetings in tune
with your budget late from his previous
meeting in building 34 he's no longer on
his laptop so I expect he'll be back in
ten minutes or so you can go ahead and
wait although if you'd like Oh we'll
come back in a minute okay i'll make
sure to let you know when you return
alright thanks so he's Jeff hello hi I'm
you're looking for errant yes jared is
having an impromptu chat right now but I
expect it should be over in around 10
minutes would you like to wait for a bit
sure sounds good he shouldn't be too
long yes I'll figure later them by mine
come on hey I'm here looking for that
yes I'm here for the chin upon meeting
with Carrie yes are you band Liebling
yes I am great here I've been expecting
you will you be joining the meeting yes
all right I'd let her know you'll be
joining his meeting with then if you
don't mind waiting around for a few more
minutes I'm sure you and love you in
shortly yes I'll see you later them by
mine very fine so I'm gonna move ahead
but there's several other scenarios here
that are a lot of fun um I'm here
looking for Eric yes here is busy
working the project at the moment so
let's move ahead you'll see in a second
how the busyness is fabulous and it was
quite well I'll show you about that
abducted but but that in a second enough
separate project Fatima recognizes me
when I walk up it'll it will say hi Eric
and give me a quick vote down if who
came by and someone when I'm the way
into my office I get email from the
assistant it's fabulous it so I my
comment is this if this is the kind of
the ENIAC vacuum tube error for this
kind of technology in 20 years I can't
imagine living without the system I
should say that it's not just those
kinds of embedded applications by a door
if you can run this video we have a
third-generation elevator project using
the same platform you saw by my office
but now we're watching people in the
lobby of building 99 and we're ordering
elevators for them so that when they get
to the elevator it's there or the doors
stay open by themselves I often tell
people that it's so 20th century to have
to stick your door y-your your leg in a
door to keep it open it's like can it
see that this is what I want in the
kinect era elevator should be very
bright about that it's indoors and
trains and subways and someone this
gonna be a major application I think
just a ambient application our kids our
grandkids will see movies where people
had to put the are minted elevator doors
and they'll say what was that all about
mom
I've shirred that by the way it would
seem so odd so I just let me saw em with
some directions before we go to question
and answer first of all a big area that
goes hand in hand with machine learning
is visualization a few years ago we
built the system called notification
platform that would assign urgency
scores automatically learn to assignment
scores of how urgent something was to
email account tasks alerts calendar
items now so how do i display all these
we came up with a visualization called
the Microsoft Research scope and the
idea here is that for items in along
different dimensions here email calendar
tasks the closer to the center of the
scope the more urgent so you can sort of
look at these you can hover over these
items and see what they are and they get
closer and culture to ground zero during
the day if they give their urgent
they're late or they fade away if
they're growing less surgeons so but
more generally the point here is that
not just particular visualization it's
often the case that we want to really
inspect understand the inferences from
intelligences and in such as machine
learning and reasoning and one way to
communicate with people is too rich
visualizations that are designed for
people now on that front an area that
we're kind of excited about it captures
a thematic area of research in our group
oh I mentioned mentioned at the
introduction we call complementary
computing basic idea is this you can
look at 20 20th century color psychology
as largely defining people as very
powerful intellects but with very very
regular and characterized bowl deficits
might say things that we don't do
extremely well like multi task for
example if you look at the this little
blob here as representing our abilities
where abilities and efficiencies of how
I do tasks on the y-axis here and these
are well-known character
well-characterized gaps there's a kind
of a dream that couldn't computational
systems learn about not just not just
about gaps across humanity the human
cognitive substrate but even personalize
gaps
and expand and extend our ability Othman
tower cognition and we've had efforts in
different areas of cog psych attention
judgment memory as separate projects
that you can weave together someday and
we've talked about it a couple of them
briefly but there's a promise that
sensing learning and reasoning will
provide this kind of extension systems
that really no mines well one area we
did a lot of research in we sort of were
leaders in the academic community in can
I figure out what what's the cost of
interruption of a user right now in a
system to sensing and given incoming
important messages some less important
than others understand how to manage
alerts and information such that people
could basically trade off the value of
focus of attention with the cost of
deferred processing of information
building triaging systems like that and
this is a little model here we built
from training data of a system called
busybody that you trained up during a
training phase and then with watch
you're working on desktop or in your
office and understand at any moment
what's the cost of interrupting you by
the way my personal assistant calls my
personal busybody model so any moment it
knows how much money i'd be willing to
pay to avoid in an interruption of type
x and it's great to be sitting in my
office working in my desk and have that
system calling this model and I hear
this assistant the hallway saying Eric's
real busy right now can you come back to
make ten minutes we'll try again and
actually I'm really were questioned on a
deadline and I'm i'm done with it and
says you can go ahead now it's fine and
these models are to meet our papers are
quite well calibrated to what people
would call sense that they're too busy
to be to be interrupted at any momentum
a particular time and they can run in
the background as add as components you
can add into software here's a system on
the memory side that actually learns
with machine learning what a landmark
event is so imagine training up models
which the system does called life
browser that assigns a probability that
any photo collection any web browse
document on desktop
or appointment would be considered a
landmark lets you search over in my case
20 years of information with a volume
control of sorts that takes all your
stuff in this case my appointments for a
segment of time and shows you the most
important ones and then lets you slide a
volume control see more and more and to
search to full-text search against those
landmarks called life browser pharmagen
another direction here is that many
applications won't be so in-your-face as
my assistant for example or the giggling
like yes it's not so fluid yet it's kind
of stilted and much if I want a floating
head by my door yeah I mean a lot of a
lot of machine learning is going to be
embedded into the infrastructure and
background for example for everybody
using Windows 7 laptops and Windows 8 if
you're using the preview yet you're
using our machine learning code which is
doing something called super fetch so in
the background super fetch is learning
about the sequence in which you use
applications by time of day and day of
week and it's learning to prefetch apps
in the background that are likely to be
launched next or soon with a
cost-benefit analysis given some
available memory so that much snappier
and even faster and which was different
about this project was we built the
system I wanted to test it and we said
can we test the system that with beta
users when a few years back and right
away we say okay how will we doing the
same okay well here's a million in a you
know hundred twenty-two million app
launches across users how well are we
doing we can see how well we're
predicting from our swim data for
volunteers using windows 7 i'm not going
to dwell long we may have some time in
the end talk about machine learning and
privacy issues I think there's it's a
very hot topic for us we're moving in
this in this in this area with
seriousness I'm very excited that
there's much we can do in this space not
just grab
data and have you click on a balloon
that says we're now grabbing at all
thank you goodbye this quite a bit we
can do in this in this world one area is
called protected sensing personalization
let me talk about that a little bit so
the idea basically is to say imagine if
data mining and analysis on your behalf
took place in the sanctity of your own
machine so your own machine is getting
GPS data euro your Cardinals big your
GPS data nobody else does and miles are
built that are then used on your behalf
in real time all within again the
sanctity of your multiple machines in
there there are many applications with
this no reason to share your data with
the world and things work just fine as
an example we have a project called
personalized search or a piece search
and the idea is you go the system
analyzes your desktop completely so but
you know but it's all internal we don't
know data is shared out anywhere your
email your documents your web activity
and we actually have a personalized
result rancor so when you go to do a
search like Lumiere for example which is
a project at Microsoft Research the
search engine call goes out and brings
back a whole bunch of search results
like 400 and then in the quietness and
the privacy of your own client machine
resource them based on its analysis of
what you want given really a close touch
with your data in this case you can sort
and bring up to the top what I'm looking
for not Lumiere the brother is in Paris
but but Lumiere the project so let me
stop they'll just say that I was going
to take some questions and answers that
applications of this technology sensing
learning and reasoning AI still in its
very much in its infancy I foresee and
precedent evaluated people in society
and at Microsoft Research we typically
pursue principles through applications
we love shipping products to get
experience with them and enhancing
people's lives but we often get back to
questions and principles again in a
cycle like this so I'll I'll stop there
and take your questions
