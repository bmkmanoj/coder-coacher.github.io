turns an ordinary mobile phone into a
real-time 3d scanner this requires no
additional hardware and uses only the
RGB camera available on most mobile
devices this allows the user to capture
a full 3d model of an arbitrary object
in seconds the computation happens
purely on the phone and the final free D
models are detailed enough for 3d
printing use in augmented reality games
and for instant 3d capture for sharing
with friends and colleagues under the
hood the system first densely tracks the
device in 3d by comparing the live RGB
data with the previous frames it will
take the current live frame and perform
efficient stereo matching to compute a
depth map these stereo depth maps are
then merged into a single free D mesh
model the 3d model is built live in
front of the users eyes this allows the
user to instantaneously see how complete
the scan is and whether critical parts
are missing as the object is captured
from all angles the free D model gets
refined and completed once satisfied
with the scan the user can view share or
print the 3d model instantaneously this
research project can allow any mobile
device to turn into a real-time 3d
scanner we show our method working with
an existing data set used to compare to
the state of the art system from cvpr
2014 note how our model is incrementally
built in real-time and the detailed
surface geometry is refined over time
our system performs dents camera
tracking stereo matching volumetric
fusion and surface extraction at 25
Hertz the final reconstructions are
shown here as seen on the left our
system can reconstruct detailed dense
surface geometry instead of a semi dense
point cloud it is also able to complete
the scan at faster speeds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
