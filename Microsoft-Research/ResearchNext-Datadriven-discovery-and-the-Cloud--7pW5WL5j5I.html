hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
can just
I'm based here in the Cambridge lab and
we've actually got a quite a big global
program around cloud computing working
with the research community we call it a
draw for research and he sell website
and our twitter twitter handle there so
i want to give you a few sort of
highlights of what we've been seeing so
far you saw earlier today what we're
doing sort of inside the data centers
and how MSR is helping with that and
this is more kind of working with the
external community with the university
sort of academic community but you'll
see a lot of these applications that
actually do have very much of industry
relevance as well so when we think about
this idea of discovery and we go back
and we think about how we actually do
that then in olden days scientists like
here Leonardo DaVinci or galilea would
observe what was happening in nature so
this is a sketch from da Vinci's notes
of flow past the river so he was
understanding how you know Eddie's form
and and sort of thinking about what
those implications were and so we sort
of think of that as a sort of first
paradigm of scientific discovery but
then how do we take those observations
and do useful things with them one of
the Great's of the gifts that we have
now is mathematics and this is the the
navier-stokes equations which actually
describe that flow that da Vinci was
looking at and so that allows us to
really sort of drill in a bit like you
know jasmine was showing you know the
beauty of mathematics is that we can
actually build models and that helps our
understanding of the world but sometimes
as with this model in this equation you
can't solve it so there's actually a
math prize in order to prove that this
model has a unique solution for you know
complex problems nobody has actually
proved that you can solve this equation
and come to a unique solution however
that doesn't stop us from using that
equation to do things such as weather
forecasting climate prediction designing
cars and aircraft I before I came to
Microsoft Research a few years ago
worked at Southampton University into
aerospace engineering and worked with
Formula One teams on how to design cars
better in the wind tunnel but also on
supercomputers and so you know very much
recall that so a third paradigm of
computational science computational
simulation and we think of that as
state-of-the-art
and certainly like said working formula
1 teams I have these huge clusters and
they run you know these simulations
every every unit every hour of every
minute to try and optimize their cars
and you know the Met Office is running
weather forecasts you know that we can
see so that you know state the art
supercomputing we think of sort of
heroic science but we're moving into
this world of what we call data-driven
discovery and so Jim Gray who is one of
our researchers who was into essentially
big data but a long time ago coined this
phrase the fourth paradigm of
data-driven discovery and he worked with
a lot of different communities and
what's interesting is we think about
that scientific discovery process or any
sort of X sort of project we generally
sort of have some sort of idea a
hypothesis a question we're trying to
answer we might you know get some data
do some modeling and then we sort of
work with our colleagues to sort of
understand that we might then do some
analysis and some data mining and then
typically will disseminate and share
that in the academic world that's
typically a publication and then that
goes to a journal and it gets archives
so that other people can access it and
so that is essentially the sort of
research lifecycle but with this idea of
data-driven discovery a real enabler is
if we share the data because if we share
the data inside our teams outside our
teams globally you know as jasmine said
you know with a thousand researchers
working on C elegans doing that sharing
it opens up opportunities for other
people to contribute they can pull the
data and do new things with it okay
there's a saying sort of within the open
data community that says the best
phenomenal use of your data is going to
be by somebody else okay because they
can come and look at it with fresh eyes
and say hey there's a brand new
opportunity here the company's that's
hopefully going to happen inside your
company but if you pull in data from
elsewhere you can have you know really
kind of have these step changes and what
you can do and so actually we publish
this book before paradigm actually about
five years ago and if you read it it's
freely available on the website there
you can download it for your kindle
there's PDF versions etc those essays
around data-driven discovery are so
relevant today when we start talking
about big data data side
internet of things when we look at that
book and read it I sort of laugh and I
cry because in some ways brilliant we've
done that and now that we've made no
progress so so that's a really
interesting read to sort of gay to think
about that and Jim he worked initially
with the astronomy community and he did
that because the date is worthless and
what he actually meant was that the data
was priceless because it's there and
it's free and we all share and we look
in the look at the heavens and we can
enjoy that but what he meant was there's
no true sort of commercial value there's
no intrinsic commercial value in that
data at least in an immediate sense so
he could look at this without worrying
about legal copyright you know licensing
issues and they could look at it from a
more technical basis and when he worked
with the Astronomy community what they
were doing with a project called the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey which was the
first sort of digital camera pointed at
the sky so the Astronomy community
really advanced developed you could say
almost invented the digital camera
insensitive they built this huge sensor
and they did the first digital map of
the night sky and what Jim did is he
worked the team and helped develop the
system to make that freely available on
the internet and by doing that he you
know face these challenges and when you
start working with other communities
will talk about environmental science
community in a moment he found that they
encountered these same problems and I
think when we go and talk you know with
companies like yourselves these problems
are probably fairly familiar in terms of
you know how do we manage data how do we
describe data how do we share data how
do we create and maintain that data in
the long term except when Jim wrote this
a petabyte was a big deal it's not a big
deal today in reality now some of the
systems we have are in the you know
hundreds of petabytes exabytes now we're
talking about exabytes you know think
about a large hadron collider the big
new project is the Square Kilometre
Array and they're looking at three
exabytes of data so it moves on the data
volumes increase but actually the the
problems remain and when we think about
that in the context of what we now talk
about Big Data you know Gartner you know
came up with sort of 3 v's of data and
we look at that from a scientific
context but acts
in your words i think you know you might
identify with this the fact that you
have you know what i call big science
here Large Hadron Collider Square
Kilometre Array big teams of scientists
thousands tens of thousands of
scientists who work together they can
bring together build their own systems
to manage this problem then we have mere
mortals down here who sit in their labs
in their offices with their spreadsheets
you know out in the field measuring
counting on their notebooks and and
they're starting to have to worry about
this data problem as sense has become
more pervasive and then the people in
the middle genomics is interesting
financial research is interesting in
terms of they sit in the middle there
are opportunities here but a lot of
people sit over here and how do we
actually bridge that gap and that's
where we've been working a lot with the
research community and also you know
looking at cloud computing and how that
can play a role so if we think about
data and drew we'll talk about this
later on you know we look at the world
around us and we go and try and
understand the world around us we go and
measure it okay we might go and count
Birds we might go and measure you know
chlorophyll in the ocean so we might fly
drones with cameras satellite data this
huge variety of data how do we actually
do anything with that and that's really
a problem that we see in all the
sciences actually but I think this
picture illustrates it quite well and
the problem is how do we turn all of
those numbers all of those bits into
something useful and usable so this
information ladder is actually from the
sort of hydrology community where we can
we'd spend a lot of effort managing the
data but turning it into something
that's actionable that we can make
decisions about is the real challenge
and I think when we talk about Big Data
we taught when we talk about Big Data
people often talk about the volume and
the size and that's not really the
problem the problem is how do we get to
the top of the ladder and that's where
you know we've been working with the
research community on that because
what's interesting when we think about
data and I borrow this slide from Don
sign his are F sharp architect meaning a
lot of work out on data with extract I
providers is we're swimming in water you
know data's everywhere and we're
drowning in in data
nobody really knows the cost of that
nobody knows the value of that nobody
really likes to pay for it you know
bottled water you know we can get out of
the tap why should we pay for it we
definitely don't know how much water is
wasted okay that's a real big problem
saying with data and then the real
problem is you really don't know if
you've drunk bad water until it's too
late and it's the same with data okay so
so on that subject and sort of moving on
to the cloud this is a project actually
that colleagues and reading did with the
environment agency and a problem there
again was around this data aggregation
data dissemination and so the
environment agency has river gauges all
around the country and they get updated
every 15 minutes and then that all goes
into a predictive model with all the
weather models from the met office and
then they predict where there's going to
be floods in the future and they had a
problem of how do you do that in the
time when everybody's hitting your
website and previously the Environment
Agency the website didn't cope very well
with a load so we worked with them on
the website side and then with this
company shoot Hill worked on how to make
this flood data available so it's called
flood alerts openly in this map is from
februari when if you remember it was
quite wet and you can see how it does
sort of essentially real-time mapping
interestingly it is also the government
UK government's first facebook app but
by leveraging the cloud they could
actually make that available without any
fear of it collapsing under the load
this is another project this is one that
we're supporting under our actual
program with Newcastle University in its
actual building a flood assessment
platform it's actually with scottish
water stuff like the UK and they want to
have a system where they can model well
they go 100-year events events what
happen once in a hundred years and
they've done it for newcastle this is a
model for london it's very high
resolution model it takes in the
topography data it takes in the building
footprints and then critically i also
have a 1d drainage model so it models
the drainage system and you can see
where we get floods and so they can use
this as a planning tool but using the
cloud they can do this on de ma
and they can deliver it into the offices
as a web app essentially and it's really
allowing to run lots of simulations very
effectively that they couldn't do before
on their own system so there's a website
there on that so that's a really good
example where they had this idea they
had the model which needed quite a lot
of grunt to run the model so that was
one part how do we run the model but
critically how do we make that available
just like with the flood alert system
how do we make that available easily
another project we've done with the
Irish Marine Institute where he gave
them one of these as rewards to do
essentially a data portal but they've
been able to do lots of things when I
talk to people about cloud I've just
been in Amsterdam at a meeting around
research data talk about two things
really agility and capability the
agility to be able to experiment deploy
very quickly tear down and then
capability to scale and so they had an
urgent operational requirement to deploy
a website it's a consortium they had
some event coming up and they could
immediately deploy their website for the
Institute they then had to share a bunch
of data so see can is a very popular
open source platform for used for data
UK and lots of open government data
programs and we have these virtual
machines these Linux virtual machines on
agile as was our cloud by the way and
they could deploy that see can portal
which previously you know the
installation steps was relatively
painful but they could deploy that very
quickly they could deploy a tool which
took some of their data in bespoke
formats put a web front end on it
visualize it very quickly and then
they've also worked with us on until
we've developed in-house called fetch
climate that allows you to take lots of
different types of data geospatial data
but present it to the user in a very
usable way so here we've got sea surface
height but we have things like air
temperature sea temperature and rather
than querying against the air
temperature university of east anglia
climate research unit data set which is
in a bespoke format that you need a
month to understand that format extract
it re grid it we've used a draw on the
back end to store that data but then
also do live processing so that the user
just has to draw a box on the map and
say on air temperature 2005 to 2006
every monday
between 12 and two and it automatically
goes and does that fetch and returns in
a few seconds so it shows how we've gone
up that ladder to turn the data into
something truly usable and we did play
that we've open source the front end for
that and they've managed to pick that up
and use it this is an interesting
project at the University of Washington
with Patrick McCready called live ation
and it's all about oysters so it turns
out that as the oceans become more
acidic oysters find it more difficult to
grow their shells and in in Washington
state in one of the bays there it turns
out the seven out of ten oysters and us
come from that Bay but it's really
suffering environmentally and so
Patrick's got some funding from the
University of from Washington State to
build out some tools to help them manage
the oyster farms so really important in
terms of sort of economics for the state
but for the whole of oyster industry in
the US and what he does is the
aggregates lots of data from different
sources and run these predictive models
a bit like the environment agency but
sort of slightly bigger models and here
you can see an animation of some of the
results from that metal now typically
what you'd do if you you know the
scientist is this would be it you know
we publish it we put the you know avi
wmv MV file up and that's it and nobody
can interrogate it and it's a very sort
of whilst it's interesting because it's
animated it's relatively static in terms
of what you can do with it but Patrick
wanted something Parker wanted something
much more interactive and so he worked
with us on this live ocean system there
we go which is a web web page let's go
back I can sit on there
okay and so it's a web page basically
which displays this and allows you to
query and again draw boxes and download
some of the data sets and some of the
things you can do are things like
on-demand computation so you can draw a
box and say I need a higher resolution
simulation of that area and it will go
to the cloud it will spin up another 100
machines whatever run that simulation
return the results rather than you
having to go back run a Python script or
MATLAB script you know for super
computer etc it's all done through a web
front-end the other interesting thing it
can do is on demand particle tracing so
this would be quite useful for instance
for monitoring oil spills and you could
do that on demand and the claddagh gives
you that scalability which and the
usability for that sort of system and so
yeah it goes back so that's the sort of
web page it's still being developed but
he saw that the is a hybrid solutions
he's running the simulation the main
simulation on his local linux cluster
with a couple of hundred cause but using
the cloud in order to do the data
distribution and then the on-demand
post-processing so it's a very good sort
of optimal solution for him to use the
cloud so on that subject as well one of
the things that we've been using and
it's a derivative from a microsoft
research project called worldwide
telescope is a full dimensional
geospatial mapping tool that allows you
to put in longitude latitude time
columns of data and hit play and then
you can animate on a map heat maps bar
charts bubble charts and what's great
with this tool is it's called XL so this
is a something that came out of our
worldwide telescope project in MSR that
transferred into the office team and it
just makes it really easy again for you
to do those visualizations and you can
point to the clouds so you can point to
results coming out the Hadoop cluster a
sequel database open data on the way of
a JSON endpoint and then you can
aggregate all of that data and your
canvas is essentially just excel so that
is again one of the things we did in MSR
with worldwide telescope and we work
with the Excel team who thought that
this was a great way of doing four
dimensional geospatial interrogation of
data so are our program as well for
research we've given out these projects
towards
to about 350 different projects around
the world and what we're doing is we're
working with agile product team to pull
together some of that information
because we're getting all these
fantastic use cases like with Parker
that hybrid use case is a really
interesting one and so we're using this
program to learn with what people can do
with cloud and how we can pull together
data combined it with models and climb
up that information ladder so what next
so our kind of view of the world really
is this pyramid and again when I speak
to people who work in companies they
sort of identify with this pyramid where
you have some super high capability
systems at the top where you have some
sort of gurus and wizards and experts
who can use it and and you can get a lot
of great value out of that and then you
have departments who then build out
their own systems but then you have the
majority of your users or researchers
out who can't necessarily take advantage
of that but are starting to hit some of
these problems on data access data
volume speed and so what with the cloud
we see it's a good opportunity to not
get rid of all of these systems but be
able to combine them in a way that's
very very usable by everyone up and down
in this community and that's where again
with our research program we're trying
to stimulate that with the academic
community but what you'll see later on
today with withdrew purvis is how within
MSR we're actually already here looking
at some of these big challenges that we
face on the planet play so with that I'd
like to thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
