hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
thanks so much for coming my name is Amy
graves and I'm delighted to welcome Matt
Parker to the Microsoft Research
visiting speaker series matt is here to
discuss his book things to make and do
in the fourth dimension which seeks to
reconnect us with the numbers around us
he is the stand up mathematician and can
be seen talking about math on TV in
newspapers on stages across the UK he is
the public engagement in mathematics
fellow at Queen Mary University in
London and co-founder of the festival of
the spoken nerd please join me and give
him a very warm welcome come down come
down okay that was very efficient coming
down so thank you all very much for
coming along to my talk and thank you
kindly everyone who bought the books
apparently they've sold out of books so
that concludes my presentation today so
I think I'm still contractually obliged
to hang around and actually do the talk
and if you didn't get a book that's fine
I'll still be around after this if you
have questions you want to come and see
me and oh that's my email address so if
at the end if you don't want to take
notes as we go along you can just send
me an email and I'll give you a copy of
the lecture handout sent off technically
a joke and that's the website for the
book which is bordering on up and
running it's all it's all coded I've
just got it I'm having written the copy
so that will be up before you know it oh
yeah and this so Amy very correctly gave
me my full title well done that very few
people get that correct so I'm based at
a university in East London and I'm only
there part-time I do one day a week and
my role there is the public engagement
in mathematics fellow because I was
allowed to write my own job title and
and so my work there involves training
the academics and the undergraduates to
communicate math to other humans and the
rest of my time is spent doing anything
I can to get more people more excited
about mathematics I used to be a high
school math teacher so back in the day I
taught math to young people
and I'm from Australia originally but I
have an English accents that's fine and
I moved to London about a decade ago to
teach teach math and I was working in a
few local schools in London I gradually
started to drift away from being a
standard classroom teacher so actually I
went first of all I went and worked for
a university for a while I worked for an
education company for a little bit and
then after a while I started to get
nostalgic for the classroom so actually
I went back I did went back in six
months in inner London like a pop it in
a city state school and let's just clear
that right up
and at the end of that like I've done so
since then I still probably one day a
week is still working with schools one
day weeks at the University I do
festival the spoken nerd so I do a lot
of math stand-up I guess is the way to
put it so for a while I worked part time
teaching like I was teaching math two
changes during the day and then
part-time as a stand-up so I was telling
jokes to drunk people in comedy clubs at
night which is a surprisingly similar
skill set to be honest and after all you
know you can confiscate drunk people's
phones it's brilliant but after a while
I I realized what I really enjoyed doing
was doing the very very nerdy stand
obsessed with things like crystal spoken
nerd which is three of us who do we're
all stand-ups who enjoy science or math
based things and the rest of my time is
writing doing bits of radio little bits
of TV most of it's in the UK the small
of us from the BBC
I do infinite monkey cage which is a
Radio 4 programme with some chump called
Brian Cox and I got a show on discovery
at the moment which means no one is
watching it's outrageous acts of science
season 3 coming soon and oh I do love
work on on YouTube so if I look familiar
but in higher resolution than normal
I'm on the numberphile Channel on
YouTube and I get to talk about maths
and numbers and all sorts of great
things which is good fun and anyway so
all of this will reappear at the end of
the talk oh and the book is called
things to make and do in the fourth
dimension but I thought it'd be a bit
mean to come all the way down here and
make you listen to me talk about things
that you then need to buy the book for
and so I'm gonna be doing the wildly
different
Hauk things to see in here in the fourth
dimension which is just me talking for
approximately half an hour and you all
listening quietly so that's pretty much
the plan oh and we are going to do some
math that's not an idle threat I should
make that very clear in fact you know
we'll stop we'll start with a bit of
performance math can everyone who
brought your calculators with you could
you take those out now really anyone all
phones are you going for phones some of
you opening up Wolfram Alpha well done
okay so whatever your calculation device
or aid of choice is I'm gonna be doing a
quick performance stunt for you so I
want you do is to put any two-digit
number you fancy into your calculation
devices I then want you to find the cube
of that two-digit number if you're doing
this with friends and family afterwards
if you're doing with school kids what
you very carefully say put in two digits
multiply them by the same two digits and
then multiply them by the same two
digits the third time and then hit
equals if you're not careful you get a
fourth power if you're very careful you
should get the third power of that
two-digit number and what you're doing
is the kind of long tedious part of math
this mean this is why we have
calculators to speed this up the fun
part of math is what you can do with the
answer is there anyone who's repaired to
share the answer on their screen someone
who's cute
okay a sir here what else have you got
on your screen 195,000 112 okay you had
to put in 58 and then cube that okay if
I get them right instead of silent
nodding okay a thumbs up is a step in
the right direction
how about right so in fact so forget
them right can you go wow that was a the
thumbs up is optional but still highly
recommended yes a concise yes and I get
them right okay is anyone else got an
answer okay over here three hundred
fourteen thousand or 132 you put in the
68 one off the most hilarious option
available thank you and just with school
kids every time think they're delicate
flowers anyway I'll do three more and
then if I get all three correct you
burst into the appropriate proportion of
applause okay so we're three okay what
don't
wait I won't remain calm from income in
asset you can't Eugene your friend to
help quick wait wait wait wait wait wait
perfect I need two more hold the ring
calm okay
are there two more people who are gonna
join now I got one there who's there
who's who's barely holding it back okay
I've got one over here and then done
okay well good - I like triangles right
so we're gonna go you and then you and
then you if I get all three only if I
get all three correct
okay right here we go what if you got so
good at six hundred fifty eight thousand
five hundred and three eighty seven good
3375 good thing and that's fine
so now I've not I've not just memorized
every single two-digit number cubed well
I should make that very clear I've I
have a lot of free time but not quite
that much nor am i doing a difficult
calculation if anyone knows this that
trick it's a fairly straightforward bit
of performance math where all I've done
is I've looked at the answers you get
when you cube two-digit numbers and
there are two patterns that appear in
the answers one pattern gives you the
first digit of the starting number and
the other pattern gives you the second
digit so all I'm doing as you're reading
the numbers out is I'm scanning them for
those two patterns and they tell me what
the two digits are and so that is
actually fairly straightforward mental
arithmetic it doesn't require much
thinking it's much more impressive than
it should be which is why I'm not going
to explain it so I am going to try
something that is a lot more complicated
to do so even if you know how this one
is done you should be still slightly
impressed we'll see here we go for this
one you do not need a calculation device
but I need someone who has is prepared
to read out a product they have possibly
in a can which has a barcode on it so I
need someone who's got an item with a
standard North American barcode on it
and they're happy to read out the digits
of that barcode is that I'm not going to
use the book sir nothing personal okay
it is slightly because it's not my book
is it but I will explain what
I think some of you know why I'm not
gonna use the book because anyone else
got something that's come from a wreath
okay what beverage is that diet dr.
pepper okay have it look at the barcode
because it may have come in a multipack
have you got a don't to me what they are
have you got a tiny digit to the left of
the lines
that's not think that a tiny digit to
the right okay well get this want to go
this should work what I'm gonna get you
to do is to read out the digits of that
but in a second very very slowly and do
not tell me the final digit so when we
get right to the end just say there's
one more I'm gonna calculate what it is
if I get it right you say Wow everyone
goes bananas all right here we go just
to be clear the last digit is the ones
to the right yes the little one off to
the right so you start with a little
lonely one off to the left all the ones
underneath not the one off to the right
okay I'm just getting in the math zone
come you go be focused all right okay
right so all right first digit is 0 okay
0 give me a second all right got it next
digit 7 hang on yep 7 yep 8 uh hang on a
second
yep 3 yep - yep yep 0 yep 1 did you look
it's a 7 okay that's alright cause they
were else co-products I know I suspect
that it has been bulk purchasing like a
catering pack it was a lot shorter than
I was expecting I think no we're not
gonna we're not gonna return to that
because I'm trying to it again it just
this will get embarrassing wait you just
will get more embarrassing does anyone
else got an item they've bought in Amyas
can look like I gave that to you before
we started that's okay
put it what is that Xbox controller what
you on brand sir well done okay so can
you have a look at the it now that's the
code that will be scanned in a shop and
it's got little digits to the left and
the right okay let's give it a go oh and
if you finished that she's hiding now if
you finished that Kat and I won't have a
look at it afterwards and see see where
I went wrong okay here we go so can you
start little on the left
license
hello I'll work out the one on the right
okay here we go here we go okay ready
eat okay so the eights off by itself on
the side you'll give me a second yep got
it so there's two eights okay yep five
yep three yep seven yep zero yep eight
yep
one yep four yep one yep six lustige is
a three I think I brought your applause
down slightly to punish me for how long
that song okay so I know what I'm doing
those of you know what I'm attempting to
do there is of course a check digit in
all bar codes and so all the numbers
that are being read out if you're not
come across check digits all the ones
being read out of the actual product
code and the final digit is put there to
put a mathematical pattern into that bar
code and the pattern if you want to
learn to do this if you want to be as
cool at parties as I am
the pattern is as someone's reading at
the bar code you need to add together
every second digit so you start with the
first digit you add it to the third one
the fifth one all the way down once
you've maced to sum every second digit
you multiply that subtotal by three and
then you go back and add on the other
digits you skipped and if you add every
second digit followed by three add the
other digits the grand total is always a
multiple of ten and so the missing digit
is you know you're slightly more
impressed the missing digit is whatever
you need to get up to the next whole
multiple of ten
of course I've streamlined it slightly
so I'm alternate if you watch my foot at
the front is ticking backwards and
forwards that's me keeping track of if I
have to multiply by three or not as I'm
adding to the total and then I'm just
keeping track of what I need to get up
to the next multiple of ten and so the
calculation my head ended in a three so
I knew it must be a seven to bring it up
to the next hole multiple of ten and I
think this is fantastic because most
people have no idea that this math is
going on in the background whenever they
buy a product they have no idea when
they scan something in the supermarket
it will think it just magically knows
what the product is right but you know
as the lasers are bouncing off that
barcode there's no lasers actually make
a lot of mistakes right lasers are not
that accurate
physics all right but
but thankfully math comes to the rescue
right because it gets it right every
time and what it does is it does the
checks the calculation if the pattern
works it knows it probably will scanned
correctly if it doesn't work it knows
it's been miss scanned and so without
this kind of error detection going on
with most people having no idea it
exists our modern shopping wouldn't work
and of course the same thing happens for
any kind of data transfer so there's a
nice analogy for the error correction
behind text messages so most people
think they type their message into their
phone then it MAGIX itself to another
phone and it's there but we know that
the well if you now come across it the
the pattern that you put into a text
message there are three different
mathematical patterns that are embedded
before it's sent so effectively you can
think of it taking all the characters
turning them into numbers putting the
numbers in a grid and then it goes
through and there's an extra
mathematical pattern for every single
row of the grid there's another pattern
for every single column and there's busy
intersections and there's a third
pattern for each section and if that
sounds a little bit familiar it's
because it's turning your text message
into a Sudoku puzzle so these people
understand that the idea that if I give
them one of these and there are three
mathematical patterns rows columns and
sections admittedly for text messages
it's read Sullivan reaps women read it's
the one with but actually what was that
Reese on exit right but that's more
correct me if I'm wrong they do it more
as a cube so this one you can visualize
it areas of Cubans as in three different
directions the and its coefficients of a
polynomial in to my knowledge whereas
here people appreciate the patterns are
much more straightforward but what
they're doing is they're recreating lost
data so you're going through and people
will calculate all the missing numbers
which i think is absolutely amazing if
you see someone in solving one of these
on a train just god I didn't know you're
going to error correction as well like
it was fresh now and people don't seem
to equate this with math either they go
I I hate I hate math loves to do oh my
god love lining up numbers in boxes this
is suddenly it's fun without this
without that kind of error correction
behind the scenes as we know all modern
technology wouldn't work and so I think
on one hand it's great that that happens
and that it makes our lives possible but
it's a bit of a shame that people don't
appreciate it but hope the whole point
is it's
automatically and behind those things so
I do try and show people math which is
actually useful immediately in their
lives and so X I'm going to try and
teach you all hopefully a new piece of
mathematics which will you know make
your lives better going forwards and
it's a superior way to tie your shoes so
I'm going to teach you the mathematical
way to tie your shoes to do that I have
here cuz I realize you can't all see my
foot and obviously there's a feed people
watching us online you'll be able to
zoom in on that so I've got here a
webcam which I've rigged up to my
presentation and so what I can do is if
I bring this out over here you should be
able to see my foot is that working oh
and you can see it more than once oh
there you go perfect it's like the
world's nerdiest chorus line forget ok
so right here's what we okay that just
just zoomed in on my foot now so you can
see okay I'm gonna do is I'm gonna tie
my shoelaces in them in the
mathematically superior manner and so
what you do normally when people tie
their laces they get two hoops and do
all sorts of you know mashing and
ridiculousness well you can actually do
is if you just hold one shoelace in each
hand if you cross it over it will tie
itself like that and so if I speed that
up slightly I'm holding two laces hold
the laces cross them tight there okay
you're keeping your excitement at a
manageable level
thank Catrin eyes me okay right so would
you like to try this right so what if
you want to have a go choose your
favorite shoes under the lace if you're
not wearing laces that's fine the person
next to you if probably were there using
up to 50% of their shoes to try this so
borrow the other one right and if you
undo the laces and then do a little
foundation not like that all right and
I've actually I'm gonna give you a
picture-in-picture as we go along here
we go right so you start by holding one
lace so it loops up and down and you
hold it on the way down the other one
loops up and back and you hold it on the
way down and then all you're doing is
you're taking each bit you're holding
and put it under the other loop so one
goes under then one that one that one
goes under that one you pull them tight
and there's your knot
okay so now have your shoes untied
I'll give you 30 seconds to see if you
can get that to work I'll do it once
more on here and then you get a second
pretty shoes back on again and we'll
carry on so you have 30 seconds to have
a go there were the laces cross not your
the disturbing thing is for some of you
the most impressive part of this talk
would be how I managed to embed a live
webcam feed into a PowerPoint
presentation the secret in case you're
wondering is an expansion pack called
keynote so actually they broke it right
so I I use quartz editor to make the
input for this and the new version of
keynote they've broken it doesn't work
anymore so I commissioned someone at
Apple going what people are adapting our
product to do what they want to do
slightly differently none of that so
notice I've got to stay on the old
version of keynote for that bit to keep
working there's a pointing hey-oh
actually for the first time in a decade
this is what like a treat for myself
I've been building my own PC from
scratch right and I haven't done that
since I was at university and very cheap
right so I'm gonna do this and my wife
doesn't understand
for me troubleshooting is like a
competitive sport so she comes down to
find me swearing if heat sinks but I've
pretty much got it going it's my trying
to get back into tech stuff but slowly
all right most of you should have your
shoes back on
so did not you tie by the way
is exactly the same as the knot if you
do it the long way mathematically it's
it's an identical knot and the people
going to appreciate knot theory like the
study of knots is quite a big
mathematical discipline it's a
reasonably new one as well and and the
delightful name has been called not
theorists which is quite nice and oh yes
you a theorist are not theorists but not
ferrous part of what they're trying to
do is work out the best way to undo
knots right and at the moment humans are
terrible undoing knots we we haven't got
a good mathematical theory for the best
way to undo any given knot and I've got
here a picture of one knot that at the
moment we have no idea how to undo so I
got this put as a diagram in my book if
you not say not diagrams before here it
looks like there's a break in the string
what actually happened there's the
string has gone underneath the other one
and come up the other side so we draw a
gap in the string to indicate going
underneath and I mean a trivial way for
not to come undone would be if one of
the ends goes through it right and so
we'd want to make that's a bit too easy
so for mathematical knots you join the
two ends together so you get a
continuous piece of string so there's no
beginning or end and it's got a knot in
it and if you pick it up the new shaker
and it becomes a complete untangled loop
you know that it's been uh knotted it
wasn't a knot in the first place this
one this is not called the ten eleven
not it cannot be on you can't just shake
it it won't come undone that way what
you need to do is what's called a
crossing switch to do a crossing switch
you cut the string on one side of where
it's crossing and move it around to the
other one and reattach it so you it
switches from crossing unleased the
crossing over at the moment the best
method we have for undoing this knot
takes three crossing switches no
has ever found a way to undo it with two
crossing switches no one has ever proved
that you can't undo it with two crossing
switches this is still an open problem
in mathematics we do not know if we've
found or what is the bet map best method
for undoing that not my theory is I'm
encouraging people to make it out of
string and then try because if you make
that out of string in that arrangement
then pick it up and jumble it around put
it back down again because we've tried
all the crossing switches in that
arrangement and part of why it's so
difficult is there are so many ways to
rearrange the knot before you do the
crossing switches and but if you have
enough people have a go sooner or later
someone if it is possible someone will
find a way to do it in two crossing
switches and mathematical fame and
fortune are there for a very narrow
definition of fame and fortune all right
then you be mathematically famous I mean
that's pretty cool right
and there are other ones we haven't got
any systematic way of undoing knots and
the reason we care about this is at the
moment that terior are better than we
are at untangling things so when
bacteria reproduce to go from one cell
to two their DNA has to divide and in
that process it gets very tangled and
knotted so before it can separate off
completely it has to unknot its DNA it's
got tiny enzymes that do this and they
perform crossing switches so they latch
on they cut one bit of DNA move it to
the other side of a different strand and
reconnect it and at the moment bacteria
are better doing that than humans they
are far more efficient and they can find
ways that we wouldn't or we can't work
out how they're doing it and so there
are not theorists from from the math
department at various universities
working with the biologists to try and
find ways partly to understand what the
bacteria what these enzymes are doing
and then to find ways to impede it or to
slow it down because if we can stop them
from untangling their DNA that's a whole
new wave of possible you know
antibacterial you know medical therapies
are available but because mathematicians
are working with biologists to look at
the knots in the DNA or bacteria which I
think it's absolutely fantastic okay so
I've got okay I've got approximately a
quarter of an hour left so what I'm
going to do is
going to show you a ridiculous project I
did recently involved in computing and
then I'm gonna finish with the Christmas
present my mother gave me two years ago
and the Israel it's relevant to the book
it's not just like hey check out this
jumper right it's a proper thing but the
ridiculous project I'm going to show you
first I wanted to find a way to
communicate to the general public how
computer processors actually work at a
very fundamental level how the circuitry
do calculations and so I tried to find a
really nice kind of macro big hands-on
example of sending information down a
circuit and what I stumbled across was
using chains of dominoes as a circuit
because here I very carefully balanced
these dollars I mean I've heard rumors
you can use Domino's to play some kind
of game I don't believe that right we
all know you bounce up in a long line
and you knock one over and it goes all
the way along and what you're doing is
obviously you're sending information on
the chain so if I you know bump that
Domino that soon will get sent along and
the output domino falls over as well and
you could use this practically right so
if you're a doorbell stopped working
right you could from your front door
have a chain of dominoes and have a sign
saying if you're at the door please bump
the Domino right all the way across your
house into your living room and so then
if someone's at the door they'll bump
that Domino the signal comes through the
one of the ringing falls over you know
someone's at the door and it's okay
takes a long time to reset it depends
how frequently you have guests all right
but it would in theory work but we can
do better why just in one bit of
information when you can have the
circuit interacting with itself so here
I've now got two inputs right most of
you know who I'm going with this trying
to skip ahead to the punchline all right
I've got two inputs over here I got a
single output over there so if you want
to know more about who's at the door
like let's say you've ordered a pizza
right you could have two inputs at the
door one says are you at the door please
month this domino the other one says
have you got a pizza please pop this
domino right and only if you bump both
of them will the signal go through if
you bump either one by itself the signal
stops so this one if you bump this one
these just topple over and it stops
quite straight forward if you bump that
one the
signal splits and it blocks itself
before it comes through but if I'd
knocked both of these this would have
stopped it from stopping itself and the
signal would have gone all the way
across and so because it's a NAND gate
we can do a truth table for our friend
the an gate so you've got all the
scenarios you've got no one at the door
they haven't got a pizza nothing happens
someone's at the door they haven't got a
pizza doesn't come through okay for
completeness right somehow a sentient
pizza's arrived at the door on its own
it's managed to pass the sign and bumped
over the okay it won't get through thank
goodness
what a horrifying sight that would be if
you went to the door right here the guy
with the pizza the signal goes through
right so there's a here's our end gate
Mayella Domino's of course why stop it
and here's our exclusive or table where
the signal only goes through if it's one
all the other one if you've not come
across this before the exclusiveness is
it's one all the other but not both
so exclusively a single signal will go
through whereas no signal won't and two
signals won't hear it is bit other
Domino's and so what I've done is I've
had a bit in the middle so if you bump
both inputs at the same time the signal
will collide and cancel out in the
center there and either one by itself
would have carried through and out the
other side if you want more tolerances
of course you can make this bit longer
or zigzag that in the center so the
signals can be a little bit further
apart if you want to build on one of
these by the way this is about a hundred
dominoes you can make one of these so if
you buy a standard large tin of Domino's
you will have enough to make some of
these single gates but disappointingly
you won't have enough to start combining
them because if you have two inputs and
you have the and gate and the
exclusive-or outputs
you've now got a circuit which counts
the number of inputs that have been
bumped so we've got our units column and
our twos column in binary for a binary
readout of how many inputs so this is an
anatomist set of objects it's a series
of dominoes balanced on a table and it
can count how many inputs you knock and
you require two to three hundred
dominoes if you want to build one of
these I had to build
these looks a little bit like this so
basically it's a clip on like okay
there's a mod for the exclusive all
which means you get a next one over
there for your other output and so this
circuit will count this is a binary half
adder it will count two inputs and
someone's off to get some Domino's right
now to give this a go alright I couldn't
I couldn't resist either but of course
me wouldn't it be ashamed to stop there
right because we're so close to the full
adder where you've got your two inputs
you've got to carry from a previous
calculation then you've got the carryout
and then you've got the output so what
this means is you can have a rollover
coming from a previous step of the
calculation you can have your two new
digits you're adding and then you can
send something on to the next step while
have your output and if you make one of
these the full binary adder this is the
basic unifor all all addition using
circuits right sounds like well this is
what I really want to get to but I did
the numbers to make one of these you
would need a thousand dominoes and it
would look a little bit like this so so
I may have bought a thousand dominoes
this is me at Manchester University I
got some friends who work up there this
is Katie showing you just how excited
you should be at this point and we were
able to buy we bought a thousand dollars
we use the concrete floor and we've got
a working binary full adder
built out of dominoes and then in theory
you if we had enough dominoes you could
start chaining these so if you had three
of these in a row right you could add
any three digit to three digit binary
numbers and get the four digit readout
but we worked out that would be coming
up on about 10,000 dominoes and it would
look like this so
I contacted a domino wholesaler those
are the weirdest phone calls of my life
right a vision they delivered them for
me and so this is a full calculator
built out of Domino so I'm gonna set the
video going and this is if and we
actually ran it it took 12 of us all day
to set this up and to pick what we were
adding we picked a Domino random so over
here these are the two units inputs
nothing has happened because we picked
the dominant which was 4 plus 6 and so
there were no units to some but there is
a 2 right so the 6 is going to have a 2
so over here in the twos column you see
one of them has come through so one of
the twos went through to put a 1 in we
left gaps in the circuit for a 1 we
filled it in for a 0 we left it empty
empty so you can see the 1 2 is gone in
the outputs are over here and they go
are from the bottom from your point of
view they go the ones twos fours and
eights going up the screen in that
direction and then finally cuz it's 4
plus 6 you can see over here we've had
in a fours input they've both gone in
they've cancelled a it's carried over
and the crowd has gone wild
excellent and there's our readout there
to animate so we were able to show
conclusively that 4 plus 6 does indeed
equal 10 one more thank you
one more mischievous onlooker said it
took as it took us 12 people we started
at 8:00 in the morning around this at 6
o'clock at night we had it in the middle
of a Science Museum's people were coming
by all the time someone pointed out it
took us you know 12 people all day to
prove that 4 plus 6 equals 2 plus 8 joke
and oh we were building this in front of
this is right in front of the rebuild of
Alan Turing's first baby computer which
was built at Manchester University and
so behind us we had the machine that you
can still see all the valves and
everything it's so good and was the
first that's the first computer with
electronic programmable memory and I was
allowed to play on at once and they've
got to enter data that there's a row of
buttons and each button corresponds to a
single bit in them and you just hit the
ones you want to be once right and
that's how you program absolutely
incredible and so we got to build this
and then of course we thought well it'd
be a real shame to stop there because
we're you know a little more effort and
a bit more cunning we could make
something that would add two four digit
binary numbers and give a five digit
readout which would look like this this
okay now this one didn't work right we
say I I have found the cutting edge of
domino computing it is here with ever
with a five bit readout we were briefly
calculating what Moore's Law would be
based on the rate at which we were
building bigger circuits it's not
promising and so this one went wrong in
two ways and they were both because of
the constraints so we had this space in
the museum for a weekend and with the
first one the Saturday so we didn't have
any more space on the Sunday and we
didn't have any more dominoes so we had
to make it much more packed in and the
last one there were lot of space to walk
around and to set all that this one was
crammed in much more dense and we had to
cut back a lot of the timing
so all these delay lines this is just
slow one signal down before it goes in
so we the signals had to come in at the
right stage we had loads of delay lines
to allow for that and the two things
went wrong one we had a signal bleed we
had crosstalk between two of the lines
so here right this Domino is not
supposed to fall over that DOM and that
this chain is not meant to top and you
can see the signals already come around
here in god this should remain
stationary a signal is going to come in
this way and watch this really watch
this other signal comes through and
again in slow motion
here I come no said that was a phantom
bit that came out and so that was that
we got that on top of the answer was I
think it became a two or something
really annoying and the other one is
this bit here went wrong so this was a
synchronization issue we had a timing
problem where this signal over here
should not get out that is the carry
signal it needs to be blocked right and
then over here this is the signal that's
going to stop it well it's this one's
gonna come racing along here and that's
the the gate there and bam it's gonna
block it right I've been watching a lot
of American football I've been over
right so it kind of stopped it there but
I didn't work right so the signal got
there before the blocking signal arrives
so it is it closed the gate after the
signal had left so if I said it going oh
here it comes ready watch this ones so
gonna get there first like that's
totally gonna reach it in time ready
here we go
and it comes and ah so this they wow
this is cutting-edge domino computing
right and then if we were in England I'd
say you're now welcome to borrow my
10,000 dominoes so schools have been
using them to try and build their own
circuits and do all this ridiculousness
and all the circuit diagrams are in the
book so in fact if you do if you didn't
get a book you don't wanna pay the money
for it just walk over there get it just
get your phone out right it's it's in
the answers at the back of the book
because I wanted to put it in the book
and my dad was like no you're not
putting no and I said what if I am I
allowed answers at the back of the book
and they were like okay you can do
really like so huge chunk of the book
all right they're all the things I
wasn't allowed in the normal bit of the
book I hidden in the back of the book so
the circuit diagrams are in the back oh
the other thing if you want to get most
of the value out of the book because
pretty much any other book that you get
or I didn't use your book before because
often it's the ISBN which is used in the
barcode right and I I've not learnt they
changed I spent a few years ago I've not
learned either the ISBN method so do
apologize my free time is finite but if
you open any other book and you look at
it and you look at the page numbers up
into a random page the page number on
the Left will be even and the page
number on the right will be odd almost
without exception every on the book it's
always all on the left even sorry even
on the left odd on the right
not my book right you look at my book it
is all on the left
even on the right because I start on
page zero to that oh my god the emails
it took to be allowed first of all I got
the zeroth chapter they're like what the
introduction went no the zeroth chapter
and then I started on page zero so all
it shifts the earth so good in fact that
is half the value of the book if you
don't want to buy it so you just pick it
up marvel at the page numbers and put it
back you're done that's half the fun so
anyway the last thing I was going to
show you and then I put my email address
and everything back up again if you want
a copy is the Christmas present that my
mom gave me two years in you make sure
to see my giddy face on Christmas
morning right when I unwrapped this it
is a knitted scarf made entirely out of
ones and zeros it's a binary scarf okay
some of you are impressed but not all
that fine it's a binary scarf either
like it or you don't
what does it say right now who is the
embed that is the first time I've had
that heckled very Nisha liked it
right originally because my mum is not
that not that into math and so initially
I thought that she just done random ones
and zeros right because she knows I like
binary code so she's muna makes cuff and
there's something I realized every
single row start zero one zero every
single one hang on that that means it's
a proper actual code right and so every
single row is a capital letter because
my mum knits the way she text messages
and so
old habits man right and so I was like
what what does it say I was gonna work
it out so I got the back of the wrapping
paper I got my pen out nice done
what a lovely Christmas morning that was
good to sit down with the family and
calculate my present right and there's
us decoding it
she found a interview I had done for a
website and so it's a quote one of my
answers it was a quote I gave the
website and I try and be bilingual so I
tend to say math when I'm in North
America in England we would say maths
same in Australia where I'm from and so
the actual quote you know precisely is a
maths is fun keep doing maths which
certainly sounds like me how'd she get
it correct
right because me my mom loves missing
that much is very obvious but she's not
that into math right as it turns out she
cheated she emailed my brother Steve
who's also a massive nerd all right and
so Steve gave her a link to one of the
websites where you can type your message
in hit convert right and it just gives
you all the ones and zeros underneath
then when the reason Steve knows about
the website is because we email each
other in binary which I cannot over
recommend by the way it is so good you
can go too far I got an email in from
Steve recently came in all ones and
zeros on classic Steve and I so I'll put
it in the converted hit convert and it
came back out as Morse code too far
seriously what a geek they would have
code this and she knit the scarf and are
so pleasing and then I almost didn't
tell her this right because she made a
mistake
all right part way down she swapped the
one with a zero it turned in you into a
V in the code right and so if you decode
this precisely it actually says maths is
for vent keep doing maths Oh mum I hate
to ruin your fervent but you've
accidentally stopped the one with a zero
right and she wanted to fix it she was
quite upset just she's quite the pinned
they said well actually doesn't matter
right you don't have to fix it because
to make this scarf long enough the
message actually repeats four times its
front and back front back
and she only made a mistake in one of
those so what that means is all I have
to do is calculate the average value
across all versions right that gives me
back the original accurate message
without the mistake and so lazing a bit
of Microsoft I can present to you the
odds first error correcting scarf I will
I will leave the scarf at the front if
you'd like to come and meet it it also
signs autographs but you've got to pick
it up and just write your own name I
obviously I'm now fluent in binary it's
a lot less impressive in this room to be
honest but I can I can when people come
up to get me to sign a book I'm like
okay well you like it's a normal letters
or binary code right so I can do ASCII I
can't do Unicode for anyone comes up and
demands I can't do it in hex but if you
HOT the straight ones and zeros of ASCII
I'm your guy but I will be around about
to do Q&amp;amp;A now so I'm going to answer
questions if you've got things you
desperately have to rush off to that's
fine but I would do Q&amp;amp;A for
approximately a quarter of an hour and
then I will lighter around afterwards if
you don't wants to come up and say hello
I believe we've got the space until
three o'clock ish but it depends when
people need to go I'm happy if you want
me to 2d face and lower the resale value
of your copy of the book I have more
than happy to do that but on that note
here's all my information back up on the
screen and that is officially the end of
my talk thank you
okay any questions it was a very
comprehensive talk so I can understand
was that one at the back were you
stretching flatland when you were
younger in flatland when I was younger
yes I did I read a romance in many
dimensions as I believe is to sometime
and I read actually when I was about 14
I read a book called the boy who
reversed himself which was a kind of
young adult fiction book about the
fourth dimension as well so it's not
dissimilar
it's like flatland without the Victorian
era misogyny and so I read that as a
young kid and then later on read
flatland that the title of the book is a
reference to the fact well partly it was
a nice catchy title that the editor
liked and it there is a whole chapter on
the fourth dimension in there there's
obviously several about tune and 3d
shapes on the way up and then I think of
some amazing 4d shapes that you can talk
about so the chapter and then there's a
lady chapter about higher dimensional
spaces beyond that and so those a real
shame that there are amazing bits of
mathematics that require four dimensions
and you can so rarely get to them
because it takes a lot of background
reading and bit of a run up but I knew
in a book I would have the time to kind
of seed the path along the way with
everything people would need so much
time they get to chapter tears it turns
out you're ready to go into the fourth
dimension but in a in a short talk I
fight it I do I very rarely would do it
in a standard book talk because it takes
so much momentum to get there and a lot
of people are just like oh I understand
it and I don't want to reinforce that
aspect of math where it's just confusing
and people don't get it but if you've
not come across there's a whole new
platonic solid in 40 it's brilliant
anyway so yes is that a question from
online but you mentioned that your
brother is also a spectacular nerd but
your mother is not what about death
that's a very good question so my
brother is a is a massive note in fact
he's a physicist but you know can't
choose your family and we have I have a
sister as well but he's a
physiotherapist then we kind of count
my dad's an accountant so in fact as a
small child he brainwashed me into
liking math who used to buy me like
arithmetic books as a treat and so I got
to school going brilliant math they were
else's like what and so but you know say
what you like about brainwashing it's
effective and so I grew up enjoying my
mum loves like puzzles and logic and
that kind of stuff there so it was a
quiet quite a nerdy first day and I have
since married a physicist so my wife is
a solid fit I'm surrounded by them and
so I have a soft spot for physics but
yes so it and I think that's the people
saying oh I'm good at math I'm not good
at math it's hereditary all this I think
having been a high school teacher a huge
amount is the support of the parents and
the number of parent-teacher nights with
the parents make excuses for their own
kids that like are as terrible at math I
never got it of course my kid can't do
it I think it's ridiculous it's not as a
mate as people think it is and I think
supportive parents make all the
difference for how far you go in
technical subjects so a good question
online person any more questions here or
virtual yes so for the first dimension
do mean time as the first dimension so
the question was it was twofold question
occasion mister he said is the fourth
dimension time and is the fifth
dimension really love and so if you're
not singing to Stella spoiler alert
traditionally you say that before the I
forget it so it's the fourth dimension
time and so physicists have a habit of
when they get stuck in physics they walk
over to see what mathematicians are up
to and they just always gonna borrow
some of this all right and then they go
back over here and do physics with it
I think the math behind 4d originally
was done as spatial through four
directions in which you can move and our
higher dimensions are still often
visualized or at least understood in
terms of spatial dimensions whereas
physicists specifically Einstein and
actually a lot of mathematicians working
in the area are very close to the
similar sorts of equations realize that
they could use time as a fourth
dimension and the equations work out
really nicely and there's a straight
thing in physics where if the equations
work out nicely that tends to imply
they're probably right
and there's no real reason why these I
think would be unreasonable
effectiveness of mathematics where maths
math shouldn't predict the way the
reality works but it seems to and so I I
use the fourth dimension as a direction
you can move in but exactly the same
math applies to using it as time and a
slight tweak on the equations means you
can apply it to love so that's actually
the other great thing about physics
there's a lot of hard work right this is
the one big difference right in physics
if you want to get new physics oh no
what you're gonna do experiments and
data and theories whereas in math you
just like I'd like some more math well
I'll think hard for new math right and
so that's what a better way to go about
it okay sorry other question is
everything I'll go I'll go on the aisle
and then we'll go online yep so I loved
your pseudo ku point on people enjoying
that out during math but as people get
more computationally sensitive right are
you seeing these things like perhaps
minecraft kids aren't doing good
math at school but all of a sudden
they're creating circuit boards right
because it's something visualized but
about a RvR how do you feel education
computation and mathematics for you
characters are as I'll draw these
concise as I can so her so minecraft is
a very good example I I think there are
students definitely doing things in
Minecraft that there's no way they'll be
doing at school and so when I show the
Domino computer a lot of kids do logic
gates in Minecraft there's a 3d printer
and there there's amazing things I did a
project recently I'm building fractals
to making Menger sponge --is out of
origami and so loads of kids then went
and made them in Minecraft afterwards
but what I think
minecraft is doing cuz I don't think
it's creating any new nodes but I think
that the students who like those things
it's giving them an outlet for it and I
think YouTube
actually feeling a very similar role
where previously if you were into math
and science you'd get very bored quite
quickly at high school
whereas now there's some way you can go
to access that wider community and see
that you're not alone you're not unusual
and and there's an outlet and it's the
fun bits the playing with the subject
which I think keeps kids interested and
we spend a lot of time at school making
them learn the skills without ever
showing them where the skills can be
used and so I think minecraft is a
brilliant place where the skills they're
learning at school they can say deploy
them in a fun social environment and so
I think it's a fantastic outlet in that
regard in terms of if it's in terms of
an evangelical tool they're never
converting new people to tech I I don't
know I suspect it's catering for people
who could have easily fallen by the
wayside otherwise I don't have being new
people into default okay so we'll go the
online questions completely unrelated
so now when same person two questions so
one person's really curious about how
you became a stand-up mathematician and
the second question is Star Trek or Star
Wars see now we're gonna now see your
education we're getting to the serious
subject matter now so dust I'll start
I'll start with the inconsequential one
so Star Wars and sir okay attempt to
stand up the way I got into stand-up was
I was working as a math teacher I'd work
for some universities I'd gone back to
teaching and I knew I wanted to move
into doing my skill set was less being a
good classroom teacher and more about
going into schools and doing a one-off
workshop and activities and and priming
the students to then be more
enthusiastic afterwards I'm working with
the math teachers because you it's
dangerous going into a school doing a
whiz-bang presentation when you leave
the students go to their teacher or
won't you do that all the time and so it
can be counterproductive whereas because
I've been a teacher as I operate I can
go in and work with the teachers to make
this really useful and ongoing and I
also wanted to get adults more excited
about mathematics and that pilot was
seeing parents who didn't value math and
thought they were terrible at it and so
I thought what part of the problem isn't
in the wider culture and so I looked at
doing public speaking training because I
want to get
better at doing math presentations and a
lot of it is very all the courses I've
have a very corporate it was like how to
give a business presentation all these
sorts of things and then I found an
evening course in stand-up comedy and I
was like oh brilliant I'll do an evening
cause it's like one night a week for
like ten weeks I said I'm going there
get all those transferable skills and
get back out again and I started doing
the course and absolutely loved it and
about halfway through it was of course
is about 12 to 15 of us on the course
part way in a few of us were like how
hard can this be
right and we're in London which is like
one of the best stand-up singers going
well let's go do this could do like mic
night right the three of us signed up
for a local open mic night only I showed
up I'm doing it I absolutely loved it
and so I started working part time doing
stand-up but originally it was purely my
academic approach I want to be good at
this I'll do a course in it but then I
realized if I could actually do it and
work on the circuit I'm gonna get even
better and more skills and so and I
ended up absolutely love it's a
fantastic art form and if you have you
ever wondered would you be good at
stand-up I don't know about Seattle but
a lot of cities will have a course you
can do or the open mic scene I highly
recommend it it's like extreme public
speaking training as I highly recommend
it to people it does I I'm never think I
missed the window to get into Star Trek
at the right time a friend of mine is
really big on the math of Star Trek
right he's all over that whereas Star
Wars I think I was at the right age at
the right time so I'm gonna go Star Wars
/ Star Trek there's some fantastic math
someone did a video for a channel I'm
involved with on YouTube channel called
head squeezed about the naming system
that George Lucas used and his serial
codes for the robots in no way match up
with the production levels of robots
that will be going on in that universe
right the numbers that c-3po and all
those right that doesn't scale right and
so again the universe has got some
mathematical holes in it but I'm gonna
go Star Wars
I'll do what between one and two I'll do
approximately one and a half questions
if anyone I wanna take it personally if
there's not that's fine don't know
anyone was it more aligned this is like
doing this is like YouTube lives coming
in as I'm here
a recommendation for math books well I
hear things to make and do in the fourth
so one thing I still recommend there's a
little bit antiquated it depends how
involved you want to be with the kid
who's reading it all the old mountain
guard the books are still very good that
they some of them will find the language
and the structure they're all foreign
but that's fine so I highly recommend if
you get Martin Gardner's old books and
the here collection of his columns from
scientific America then there's some
fantastic content in there for kids and
I'm not the only person writing new
books about mathematics there are loads
of great ones out there anything that
makes them think at the same time so
there is an author called Simon Singh
who wrote the code book in Euro Mars
Last Theorem and Sofer Mars Last Theorem
is a really good book into the inside of
what's like to be a mathematician and
actually Marcus de SOI toy who is a
professor at Oxford wrote a book music
of the primes which is a really nice one
again on what it's like to be a jobbing
mathematician but in terms of actually
hands-on puzzles Martin Gardner stuff is
still very difficult to beat okay so on
that note I I'm gonna wrap up because
people have to get back out to your jobs
however I will be around for as long as
people want to go off and say hi or
deface books anyone's book so even mine
but on that note thank you all very much
