hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
hi I'm Danielle Fisher I'm a researcher
here at microsoft research data
visualization and I'm delighted to
introduce our guest speaker today Nargis
Meyer is joining us from the University
of British Columbia where she is working
with old friends in cscw like Kelly
booth I'm really interesting work around
architecture and visualization design
she's before that from the University of
Victoria where she worked with Melanie
Torre and she'll be talking today about
designing carpet visual analytics tools
like to pass on to Nargis thank you so
much for the introduction done so yeah
I'm very excited to be here today and to
talk about collaborative visual and
athletic tools and to share my
experience from designing these tools to
supporting and empowering experience and
analyst to my current line of research
which is more to engaging public and
this diverse range of people who don't
necessarily have experience with
visualization or a domain itself so a
little bit background about myself I'm
coming from a very interdisciplinary
background i got my bachelor in
electrical engineering and then I switch
to computer science as I found it more
interesting to do more innovative and
creative tools and there was also strong
a reason for this sage I have a fine art
background and I was always a very
passionate to somehow combine these two
so I thought and I found information
visualization a great great use of you
know to bringing my personal and
professional background and interest
together here are some samples of my
fine art work I have spent many years
learning about different styles of
fainting from you know principles of
drawing and painting in reality I'm
style to more you know modern style
expert surrealism pursuing them collage
abstract but the question that is really
interesting to the computer science
audiences and my desire has been always
to combine these two knowledge together
but more in line with my current line of
research is how we can reach beyond TS
audiences by bringing more design
elements into visualization and also
collaboration technology so i would so
here's what i do in terms of research i
design develop and evaluate novel
interaction and visualization technology
specifically for groups to solve complex
problem when the problems get really
complex and people have to come together
and make decisions my work is in
human-computer interaction I really
enjoyed working a lot with human subject
to understand their issues and
challenges regarding the use of
technology and how we can improve that
but more specifically it's collaborative
visual analytics which as you know it's
a subset of cscw as well as
visualization and visual analytics and
I'm really interested to study and
understand this you know communication
between previous two people and their
communication with technology and
visualization and how they understand
this underlying data and they derive
insight from the data so how we can make
that information more accessible and
more meaningful for this user my work is
very interdisciplinary and I have been
working and it can be applied in
different domains for example my PhD
research was funded by a safety business
objects so I worked very closely with
their experts from there with
researchers as well as analysts to
understand their needs in business
domain when they had to you know gather
around the table together and solve
their problems and then I have also
worked in intelligence analysis and more
recently as daniel said i'm working in
built environment with close
collaboration with faculty members from
urban planning as well as civil
engineering as they do have a lot of
examples of this close collaboration
scenario
when they don't have enough you know
collaborative and visualization
technology to support a tasks so my
research approach and method I try to
bring them together is first understand
the domain specific problem so I spent a
lot of time with domain experts to
understand their challenges and needs
and I do that through different you know
methods such as at no graffia the
original users study as well as case
study to work with expert and understand
their needs and challenges how they want
everything to be changed and then I go
to the whole process of system building
from prototyping to designing
implementing and deploying and for the
evaluation of those tools which is a
central part of my research as well I i
go through qualitative as well as
quantitative evaluation methods so
here's I try to bring a very visual
summary of main contribution the
research that I've been leading so far
this is my an information visualization
research we traded during my master's
and it was a creativity support tools to
help creative advertiser to come up with
their language for their ad ads so this
tool would bring their most relevant
words and sentences from internet and
will present them in very
thought-provoking stimulating kind of
way to help them to create it up and
then I started my PhD with Melanie when
she got this large interactive surfaces
and I was very excited to design tools
for this but we decided to first go with
an observational study to understand
what are the challenges of a group small
group of people when they're working
around this large interactive surfaces
and through this observational study we
understand that note taking is a
critical activity that happens around
from this framework that we propose
and it hasn't been supported with you
know visual analytic tools so with that
the next phase of my PhD was designing a
tool tailor-made for tabletop and with
you know considering all the principles
for designing for tabletop such as you
know Floyd interaction and Churchill
reality bringing those individual as
well as working group worker spaces and
transition between collaboration style
but also it integrated a note ticket
note-taking and visual history module
which they can go back and revisit their
visual history which was linked to their
notes and it really helped them to do
their task better and then last piece of
my PhD which I'm going to describe in
more detail today was clip which was an
awareness McCann is emitted that we
proposed to help this co-located analyst
to do their task more effectively by
sharing their the analysis results
basically and then this is more current
research that I'm conducting at UBC in
built environment and community
community planning which is a multi
display table center application to help
people and engage public in the process
of participatory urban design and then
lastly this is this is a short paper
that I presented last year personal
visualization at least and it was about
we need we need to actually gain a
better understanding of engagement if we
are trying to measure engagement and
report engagement of visual analytic
tools so i don't have to go over details
for all of them away would be happy to
take questions and talk to you about any
of those research after work so today i
will start with a brief introduction and
challenges of collaborative visual
analytics and the two projects that i
picked today was one of them from my PhD
which was to support
empowering and now lists and the other
one is to engage in public to this
domain so I wanted to address these two
different spectrum and I'll go over my
contributions and finally up some up web
my vision and directions for a future so
the question is why collaborative visual
analytics at all here with the complex
information that we have we see more and
more these scenarios that people have to
get together and share their expertise
to solve complex problems so as you all
know collaboration has a lot of
advantages like people can share their
diverse background and expertise and it
can help with the quality of work less
than the individual biases and helps
with the task load sharing the task low
but then we pair it with visual
analytics and visualization we basically
empower a group to go to this data and
understand and explore the underlying
you know meaning from the data so it
helps them to interactively explore the
data and make better decisions and we
are going to see a lot more examples of
these collaborative work in the future
but of course it comes with a lot of
challenges for example the first one and
the most obvious one is users we are
dealing with multiple users and
sometimes for example when you're
designing for experts they know their
their domain but sometimes when you're
dealing with public they're coming from
this really diverse range of
stakeholders with different background
expertise expectations objectives so
it's really really harder and more
challenging to design for them and then
you know supporting cognition of a group
has been always one of the grand
challenges in collaborative visual
analytics as sense-making has been
stated at Grand Challenges how do we
understand how group make a decision and
how they gain
inside from the data and how we can
better support that and then how they
they want to share their inside and Anna
analytical outcomes and what are the
best ways to support that is another
challenge as well evaluation has been
always one of the greatest challenge in
this field how do we you know evaluate
these visual analytic tools especially
when it comes with you know all the
social interactions that happening
around this data how do we evaluate that
and then visual representation this is
also another challenge so when it comes
to different display environment and
multiple display this poses the question
of how do we design this different you
know display and how we are going to
build interaction techniques with this
different display so searching to the
first project today is clip which one
the best of a paper award in at vast
2014 and I think this was because they
noted this project as an exemplary user
study because of the methods that we
used and the massive massive amount of
qualitative research qualitative data
that we went through and all the metrics
that we proposed for the for the
evaluation so clip was a prototype tool
that I designed and built for and I
would like to call it a collaborative
thinking space so it was an environment
to help people to record and then
organize to be able to better share it
with group members and share it with
their collaborators so this was one of
the problems that has been stated in
collaborative sense making for a while
we wanted to really test as this idea so
as I mentioned the bigger picture was
supporting collaborative sense making
but more specifically how to support
externalization and by externalization I
mean everything that a external
noise from the data it could be a
findings like a pure some values of
findings that they find through their
visualization but it could be a cue
about what to do next for the course of
analysis or question for collaborators
or hypotheses so externalizing all of
those and be able to share them when
necessary was our questions and we
wanted to see the effect of these two
lon collaboration mechanics this project
was partly motivated by Camby era which
was built here by Petra and Daniel and
their goal was to build this tabletop
co-located collaborative environment for
people to go over documents and they
work a lot in you know the searching
ways of phasing of sense making how
people search for you know keywords and
how do they see who has find different
you know documents but they didn't
provide any support for externalization
and they speculated that supporting for
expert externalization can help groups
to come up with better results and this
was also very grounded in literature
many other researcher has been stated
that but it wasn't tested before so we
wanted to test the idea and to give you
a better context about the task we chose
one of the vast challenges which is kind
of standard data certain scenario to
evaluate the visual analytic tools and
it was a mystery task it was challenging
because there were like 240 documents
and they had such a limited time to go
through all of them and there were a lot
of misleading facts so it was just
really easy to come up with wrong
hypotheses and insight from the data and
then the scenario itself would give them
a cute find the first relevant document
out of this 240 but it was their own
jobs to search and find other related
document and connect those facts
to to solve the case so the core idea of
clip was what we called linked common
work or lcw and this was basically the
idea of we can automatically identify
and then visually present all of the
common work to help them to gain better
awareness of who's doing what at any
given moment and it came to two
different modes partial melting as well
as full merging to give you a better
idea of hardest work i created this very
simplified version of cliff here so
imagine as you saw through the picture
they were sitting around the table using
their own machines so imagine this is
Laura's machine and she's working with
Alex and Mary at this time and each of
them have even a distinguishable color
so you can see and trace everyone's work
so here's Laura and she started
recording stuff based on what she wants
for example George is a suspicious
person in this case he can play
important role and then she finds out
about a club and those little you know
circles about those nodes indicates how
many evidence or documents articles she
has found based on to support her you
know results and then she finds a
relation between to this soup bingo so
George works for cloth it can be a you
know key person in this but here's where
the partial merging comes and the idea
was with with those little visual leaf
we can give them an idea of you know
what the other collaborators or those
blue ones is associated with Alex so
Laura understand that alex has also
found about George and Club and for each
of them he has stated one evidence or
document organization and added them to
or was it done separately I'm just not
sure how the blue things ended up there
this was the mechanism that we will look
at each each person's work his face and
if there is any you know common work
also had a George yes God and also has
club and also had you know had recorded
one document for each of them there's
like Lala has fun to documents for
George so they can also go over each
other's document for validation purpose
and then here if Laura gets interested
to see what as alex has found she had
this option to take for you know full
merging and full merging is where she
can see the rest of you know Alex's work
at this time and by that she figures out
like George is a member of OS PS which
is a tourism you know organization and
from here they can really coordinate
their task better together and
communicate more effectively this is
very similar it's more complex it has
more you know coordinated we use but it
comes with this note link graph idea and
it's because in intelligent analysis
many times they would like to go with
northland graph do you have it this year
what does he mean by not having mad
thought for the box doesn't mean that
there's no evidence to see yes in
simulation she he didn't he didn't
record in here they were supposed to
record their evidences because we were
interested to see how they go over those
evidences and coordinate but for this
one for any reason he didn't support a
evidence there but they had the option
to do that so here's a very quick you
know video of clip where you see the the
main interface and the idea was this is
a collaborative visual thinking space
rather than you know going to the data
could either probably give you built in
utah ways to support collaborated
sense-making clip those analysts to
record it
means in the form of Milton ground and
timeline add evidence to keep track of
their findings came from and add
freeform text to record hypotheses the
chance to do list etc most importantly
clip automatically discovers and links
common work to read it and integrate
findings of different qualities it
wasn't quite obvious but all those you
know views were coordinated so if you
would click on any of those node you
would see the related note or evidence
and the timeline item as well I think
goes into this set visualizer because
there were three people but you are
showing me just two people right up for
treasure to basically show yes
intersection yes it's because before
Mary starts to you know to record any
common work you don't seem at its work
unless there is something something in
common but if you want to see Mary's
work they were tab above the workspace
which you can click on those tabs and
remotely see Mary's work but but the
reason you don't see it in Laura's
workspace is because Mary hasn't still
recorded anything that is in common with
either marry either Laura or Alex if
there are they find analysts working
together then
does it show it cost me quite beautiful
fast yes I should have I should have
brought a sure click it's a
collaborative ult in the space to
support collaborated sense majors good
it's a collaborative I continue on stage
right you for your patience and curios
yes I finishing them just keep it also
so what was your never see nothing just
let it run through and guess is it
because it'll it'll start it does you
just let it run click is a collaborative
in welding in space to support
collaborated sense-making clip those
analyst to record and front doesn't let
form of not in brown edges on trend line
add evidence to keep track of where
funding came from and add three phone
txt record hypothesis questions to do
list etc most importantly click
automatically discovers and links
community the link to repay and cheat
Agrium's forms of his own plan and you
click on whether I was gonna sit there
yeah okay good but it's the second time
can I go over your question one more
year maybe when we meet with more
through really sure so for the
evaluation of the sling common work I
decided to conduct an experimental
comparison between clip and a baseline
which doesn't have lcw notion to see how
this in CW will affect their work so for
the baseline tool is like for the only
way for Laura to see what's going on and
Alex's work is to click on the tab above
its workspace and see remotely what's
alexis has been doing but there is no
notion of you know bringing common work
together and it's a lot more cognitive
load to see what's going on in this
space where there is no linking so that
was based on this Clark and burning
theory as well for you know lessen the
cognitive load on users so for the user
study I recruited 16 groups of three
which was a non-trivial task so eight
groups in each condition and then they
worked for 90 minutes as I mentioned and
they used they were randomly assigned to
clip or baseline and this process was
video recorded and followed up by a
semi-structured interview and I was
there to answer the questions and take
note and observe and also to do the
follow-up interview so we had quite a
few hypotheses for this study these are
the informal version but the more formal
version can be found in paper so you
hypothesize that linked common work will
improve performance communication it
helped them to better coordinate their
task and it will increase awareness so
metrics and analysis this was one of the
challenges of this work for sure how to
find metrics to for example measure
awareness which is not easy to measure
so for the performance we followed the
same scoring scheme that Eisenberg at
all used and it was like positive points
for correct hypothesis and negative ones
for incorrect hypotheses and finding and
also the number of key documents that
they found through this large data set
and then Fred for the other hypotheses
we went to this massive massive
qualitative work where we transcribe all
of those videos and we went over this
conversation and align analysis which is
also roots back in social sciences so we
we started to you know coding and
recording all of the conversations until
we came up with
set of code for our hypotheses and we
had two coders and we spent a lot of
time in this data analysis yes 500 to
hunt 520 hours it was really really
massive amount of work some people find
it tedious I found it still interesting
to go over you know people's interaction
and see how they formed groups and
subgroups and how they talk to and use
the visualization but it was really
tedious at the same time so this is the
metric metric schemes that became up for
example we distinguish all the
discussions which were relevant to the
solving the task or where they like
verbally reporting it a hypothesis that
they generated and then because with
using and referring to tool was
important for us we also called it all
the instances for referring to
visualization all the verbal instances
of coordinating a task together and for
awareness we realized it's really really
hard to measure awareness how about we
look for instance this for lack of
awareness which seems more reasonable
too cold so any time that they were
seeking for awareness or there was a
lack of awareness like what's going on
on your surface on your workspace bah
bah machine because I couldn't see and
follow up what's going on on her work
especially in baseline be coded that and
we also notice that they verbalize
findings a lot it was an intense session
and they were really engaged with task
we wanted to you know get the incentives
and win the prize so they were really
really competitively working on solving
the task so they were verbalizing
findings constantly to you know
coordinate a task and ever sometimes
that people were reporting their you
know findings and again there was like
what did you just said because they they
were so immersed in the task they
couldn't remember all of those
verbalization and then others so
how many people were doing this coming
to so independent entity Cohen yourself
so unfortunately i won't have time to go
through all the hypothesis and results
but for example the first one was better
performance and here clip groups are
represented by blue you can see the
significant differences between clip
group versus Bay baseline the clip group
were also variable to find the more key
documents through this time because they
had a better coordination grace line the
baseline was without that without the
partial merging or full emerging so the
only way for them to see what's going on
each other's you know workspace was to
go through those tabs individual ones
and I just just be clear the tabs would
hide the other stuffs you couldn't
actually separate out see the other
person stuff while you were doing it at
all you had to switch back and forth
between this is how these tabs and Lance
notion has been used so far mostly it's
so then building on that actually when
you're looking at this collaborative
system in the clip on the clip side and
I went to bring in your data let us say
that you have arranged George and Club
horizontally and I've arranged Georgian
club vertically what did you do for they
owe exactly that was that was one of the
question so we allow people to to freely
you know create a layout as they wanted
to and then when you're very like
clicking on Alex's tab to see this was
his own layout so it was different from
yours and you would just see what
exactly it's like looking over the
shoulder and see what's going on on
Alex's workspace but emerging button
click button click world you still had
merged somehow right yes so we are our
problem was this you know you know
bringing this especial you know thing
together so bringing all the common work
and very
changing whole diagram around the center
around the common work which means in
turn that if I that I could not say you
hey I've got both of our stuff up and I
see that over to the right here because
you're right mentality of him yes so we
thought it's much easier for each person
if we Center on based on his own or her
own layout and then we bring common work
based on them they are that you have
chosen so you keep your their stuff
constant and bring in the other things
aren't there exactly it just lets cut
your clothes rather than be confusing if
your thing was rearranging and if they
work in parallel and they move things
around while you are looking at the
merging does it move around as well and
introducing with things and then
removing some in the Mary you know cuz
in the merge view it's it's based on
your work you just see the new you don't
see while there they're changing their
spatial you know location merge when
does it update every time the system
would find a common common entity if it
managed it automatically serve right
then would not update it if they move to
that no it one it's going to be a lot of
distraction but if you instantly check
the removed but removed you will see the
exact copy of their work so if they're
changing the layout you'll see the
change of the layout every time and then
I have another results from you which
thought it's really interesting to go
through this one so hypothesis for was
less reliance on verbal communication
for awareness and you can see the
differences between seeking awareness
instances there was still a significant
difference between cliff and baseline
tools the clip version didn't ask as
much for you know what's going on
sticking everness lack of awareness and
they also variable eyes they're finding
less because I mean there wasn't the
need to constantly verbalizing what I'm
upgrading or you know what I'm finding
so there was marginal kind of sick thing
differences between these two but they
were in turn it was still interesting to
see they ask less questions about each
other's finding and they verbalize their
findings less yes for one per session
average all of them so in a 40 minute
session you're saying that people move
from talking about their findings 12 ish
times two fighters times even that seems
we're I'm curious what the experience of
these sessions was a sort of it's kind
of when we were at any era study perhaps
because we forced people head-to-head
they were talking nonstop the entire
time in fact you looks like yours was
feeling very different from that these
are only because we yes they were
talking a lot for many different but
because we distinguish a differentiated
between those so you see the breakdown
here like this much about you know
sticking a furnace this much about
verbalizing funny but they had very more
a lot you know communicating and you
know talking about their hypotheses and
so this is just a subset of their
conversation so you might actually take
the total conversation it might have
been constant between them but the
specific ones related to the
visualizations by than fear and despair
the exact instance as a verbal
communication that they referred not
anything that we interpret ourselves so
I believe there are a lot of future
applications for this project for
example we are we are talking with
Danielle about extending this lcw notion
for different you know domains or
different problems like co-authoring
document how we can notify people of
common works and help them to better do
their task as well as lcw for different
collaboration studying of course for
different for for example for distribute
as we need other communication channels
to help people to communicate like chess
and instant messages but still those you
know subtle visual cue can be helpful
for distributed team to know there is a
common work and to better coordinated
their task and then moving to the next
project this was actually a shift from
my PhD work to turn you you know work
which was understanding the public
engagement with collaboration technology
and visualization technology and this is
still ongoing you know project I haven't
been done with the results and
evaluation but this is a multi display
environment for people to better
understand the community urban planning
and this is the phase of urban planning
that the decision has been made but
people but they invite people to come to
this design shallots or open houses to
be involved in this you know coming in
this decision making and people are not
really involved in most of those open
house in a communication so the main
question this group of people from you
know landscape architecture and
community planning at UBC were asking
was like how to use visualization and
collaboration technology to bridge this
gap and to involve people more actively
into this design space so i should
mention that this project was on going
from like five years before between a
close collaboration between this
department and kelly booth from you know
computer science to build up this
multi-day multi-touch table and they
deployed it in several design chair it's
already before i arrived so this is a
picture of those deployment this is a
tabletop where people can just easily
work with you know fluid interaction
dragging and dropping building to the 2d
map and then build a new design and then
it was also based on the idea of if we
give them real feedback real time
feedback
the treaty on the wall display which was
big and we were you know they were
trying to create this immersive
environment so people can get a sense of
the treaty at the same time and then at
the bottom of the ball display you can
see these numbers and little
visualization it was their attempt to
bring people's attention to some of the
sustainability metrics the thing that
has been neglected mostly from this you
know paper-based a design Sherrod's
where people can really see the
implications on some of this matrix for
example what is the workability of the
design that you're making or more
abstract to show you know variables such
as co2 emission of this design like
transportation stuff like that so when I
arrived I wanted to answer these
questions about the limitation of the
single shared display environment to
support multi user interaction as well
as you know how we can really leverage
that but we're by bringing multi-display
environment to help people to better
interact with all the underlying data so
for this i started with observing the
system in action interviewing and
closely collaborated with expert which
actually took a long long time for me to
understand this design space and
problems and some of the challenges and
then i let the design and mentor to
students to develop new features and
right now we are in the face of
evaluation and for evaluation we are
designing this comparative study between
this system and a paper-based
paper-based session and we are trying to
understand whether the effect of this
tool to users engagement as well as
their learning and how they can better
interpret the data so by that we came up
with design objectives of okay this was
one of the problem that I observed and
it was
completely expected from the you know
videos and system in action people
didn't have a personal display display
to discover and you know customize and
work around the data so that became one
obvious problem we needed to address and
also visual history I I propose my idea
about you know visual history and all of
the experts were really well received
this idea because one of the main task
that they're doing is the comparison of
their different design at the end of
those session to make a decision which
one is going to be the best and they
didn't have a way to you know compared
their their previous design so visual
history can play an important role here
and it can also not only help them to do
their task better it can also inform us
as researcher to understand the model of
you know this decision making and public
engagement and how it works out so with
that we integrated individual displays
and we design 3 iPad application one was
to use iPad as a removed to work with
the water wall display which wasn't you
know interactive before people had to go
around the table and interact with the
table to change you know any of those in
3d wall display information and also
iPad indicator up in their language they
call those metrics indicators so became
of this idea of personal indicators
where they could customize and bring
their own metrics and get a better sense
of those metrics what they are and so
perhaps it could help them to better be
engaged with metrics and understand that
which wasn't the case before and also
the iPad history application here is a
picture of one of the cases study that
Iran just recently so you see that one
of the it was with one of the experts so
you see that one of the collaborator
decided to project his iPad display on
the wall to discuss the
indicators that he designed so before it
was just static this was only here but
with the iPad they have this
interactivity to explore and customize
and you know discuss it with
collaborators and it's also a better way
to support individual as well as group
discovery so people could just sit
around the table work with their iPad or
go over table and manipulate the data so
larger audiences as well so as I
mentioned this is not their finished and
we don't have concrete contributions but
we are planning to capture really rich
set of data to this qualitative study
like the study is going to be six people
per group as we're going to see all the
subgroups activity and the use of
different displays and how they would
like to work around this multiple
display environment as well as measuring
their learning so going beyond you know
measuring the interaction and time with
each display measuring how they learn to
this you know display an interaction
technology their engagement as well as
their collaboration dynamics one of the
questions I was going to ask you earlier
so you know previous work if we brought
in nyad's right diads work very
differently from try so now you've
looked at triads and how they leverage
multiple displays or whatnot and now
you're movin on and I think that's also
very different than moving on to a group
of six where it gets increasingly more
complex but a further more abstract
question I have is you know going back
to like 2001 we did tons of work on
large displays and people throwing their
stuff from their phone
display and tablets and none of that
ever happened so you know sure on NCIS
they're all using other you know why you
50 using the surface but actually figure
out in the real world you don't see that
that all so is this last group that
you're working with really using these I
mean before you start the study is that
the way they were actually working and
that large screens it all aren't
officially set up so you can explore
these questions because i'm actually
just asking any question how prevalent
is it in the real world that people
actually work this way it's not it's not
let's go by you know yeah very good
question you know it was interesting for
us one of the more you know different
kind of this design sherrod they use
large surfaces not interactive surfaces
but just bring large surfaces to be able
to share the results of visualization
those heavy GIS gis-based visualization
and for those they have to wait another
week or so and invite people to come
back to those meetings so very
inefficient and then they present them
with this large to create some how
immersive you know experiment and then
people are just in actively sitting
around the table and some some someone
is exactly they don't have a means of
you know engagement and interaction with
it so we are trying to change that i I
guess I wonder if it's a technological
speedboat you know it's just that you
know like Anna for doing that when we
were playing with like the surface hub
demo the other day right right it's very
clear that it's a whole lot smoother now
for me to take control with my laptop
and then let you take control with your
web top and so it's still throwing
things back and forth is not as easy
we envisioned long ago imperfect yeah I
mean yes that's exact time with deaf
yeah like you know someone else couldn't
just throw their thing up all yet his
ipad i just keep with you like you know
they talked about video conferencing for
through I never for it just like all of
a sudden it's completely place right and
it's one of those things we do it's
gonna it's going to happen and then
people bringing with every search we are
exactly trying to push that into our
scenarios right well you need project
yeah just hope this video conferencing
was like that so before you go on could
you clarify what you mean by Public
Engagement bring in public we're very
inviting public they could be like
residence of those you know those
neighborhood and the plan is just to
densify because we need to densify
cities right so more green environment
green cities one of the planets
densification and then they invite
people so the high-level decision makers
have have this goals already set but
they don't know exactly how to you know
design those neighborhoods so planners
aren't professionals exactly exactly
what I'm trying two min so yes so
planners and designers just come sit
together and come up with some
preliminary idea but the next phase is
to invite public anyone any stakeholder
who's interested in this space it could
be builders it could be like media
people it could be resident it could be
all their residents it could be citizens
of people so people are coming from this
very mixed you know background and
expertise and each of them have
different expectation for example an old
resident doesn't want to see just tall
you know apartment in front of his own
you know place there as a builder wants
to build more and make money so this is
this conflict of you know
perspective so they can see like from
there from their point of view what the
new building would do to their view yes
there so that's all that's also always a
problem working with 2d only so we want
them to leverage and I now presumably
this audience is fairly unskilled and
not necessarily willing to learn a
particular vertical you I yes the good
news is when they deploy this like in
three different design sharit they only
gave people two minutes introduction how
to play with the table and people just
learn it like people from high school
and people like more elderly people they
invited they just learn it so quickly
they had never so the usability you know
feedback we're always positive but one
of the problem was they were so engaged
at the table because it was playful they
didn't really pay attention to those
metrics and that's what we're trying to
bring more okay
by the way we definitely found when we
were doing our tabletop studies that
every project would start with five
minutes of people that are sort of like
running their fingers along it going
yeah yes exactly so just back to my
research contribution the first phase
was proposing this framework for the
collaborative visual analytic process
and the role of note taking and then
just investigating the results of
integrating this with tool and lcw
omitted and new metrics for cheap for
cba as well as metrics for engagement
and more currently as i just mentioned
the multi-display across system so my
vision for future of this work would be
more engaging design both in terms of
collaborative technology as well as
visualization so engagement has been
always the center of visualization we
want to engage people but we haven't had
a good way and concrete understanding of
how this engagement works and with you
know bringing more people to this design
space reaching beyond you know and
expert analysis we really need to work
on this engagement and for that we
definitely need to develop more theories
about the engagement and then maybe
bringing more design elements to
computer science and CS to bridge this
gap and reach beyond this audience and
explore potentials for multi touch and
touch based you know interaction which
is going to really change the way we're
interacting with machines I believe from
now on so really going and pushing
further toward more innovative
technologies and by that I think that we
need to revisit principles for cscw
because it's changing quickly with this
new technology so here are some
short-term research goals that I have
and it's based on my previous research
about not taking in the front door
and studying as well as lcw I just
mentioned four different you know
problem space and I think learning from
this multi-display environment can
really inform TST w in general so beyond
public engagement and this specific
domain but let's go back to the
participatory urban design this is a
screenshot of one of the ipad and as you
can see we have only used bar charts and
donut charts with a little bit of info
graphics in the middle because these
people really didn't pay attention to
those visualization and metrics so how
to bring more you know excitement and
engagement and make them more readable
and accessible this was actually we
bring a little bit more like details so
they can understand for example for this
household energy where this comes from
like hitting and hot father Lloyd water
lights and appliances so it's really
easy to read and work through but for
this we were only you know following the
suggestions but people who have worked
in years and years with these people in
this domain so they were like we are
only going with bar charts and donut
charts this is based on our and we
didn't want to push that but one of my
further goals is to really understand
how we can create and use different
visual encodings to help them to make
comparisons and other tasks that are
necessary and then this whole
understanding engagement with the
granularity and different level this is
the one that I proposed in this workshop
for example people just exposing them to
the visualization and I can see a lot of
this reports currently from like
visualization community that people were
really highly engaged with our tools
because we counted the number of
interaction with this video too and it
was quite hard so people were actively
engaged and to me it's just a very
shallow kind of coding for engagement so
it just comes here they just started to
be involved and interact but it can go
deeper when we are trying to end
understand how much they analyze and
then further how much they synthesize
and how they made their decision so if
we come up with metrics with different
level of granularity we can better
understand the lower engagement versus
higher engagement and for this I'm
working with Jeremy boy and Heather or
Bryon from UBC who has spent their whole
PhD around engagement and engagement
theories so more longer term research
goals switching to different domains and
exploring more ideas about more
multimodal interaction for collaboration
as well as I already mentioned that i'm
passionate about evaluation methods for
both cscw and impervious visual
storytelling is one thing that I've been
always interested to understand how this
capturing visual history can help to you
know tell a story about the whole
analysis process but more going forward
to understanding the visual storytelling
is one of my goals and visualization for
personal discovery for example I'm
talking from one of the professor at UBC
from public health informatics and one
of the problem he tries to the answer is
like how we should build you I
environment for people with severe
migraine headaches so there are a lot of
applications that helps them to record
their like severity and duration of
their headaches but really thinking
about those patients when they're in
pain how they can use and with the time
they get better there is another attack
and they're involved with others so
really thinking about more natural you I
environment user interfaces it's really
helpful and then bridging between this
you know computation on analytics and
design and fine art word is one of my
future goals and there are many info
bays and cscw research at seal out here
at MSR that I found very real
and in line what what I do or what I
would love to do in the future for
example Michelle and bill buxton work
around society of appliances bringing
all these devices together new and now
well methods for interaction between
these as well as a sketch story and the
whole self you know tracking movement
and bongseon Melanie's law and others
have been working on is very interesting
to me to follow and probably get
involved the Sundance was really an
engaging way to you know help people to
visualize their information as well as
this was a really interesting examples
of how designers designed with
visualization and recently I've been
talking with designers about their
problems with adobe said and how they
want more interactivity problem is they
don't have technical knowledge and
background in coding and finally by
crystal and bringing more ambient
display so I want to thank all of my you
know amazing advisor that I've been
working with and my car there as well as
students that I've been working on with
without them none of my work was
possible and here's the link to my slide
to my website where this slide is online
and thank you so much for your attention
looking for articles few minutes for
more questions also our guests will be
around for the rest of the day and if
there's folks who want to be slipped
into her schedule I'm happy to make
space
and one question actually you start off
by talking about how you wanted to link
say yes with art and then you went up
and talked for a while about you know
engagement and talk to a while about you
know collabera visual analytics i'm not
i'm not sure i saw where the art theme
came back in can you talk a little bit
more about that i haven't seen that
either that's a problem like it during
my research I was so involved with this
you know empowering analyst and there
were like some aesthetic kind of
investigation that I did I I just tried
I conducted a user study to see how
aesthetics will you know make a
difference in their experience I never
published it because it wasn't the best
time in my birth in my work but I
haven't been able to really really
combine these two and this is one thing
that I really I'm Kings especially with
public engagement and bringing larger
audience to visualization and cscw I see
more linkage but feel like infographics
and bringing art elements how is that
expect the analytics process sorry you
said you have an unpublished paper on
that what did you find they really love
the way to be able to first of all
customize their you know information
visualization and it really really was
interesting to see more you know
aesthetics around the it was one of the
the co-located collaborative tabletop
application which which we made some
changes in aesthetics and it was more
engaging like they had a way to
customize the color and everything in
background and work with it just more
nicer to work around
I think that link between engagement is
the sort of focus that or you have art
making things more engaging engagement
this although it's difficult to evaluate
and lots of all the other things doesn't
really help us about so your talk was
about collaborative is your another case
but the kind of work that you're
interested ms artists at least none of
them are collaborative age or another
thing some of them are like Michelle's
work is her collaboration around it and
the most from the Beast size so they do
not really we try to support the
collaborative aspect right as I meant
something envisioning to take switch
your research directions that's exactly
what I mentioned like visual
storytelling in personal health it's not
collaborated but still there are a lot
of you know engagement team there which
I'm happy to sit and work in one like
the work that Steve has been working on
I feel it has a lot of you know
potential for cold and collaborate bring
multiple user to the space too it was
collaborating it could be it's not per
se but I just like sketching side could
be as well yeah but I think that's a
very common mistake that people tend to
think that when you use these largest
display
could be setting but to make it really
like usable for collaborative setting
you need to work yeah designed
specifically for those that sketch
inside it doesn't even support two pens
so right right it's kind of a myth that
you can just get five watching that kid
were using it in front of her life but
it could really inform you know the
design firm her season it was kind of
interesting when we did this square ease
stuff we often we brought to people from
many of the different groups because
they would often be someone sort of
doing the operation someone else sort of
calling out to them and because they
could observe what they were doing
unless they use it was almost inherently
collaborative so I'll add this and is
that was kind of interesting to see
again that form factor really does
encourage that kind of thing but you're
right that it has to have a little bit
more to support it okay that case thank
you very much thanks so much for your</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
