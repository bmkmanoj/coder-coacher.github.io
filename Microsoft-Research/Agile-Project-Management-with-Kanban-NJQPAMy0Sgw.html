hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
um hello thank you all for coming my
name is Doug Thompson and I'm a program
manager on the Xbox platform team here
at Microsoft I'm honored to introduce my
manager Eric Brickner to the Microsoft
Research visiting speaker series Eric's
here to talk about his new book agile
project management with Kanban now Eric
is not one to brag so I will do it for
him
Amazon has this as the number one rated
hot new release and software design and
engineering kind of a big deal
several years ago Eric assembled the
team for the engineering services and
Xbox and I was a proud member of that
team I was lucky to be on it at the time
we were all using TFS which is the
Microsoft internal bug and work item
tracking system to manage our work and
deliverables Eric mated declaration once
the team had kind of got into a groove
and established their roles he said you
guys need to use Kanban we must use
Kanban to be better because he had found
that it was such a success in his
previous teams it was a good thing we
did that because agile is the convent a
July 8th addala G would provide an
awesome framework for us we welcome the
change and found the migration from the
waterfall like world that we had been in
to Kanban to be natural and
straightforward we could really
visualize our work on a day to day basis
basis and see the emerging patterns
easily our team broke free from the TFS
in Kanban in sorry and waterfall world
and landed in an environment that
allowed us to work efficiently and
consistently to produce high-quality
deliverables all of that is great but
the thing I've appreciated the most
about Kanban and what you're going to
learn about today is its versatility and
ability to mold around the team eric has
a few Kanban boards in the team's
hallway you just walk down it each board
runs differently
Mette is managed differently but they
all have the same results it adapts to
the various personality since the whole
point is to visualize your work some
people want to get very granular with
how they manage their their stickies as
Eric use is going to show you some
people like to manage them at a high
level but it doesn't matter as long as
everything is being tracked it followed
accordingly that's the beauty of Kanban
each team member contributes to the
Kanban there's a whole sense of
camaraderie and culture around it
there's a day-to-day conversation and
openness that we have there isn't a
central Kanban boss but there is a team
mentality so after using Kanban for a
few years now the thing that I can tell
you that I appreciate the most is that
our is that our team not only delivers
features of the high quality but I
appreciate the shift in culture that
Kanban has fostered Kanban is awesome
and with that it is a privilege and
honor to welcome Eric Brechner up here
to tell you all about thank you Dad I'll
pay you the 20 bucks later no that was
awesome thank you so much and thank you
all for coming out and letting me talk
to you for a little while about this
most talks of course have slide decks
and things like that or just a chair and
someone talks I'm gonna do this a little
differently
I'm going to actually create for you on
the board a Kanban board and I'm going
to use it for this talk okay so I'll
just take you right through it now some
things you should know about me in
advance that Doug didn't cover but I'll
cover them very quickly
I'm a little as so I've been a developer
since I was a professional developer
paid for it since I was fifteen years
old I've worked at many different
companies including soon will be my 20th
anniversary here at Microsoft all this
kind of adds up to my you know receding
hairline but but what I've had in common
all those years is I'm a little as my
wife can attest little OCD about how I
do things I just I really like being
super
fishing about everything that I do I'm
constantly trying new ways and new
things to just do a little better and
over the years just about any
methodology you could imagine in
software development I've given a try
and the reason why I wrote this book on
Kanban is because I have finally found
my own little slice nirvana it's amazing
a Doug talked about it I'm not going to
belabor that point but it's so simple
I've the book is really thin and that's
because it really doesn't require much
to describe it I do cover everything
you'd ever need to know in this book so
I hope you pick up a copy and I'll cover
some of that today and answer your
questions but it's a it's a remarkable
thing so without further ado let's
create a Kanban board Kanban board is
very simple and the only thing you need
in order to actually use Kanban there's
no separate planning meetings no
separate retrospectives or anything it's
just the board and yet it works as a
project management tool for just about
any workflow that you happen to have so
with that let's get started the first
part of the Kanban board is the backlog
so this is the collection of stuff you
need to do you don't want it all sitting
in your head or something like that you
need to write it down so you write it
down on a sticky which we'll be doing
and you put it in the backlog simple as
that
after the backlog you have your steps so
the steps today that I'm going to be
doing is I'm going to be answering your
questions so what are the steps to
answer your question right
well first step and this won't come up
much but it can come up and I want to
make sure that I capture it is that you
may need to break down that question
sometimes people ask really big
questions and they're actually made up
of lots of small questions so the first
thing I'm gonna do is break down the
questions so I'll have a break down I'm
not going to be using it much but it's
important to have it there this comes up
a lot more in software too
often you have a feature that comes in
and it's big it has lots of different
pieces to it so you really do need to
break it down before you actually work
on each piece you break it down into
tasks sometimes the features are very
small if they don't get broken down at
all
but a lot of the time you do so it's
important to have that step the next
step is after break down the question
I'm gonna answer it
fair enough and then after I answer it
I'm gonna want to validate make sure I
answered the person's question I'm gonna
want to double check because I'm trying
to be a good speaker here today that's
it that's my comp on board it has just a
couple more elements to it I'll go over
those elements and I'll start taking
your questions this really is this
simple okay so a couple of other
elements each step has a I'm working on
it and I'm done with it so there's two
columns to each step and that's
important and you'll see why as we kind
of go through it but that's an a very
important element of Kanban now many
people do use boards when they're doing
just about anything when they're keeping
track of work at home maybe the kids
homework or something like that when
they're obviously when they're doing
software development or working on a
project people often have a board that
tracks the work and they have a big done
column at the end okay one of the things
that's different about Kanban is that
it's done columns for each step and that
is an important distinction okay now why
have the done columns for each step
there's some really complicated stuff we
can get into if you're curious but one
of the things that the done columns do
is that it enforces you to think about
whether or not you're actually finished
with each step you don't get to just
move the things over you actually have
to obey some kind of rules
so there's done rules
so there's done rules for each step all
right laughter just as an example we've
got my breakdown step so for my
breakdown step if I'm gonna break down
the questions how do I know that I've
broken it down sufficiently well I'm
gonna say for argument's sake that when
I break it down each of the individual
questions I break it down to takes less
than two minutes to answer right that
would be a nice small question in real
life you know on our teams it's
typically when you break down a feature
you break down to the tasks that are no
more than like one to three days each
right that way you know you've kind of
gotten it down to a workable chunk but
here less than two minutes to answer
that'll be my done role then I know that
I'm done with it
okay for the answer for me to be done
with my answer I want it this is being
recorded I'll want to repeat the
question and then answer it
okay so I'm done if I've repeated the
question I've answered the question but
of course I may not have done a great
job of that so we'll want to validate it
so I won't be done with validate until
I've asked the questioner and they have
said yes that does in fact answer my
question okay so there are my done rules
I've got it done rule for each one now
in software development the done rules
might be more like for breakdown tasks
or no more than one in two days for
implements which would be the natural
thing for answer for implements it would
be the usual things you have for
implementation it's been code reviewed
it's been unit tested it builds it
passes the basic check in tests right so
those would be the done rules for
implement and then for validate it might
be we've pushed it out into production
within a small ring it's validated
nothing came up it went maybe into a
second ring and now we think we're good
to go it's done okay so it just depends
on what you're doing you can see the
flexibility that Doug referred to these
these these done rules they can be
specified by your team the steps you can
make them whatever steps make sense for
what you're doing if this is a list that
you have at home a lot of people use
Kanban at home believe it or not those
done rules can be you know like your
list of honeydew's and the done rule is
I checked with honey and she said it is
good right so whatever works for you you
can set those rules however you like but
the important thing is that there is a
sense of done this ensures that you have
quality at every step which is something
that many other methods don't ensure but
it helps a lot in delivering value
continuously to your customers which is
a key thing about combine alright now
before I get into the very last element
there's only one other element and then
we're done and I want this talk to last
more than just you know
minutes or so so before I get to that
last element any questions yes I want to
point out that another reason for having
a done column is without it you kind of
have a push model whereas with it it's
pull model which is really really
helpful okay so let's talk a little bit
about pull I realize it was more of a
comment but other questions yes schedule
so you've talked about backlog but you
didn't talk about schedule yet in how
okay schedule and probably estimation to
go with that all right schedule an
estimation look they're going to my
backlog right that's just what you would
expect yes
what about how teams transition from
scrum scrum could you add a scrubber
ball sure and in sync transition I have
been told by people who who love scrum
and everything that this is very similar
and it's not a transition so I'm gonna
go evolve okay so we evolved from scrum
yes it's full versus digital online
boards yes if you have dependencies that
are deeper than how to manage that
that's date driven
and also there was a loaded question
because there were dependencies in there
oh you're breaking down before you've
left you back I 3d fancy-looking here I
was breaking down the questions early
and I should have left it for that step
but compounds really flexible cultural
change yeah wait wait a minute yes
that's EFS that's the team foundation
server service thing that tracks all of
our work as a large group yes how about
Kanban specific project metrics project
metrics yes a bit about how branching
models with publishing branching and
publishing
yes using Kanban across a team that's in
different geographies Wow okay you know
I'm gonna put that with the online
boards those two related yes oh and I
will repeat the questions you know as I
answer them coming up that one was about
how do you deal with teams spread across
geographies yes breaking away from
timeboxing benefit versus time boxing I
hope I get to that one that's yes one
scale and the next one is management
exception scale and that's managed whole
management change
um so scale of the methodology skew you
know I work in a team with objects
within osg Dell to osg yes exactly
I'm with an OSU to definitely can do it
yes how do you integrate threat modeling
with this threat modeling
I'm gonna need a bigger pad yes and
something go backwards in the process
backwards
yeah the Vista or perfect a team size
that the smaller can work with and
whether this applies to a one kind of
okay sure
team size yes can you speak like the
advantage or agility that you might gain
in this versus a waterfall pure
waterfall Jill the T versus waterfall
yes Amy ownership board tests doneness
ownership tasks and and doneness
associated with that yes okay those are
two different things and it's not a
breakdown gosh darn it those are two
different questions I already won deaf
implementing with my expertise yes tasks
for his bugs in part addiction ah
and I'll talk about prioritization of
that too any others yes
estimation techniques story playing ok
I've got that one on there so we're good
yes how do you measure whether it's
working fine or not with this um so one
was measures of success
okay any others for now live by the way
we can add more at anytime of course yes
pipelines and orchestration of parallel
work at it oh okay so I'm gonna call
that swim lanes if you don't mind okay
yes my team practice but they were
penned a forward room with the processes
involved any tips on how to not burn the
tea with the processes but still have
them okay not okay it's not burning with
process and two flex pay yes all right
one we should you just come down and
when we should not okay short answer the
second one okay no the question was when
not to use combo or when to use it so
I'll say when to use any question if
it's outside of the two to three weeks
sprint how do you use it
is it similar to this project okay so if
it's beyond the length of the sprint
okay let me get to answering some of
these and then we'll them they'll keep
moving on worried that it's so many that
we're not gonna get to talk much okay
nonetheless I will still take more and
put them on the board and I can also
promise you that every question that
people have asked even the cultural
change one is actually answered in the
book it may not be you know particularly
to your liking or something that you
want some more but of course I'm still
around you can ask me I'm I'm in the I'm
in the Gallup in the whatever that's
called an oil outlook the address-book
okay so I was gonna get to what is the
last element here and there's a reason
why I left it off it's because the thing
that's a little bit complicated for
folks to understand but it's what makes
this project management everything up to
here is visualization of work okay there
are some done rules that's a little bit
of project management but mostly it's
visualization of work and there are lots
of people as I mentioned before who will
put stickies on for all their work and
move them along board and all that but
they still need some other form of
project management ways of tracking
their work and making sure things don't
go badly whether it's scrum or waterfall
or some other interesting method they
need something in in Kanban you don't
need any of those things but you do need
one more element and that is what are
called whip limits now whip just stands
for work in progress that is work that
you've started but you haven't finished
okay and whip comes up so much that you
know they have an acronym for it so work
in progress what you want to do in to
make this project management is to
control the work that's in progress
that's what makes it project management
okay so what are these whip limits all
these whip limits are are a maximum
number of stickies that are allowed in
any step that's all they are
now how you set them is what's
interesting so typically the way that
you set them
is you start with the step that's going
to take the longest okay in this case
clearly that's answer all right and you
set that value to be something that's
gonna allow you to work smoothly you
know have enough flexibility but not any
more than that because you want to limit
the work in progress and the reason why
you want to limit the work in progress
is that's that's what gives you all of
your agility if you don't have much work
in progress on any given time it's very
easy to switch and do something new you
have that agility it's very easy for you
to produce stuff and get it out the door
quickly because you don't have much ever
that you're working on at any one given
time it's all getting right through the
system okay so you want to keep it low
but high enough that you can get stuff
done so in the example here I'm gonna be
answering questions sometimes there's
two related questions or something like
that so I'm gonna want a little bit of
flexibility here I'm gonna go ahead and
make my lip limit I'll make it three
just to be safe it's just me someone
who's knows how to do this is
complaining but it's just me I'm gonna
make it three I could probably knock it
down to two I don't think I'd want to go
below two there will be times when I
need to do more than one question at a
time all right
once you have your whip limit so no more
than three questions at a time and
answer once you have that one you want
your other steps to match their pace to
the middle step and there's all kinds of
queueing theory about exactly why this
needs to happen but basically your
fastest possible throughput is going to
be when all when the speed of stuff
moving through the board is fairly
constant if this goes too fast if you
pile up too much work here it's just
gonna pile up all right and then you're
gonna have all this extra work in
progress and then when you change course
or something like that you're gonna have
to throw this away and that's terrible
alright so you don't want this piling up
here and you also don't want stuff
piling up over here without it being
validated so you want the validate to
move it right through okay so you set
the whip limits for the other for the
other steps to match the
pace of the middle step now that may
seem slightly complicated
no worries there's an online spreadsheet
that comes when you get my book there's
an online spreadsheet you can grab it
has all the formulas worked out for you
you just enter in some basic information
it sets your whip limits for you so in
this particular case I'm gonna make this
one and this one because both of those
were really quick they don't need to be
any any bigger than that like I said for
breakdown most of this stuff is gonna
fly right through okay we've got our
whip limits now key point about the whip
limits is that they limit everything in
that step both the stuff that I'm
working on and the stuff that I'm done
I can't keep just piling on okay so even
though there's it says one here it can
be sitting here or sitting here there's
never more than one in the entire step
whether it's done or not that turns out
to be extremely important in getting the
flow right if you're allowed to add more
and just build up your done column bad
things happen the other thing is that
I've made a little mistake this final
done column here that's as big as you
want it to be you're just finished with
stuff entirely so that last would whip
limit really just applies to the working
on it
the final done column that's basically
infinite and that's it that's our entire
board bill
this is their kind of a similar fun with
your breakdown column to just breaking
down any question into another couple of
questions is gonna be bigger than one
okay so the question I'm gonna answer it
right away and you can do that in Kanban
you get mail you get little bugs you get
little things that are very quick to
just do right away you can do that there
are no Kanban police there's no Kanban
army there are no Kanban zealots
hopefully okay no one's gonna beat you
up for just making this work for your
team so I'll just answer that one right
away for the breakdown step the
refers to the questions coming in when
they get broken down and they get broken
down say into three other questions
those are kind of clustered together as
one but then as I answer them they
become individual the flow remains the
same in smooth okay so let's start
getting going and we'll start with
priority someone asks how do you
prioritize okay very straightforward
thing in combat we've got a backlog
we're gonna order it now I could spend a
lot of time ordering all these different
stickies carefully putting it in some
clever order and then later on things
change you know if few minutes people
start complaining or asking about
something else or something like that
that would be kind of a waste of time so
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to kind
of clump I'm gonna clump and the thing
that I'm most important the thing that's
most important is this what am I going
to do next okay so in the middle of
answering priority let's see we'll do
capacities related to that project
metric so I'm gonna move down a bit team
size and geographies on line
dependencies super important
evolving from scrum I want to cover that
as your success expertise put that with
dependencies bugs and but that would
scrim somewhere I figure it went that
close enough all right close enough good
enough for me to work with you think
this is a little funny right I mean can
I just arbitrarily do that in an actual
team what we do is we have a daily
standup this if you're familiar with
scrum a lot of you've probably used that
in scrum it's the daily scrum when I was
doing waterfall years ago we still had a
daily stand-up we still met and talked
about you know that day what we're gonna
work on all that sort of thing
so a lot of people are used to doing
this that's what we do every day
every day we get in front of the board
we talk about the backlog we talk about
priorities we talk about any blocking
issues anything people need to discuss
but we don't have to talk about and like
scrum is that we don't have to talk
about what we did or what we're going to
do next
cuz that informations right on the board
and you can move the stickies any time a
day whenever you like okay because
there's stickies if you just move them
so no big deal so you just mostly focus
on what are the issues of the day one of
the things that you're going to talk
about of course is okay do we have the
right priorities are there any new
things that they need to add any new
questions come up in my particular case
right that sort of thing so even though
I was pretty rough here and just sorting
just a little bit to get the priorities
right for the order in which I'm gonna
answer these questions I can change that
anytime and you'll notice I will that's
because this serves me I don't serve it
okay likewise for your team's so for the
priority we just put everything in
priority order obviously your customers
your stakeholders are gonna have
something to say about that whenever
they do we have stakeholders on our
teams they are pretty insistent their
stuff is the most important things in
the world no problem we take them in
front of the board or we describe it to
them and we say hey where does yours fit
in and they can look at the board and
they can say you know what the colonel
fix is more important than what I'm
doing but I think it's more important
than this can I put it here and sure
that sounds good or will say actually
this is this and like you know we have a
discussion it's not terribly complicated
it's very visual did I answer the
question who had priority difference
between scrum versus Kanban is that in
scrum you lock beyond the Puri right so
income bond it seems like it has come
since fluid yes so the what the
questioner who put this up commented on
was that in scrum the priority is kind
of fixed it doesn't have to be I've run
scrum teams where we're pretty fluid
about that too but definitely in combine
it's very fluid and that's because in
scrum for those who are unfamiliar with
it it's a particular project management
methodology and they time box what's
called a sprint so you plan out
everything you're gonna do in a sprint
the Sprint's last one week to four weeks
you plan it everything you're gonna do
and then you do it you don't mess with
it and then you get the plan again at
the end of that time box at the end of
that month or week in Kanban you're
continuously delivering just like I did
every day you've got new stuff that
you're finishing there is no time boxing
at all so in that case we have a lot
more flexibility which is very nice did
that answer your question we're done
with our first thing now you notice a
bug came up during validate all right no
now you probably wouldn't think of it a
bug was a follow-on question right but
in a certain sense if this is like work
and I'm working on features or tasks or
something like that I got to validate
but there was something that I didn't do
quite right so I just took care of it I
took care of it and moved on if it had
been a big thing if you had a really big
fall on question I could have written up
a new question new sticky put it into
the backlog and prioritising that's
basically how it works let's see let's
talk about dependencies going over
capacity here okay let's talk it append
dependencies and you know what expertise
comes right into this though I'm going
to put that right here yes full of
question on that thing if that had been
a bug and you would put that in the
backlog would you still move priority to
the dog column yes I would okay that was
like an email I can answer it right away
I don't have to put it on the board
quick answer but big things you want on
the board and we'll get to that again in
a moment let's talk about dependence
these dependencies are really rough on
all of us so this is when you have work
items and they depend you know tasks
stickies that depend on other things
right and those other things aren't
ready one of the ways they may not be
ready is because you have some expertise
on your team there's one particular
person who could do that task and
they're busy doing something else so
they can't work on it right away
right both of those cases they're
similar in that you have a work item you
have a sticky that gets blocked so what
do you do so what we do and Doug's team
actually came up with this idea thank
you Doug is we add a new marker we add a
new column right in the middle called
track okay so let's say my dependencies
question has a dependency I can't answer
it I put it in the track column okay now
what the track column does first things
first the track column does not count
anymore towards my whip it's off the
board in some sense but we're keeping
track of it because we can't work on it
right now we have to wait for that
dependency to free up or in the case of
the expertise we have to wait for that
person to become available right so it
sits here in the track column and it's
right there on the board
so at our daily standup one of the
things we do is we talk about the items
in the track column how are they doing
is there ready yet is it going to be
ready soon as next week when is it oh
it's ready now fantastic okay it's
unblocked wonderful when it's unblocked
goes back now we can work on it now if
we were at our whip limit if we had if
we already had in this case three
stickies filling up these areas then it
obviously couldn't move right away but
as soon as that got freed up it would be
at the top of the list the reason why
it's at the top of the list is that it's
already higher priority
that's how we would count into the board
in the first place it's the top priority
we just couldn't work on it right away
so we just put it right at the top
instead of pulling from the left we just
put it right there
yes you're fatter inter-team
dependencies so bigger fatter
intertwined dependencies quite a while
to do this thing but I'd like to be
working on right right yeah this is
exactly what I'm talking about so in
that case this guy would sit right there
and track until that team was ready and
had delivered it now if it was a big
deal and it was gonna be six months or
something like that
that's what project planning is about
that's when you're really thinking about
how you're ordering your backlog all the
usual coordination that you would do
regardless of what project management
technique you were using you would have
some conversation about how we would
time it right but if it's yeah that you
know the priorities right and it moves
through the board but they're not ready
yet then we put it in the track and we
track it every day if we say oh it's
gonna be next week we'll just leave it
there and not talk about it as much but
the next week would talk about it yes
stickies you said represent work that is
scoped to about wonderful yes yes but
I'm losing here is tasks that you know
themselves don't value
I don't value okay the accumulation of
several yeah right so the question here
is each of these tasks they could be
fairly short and by themselves they
don't deliver value we could move him
all the way through the board they could
be done but the actual value is in the
collection of tasks together much like
how it originally broke down right and
absolutely that happens all the time we
just you know an Xbox we typically use a
switch of some kind that prevents that
collection of work from actually showing
up to a customer until all the different
pieces are done so one of the last
is gonna be switching it off did I
answer the question about dependencies
no objection moving on with expertise
with expertise there's a few different
ways you can handle expertise all right
one is you block on it right so it's
treated just like a dependency another
way that I prefer actually is that if
you have people who are specialists in
one thing or another and they're busy I
hate it when I'm in a situation where
one of the members of my staff could be
on vacation or sick on any given day and
it gums up all the works that's really
just not a good way to run your team so
what I typically do instead is if we
have that flexibility if there's someone
available I'm gonna give that work to
someone who's not as familiar with it
and I'll use the person who has
expertise as their backup mentor code
reviewer all that sort of thing right
and then that's gonna mitigate my risk
now I'm not gonna do that for everything
there are some tasks that really really
they're big things I really do belong to
one person that makes total sense they
should own it but you know for for some
items you really don't want to put
yourself in a situation in which you
know you're just gonna be stuck so that
would be my recommendation did I answer
a question about expertise good all
right
evolving from scrum so scrum I'm for
those of you not familiar I mentioned a
little earlier scrum has these ideas of
time boxes and there was a time box in
question here as well I'll just move it
through when I'm done so I scrum has
this idea of 1 to 4 weeks you just focus
on a set of work that you plan in
advance and at the end of it you ship it
so using Kanban going from scrum to
Kanban is actually pretty simple you
probably already have
word you're already working on things
and moving them all the way through you
already have a definition of done you've
got a lot of the you got a daily standup
right you've got a lot of the elements
of Kanban already so it's really not
that much of a stretch all you do is put
your steps up on the board if you don't
have them already add a done column to
each step put in some whip limits again
using my cutesy little spreadsheet
that'll tell you exactly what they
should be and then just track your work
on the board you can still have your
sprint planning meetings if you like you
can still have your sprints if you like
you can still do your retrospectives at
the end those of you who know about
scrum know what I'm talking about
you can do all those things it's all
good it works pretty much the same this
is what I did when I first started using
Kanban I took two of my scrum teams they
switched over to using Kanban they
worked exactly the same as they did
before for a while after a while they
got really good at Kanban they got
comfortable with it it made sense they'd
adjusted the whip limits a little bit to
match the individuals on their team
you know just moving up and down just a
little bit fine-tune it and after a
while they realized that they didn't
need the planning meetings anymore
because it was continuous they realized
they didn't need the Sprint's anymore
because there wasn't a beginning in an
end they just keep moving stuff through
they realized that they didn't need the
respect respectives anymore because the
retrospectives were all about when
things got blocked and messed up and all
that was happening right in front of
them day to day they could see it on the
Kanban board because one of the things
the whip limits do is that they enable
you to see anytime work is blocked
if the validate step is taking too long
and just sitting there eventually all
these answers are going to be in the
done place and they'll be stuck because
the validates taking a long time right
you don't need a retrospective to notice
something's wrong you'll notice a right
then you don't have to wait till the end
of the month this is true for just about
everything that goes wrong on a team
except for major things like hey are we
gonna have a brand new change in
direction or hey there's a personality
problem between these two people and we
really need to talk about or whatever
else but the regular things that we used
to talk about at retrospectives they
come up all the time same day every
minute of the day right there on the
board so we didn't need to do those so
eventually it just became Kanban but the
initial transition looked just like
scrum we kept our scrum master we kept
everything yes almost time do you spend
every day as a team managing this board
so the question is how long do the
stand-ups last and they can vary they
can be as short as five minutes they can
be as long as a half an hour it depends
on really what the team wants to talk
about but actually managing the board
takes very little time that just takes a
few minutes as well as like editing of
the new features or anything again
what's to get you must try to use some
time right thanks something like so
about adding features and all that
doesn't that take up some time yeah it
takes ten minutes so what all the adding
the moving of the stickies all that sort
of thing doesn't that take time that can
be done any time of day
all the movement around the juggling of
the stickies that can be done any time
of day now you put your own life at risk
if you start changing the priorities all
by yourself without consulting with your
friends but but that can be done at any
time so it really doesn't take the stand
up doesn't need to take much time at all
and stand-ups
now for my teams where we range three to
ten people ish all right
so for that number of people doesn't
take very long the compound has been run
with his teams as large as 75 and it
still takes less than 15 minutes because
again not everyone's talking about what
they did or what they're doing next you
only talk about blocking issues and
those blocking issues are really evident
on the board question you talked about
deployments and if you have an ops team
doing employments if you don't have you
cannot set up to do continuous
deployment right production
wheezes I've got it on the board I got
so this is about publishing and stuff
like that we're in deployments I've got
that one
yes sir garden scrum on traditionally
there's like a sprint planning session
where the items are you propose the team
talks about in our design review
sessions whatever are those meetings
schoo hello or one of those okay so the
the question again going back to scrum
which we're in the middle of answering
I'll take care of it immediately was
about and when do you do all the stuff
that you typically do during sprint
planning like breaking down features
into tasks and planning out who's gonna
do what and all that sort of thing
they're breaking down into tasks that's
the breakdown step so it'll just happen
continuously everyday doesn't have to
happen in some special planning session
the assignment also happens continuously
every day who's ever available takes the
next icky if they can't take it because
they're not prepared to take it
something like that then we have that
expertise issue that we were talking
about earlier yes notes and sending them
to the team or Kanban board that they
only our chief architecture so the
question was during the stand up are you
taking notes and sending the team or is
the board the only artifact the board is
pretty much the only artifact the only
time we're sending notes beyond the team
is when we finish something big and we
want to show off which happens a lot yes
in scrum you have an idea
like when you will be able to deliver a
particular thing because it's either in
this print or not that's bad estimation
in planning that when things will happen
I will get to that yes what are you
doing you have an excessively large
backlog what do you do about an
excessively large backlog you don't
sweat it you don't sweat it everybody
has an excessively large backlog they
mean I realize it but they do there's
always way more than you can ever
possibly achieve that's called life yes
so this is kind of getting bad for the
expertise question what if you have a
team where it's really a bunch of small
teams where these two people work on
this service at least two people worked
on that service and you're really not
sharing a backlog across the entire team
so if you have split up teams
we're running a little long on time so
if you have multiple teams and they
really don't share much with each other
they're working on their own backlogs
give them their own boards it doesn't
take up much space okay I'm gonna move
on a little bit make sure I talked about
branching and publishing and about bugs
and we'll see how we go from there
did I answer the question about scrum
we're good good so what about branching
and publishing so what's going on here
is you finish a bunch of work right but
it's not all as soon as it comes over
here it's not necessarily really done
because it needs to get published
outright maybe it's a new release of an
app maybe you're publishing out to to
production for a web service or a
website maybe you're just integrating
right maybe you've been doing a bunch of
work in a branch and you're integrating
it up to the main branch or something
like that there's lots of reasons why
there's like a publishing step what we
typically do there is we divide up our
done area into its pending pending
integration pending publishing pending
whatever it is and it's got its
published so when it gets published all
the little stickies that were in that
little pen get move down here and the
next set of stickies keep building up
until it gets published again there's
nothing really that we need to do other
than doing the publishing step but this
allows us to know when things are
actually out there did that answer the
did that answer the publishing question
yeah
so it wasn't my question but with the
publishing would you do that even as
multi-level like if you have are eyeing
multiple steps would you track
everything like oh now we moved up and
from an l-3 don't know if there were
multiple publishing steps couple
different ways you could do that if your
team is in charge of it you're gonna
have those steps on your board
yeah if your team wasn't in charge of it
relax okay think someone else is gonna
take care of it we don't have to worry
about everybody else's problems thank
goodness I know some people do but okay
what about bugs
so bugs are a little different from
features
how would you track bugs so there's a
couple different ways to do this one
even the teeny weeny bug we've already
been through this there's a small bug
you can take care of it right away
just take care of it no big deal it's
just you know a little bit of noise you
fix it you take care of it done okay but
they're also bugs that are really big
and they're gonna require some design
work and they're gonna be broken down
into pieces and they're gonna have
multiple tasks associated with them
they're gonna need to be implemented and
validated and all that
in that case they're yet another task
you write them on the sticky you put
them in the backlog prioritize it
accordingly you push it through did I
answer the question about bugs yeah if
you get rid of the timeboxing the
prioritization of bugs versus features
is significantly easier problem mm-hmm
it is come ons awesome yes but bugs if
it's a customer reported LifeSite issue
that's a bug that's reported how do you
deal with that then so if it's something
you can fix immediately you fix it
immediately now I used to run all the
websites for Xbox and typically when we
had a live site issue there'd be an
immediate fix boom you just take care of
it like answering your email you know
you're just right on it but that patch
is it but it doesn't fix the underlying
you know fundamental problem so we fix
it right away we create a sticky for the
underlying problem we put it through
that was my
cool let's talk about geographically
distributed folks and online boards so
having a physical board is awesome it's
fast
it requires no skill to write new
stickies and move them around it's
visible everyone in the team can see it
all the time there's never any question
about where things stand it's just there
all the time it's great right so that's
really nice I love having a physical
board it makes a big difference when you
have an online board yeah it's like a
webpage or something like that or an app
and it allows you to move around the
stickies it seems the same but there's
extra overhead for members of the team
to actually work with it they've got to
launch the thing get to the page when
they're creating something they're using
the keyboard and the mouse and all that
it's just more work and if that's a
barrier turns out engineers are
notoriously lazy it's just awful I mean
yeah you can bribe them with pizza but
that only goes so far
right you need to have zero barriers for
your engineers to use the system which
is why the stickies and just a physical
board and you move it so easy that's the
way to go however if your team is
geographically distributed obviously
it's impossible to have that physical
board that everyone can get in front of
so in that case you're going to use an
online board and there's lots of
available including one that's actually
built into TFS and you can use that
another one that I really recommend is
that there's lots of just scratch pads
just these virtual scratch pads and they
have stickies on them and you can move
them around just like a regular
whiteboard you can use that very
low-tech very easy to use it's not quite
as good but you don't have much choice
for a distributed team
did I answer the online boards question
sure so what about the online common
boards or Visual Studio online I have
played with it
it's missing the done columns for each
step I have talked to them about this I
told them I wrote this book and there's
a problem with your board and they said
oh shoot we'll fix that so in the next
release of TFS which is I think coming
out the spring that will be fixed yeah
so is it like Kevin yeah its built-in
and the information about its online yes
I'm still kind of curious about aside
from the visual representation using an
online board the time aspect of it
because when you're all in one place you
can go and meet you know for a stand-up
meeting for a few minutes everyone kind
of sees what's going on but I have never
heard so the question has to do with
what about timing now we've got an
online board but what about timing for
the daily stand-up kind of thing
just a few minutes but nonetheless it's
problematic when people are time shifted
right in every book I've read and every
personal experience that I've had
there is just no replacement for getting
together on a regular basis there just
isn't so someone's gonna have to do it
during breakfast or at night or
something there's just no getting around
it unfortunately yes question but I'm
actually serious is the team that is
implementing the online Kanban board
using an online Kanban board I do not
know I all have to ask them that's a
great question I have no idea if I were
them and they were all situated nearby
I'd be using a physical board
okay let's see when to use ownership the
test I want to get to the one that had
to do with big big groups okay and then
one touch to that scale to hear this
scale to osg before I get to that one
before I get to that one benefits versus
timeboxing since we talked about scrum
before the biggest benefit relative to
time boxing is that since you're
delivering value continuously every day
all those problems that you have with
synchronizing with other teams right
because your sprint length whether it's
a week or four weeks whatever happens to
be may not match up with your customers
with your partner teams your upstream
and downstream partners all that sort of
thing bringing your customer for the
demo at the end of the month maybe
they're busy that month maybe they want
to reschedule maybe there's all this
extra stuff around that length of time
and also if something big changes right
in the middle of your sprint now you're
stuck right either you completely blow
up your sprint or that you just have to
wait
none of that happens with Kanban ,
doesn't have any time boxing whatsoever
you can give demos to your customer any
day you like and you should because it's
great to get customer feedback but you
could do it every day you could do it on
their schedule rather than on yours
after all they're the customer you
should be accommodating to them right
all those problems go away one of the
great things that happen just with Xbox
one of the things we had to do in order
to start shipping once every month which
is what Xbox does these days you get an
update to your Xbox one every month the
website gets updated every day one of
the big issues of getting to do that
every month is we had to synchronize
every team's shipping schedule every
team sprint whatever methodology they
were using for my team that was nothing
happened we were good we could fit with
anyone cuz we ship all the time
yeah so without the sort of spread kid
then how do you answer the question if
someone says I need you to do this thing
when can it be did when will it be done
right so there was the estimates thing
here somewhere there it is
Thanks okay did that answer this
timeboxing question wouldn't minor
clarification like the time box you feel
they could provide you a little bit of a
focus at the end of his friend and then
I give things have gotten unstable it's
a it's a chance to kind of reset and try
not to do that again how do you not just
sort of devolve into we've got to we've
just touched too many things and okay so
the question the question is about one
of the nice things about the time boxes
is that you kind of create some churn in
the system and the time box gives you a
chance to kind of get settled at the end
of the Sprint and make sure that all the
bugs are out of the system you're nice
and stable and the answer to that is
with Kanban because there are done rules
at every step because you can't move
from here to here because the done rules
are right on the board everyone sees
them all the time because you can't move
along you don't build up bugs technical
debt all that sort of thing if you do
have one by all means write it on a
sticky put it on the board
drive through clean up that technical
debt but it just doesn't build up we've
now been running Kanban for four years
actually three years I guess on my
current team that Dougs tugs the PM for
one of my teams we've been running that
now for three years we have never had
that issue ever its combats awesome
okay did that answer the question say
the same about scrum though doesn't
people say lots of things vets crumbs I
love scrums I use scrum for eight years
I'm never going back it was great but I
found something better
okay four minute warning thank you and
these these two are the most important
outlying questions so I'll make sure
I'll get through these scale to osg osg
for those you don't know is the
operating systems group it consists of
only about 13,000 engineers and other
folks working on the operating systems
Xbox is one of the groups
there's also Windows Phone obviously
Windows client it's a big group and how
do we fit into that group well the way
that OS g tracks work is in TFS which
we've mentioned a few times that tracks
all our work items as well as all of our
bugs it's a great system it's
hierarchical so you can have a work item
that's like ship phone and then it can
have lots of children and those are yo
all the different pieces of shipping the
next version of phone and then ik that's
gonna have children and so on so it can
kind of break down hierarchy it's a
pretty nice system and the key thing
though is that for it to work for us to
kind of fit in for our teams to kind of
fit in in that large organization and
all the tracking that's going on using
the TFS system our stickies need to be
in TFS but our stickies are on the board
and I just told you how it was a bad
thing to force engineers to try and
update something online because they
don't do it and it's overhead to them
that so I volunteered Doug and and for
my other teams there's a p.m. on those
teams they got volunteered once a day
when you know for any for any of these
stickies that we're tracking high up
Doug just sits down in a chair we used
to keep a chair right across from the
board
he sits down with his laptop you did at
the end of the day as I recall updates
each of the the corresponding work items
and TFS that correspond to each of the
stickies if they moved around he updates
them never took you more than ten
minutes usually
a few minutes done we are integrated in
as far as everyone else knows we're
using waterfall or something
to get our work done in fact we weren't
and we fit right in with everybody else
no problem when you think about what
about the planning in the top-down
planning and all that that just
determines what our backlog is gonna be
and helps us a prioritize an order or a
backlog the last piece of this of course
is estimation and I'll get to that next
does that answer the question about osg
yes quite you think if they're with
estimation but I'm still concerned about
how that fits with osg level scheduling
and the expectation that particular
things will be delivered at particular
time right so let's get to scheduling in
estimation then but otherwise clear
enough on how we coordinate yes so when
you're going through something there and
it you identify another task or breaks
down to more just Doug go enter those in
yes assuming that when whatever you're
planning the question is when new
stickies get created is Doug enter them
as work items so if those are work items
that we're tracking you know up in osg
absolutely
he creates new work items for them types
in the stuff and there you go stickies
though that you work on purse through
that you know yeah we do some technical
debt the question was are there stickies
that don't end up in TFS yeah we do a
certain amount of this work just for the
team fixing up technical debt cleaning
up some things whatever it might be
little tools that we need that we may
not track in the system because no one's
knowing why extension of that just so we
always pay attention to it does Doug
have an intermediate set of deliverables
that he's thinking about above the tasks
layer but sort of below that osg are you
layer take any questions about what Doug
you know it was responsible for an old
things
let's talk about scheduling an
estimation before we finish up here so
this is a big deal right we do have
customers or partners of internal
partners or maybe even external partners
that need to know when we're going to be
done with certain things they want to do
some planning right they have a
dependency on us when are you going to
be finished right so it's important to
do estimation it's important to kind of
plan out a high-level schedule right the
way that that's done is also fairly
straightforward now your team may have
its favorite technique for doing this
maybe it's story points maybe it's
wideband Delphi maybe it's t-shirt
costing maybe it's using project and all
kinds of fancy stuff you can do that
that will all work it's not any
different workers work you can plan it
out in whatever way you're most
comfortable that's fine if you want to
make it a little simpler or be more
Kanban II the way to do that and again
you don't have to do this you can do it
the way you've always done it and it's
fine and you will produce work at a
certain rate and and you'll adjust your
estimates accordingly
Kanban turns out to be very quick but
nonetheless you can use whatever
techniques you'd like if you want to use
a Kanban like technique something that's
more related to directly what you're
seeing here the way to do that is just
to count how many stickies you complete
in a given period of time say two weeks
or a month just count it's not
complicated
they're stickies just count them that'll
tell you how many stickies you do per
day on average then you count up how
many stickies you have the O in priority
order right how many stickies you have
that are going to go through that system
now those are going to be broken down so
there is an estimation step but the
estimation step is one that's very
intuitive the estimation step is hey if
we were to break this down how many
stickies do you think we'd get
right which is a very intuitive thing
people can figure that out pretty easily
they'll make a guess that may not be
perfectly accurate but estimation never
is they'll make that guess you can write
it down right on the sticky and compare
and contrast when we actually break it
down you take the total number of tasks
stickies that you think are gonna come
out the other end you multiply that by
how long it takes for each sticky you
have your estimates again in the
absolutely free to you if you buy my
book there's spreadsheets to do this for
you you put in all your things you
estimate how many tasks each of them are
gonna be you put in your rates that you
get from this or it calculates it for
you boom it'll give you dates because
it's just not that complicated actually
and then you can do all the scheduling
stuff that you like okay did I answer
the question great how are we doing in
me do I have time for one more we're
good all right we've covered all the
important stuff everything else
including the answers to the remaining
questions are in this book there's even
a QuickStart guide a troubleshooting
guide rood q and a's checklist the best
