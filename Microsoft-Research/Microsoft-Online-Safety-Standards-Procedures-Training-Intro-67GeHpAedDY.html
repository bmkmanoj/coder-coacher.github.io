you
alright welcome everybody my name is Bob
Heba i'm a senior solution manager with
TWC and welcome to today's training on
the microsoft online safety standards
and procedures so as it says if they're
why the microsoft online safety
standards and procedures they really the
same gym procedures provide a way for us
to consistently provide a safer and more
more enjoyable internet which sounds
kind of strange when you think about it
because you know i'm kind of stumbling
alright so sorry i usually don't get
morning nerves that's right so it's it's
a way for us to to provide consistent
coverage on our products and services so
that when a consumer goes from one
service to the next they aren't confused
by you know why is this okay on one side
wise not why is it different on another
we want to have a level of consistency
and it provides guidance to teams
especially new teams as they're coming
along a lot of us in this room have got
experience with doing online safety work
for years now but four new teams as they
come on board this is all brand-new
stuff to them and then sometimes it's
confusing they don't necessarily
understand why they're being asked to do
this and so they're looking for guidance
on how to do it so the online safety
privacy of the microsoft online safety
standards and procedures is a living
document it's one that while we have it
now in its current form it will go
through a regular updating process and
as we as we have new issues that come up
as we have new areas of coverage that
need to be addressed it will be updated
to do those much in the same way we do
with our privacy standard so it's
designed to help users find the
information they need this is an actual
screenshot of of the of the standard it
cut its divided into five distinct
sections at this time the first one is a
terminology section I'm not
really go into that with too much today
because most of you I think know the
terminology there will be at points
where some of the terms that come up
there'll be a little things that appear
little snippets of information to help
you understand what that is but I think
you know for the most part itself except
evident if however I missed something
please feel free to ask I'm happy to
explain we're going to do filtering
user-generated names this is a common
one that we tend to deal with for any
any kind of product or service that
allows people to choose user names it
allows them choose like Microsoft
accounts for example uses email
addresses they have to do this sort of
thing to to provide a more enjoyable
environment for everyone codes of
conduct many people are aware of a terms
of use or they're aware of a EULA but
some people aren't aware of what a code
of conduct for y is why what is it when
is it needed why do we have it we also
are going to have abuse report reportage
report handling so if somebody says hey
there's some bad behavior going on in
this environment with this product or
service how do we how are we set up to
properly address that and we're set up
to properly mediate that and then
finally child pornography which is
obviously very sensitive subject very
it's very challenging sometimes to even
talk about because it can be
uncomfortable but it's something that we
have to realize isn't a real problem
that exists with internet products and
services and so we have to make sure we
moderate it it doesn't take long to get
comfortable with the microsoft online
privacy standard or the microsoft online
say i'm playing safety standards and
procedures hey it's not a huge document
at this point in time I don't think it
will ever necessarily get to be as big
as the as the as the privacy standard
but that doesn't mean it's any less
important so the nice thing is because
of the brevity of at this point it's
relatively easy to consume and
understand and also the way it's laid
out so the core concepts of it customers
have to have a safe and trusted online
experience so
what a safety mean doesn't mean where
the internet police no think of it more
as we're kind of deep right trying to
provide security the reason I the reason
I say this is because we clearly can't
control what goes on on the internet I
have in fact seen people right into
Microsoft and say well you guys control
the internet and here's something going
on in the third party site and I don't
like it I need you to take care of it
clearly we can't do anything about that
but what we can do is in our part of the
internet we in our products and services
we can take steps to try to make things
enjoyable to make them feel safer to
make them feel more welcome to make it
feel like a place that they want to be
at in addition the potential harm to
users there's also a risk of damaging
Microsoft's reputation the goal should
always be to increase the level of trust
people have with our products and
services some of the behavior that can
go on and just make it an environment
that people just don't feel like they
want to trust their information with
they don't feel like they want to have
their children on they don't feel like
they want to spend time themselves on
and this is all about trying to make it
so when they see a Microsoft branded
product there is a level of trust that
they feel comfortable going on to and
spending you know spending their time
spending potentially their money it's
also important to remember that this is
a diverse products and services group in
an audience that we play too it's not
just us centric so there are cultural
societal issues there are economic and
geopolitical issues that we also that we
often have to take into account over the
years that I've worked with this we've
often seen instances where things that
if we look at them only from a
perspective of redmond in the u.s. like
it seems perfectly fine but
understanding that different people in
different parts of the world have
different views on these things we want
to make sure that we moderate
appropriately
and these standards and procedures apply
to all Microsoft services that allow for
the big collector hosts user-generated
content content whether or not they are
hosted on Microsoft servers or whether
or not they are hosted on a vendor on
our behalf but what about third-party
services what if we are hosting
something on behalf of someone else for
example with the juror these don't apply
the services that operate on behalf of
that Microsoft operates on behalf of
other companies where they have their
own rules and everything else so
sometimes this creates a little
confusion but it's it's it's you know if
you just think of it is is the same is
this Microsoft property oops is this
Microsoft property whether or not you
know we are in fact hosting it ourselves
or paying somebody to do it then these
apply and user-generated content
includes any content or information that
user can create that is posted publicly
or shared so for example images photos
you can see special offers applications
comments text location-based information
there's all kinds of information a lot
of times people just think of oh if it's
just a comment form or if it's just
allowing them to post pictures or videos
Jodi oh hold on ladies going to bring a
microphone up to you I'm Jodi from xbox
yeah I've a question about applications
so in the previous slide you talked
about third parties aren't within the
scope of the policy are you talking
about apps that are not that don't go
through the certification process like
some other app or are you also including
cert apps like store apps for example
well they're gonna be apps that that we
create that are our products and
services what's that that's not sorry
let me back up this scenario is I'm
Netflix yeah I go I haven't a microsoft
certified app that goes through our
store that we ingest in
display to customers is that covered by
ugc our policy him one stay into that so
this if third parties are hosts are
putting applications on our stores then
they are covered so what that means by
covered though it means that through
that store that marketplace there needs
to be a code of conduct that tells
people who are posting applications up
there what's appropriate and then there
needs to be a place for people who are
using that marketplace to say I had this
app I felt was inappropriate so it's not
within the application telling them how
they need to deal with user-generated
content is treating the application
itself as user generated content I know
that's kind of tricky so so it's not
telling a third-party app that they have
to what kind of content that that are
how that they have to have a code of
conduct or that they have to handle
abuse reporting in a certain way but
what it is saying is that if somebody
comes to our marketplace and they find
an app that they feel does not meet our
the standards for that marketplace
because we say within our marketplaces
what's okay that they can complain and
say I found this app that i thought was
inappropriate or was violating the code
of conduct that you had for your
marketplace and i think and that would
tell us we should take down that app
from our marketplace okay yeah
so so that kind of gives you a summary
of really what the purpose of the code
of the privacy microsoft online safety
standards and procedures is about let me
open up real quick see if anybody else
has any questions no oh okay let's see
kim will get you a microphone yeah on
the previous slide can you give me an
example of location-based information
ugc that we that we would be worried
about I mean an example well for example
if i was on a an internet forum that was
posted by Microsoft for example and you
and I were having a discussion maybe I
wasn't upset at something that you had
said or I'm just a jerk I can't post
your location information if I if there
was a way that I could find that out I'm
not allowed to do that um does that make
sense yeah so but it's not a technology
based thing then it's kind of like a no
it's not yeah comment I mean like they
could just make a comment so it sort of
kind of falls in that category too i was
thinking like is it something about
what's attached to a picture or you know
something else that could be generated
in some fashion right no from an online
safety standpoint what you find
sometimes if you go through internet
services that allow people to interact
you will see from time to time where
people get into flame wars right there
battling with each other or or somebody
comes in and says something incredibly
stupid and everybody gangs up like it's
like blood in the water and they're
sharks attacking and all of a sudden
people will start posting like here's
where this person lives here's their
address here's the phone number here's
where they work it becomes like this
this insane scenario that goes on the
code of conduct is really going to stop
that from happening code of conduct is
what's going to you know because we're
going to forbid that is going to give us
the power and authority to come in and
say and take that content down because
we you know it it's not a safe
environment at that point
and it's unreasonable to 241 to expect
that that would be an acceptable form of
interaction on that forum that yes maybe
this person said something that was
either really dumb or maybe even
inciting the anger of the crowd that
doesn't mean that they necessarily
should become the victim of some sort of
online bloodbath witch hunt yeah I was
going to say witch hunt but but you did
it for me so you think it's also would
be the the location of the posting this
is where we get into kind this is a
pilot and we would normally wouldn't
talk about this but yeah I think that
the confusion here is that we're talking
about types of user-generated content
and what it sounds like from your
explanation is that location-based
information might be included in a
comment so it's not that it's a unique
type of user-generated comment content
it is a substance within a posting that
somebody might type up so it may be that
we shorten this list or even just
bringing examples into it right so it
might be a good way to illustrate this
is to say here's an example of a image
photos videos that went bad and here's
how it ties back to our policy here's a
nap things like that so we need to add
some inappropriate content to the
training sir so some slightly
inappropriate stuff but no I think
that's that's probably fair yeah I think
it's I mean there i think you know for
in a case like this for the for the
photos like you can illustrate that
simply with something we'd talked with
three years back in the windows live in
msn days which was when people upload a
photo it's not uncommon for especially
photos from from mobile phones mobile
devices that it may have GPS coordinates
associated with it and how do you what's
the best way to handle it in some cases
that's very usable for example a product
like photo symp it actually uses those
GPS coordinates to create the synth so
that when somebody goes and sees like
say
the space needle or the Eiffel Tower as
they move around it it geo locates those
photos so they can see from this
position on the ground this is what you
would see however if I'm taking pictures
of my son outside of school I don't
necessarily want the picture to go up
with the GPS coordinates where it's like
oh here's my son at school so now
somebody can look at them and go oh I
know where this kid goes to school now I
think there's a way that we can
illustrate that without necessarily
getting too saucy but that's a great
question thank you Nicholas you have a
question I was just wondering if the bar
that we set for what is appropriate
content and what is inappropriate
depends on the app or the application
that is presented in so could I speak
about birth control methods on a medical
site a forum but i could not on the site
design for children for instance III
think absolutely i think this the sites
have the capability of determining
what's appropriate for them for their
audience and stuff and i also think that
it may be you know that the site chooses
to say look you know when you're talking
about this this is not in context with
what the subject is and you know you see
people do that all the time they're
people who will inject totally non
sequitur arguments in at any given time
any given thread because that's for
whatever the reason their passion there
or they're just trying to stir things up
I think the example I gave of the photo
is actually a very good illustration of
that because in one site in wonder one
context the GPS coordinates on attached
to the photos are relevant and necessary
for the service but on another site they
may not be and so we just we we have to
decide we have to take it on a
case-by-case basis because we just
because they're not necessarily relevant
for me to have the GPS coordinates
attached to the photos of my son in
front of his school does that mean that
we put a hard line and we say they can't
be there or is it better to put up a
notice to allow people to make the
choice for themselves I think that's
oftentimes up for the business to decide
what's best
and if if there is that sort of idea of
relevance and the site and
appropriateness on the site would that
extend not only from user-generated
content but also to advertising good
advertising break these same rules
because the ad is inappropriate for that
particular site and not just its
irrelevant because it's you know it's a
car ad on a medical site but if it's a
dating ad on a child's app for instance
it would that be considered the same
kind of thing I I would say yes because
I know that we we deal with that from
time time I I know from from the
experience I've seen we've had apps that
have inappropriate advertisements in
them and the teams are scrambling to
make sure that that's adjusted and they
try to keep it relevant game at
something a couple points we'll get to
when we get to the scenarios one thing
about the online safety standards is it
is not dictating what the code of
conduct needs to be for a given service
so it is saying that codes of conduct
snead to need to address the same types
of things but it's not so each service
to a certain extent can decide what's
appropriate and not appropriate for it
so this is really more about saying that
a service needs to decide and state a
baseline about what's appropriate
behavior for that service and then it
needs to have the ability to for people
to complain and for that to be moderated
right with a consistent muttering so
it's really more I would say the more
important thing is that you have to
state what your expectations are about
behavior you have to enable people who
feel that that expectation is not being
met to complain and you need to be able
to address it in consistent manner they
online safety standard as it is today is
not set it saying that the company as a
whole has a certain level of what's
appropriate and what's not appropriate
so it's about enabling people to
services to state what they feel is
appropriate and making sure that
customers feel like that's being lived
up to that makes sense and as far as ads
go this policy does not cover ads
because ads aren't considered
user-generated content in the scope of
this policy those those same concerns
that do exist but they're not addressed
by this policy
that makes sense okay very good any
other questions no oh well thank you
very much for some great conversation
I've been some great questions thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
