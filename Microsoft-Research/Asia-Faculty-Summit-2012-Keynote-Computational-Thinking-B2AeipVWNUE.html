thank Microsoft for inviting me to give
this presentation at the faculty summit
I also personally want to thank hon hon
hello because it was the faculty summit
and the 21st century computing
conference in 2005 which hon organized
under the leadership of Harry Shum and
it was at that those two events where I
had this idea about computational
thinking and I decided I'd try it out on
the Chinese audience I had never given
any talked about this before and I was
supposed to talk about predictable
software but I decided in my first you
know three to five minutes of my time I
would try this idea out so it really was
a germ of an idea in 2005 and so what
I'm going to do so now my three to five
minute talk has turned into an hour talk
which I'm going to compress into
probably 35 or 40 minutes but what I'm
going to do with you to what I'm going
to do is actually explain how far we've
come both in terms of computational
thinking in research and I think of a
special interest to this audience is
computational thinking in education so I
want to be sure to cover all my stories
and examples but really make sure i get
to the education aspects because i know
many of you are thinking about your own
curriculum on your campuses and also the
implications for pre college students so
i'd really like to get to that so let me
just start by sharing with you this
vision in fact I think I showed this
slide in 2005 and my grand vision is
that computational thinking will be a
fundamental skill used by everyone in
the world by the 20 middle of the 21st
century so we're not quite there yet we
have some time in fact I think in the
past seven years we've we've gone much
further than I expected now when I say
this i mean you know in substitute in an
exaggerated way
computational thinking just as
fundamental as skill is reading writing
and arithmetic this is that quite
ambitious vision but it's good to have
these far-out visions and it's of course
quite incestuous this vision in that it
will be computing and computers that
will spread computational thinking the
implications in with respect to this
vision are twofold one is of course in
research what does this mean for
computer science researchers but also
what does this mean for other for
researchers and other disciplines and
I'd like to argue that every other
discipline has already been influenced
by computational thinking or is being
influenced as I speak and so the first
half of my talk will try to make that
argument by going through a lot of
disciplines and showing you examples of
how the influence has spread from
science to the arts the second
application is one of deer interest to
all of us and that is in education and
certainly at the college level and above
i think it's it's a given by my argument
about research influence that
computational thinking will be important
for every student the question really
the challenge question is what does this
imply educationally in terms of pre
college students what we call in the
united states k through 12 k for
kindergarten 12 for 12th grade um so i
literally so you can see by the date of
my three page article that my enrolling
of this idea at the microsoft faculty
summit in 2005 it really was a germ of
an idea that eventually i wrote a down
in a three page article it's a very
short article i encourage all of you to
read in fact it's been translated into
chinese so you can all read it and
understand it's very good translation by
the way okay so before I talk about
computational thinking I think it's
important to for me to share with you
what I think about what computing is
because you can't talk about car
k tional thinking without talking about
computer science or computing and so to
me computing is the automation of
abstractions the idea is that you have
some kind of automaton on the bottom it
could be a machine that could be a human
being because humans compute or it could
be what I think is the new paradigm of
computer today which is networks of
humans and machines working together and
so the idea is you have some kind of
machine on the bottom but what what is
it executing what is it animating what
is it automating its abstractions that
we as human beings think of in our heads
that's what computer science is all
about we have you know machines and we
have all these layers of abstraction and
we you know write them all down we
expressed our abstractions concretely in
terms of some programming language and
write some code and then all of a sudden
the machine can actually animate these
abstractions so to me computational
thinking focuses on the abstraction part
of this picture so I'm not going to talk
about machines and humans and networks
of humans and computers and so on I'm
going to talk about abstractions and to
me computational thinking is all about
the process of abstraction and for so
for us that what does that mean it means
when we are faced with a problem it
means choosing the right abstractions
that's the art of computing if you will
that's what machines still can't do
automatically it's it still takes human
ingenuity to think of those abstractions
and that's why i say computational
thinking because it's as tyll tyll
Eric's dream comes alive in you know our
grandchildren's age humans are still the
thinkers and again as you know in
computer science the way we've been able
to build complex huge systems is through
layers of abstraction and I think what
distinguishes computing from other
science and engineering disciplines is
that we actually operate at multiple
levels of abstraction at the same time
so if you just think about a compiler
immediately you're talking about the
source code in the target
code and then and of course given that
an abstraction is just a mathematical
object we can talk very formally about
the relationship between these layers
and define abstraction functions or
simulation relations and so on so all of
what i just said however is not new to
computer science and computer scientists
did not invent this mathematicians use
abstractions all the time so what's a
little different in computing is that
our abstractions are guided usually by
certain measures we want efficiency we
want correctness so for instance when we
come think of an algorithm which is just
an abstraction of a process that takes
some inputs and follow some instructions
and produces some output we often ask
questions about it like is this the most
efficient algorithm that we can use to
solve a particular problem where
efficiency it met is measured by time or
space and I think the new one is power
but we also ask about not just how fast
is this algorithm take or we also asked
about correctness does does the program
compute the right answer or does it
compute anything at all what's known
commonly as safety and liveness
properties so these are the typical
kinds of questions we might pose of a
given abstraction but of course there
are other Ilah DS if you will for the
abstractions that we invent given a
problem at hand an abstraction we've
invented we're going to ask about
simplicity and elegance scalability
usability modify ability all the kinds
of things that in fact typical engineers
ask of their abstractions or their
models of the physical world so what I'm
really trying to say is that coffee
tential thinking is not this mystery
it's really a blend of mathematical
thinking and engineering thinking so let
me summarize that computational thinking
compliments and combines mathematical in
thinking it certainly draws on
mathematics as a foundation because in
fact of course mathematics is the
foundation of computer science so you
can't help but use mathematics when
you're doing computational thinking one
difference however is in our mathematics
you can work in the idealized world you
can say for all X X over some infinite
domain on you add you can add you know
prove properties about elements or and
the main types that you know wouldn't be
representable or reachable by some
hardware device so in computing of
course we are restricted we to buy the
limits or the physics of the underlying
machine here's a machine again so be it
a laptop or surface or your phone or
your brain because after all the human
is a computer too so in computational
thinking yes were the abstractions all
come from mathematics and we know how to
manipulate those abstractions using
mathematical reasoning but the kinds of
objects that we represent in our
extractions are going to be limited by
the physics of the underlying machine
computational thinking also draws on
engineering thinking as I mentioned
already but there's one difference
between computing as an engineering
discipline and any other engineering
discipline like civil engineering
Electrical Engineering mechanical
engineering and so on it's what I think
makes computing unique can anyone guess
what I'm thinking software because in
software you can do anything in software
you can invent virtual worlds where the
avatars defy the laws of nature defy the
laws of physics in software you're only
limited by your creativity you can build
anything you want in software and that's
a difference on anything a challenge
colleges you in terms of your
imagination and creativity when you're
using computational thinking so I when I
talk about computational thinking I
really focused on the ideas the the
abstractions and not the concrete
representations of those ideas like the
hardware or the software and I do think
it's for everyone everywhere so before I
go on to my examples I want to just be
little concrete by what i mean by
abstractions and i listed up here some
classes of abstraction they're all very
familiar to you you probably teach all
these abstractions to your
undergraduates or graduate students in
computer science so you know if you
major in computer science you're going
to come out of computational sinker
that's actually not the challenge um and
I don't I don't really mean to go
through all of this but just to go just
to be concrete what I do want to show
with this slide is when I talk about
computational thinking I'm trying to
distinguish computational thinking from
computer literacy so when I talk about
everyone in the world should be a
computational think or know some kind of
computational thinking by the middle of
21st century I don't mean everyone
should know how to use word or excel or
learn how to use Google or Bing that's
gonna that's do everyone knows how to do
that that's not a challenge but it's
thinking deeply thinking inventing
abstractions knowing how to analyze
those abstractions in terms of
efficiently someone that's actually what
I'm talking about I also don't mean
computational thinking is computer
programming computer program certainly
it's not only is a skill that all
computer scientists learn and use sort
of how you when you're reading and
writing you just learn how to write and
read but its interpretation and thinking
about what you're writing that's deeper
than just you know the physical act of
writing or reading so so so now in
summary I just mean that computational
thinking is the thought processes
involved in formulating a problem and
expressing a solution in a way that a
computer human or machine can
effectively carry out so computational
thinking is what
comes before any computing technology we
are we're very we it's too easy in
computer science to be swept up with the
technology that comes out and thinking
that that's all of what computing is
about it's not computed the community
technology had to come from somewhere an
idea in someone's head and that's the
computational thinking part okay so now
I'm ready to start with my examples I'm
going to start with examples of
computational thinking in other
disciplines and let me start with one
discipline that has been greatly
influenced I believe already by many
different computational methods so what
one discipline do you think I might have
in mind don't be shy i'm looking at
michael jordan for a reason what biology
is that surprising that AI said biology
okay thank you candice okay here's
another test question um what event
caused i think the biologists to
recognize that the computer scientists
might have something to bring to the
table in terms of advancing their own
field Candace you know I think it was at
least for me in my you know observation
of the world as an outsider the shotgun
algorithm algorithm expediting the
sequencing of the human genome I think
awaken the biology communities saying
hey maybe you computer scientists have
something more than just hardware to
bring to the table of course a lot of
the hardware helped but i think the word
album that was starting to bandy about
this is so old now that we forget that
it was a big deal back then and then
since then i'm going to just give you
lots of different examples here of how
other computational
kids have been used to study biological
problems and what's common to all these
models and languages that I'm showing
you here is that many of them are
designed to understand the dynamics of
multiple processes interacting with each
other you think of an operating system
what did I just say multiple processes
interacting with each other so it's no
wonder that models of computer science
might pertain to the challenges of
modeling multiple processes interacting
with each other in biology and I'm let
me just give one example from my own
research area which is model checking on
to give you just a hint of how computer
scientists and biologists are working
together to try to tackle biology
problems so how many of you here know
what model checking is okay so if
there's anything you get out of this
talk for the computer science faculty
here in China it's a taste of what model
checking is it's a off-the-shelf
technique so I highly encourage all of
you to go learn about it okay so mama
checker is literally a block box and
what it takes there are two inputs one
is a description of the system that
you're modeling in terms of a finite
state machine and the second input is a
property often expressed in some kind of
temporal logic or some kind of logic and
the idea is you want to determine
whether every behavior of the system as
represented by this finite state machine
satisfies this property it's a
verification problem because you really
want the answer to be yes every behavior
of this concurrent system that I'm
modeling with my finite state machine
has no race conditions or has no
deadlock you'd really like to verify
that before you say launched it in
Windows 7 so what what the mama trucker
does is you push the button and out
comes the answer yes every single
behavior represented by this finite
satisfies this property dead like
freedom but more often than not you get
the answer no but you get a very
interesting no answer you get an example
of a behavior that does not satisfy the
property so that's called a
counterexample and it's this advantage
that a this verification tool gives you
a counterexample that has made model
checking and off-the-shelf verification
technology for many hardware companies
for instance so now I where what does it
have to do biology so that's my next
slide um here's just an example of a
recent work by colleague of mine who's
been working with biologists in
understanding the interaction between
diabetes and cancer and I'm not going to
go through this in detail but they
created a state machine model of the
proteins that inhibit or actuate each
other in terms of representing a
diabetes cancer model a single-cell
diabetes cancer model so this is
basically a state machine you can think
of these as variables and they're either
on or off and you can think of the
arrows as determining actuation or
inhibiting and then you can express all
sorts of interesting properties in ants
and ask questions about diabetes and
cancer which risk factors are related to
others and so on and so in I'm not going
to again go through the details but you
can actually express these English
language questions in terms of formal
logic and then feed it to them to the
motto checker and this is your state
machine which is really just a boolean
arm state machine you can think of the
variables as being bull answer on or off
and so what's of course nice about this
technique model checking is that it can
handle very large state spaces so this
is actually a 2 to the 49 states space
model and you can basically a feed into
model checker pushes button and answer
these kinds of questions and so this is
just an example of a kind of question or
conclusion they can come up with based
on
this particular model diabetic risk
factors might not increase cancer risk
in normal cells but they will promote
cell proliferation of the cells of
precancerous age and so on so this is a
very recent work and just a taste of
what you could do in with using model
checking in biology okay so I very
quickly tried to argue that at least in
biology there have been many
computational methods that have been
used to model for instance the dynamics
of interacting processes and I just
showed you one one example one example
method model checking but let me flip
the question let me ask the question
what one computational method has had
influence on a broad range of
disciplines now let me look at Michael
Jordan again machine learning are you
just teasing me okay machine learning
has for instance I think and you could
argue with me which way which direction
and went transform the fields of
statistics and coming from Carnegie
Mellon where we have a whole machine
learning department you can see why i
say it this way as opposed to statistics
has transformed the field of computer
science because of Carnegie Mellon we do
have a machine learning department which
is really made up of professors and
statistics with professors of computer
science sitting side by side so and also
I remember many years ago a PhD student
in computer science came to up to me and
he said Oh Jeanette on interviewing I
interviewed a very large Midwestern
university in their engineering school I
got an offer from their computer science
department I also got an offer from
their statistics department and his PhD
thesis was a machine learning he said I
don't know what you know there's the
center part is really good and commuter
size not so good what should i do and i
gave him advice and so on because yes
Junior faculties think about his career
path and so on eventually he chose
statistics of which I think was right
decision for him but what was telling to
me was that this statistics department
saw the future and they wanted a PhD
computer scientist who understood
machine learning and so in all other
fields now we see that you basically
seven years ago I had to really make the
case but now I'd hope they got have to
make the case so is she learning the
sciences we already heard from eric this
morning about machine learning in
astronomy and there's being working
cosmology was she wanting in medicine
I'm cutting giving a summary of Eric's
talk now you didn't mention meteorology
okay so one of my favorite examples
comes from Cogley colleague of mine Tom
Mitchell it in the computer science and
machine learning department Carnegie
Mellon who's been looking at UM
analyzing massive amounts of fMRI scans
scans of your brain to understand what
parts of your brain light up when you
see what different kinds of words a verb
or adjective and so on and so he's
basically applying machine learning in
computational neuroscience on machine
learning everywhere outside a science
and engineering so machine learning is
used to detect credit card fraud its use
on Wall Street for good or bad it's used
in one in the US when we go to the
supermarket we get the we go check out
and then we get these coupons that tell
us so would you like to buy something
rather and they're using machine
learning to look at our behavior detect
patterns and spit out the right coupons
machine learning is obviously used in
recommendation systems reputation
services and so on and it's even been
used in sports to analyze how pro
athletes train and and sort of / for
certain movements so that coaches can
teach the college kids how best to do
certain moves so this is a very quick
example of a machine learning question
that has long resulting in a hole
class of algorithms and this is typical
problem in machine learning where you
have a set of images and you want to
find the dividing line between say in
this case the faces for the non faces so
find the function or the separator
between the these dots so the first
thing we're going to do is abstract the
problem so find the separator between
the red dots of the blue dots and why is
that interesting because what you want
is if there's a new image that comes
along you want to immediately classify
it's the face it's an otter face so
that's why you want to find these
functions so of course in real life it's
visually not so easy to see what that
separator is and of course in real life
it could be a curve in sub n dimensional
space so that's really the the nature of
the sort of now imagining a zillion dots
not just a few dots I can draw on the
slide and and more and n dimensions not
just two dimensions ok so here's the
question that Michael karen's posed and
I like this example because there's a
both theory and practice that resulted
from this question which is kind of set
of weak learners create a single strong
one and so a large is a classifier that
a weak learner is one that kind of gets
some of the dots wrong when you're
classifying it and a strong one is the
one that gets lots of dots right and so
here's it's just an example I made the
the blue dots crosses in the debt a red
dots dashes just for visual convenience
so what you do is you basically oh and
the answer is yes and there's a whole
class of boosting algorithms that came
out of figuring out what the answer to
this question was and you can see how
old this result is and so here's an
example of how boosting works you just
pick a classifier on and then you look
to see how well you did on the training
set and you see that the blue cross's
have been misclassified so you boost
their weight and so you do this again
here's another weak classifier
the red dashes are misclassified so you
boost their weight and so we'll just
iterate one more time there you go so
that red dash is wrong though stupid
cross is wrong and you have three weak
classifiers which as you know the punch
line is going to be you combine them and
you get this perfect classifier so this
is just a hint at to as to how the
boosting algorithm works and boosting
algorithms now is just run-of-the-mill
kind of machine learning that's been
used in a tumor classification it's
using reputation services it's used used
everywhere and eric and michael jordan
are really the experts who can tell you
more than the knee okay so that's what i
did was i had one example in biology one
discipline multiple methods that flip of
that one method multiple disciplines now
let me just walk through a few more
examples to show the breadth of
computational thinking in other
disciplines so in other sciences in
chemistry and physics and the
geosciences let me just tell you one
physics story this was a story given to
me by Scott Aaronson who's a faculty
member at MIT in theoretical computer
science and he collaborates with
physicists and he's been working in
quantum computing for a number of years
and he was working with a physicist
trying to understand this particular
kind of quantum computer called
adiabatic quantum computing and this
particular kind of quantum computer you
express the problem that you're trying
to solve in a kind of structure called a
hamiltonian and you can't easily read
off the answer in that structure so what
you do is you can you modify transform
that hamiltonian into a a different
hamiltonian and you can easily read off
the answer in that second that
transformed hamiltonian and in fact
there's a process by which you can make
the two different hamiltonians converge
towards each other so the question he
asked of the physicists as a
computational think are was how fast
does this convergence process happen
natural question for a computer so
scientists remember i talked about
efficiency they had never the physicist
had never asked that question before the
existence of the process was good enough
for them but how fast they never asked
it of course Scott was very interested
in the answer because if it were well if
it were polynomial he fast he might have
some hint at the P equals NP problem so
he was very keen to know what the answer
was and so after some hard work it turns
out it's very actually quite fast until
there's small window where it's
exponential so it's good result to know
that we still haven't corrected equals
NP problem but the physicists were so
excited by just the simple question
that's God asked that he told me this is
cod story now that he went that the
pizza business is one around and asks
the same question how fast is this
process converge of many different
processes that they had been studying
for four years so that's an example of
computational thinking applied in
physics it's got nothing to do with
programming or running machines or
anything it's a way of looking at your
problem asking questions that you would
maybe not have ever asked before ok math
and engineering I'm not going to go
through examples here but you can see by
the way at the end of my talk I have
references for all these examples moving
on then to computational thinking four
disciplines outside of science and
mathematics and engineering but for
society on one of the hottest topics
right now in computer science its
convergence or the intersection of
computing and economics and there's a
lot of this is actually being driven by
the computer scientists in ad auctions
and keyword bidding and so on kidney
exchange needing the computer scientist
and the economist to start talking to
each other and this is having more and
more certainly at Carnegie Mellon I know
at microsoft research as well in
computational thinking in law so I'm
going to
you a short example when I was at the
National Science Foundation a patent
lawyer came to visit me on he had just
written a book and he said jeanette i
wish i had read your article before i
published this book because I then it
would have called a computational
thinking in patent law and so he went on
to give me all sorts of examples of how
in how first of all he's trying to
advocate that patent law in the US has
to change because computers are going to
change the whole way that legal system
needs to think about patent law but he
had an example which I wanted to share
with you and which is there's a company
in the United States called called
oral-b oral-b makes toothbrushes okay
and he said there was a an employee at
Oral B it's a PhD in physics who was
handed the problem by oral-b to
determine the optimal placement of the
bristles in a toothbrush for maximizing
cleaning your teeth very natural
question for a toothbrush company to ask
now this physicist this he was not too
happy on his job he didn't really want
to calculate what this optimal placement
might be so he decided he would throw a
genetic algorithm at it let the computer
figure it out and interestingly to the
surprises of physicists arm the the
genetic algorithm determined that the
optimal placement was when they actually
crossed each other and so the reason
that he the patent lawyer was interested
in in all of this shenanigans was you
know who gets the patent you know the
one who invented genetic algorithm the
physicist thought to use a genetic
algorithm or will be the software so
anyway that's why he wrote that book but
I thought that's a great it's a cute
example and it's true too true story
okay another example I want I like to
give a health care i'm not going to
cover this because eric did it
archaeology so this i'd like to talk
I like to cover because this is
specifically of interest to msra they
had an e heritage project I don't know
if it's still going on which I think was
one of the first projects that brought
computing to to history and archaeology
in this case and there are lots of more
recent examples of digital archaeology
journalism in Northwest there's a
university very famous in journalism
called Northwestern University in the
United States they just started a
computational journalism degree program
on humanities this is another favorite
of mine again when I was in the National
Science Foundation I had visitors from
the National Endowment of the humanities
who came to me said Jeanette I want to
do a a big data challenge competition
competition join with the NSF and I want
it to be you know what could you do with
a million books and at the computer
sciences I thought a million votes with
a million but how about a billion books
and then I realized that you I
humanities scholar to someone in history
or english or literature a million books
is a lot of information so can you
imagine you know if you read a book a
day for for all a hundred years if you
lived a hundred years you could only
read some thirty six thousand five
hundred bucks a million books is a lot
of information and the idea was you've
got scholars from different parts of
humanity's history literature and
linguistics and so on all of a sudden
seeing patterns across this million
books that no one scholar could ever
detect on his or her own so that was a
actually the project was funded I was
refunded and sullen and lots of
interesting stuff came out of it okay
now now now we're down to brass tacks
okay what so if you will for research as
far as every other discipline being
affected whether it's a professional
discipline like law or medicine or
research discipline like humanities or
science I think it's it's just there
already it's inevitable it's in size
engineering it's there already so what
does this mean so research it i think is
done what about education so let me just
argue that because of my argument about
research graduate-level education is
taken care of itself now what's
happening on campuses at least in the
United States is what does this mean for
undergraduate education and i will cut
to the chase and just say that many
campuses are at least in the united
states are now revisiting their
undergraduate curriculum not specific
for computer science certainly but
specifically for first-year students and
most importantly for non-majors what
courses should be offered to non majors
to spread computational thinking that's
what's going on on campuses right now
including Carnegie Mellon so I'm going
to get to that a second the really tough
question though is K through 12 so
that's the question I posed the
community many years ago already again
while I was the National Science
Foundation which is what is an effective
way of learning computational thinking
by a pre college student and this really
breaks down into two questions the first
one is probably the most important what
concepts can students learn when so for
instance when is the right time to teach
recursion or think about when your child
learns to long division usually in the
United States it's in fourth grade when
you're nine years old I hope that's
still true when you when a child learns
long division why don't we use the
general word algorithm and that they're
just learning an algorithm to divide one
number into another number to get a
quotient and remainder what's the big
deal why don't we just use that word
maybe children at nine years old are not
ready for that abstract concept I don't
actually know you know as a computer
scientist I don't know anything about
education or cognitive science so I was
challenged at the community
to work specifically with educators and
cognitive learning scientists to start
addressing this first question and this
first question means research questions
really understanding in a most
fundamental way what are these concepts
in computing and how when is the right
time to teach these concepts Frances
back to my question about recursion I
remember asking this question of the
other age when I was at NSF and the my
fellow ad in the social behavior and
economic sciences was a linguist by
training he said to me janeck recursion
what's the big deal language is
recursive everyone learns how to speak
in some natural language and I said yeah
well you know it's not like we go around
instantiating you know and recursive
Brammer every time you utter sentence
there's something something not natural
maybe as a five-year-old in learning the
concept of recursion but I actually
don't know and some of these concepts
concepts might be innate and not learned
I don't know so I think there's some
very deep interesting learning science
questions behind my first question here
and my analogy really is is to
mathematics we somehow figured out by
the time you're 55 years old you have
some sense of number by the time you are
12 years old you can learn algebra you
have enough mathematical sophistication
to learn algebra by the time you're 18
years old you can learn calculus we
somehow figure that this out over
decades and centuries of teaching and
learning mathematics so it's in some
sense it's not surprising we all have
answers to this in computer science
because we're a very new field the
second question is actually very related
to the session that a new Gupta will be
heading later this today it has to do
with technology and enhancing learning
of computational concepts so I'll let
Anu just answer that question for us
okay I want to give you one simple
example of how computational thinking is
Ashley
very natural to use in daily life and
this is me at the National Science
Foundation my second day at work at the
coffee station and what do i do I I go
in and get a cup and it puts a milk in
it I put some coffee in it I put some
sugar in it get my lid then a napkin and
then I leave so you know your were all
computer scientists what do you what do
you see when you see this coffee station
what do you think you think that's my
path you think how inefficient is
especially in efficient when there's
someone in your way someone your way
someone getting a cup of would you want
to get your lid and then when you want
your cat caffeine in the morning you
just want to barge in so I thought okay
what did I think is a computational
thinker well I said how inefficient but
I also thought well what's the how I
solve this problem anyone I thought
pipelining and then I thought okay what
are the minimum number of stations I
need to move to affect the pipeline I
said oh that's not the most efficient
pipeline but I stopped myself and you
need to know to answer this question
that the coffee and the soda machines
are bolted down and because the powers
behind them and you can't move those so
in case you haven't figured this out
already you just need to move the lids
over and then you get this nice pipeline
I went over to the cashier said oh let
me make it a coffee station much more
efficient you just need to move the lids
over and he didn't understand what I was
saying and
and so much for my insolence at the
National Science Foundation but in
reality i did have quite an influence at
NSF in a serious way in terms of
computational thinking I'm proudest of
this achievement when I first came in
which was FY 08 NSF had already
dedicated about 50 million dollars into
the program called cyber naval discovery
and innovation which is really
computational thinking for scientists
and engineers by the time I left the
budget request was a hundred million
dollars what Congress didn't give the
NSF that amount of money but but that
goes to show how and by the way this
program was funded by every single
Directorate in the foundation this is
foundation my program so even the
officer polar programs put money into
this geosciences math and physical
sciences Matt social behavioral economic
science is all the offices and so on so
this was my influence at NSF in terms of
the research community and it was its
program carried off carried forward for
four years and it was the seed for the
big data movement now that the u.s. is
enjoying because the first theme in CD I
was from data to knowledge so already
back then in 2007 I was promoting big
data and I was promoting the use of
machine learning to analyze the big data
and as I left investors examples as when
I left I started an education program
that was trying to address the
educational challenges of developing
competencies in K through 14 or K 2 16
in computational thinking and this is
actually join with Education and Human
Resources Directorate so we really got
the education scientists on board okay
so lemme oh this is a let's see how much
time I have one minute and 40 seconds
left okay so this is our redesign at the
intro courses at Carnegie Mellon this
course is for non-majors and there are
um almost 400 students taking this
course is some
stir which for CMU is a large number and
you can see that I'll just go on
industry support has been fantastic so i
have to thank microsoft research for
funding a center that I host at Carnegie
Mellon it's been very generous to really
support the research activities behind
computational thinking but I should also
credit google for picking up on the idea
of computational thinking promoting it
at the high school level teachers and
also creating a website called exploring
computational thinking that has
tremendous number of resources available
for science and math teachers at the
pre-college level u.s. national efforts
there have been many at the high school
level in terms of changing the college
board exam in terms of resources provide
the very a lot of resources on this Web
website computer science teachers
associations all the high school
teachers and computer science in the
u.s. there have been National Academy
reports on a mean Congress even has an
act that's pending on computer science
education but I wanted to get to the
international efforts the one I'm really
the most gratified by is what the UK is
doing and the many years ago there was
an assessment of research assessment of
computer science in the UK and without
my influence at all they were really
saying computer computational thinking
is influencing all disciplines but the
one I'm most excited about is what came
out earlier this year the British Royal
Society published a report and that
basically said we need to overhaul what
we are teaching in terms of computer
science to our pre college students and
I'll just quote a couple here
computational thinking offers insightful
ways to view how information operates in
many natural and you're near systems
every child should be expected to cetera
et cetera so this is like playing out my
vision and for real ireland this
university actually created a new degree
program in computational thinking they
asked my permission if i could use this
name and that just launched this year as
well other
international efforts I wanted to
mention what's going on in Singapore
because they have a program called see
reloaded program and they also refer to
computational thinking so this is
happening in Singapore probably the one
that excited excited me the most
personally was his email message I got
from a student in Egypt he sent me this
email message said I love your paper
this three-page paper I love your ideas
I want to spread computational thinking
in Egypt what can I do and he started
this blog and you go to the blog and you
just feel like I wish I could fly over
there and help him it was like my Arab
Spring moment so I this is just
personally very touching ok so there's
my article translate into chinese
translate into french and this is my
call to you to help me spread
computational thinking so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
