of Washington with Polly I'm Angelica
and I'm Chloe and we are Millennials
there are a lot of us the mullet the
Millennial population currently exceeds
that of the baby boomers by millions and
because of this it would seem right that
the Millennials make up the majority of
the American voting population however
when you look at the 2012 presidential
election you see that we're not really
showing up to vote a lot of different
age groups vote more than us and we look
at even smaller elections such as
midterm elections our turnout is even
worse and it's elections like these that
are really problematic that we don't
show up because these elections are
where change begins change begins when
you vote consistently and constantly so
for young voters it's important for us
to not only show up during presidential
elections but also to show up during
midterm elections during state elections
and most importantly during local
elections change start small and time
and time and again we've seen this hold
true in policy changes having to do with
gay marriage with climate change and
with minimum wage democracy is measured
by the strength and voice of its
citizens and this voice must be heard
more than once young people have to vote
again and again and again so with that
meet Polly what if there was an easy way
to participate in politics a space to
ask questions become informed a reliable
companion that you can ask anything how
many debates are left before the
election for my state district
representatives and trust that it would
have an answer
big or small according to USA Today
Sanders is a top pick in the upcoming
caucus so what is a copies great
question Joey it would help you get
involved in politics that matter gene
don't forget there's a town hall meeting
this thursday to discuss the new housing
policy so how would that bill effect
where we live and think about how those
issues affect other people too Jake will
still pay the taxes for the light rail
even though he lives five miles from the
closest station talking about politics
with your friends has never been easier
democracy is a conversation if you can
change the conversation you can change
everything be a part of it now Paul way
is a personalized political companion
she's a conversational user interface
that empowers Millennials to be informed
and engaged in politics Paul we is polio
is not a product rather a physical
product but we created her with she is a
thoughtful concept and as well a
necessary concept that we believe will
change how Millennials participate in
democracy in the past command-line
interfaces and graphical user interfaces
have required people to tell the
computer what they want now with
conversational user interfaces the
computer already knows what people want
and this is something really special
because a good conversational user
interface has all of the benefits of
back-end computing but also can act like
a human this makes them adaptable and
invisible and also a perfect candidate
for a role as a political companion
so is when we looked into designing
polly with three main goals we wanted to
begin with understanding each user and
to fully understand a person polyworks
to foster a long-term relationship the
earpiece you saw in the videos is one of
the many devices that poly is manifested
in she's designed to be a platform
agnostic system so she can be everywhere
this enables her to collect information
about your commute on the way home what
you do in your free time or your
existing political views additionally
poly removes the legwork from getting
involved in the political system she's
constantly working poly provides
relevant information to you and tracks
in tracks events and news that you are
interested in and finally poly really
works to empower change many Millennials
Millennials feel there's a gap between
your personal opinion and your what you
want and what actually happens making
change a lot of Millennials also think
that in order to close this gap it
involves like arguing with your crazy
uncle about Donald Trump we all have
that uncle but it turns out this is not
the solution poly enables users to help
find how they can actively be
participants in politics she ups and
findings local level small participant
actions like canvassing or phone banks
to get involved when designing poly we
also wanted to look into what she was
not and make sure we wear of her
limitations poly is not a personal
assistant she is designed specifically
to be a political companion and she
finds her limits within politics
additionally poly is not opinionated on
a behavioral level she's never going to
tell you what to do she's not going to
tell you how to think she's going to
help you develop your own political
opinion might may be challenging at at
times but ultimately always referring
deferring back to you in order to make
people feel comfortable discussing
politics with a computer you need to
have a level of trust many existing you
see you eyes fit into these axes these
actually show a lot of qualities that
many existing see you eyes fall
underneath we can see through this range
many range from robot like in serious
down a playful and human-like poly
however exists in a unique space her
serious tone
mimics that of the political sphere
while her human-like conversational
skills make her approachable and warm
together these qualities help foster a
huge elevate of poly success which is
trust it's hard to challenge someone's
opinion if they don't trust you poly is
designed to gain this trust through
three stages of a very complex
relationship in phase one poly is
learning about you while you were
learning about her she shows you more
top level bits of information engages
your response to learn more about your
knowledge in your opinion this is where
she works to build a foundation of not
only your political opinion but your
relationship with her as well once poly
gets a sense for what matters to you she
becomes more of a guide she will start
sharing relevant information to your
lifestyle like zoning changes in your
neighborhood your you're still having
conversations with poly but Polly has
also prepped you to begin having
informed political decisions outside of
the system go to your town hall meeting
and speak up poly makes the biggest
impact on stage three by now you and
Polly have worked together to develop
your fact-based political opinion your
trust in poly allows her to ask you some
harder questions that might challenge
the opinion that you know ultimately you
have learned to think critically
question your own opinion and inform
your own vote Paul uses a specific
content aggregation system to decide
what she shares with you during these
times during the educational phase of
our relationship poly works to ensure
that all the information you're
receiving his pack is fact and data
based this comes from nonpartisan
sources such as c-span whitepapers and
Pew Research Center this guarantees that
you can first focus strictly on
developing a fact-based political
opinion once you've worked with poly to
develop the basis of your political
voice she expands her reach to include
information from data driven think tanks
by doing so she is inevitably
introducing a higher risk of bias
however what makes poly successful here
is the transparency around sources by
informing you about where this
information is coming from she's making
wary of what biases you might encounter
teaching how to how to deal with them
and introducing you to more contrasting
opinions
in the most advanced phase of your
relationship with poly you're receiving
news updates and information from all
political sources all political sources
partisan partisan ones included by now
with Polly's guidance you know that fox
news and MSNBC should not be perceived
as fact but you also know that digesting
them is an important part of
understanding all sides of political
issue they help you develop your
opinions and your stance on politics you
are by this point you are qualified to
identify biases and be a highly aware
media consumer you can also probably
even now have a polite informed
political discussion with your crazy
uncle about Donald Trump in a world with
poly milena you'll see the potential
they have to make change this is by
voting again and again and again and we
think the future of democracy is poly
Thank
thank you you dub let's go into the
judges comments cliff sorry I jumped the
gun was so excited so thank you guys for
your presentation it was really well
done actually the sort of polish in the
in the in the clarity of the information
presentation in your presentation
actually reminded me a little bit of
Lisa thank you her work so one thing
that I think thought really got me right
in the presentation is the declaration
the problem right a lot of times the
student work that's one of the most
difficult things to actually articulate
is what problem you're trying to solve
and when you put it like you know
there's this problem of continuous
engagement actually that you had me had
me right there the thing that I wondered
about though is like why would what sort
of what is the incentive for somebody to
keep coming back to this product to use
it over and over again because some of
what you described already assume
somebody that's very much engaged in
these in these issues right there's
perhaps a you're presenting a more
frictionless way to engage with these
issues but at the same time you're that
also assumes that somebody's already
engaged and so I wonder if you guys
thought about what brings a new person
to this product that wouldn't otherwise
be engaged in these issues yeah we
definitely think that sort of the
millennial target fits best into working
with like exciting new technology you
know there's some sort of pokemon go
component that it's new and it's there
you want to interact with it I think
that's sort of the long-term maintaining
that relationship is sort of one of the
when we talk about the perks of the
long-term relationship and embedding
poly into it is her just understanding
you better and I know that's sort of a
hope and a wishful dream that I see you
I fully understands you but it's sort of
those details of the long-term
relationship that you know she picks up
on you don't really want to talk on your
commute ride home but when you're making
breakfast in the morning you are want to
be engaged and hopefully by this time
she's giving you enough information that
you feel like your voice is being heard
and you want to continue interacting
with her and interacting with engaging
with the politics
I love this project and of course some
have a particular interest in it and I
agree with cliff just just the framing
of the problem was really you know a
huge a huge part of what what I think is
so successful about this and I think
that that they I mean that what I saw of
the technology was something in people's
ears that any one way that she was
realized when I I mean what's what's
what's cool about this project is that
you could I mean this technology this
this information is available to
Millennials now I like that it has a
place in space it has a it's um it's
sort of defined as a thing that's that
is working constantly to engage it which
is which is such a huge part of the
problem i mean the example of the
is like to explain a i mean its ism
its own sort of challenge the examples
were really well done i also love the
way you described the the spectrum of
liberal to conservative and the sources
so again just just the idea of making a
place for this thing sticking it in your
ear or wherever you know and and
encouraging millennials to to think
about this you know before the election
sort of springs up on us i think is a
great contribution thank you thank you
so i think this is deep challenge right
about developing critical thinking and
especially in some sense if you look
around right now I worry about so-called
information technologies you might
question how informed we are whether
we're better or worse informed and the
question is I really like the notion you
could just get a job and copywriting by
the way forget design in terms of this
democracy is a conversation you change
the conversation you can change
everything that's that that's very
that's a very mature way to articulate
things and
and so the notion that it's not about
the technology that's about the nature
of the conversation and how you interact
with it that's a feature of design and
how you design it can change the biases
which can provoke that the types of
conversations and they reflect a certain
value and so the what I find interesting
throughout your word is the underlying
value that are reflected by it that
you've never really called out but there
are obvious based in how you chose it
and and I think that's the part that we
don't tend to talk about or even try to
teach and so I really appreciate it it
in your how you presented it so thank
you thank you thank you I'm so with you
on this project it's it's awesome love
where you're coming from I think there's
two things I wanted to say one was it's
amazing when you talk about
conversational you I in the future of
you I and where we're going how formless
your presentation is in terms of there
is no there's no thing we're talking
about you describing it very very
beautifully and very articulately but
there is no artifact right there's
nothing nothing there and that's
actually one of these sort of soup it
may take the form with something in your
area may not it may be many in many
different places and many different
experiences and i think that's that's
also commendable in terms of your
advanced pneus of your thinking the
second thing i wanted to point out was
i'm with you on you know the benefits of
society here is clear and the benefit to
the individual is clear is there a
business or is this a government thing
yeah we've talked about it I mean in
some ways it's like the ultimate
campaign manager right that it like gets
people talking about your stuff in the
way that you know in Obama's election or
Clinton selection that language is went
way more accessible and so sort of like
bringing it that language to people in a
much more streamlined way it's not
something we thought deeply about but
steadily been on our radar a little bit
great job guys thank you thank you
you're Doug</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
