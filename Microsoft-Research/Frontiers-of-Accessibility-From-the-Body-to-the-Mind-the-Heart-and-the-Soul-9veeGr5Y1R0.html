hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading

academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
hello in-person audience and virtual
online audience on resnet excited to
have Ron Becker here to speak to us
today so Ron is a professor in computer
science now an emeritus professor in
computer science at the University of
Toronto where he helped found the
founded the DGP group and now he works
primarily in the technologies for aging
gracefully lab there and Ron's been
recognized by many organizations in the
US and Canada for his pioneering work
both first in computer graphics and then
later moving into HCI and Jonathan
Gruden who is our sort of resident HCI
historian has provided me with this
exciting trivia fact about Ron Becker
was you may not know which is that he is
the progenitor of the one cai academy
family that strings across four
generations which consists of Ron Becker
and then his protege Villa Buxton and
his protégé brad myers and his
protégé james land a so that is a good
piece of Hyde trivia for you to keep in
mind and we're lucky to have run this
week he's in town for the ACM assets
conference which is taking place next
week where he's going to be giving the
keynote address and so we're lucky that
we're going to get a glimpse of that for
those of us who will not be able to
attend assets so thanks Ron
sorry I'm just resetting resetting my
clock to zero so I I can see it thanks
Mary it's always I seem to get here to
give a talk about every four or five
years which gives a good rhythm to my
life the anecdote about descendants in
the chi Academy the full story is I'm
probably the only person thus far maybe
for a long time who was preceded in to
the chi Academy by his academic child an
academic grandchild although indeed I
did proceed james land a into the
Academy so anyway there there are some
advantages to age I'm not sure how many
there are okay so I hope this will be
moderately interactive if it gets too
interactive and recognition to the fact
that this is late Friday afternoon I'll
start to decrease questions and
apparently that the apparently I am
being webcast to various MSR research
campuses all over the world although how
many people might be watching me now in
Beijing or or bangla door or wherever
the other one is remains to be seen
given the time difference so there's
apparently no way in which those of you
who are remote for me to know how many
such people there are or what you're
thinking or what you want to ask but in
the room is Mary Morris is Jonathan
Gruden is Mary cywinski is Gina vinalia
and a bunch of other people that I I
don't recognize so certainly feel free
to text questions to them and they I've
seen a lot of proxies today
videoconferencing proxies so yeah I hope
these four individuals will agree to be
questioned proxies this is as as Mary
implied a second rehearsal of the
keynote address i'm going to give monday
and
I've made I believe some improvements
from the rehearsal I get on Tuesday and
hopefully you'll enjoy and find it
provocative I was a little hesitant in
using the words mind and soul in a title
for a computer science audience but in
my age I figured I could get away with
it and and the work that i'm going to
describe from my own lab and i'm going
to try to cast my net a lot wider than
just our work is of course the work of
many people and the names you see there
are just the names of the current people
in the lab and there's probably an equal
no probably two times as many who've
been part of the lab in the last ten
years it was only name four years ago
but i started doing this line of work
about 11 or 12 years ago as i could see
the 60 milestone looming close on my
horizon and i said well it's about time
to do this kind of thing before before I
needed so I'm going to be speaking at
assets on Monday and so I thought I'd
take a look at what the current assets
conferences think about what
accessibility is and what areas are
being worked on and I find it very
interesting i only went back three years
looking at the session titles i didn't
look at the posters and i didn't look at
individual paper titles from 2011 313
and found that issues a vision
impairment was by far the largest focus
of attention at assets a surprisingly
small number dealing with hearing
challenges three dealing with mobility
and waved fine wayfinding three dealing
with aging and a number of others and so
what i want to do first of all is just
talk about very very briefly the huge
advances that have been made in those
kinds of accessibility certainly dealing
with visual challenges there's been huge
advances made in terms of things like
screen readers audio description the
script of video turning a moving image
into some kind of textual
scription of what's going on in the
moving image as well as sonification
turning visual images into non-speech
audio all of these are an example of
what I would call a sensory substitution
or the recreation of something in a
visual modality into another modality
there's also a lot of there's been a lot
of work on haptic displays and what's of
course interesting to recognize in this
work is that there are no uniform
universal solutions so people who have
acuity problems those issues are very
different from those who have glaucoma
from very different from those who have
macular degeneration so the technical
solutions need to have a fair amount of
subtlety there's also been a lot of work
in hearing challenges in other words
taking auditory phenomena sounds and
turning them into for example captions
or sign language and this the use of
captions is of course interesting
because it illustrates what some people
call the curve cut effect but it
illustrates the fact that advances that
are made for issues of accessibility
often benefit those who whose faculties
are normal so for example I normally can
hear things but if I go into a sports
bar I can barely hear the person next to
me much less something that's coming off
the screen so our third captions on the
screen I can read something about who's
winning the baseball game or whatever
and thank you for coming to hear me
instead of watching the Red Sox and the
Tigers who I think are going on now I
hope this doesn't mean people all over
Microsoft immediately leave your desk
and go turn on your TV's there's also
interesting new work being done in
haptic displays there's a small Toronto
company called tactile audio displays
that has built a chair called the
emotive chair which turns music into
vibrations on your back and and so again
this is an attempt to substitute things
in one sensory medium to another there's
also been a lot of work on mobility and
wayfinding
smart cane smart wheel chairs etc but
what about seniors are these the crucial
issues for seniors and this question is
interesting because seniors are getting
more and more prevalent in our
population in the most striking data
point that I've seen since I got
interested in this issue was from the UN
in a 2004 report in which they said that
in nineteen fifty-five percent of the
world's population was over 65 in 2050
it will be up to sixteen percent and by
2300 should the world last that long it
will be up to thirty two percent which
basically means that assuming you're not
a senior and you're randomly distributed
among other people if you look to the
right of you and they look to the left
of you one of the three of you will be a
senior citizen so that's quite
staggering and in fact the percentage of
seniors will pass the percentage of
children defining children i believe is
under 15 and seniors is over 65 that
could happen in two or three years okay
so the world is starting to look like a
very different place the good news is
that of course if we're healthy and if
we have things to enjoy in our life in
principle we can enjoy them at a lot
longer and the bad news is that we have
all sorts of obstacles to enjoying life
ranging from things that are clearly
defined as physical and neurological
conditions like Alzheimer's disease or
aphasia resulting from stroke
difficulties in speaking or Parkinson's
shaking or things like that and also of
course blindness deafness permeability
and said are they the issues that the
accessibility community has worked on
very hard but also things that you could
view as psychological or social barriers
to leading a healthy life such as
isolation loneliness vulnerability etc
etc things that the medical community is
not always willing to recognize is a
disease or a condition
that the medical community needs to deal
with so the question is can technology
help with any of this and if so
addressing what needs I like taxonomies
and I like my style of work in in new
areas and I've changed field several
times in my career is to start dabbling
in things trying various things and then
I try to pull back a little bit and say
is there some sort of systematic for a
little formal isn't our framework or
structure in which I can I can
categorize pieces of work and a couple
years ago four years ago maybe I ran
across a paper by psychologist Abraham
Maslow written I believe in 1944 and
Maslow argued that there was a hierarchy
of human needs starting at the lowest
level with physiological needs things
like we need oxygen to breathe we need
water to drink etc if we don't have that
we're going to die and then moving up
somewhat higher to the level of safety
security to the next layer he did was he
called actually the need for a lot of
affection a sense of belonging family
friends the fourth layer he defined was
what he called the steam the need to
feel good about yourself and your
capabilities to be able to engage
meaningfully with the world and the
fifth level which is perhaps the
fuzziness was what he called
self-actualization the need for
fulfillment a cause some reason to exist
some higher purpose and what I want to
do today is is arguing I'm not going to
argue it at length but I'm going to
assume it when I talked in my title
about the mind the heart and the soul
I'm going to equate the love layer with
things of the heart the esteem layer
with things of the mind and the soul
layer with the I mean sorry the
self-actualization layer with with the
soul and hence my title so the
opportunity for us is to identify needs
that somehow fit into this taxonomy or
this space and then come up with
technological solution
and they're probably more than four
categories but before I find most
interesting our diagnostic prosthetic
rehabilitative or preventative and the
easiest way to explain that is to use
the example let's say that you're out
skiing on I don't know where do people
ski see ski here my Baker do you ski it
my Baker or is it I don't know there
there's places to ski and so imagine you
have an accident and you don't know
whether in fact you've broken your ankle
or you just twisted it or sprained it so
you might go have an x-ray that's a
diagnostic instrument and that'll tell
you yes you broke something if in fact
you broke something or you fairly
injured it you will have a prosthesis in
other words something that compensates
for this loss whether it's a cast or a
crotch if then you start to get stronger
you may see physiotherapist and that's a
rehabilitative sense system to
strengthen the ankle and then finally
you might think and particularly if the
person who had the skiing accident is
you know a reckless 17 year old male or
something their parents might say to
them well you know if you had gone down
the mountain a little slower and not
been also talking on your cell phone you
might not have had the accident in the
first place so and that's what one would
call a preventive intervention and so
those are the kinds of things we can
look for in this area and what's
important to realize is that any
technology intervention that we develop
should be and can be informed by
medicine and the health sciences and in
turn as we do technological
interventions they often give us new
insights into the disease or the
condition or the disability that one is
attempting to to deal with and so our
lab which is called the tag lab
technologies for aging gracefully lab
mantra research for the journey through
life tries to design and develop
technology to make seniors and their
families smarter more capable
resourceful and in the pen
and it's very different i'm an HCI
person and this is different from people
who work in the same field who come from
AI and computer vision who often try to
make machines smarter to watch over
seniors to ensure that something bad
doesn't happen and I'm not here to argue
that one approach is better than the
other in fact we try to build as much
smarts smartness intelligence into the
things we build as well but we come to
this in my lab from the a from the HCI
approach and so what we try to do is to
think where technology could serve human
needs and to envision design build test
improve and commercialize solutions for
a variety of conditions including what
some how quaintly sometimes quaintly
called normally aging senior citizens
and so the outline of what I'm going to
do in the next 40 minutes or so is to go
through these five layers and talk about
a little bit of work in each layer in
some cases talk about the work of others
in some cases talk about work from our
lab and and then wrap up with some
general thoughts that that can be drawn
out of all the layers and I'm certainly
willing to to take questions at any time
so starting with the layer of Health
this is an area where there's been lots
of work one phenomenon that particularly
interests me is the increasing
proliferation of authoritative
information sources or apparently
authoritative information sources about
health on the on on the web and this
includes information from government
sanctioned websites such as pubmed
health to very well known and
distinguished and authoritative hospital
websites such as the Mayo Clinic and
more commercial websites as a xem WebMD
and you see here three snapshots of
information about prostate gland
enlargement there there's another
phenomena which approaches this from a
different point of view which is
not the authoritative summary
pronouncements about certain conditions
that are defined by medical science but
the more anecdotal here's what happened
to me when I had my brain surgery or
here's what happened to me when somebody
close to me passed away or whatever what
happened to you and these these are
social media for health here's an
example from my brain tumor community
org and this all in my view is good for
us as intelligent consumers of health
information it leads the challenges such
as how do you decide what's correct what
to believe in and also how do you
encourage the medical system and medical
practitioners to spend some of their
time and this is more of a problem in
Canada than in the States because in
Canada everybody gets health care but
there's increasingly little time for
everybody whereas here if you have if
you have more money you can get you know
you can get better health care and you
probably have a better chance here to
say to your doctor okay I need 10
minutes for you to explain to me why I
shouldn't worry about all the drug
interactions that I saw in this
Wikipedia site why I should take this in
confidence in Canada you you probably
won't be lucky enough to have fun an MD
can do it but you will certainly get you
don't have to worry about what happens
with health care if you're poor another
area another area is monitoring physical
fitness for health this these are slides
about a device called Fitbit which a lot
of people wear which gives them
information about motion in three
dimensions and allows them to monitor
their their activities and then another
thing that that I think is particularly
interesting is the number of seniors now
who are either keeping we fit or keeping
connected and using some of these
technologies for encouraging exercise
with things like we bowling which I
I mean I don't know how many seniors
play wii bowling but certainly that kind
of activity is is getting more and more
common so that's all I want to say about
physiological needs I not just have one
slide about monitoring for safety and
that's the next slide and I just want to
mention to what I think our outstanding
pieces of work one is from here from the
Seattle area and in fact i believe i saw
shweta patel wandering around the halls
upstairs so he's done beautiful work on
technology which you can either attach
to your electrical circuits or to your
hydraulic circuits in the home and they
could be used for things like making
inferences such as well for the last two
years there have been electrical pulses
around nine o'clock every morning from
two places in the in the kitchen that
could plausibly be the toaster in the
coffee pot nothing like this has
happened for two or three days either
the person has gone away or maybe
there's something wrong and we should
take a look and similarly for fluid flow
dealing with issues like sinks and
toilets and things and this is I
understand now being commercialized by a
company I think it's called belkin so in
the upper left you see some some images
taken from some of the belkin literature
work from Toronto that I find very
interesting and that uses
state-of-the-art computer vision and
machine learning is from alex mica
lightest in toronto Occupational Health
Sciences as well as throughout a rehab
Institute and that's designed for that I
don't know to what extent in this area
they sell the device where the
television ad is I've fallen and I can't
get up okay and that works very well in
the cases where you remember to carry it
with you it doesn't fall out of your
hand when you fall down etc etc etc but
what Alex has done is he's built some
technology which sits on the ceiling and
I think you can see it in this let's see
oh actually I have a point of that you
could see it up there and if this is an
actual scene down here it normalizes it
and gets
the raw image and then it does some
silhouette detection and is able to say
it looks like you're falling would you
like help etc and so this is these are
good examples of where smart computer
vision and smart machine learning and AI
really can can be greatly beneficial ok
I now want to move and you'll notice at
the bottom of some of these slides I'm
showing where I am in the outline of the
talk so I'm now moving to the the third
level of the hierarchy love needs and so
I want to start with a question in part
because I hate a talking that's just a
monologue even if I'm the mono logger so
can anyone here tell an anecdote it need
not be need not be someone you
personally know it could be a friend a
friend of a friend something you read
but but something about somebody who's
isolated lonely vulnerable and what the
implications of that for the life has
been yeah Mary ok right yeah yeah so
anyway it's these these situations are
clearly negative there's an image here
of a happy couple skyping one another
and not everyone is in a position to do
that and so and in fact there are large
collections of cases in which this is an
issue so not every senior living alone
is lonely and isolated or isolated and
lonely but many of them are many people
who are in long-term hospital care I'll
get back to hospice care towards the end
of my talk a large collection that's
under-recognized perhaps and under
valued by society or 724 homebound
caregivers people you know like someone
who's 68 years old who's got a partner
who's 74 years old and who has dementia
and Bay and you don't have a lot of
money and you can't hire people to come
in to take care of the person and you're
stuck there day and night you don't have
kids who are nearby etc etc people who
are in long-term
it doesn't have to be seniors it could
be people who are just hospitalized for
a long term because of some surgery or
rehab or quarantined or individuals with
chronic pain there's statistics would
say that the number of people with
chronic pain in North America is
something like twenty five percent this
is paying that persist for long in the
three months which is just a staggering
number that i never believed was serious
until i started talking with diane
gurram ala of simon fraser who's
essentially life work is technology for
chronic pain and so this often applies
to individuals who may or may not live
alone have relatively small and perhaps
shrinking social networks may also have
sensory or motor impairments which makes
it less and often have little control
over how they feel or their availability
for conversation at a particular moment
so for example if you're in a hospital
bed and even as something as little as
can you talk on the telephone many
hospital beds don't provide a telephone
next to you and you may have to summon
someone a nursing staff in order to talk
on the telephone to do something so so
that can be a serious issue so we've
started to we've gotten interested in
this issue when we we've surveyed the
issue of video communications and being
here today has been very interesting as
it was four or five years ago when I was
here there's sort of lots of technology
around for synchronous video chat
commercially skype google hangouts etc
there's the research frontier and i put
research frontier in quotes because in
fact in the cscw community people at
belk or was doing this 20 years ago with
video windows and i understand video
windows are or have been quite comfort
controversial at MSR but the notion that
you you had a way to imagine as if you
were living next door to your to your
children and you could and there was a
window literally between the two
buildings and if both of you agreed and
pulled up the blind you could
communicate with video and audio in
erection so that's what video windows
and person named
to gender judge did some very nice work
on this called family window and family
portals a few weeks ago we've chosen not
to start with synchronous or always on
video but with asynchronous
communication or video messages in part
because we've been very influenced by
the fact that people are not necessarily
always available for conversation when
you want and we thought the notion of
just saying hey I'm thinking of you get
in touch was was very valuable and so
what I'm going to and so what we've done
is we've built some prototypes over the
last few years we've done a lot of
interviews focus groups and observations
in a variety of settings people living
at home with chronic pain individuals in
a complex continuing care hospital where
they're in for very serious conditions
and in fact often don't leave as well as
we we've been working with a company
that owns retirement homes and long-term
care nursing homes and we've been doing
interviews and observations there and
we've developed a set of design
principles which if the gods smile upon
us and a random number generator is is
dialed in the correct way you might get
to here at Chi 2014 but if not we'll
submit it somewhere else and as I said
we start with asynchronous interaction
we our goal is to build from there and
our goal is to build something that
looks like an appliance and that doesn't
look like another program on on a
computer and so I'm going to show you a
few early prototypes and this video does
have narration so if i can find the
start
and today designed to aid communications
by isolated individuals who may be
lonely or vulnerable families in touch
by Elaine macaronis and Tariq ship are
introduced the metaphor of a digital
communicating picture frame jessica
david's ringo advanced a concept further
here her grandfather sends out a
thinking of you message from his picture
frame by touching it jessica receives it
and records a video greeting to Grandpa
mentioning that her dad son it also some
degree
hey grandpa just got out of class it's
really beautiful here in Toronto and
coming fall dad wants to send you video
of the dog later so hopefully you get
that talk to you later bye
rather than receives and watches both
videos
Jay did watch outside p x mark da hah's
macomb explores a different way of
controlling the device in a different
context of use bhisma's dad here
pretending to be in a hospital bed
commands the communications of clients
by gesturing to the other side of the
room he can send a request to a nurse
elsewhere in the hospital or send
messages to family
so that was that last demo was done with
a Microsoft Kinect and the images on the
right are images out of the current
prototype in touch which does something
very similar to Ringo and we hope to
start testing with seniors in retirement
homes and long-term care starting in
January there are lots of this is a
lovely domain to work on there are lots
of different research challenges or
opportunities one is what's the metaphor
you use we've we started with a picture
frame originally my idea had been to do
this through television because the work
was motivated by visiting my sister in a
long-term care facility in the last
couple years of her life where she got
increasingly isolated and lonely and I
imagined the TV everyone in the everyone
in a bed often two TVs in a room with
twin beds had their TVs on and I imagine
the TV stopping and a voice coming out
we interrupt this mindless drivel from
CNN with a message from your son hi mom
its Neil she went golfing yesterday shot
three birdies etc etc so we've been
looking at picture frames TV screens we
believe that in fact all three of the
communication modalities synchronous
asynchronous and always on our relevant
than the question is how to use them
together in some a elegant way and
although we started with touch we are
interested as you saw in the Keith video
in gesture but for the moment I've put
that on hold because we wanted to
explore voice as the second modality
because we think that's probably the
most important one besides touch ok
before I go on to the next topic I would
be happy to take a question here or
comment if anyone has one and then i'll
i'll continue
okay so the next next area I want to
talk about i classify under esteem needs
although in fact it sort of bridges
communication and and and and thinking
and that's having trouble to communicate
and to speak and we started out working
with technology that we developed for
stroke survivors who had aphasia but
more recently we started to think about
another kind of impairment or disability
that affects a lot of people including
seniors particularly new immigrants
which is dealing with English as a
Second Language and again if anyone
wants to share a an anecdote or a story
about someone they know who's had a
stroke or a child with very you know
autism spectrum disorder or someone you
know who's an immigrant who has trouble
with English you know I'd be happy to
make this a little more participatory
and if not I can certainly go on but
i'll give you give you a few seconds to
to pipe up if anyone wants to say
something because i find that these
stories often sort of bring it bring it
to home okay so so once again there are
their commercial products here that are
making a difference the fact that now
you can get speech synthesis that sounds
almost human is is is is a big step the
image you see on the upper right of this
screen is the collection of materials
that a stroke survivor named bill used
to work with to help himself communicate
as he wandered around toronto what's
hard to see and this is i think it's i
think it's this note well no I'm I don't
know where it appears here but he
actually has the most important thing
are not all these maps and business
cards in
things but a book that he put together
that's essentially two thousand words
and phrases that he finds the most
useful for his communication includes
things like stories of what his kids are
doing and stories you know thinks he he
wants to do in informal social
interaction as well as things like I had
my I had my stroke while being on the
subway etc now you have to remember that
bill is no ordinary stroke survivor I
mean if you rated people in their
intelligence and their fortitude to try
to say I'm not going to be beaten by
this I suspect bill is in the upper 1%
Tyler Moore I mean he's an engineer he
basically said after he pulled himself
together again and he realized he he he
couldn't remember words and he and he
could barely articulate them he said I'm
going to beat this and so your average
stroke survivor isn't capable of doing
that and so my lab spun out a company
called my voice which has an application
called talk rocket go which basically
brings up words that seem to be relevant
in specific context and either allows
you to see them on the screen or will
speak them out with a speech synthesizer
in terms of language aids there of
course things like rosetta stone i don't
know what TV is like here but you you
can't watch television in toronto
without seeing a rossetti stone ad but
none of this none of the commercial
products really deal with what we think
is that the the most serious problem or
opportunity which is supporting user
needs in situated learning in other
words how do you help the person by
somehow zeroing in on the vocabulary
that might be most relevant as opposed
to forcing them to look through a whole
dictionary and so my voice started
working on that and they have some of
that in there commercially available
product but I have a PhD student carried
em and Zep who's who's three-quarters of
the way through now who's doing a
beautiful job I think with a technology
called vocab Nomad which thinks about
like the
my voice technology did in terms of
vocabularies that are spatially relevant
and we call them low Cabul ares and so
if you to understand the idea if you're
in a doctor's office there's a
particular set of words that are more
relevant for that condition than if
you're at a movie theater and that's
going to differ again then if you're in
you know in a Starbucks that's not to
say that in a Starbucks you couldn't
talk about the movie you just saw or
your forthcoming doctor's appointment
but still the most critical things in a
doctor's office are words like nurse
appointment blood tests and things and
the mechanical things in a Starbucks or
things like black double-double I don't
know is that do they use that in the
States or is that just the Canadian
phrase double-double donut croissant
etcetera etcetera and so and I don't
have a video of this unfortunately and I
decided to stop showing the my voice
video you see here and it's hard to see
three screenshots from vocab nomads the
upper left screenshot shows you some of
the interface for helping detailer
vocabularies on a desktop machine in
here someone's working on the milk
vocabulary including things like or the
liquids vocabulary 1% milk two percent
milk seven up etc down in the bottom
left you see the notion of chunks of
vocabulary that are relevant in
particular situations and so here you
see an important port a bowl vocabulary
chunk or I think of them as vocabulary
books for numbers for colors for parts
of the body and the upper right Carrie
demonstrated this at an artificial
intelligent education conference
recently which was in Memphis and so she
tried it and it knew she was in Memphis
and it came up with American South
Baptist Memphian etc which wasn't bad
and I asked whether would come up with
Elvis and she said Oh Elvis came
couple as the sixth term etc that's not
too bad Johnny Cash maybe I don't know
I've never been to Memphis but so again
in this area we have huge research
challenges as do others in the community
there's the classic problem from
computers in learning which is how do
you track learning learner progress and
intervene appropriately there's the
automatic low cab you Larry problem
which we barely scratched the surface of
theirs what I'll call the social media
for speech production problem not only
the idea that there could be vocabulary
books that can be contributed by people
in the community but the notion that you
know you might be in a particular
situation and send out a message over
the Internet to say i'm having trouble
saying this could someone help me and
the question is how quickly could get an
answer back there's lovely work that i
was reported at chi by erin brady did
she work with you yeah Steve Jeff
Bingham student of basically taking a
picture of things like medications and
things this is for blind people and
saying over the Internet can you help me
what am I looking at and and so the use
of social media to help people with not
only visual challenges but speaking
challenges setter sounds very very
interesting ok so I have two more a
couple more things to talk about any
questions or comments here before ok so
the next thing I want to talk about is
being able to read and I won't i'll skip
the exercise of trying to get you to
talk now so I know it's Friday afternoon
it's been a long week did you have was
Monday did you have monday off here also
no you didn't have monday off ok and in
canada we had monday off for
thanksgiving although we we ate so much
that we've been sluggish all week so so
so so we've gotten very interested in
the the problem of helping people read
and this this I believe is important or
compelling because look at all the
ebooks out there I mean you're sitting
in Seattle here and you've got Kindles
and I I forget this Microsoft have its
own ebook yet or not yet now you have an
investment in in nook is it yeah nook
and and whatever so but anyway the most
of the ebooks don't seem to pay
attention to people with disabilities
whether it pays lip service to it
because you can enlarge type but it
doesn't do it in a terribly
sophisticated way and the research
community has started to look at this
but not nearly enough the most exciting
piece of research that I've seen is by
Heys raffle who's he wasn't nokia's he's
still there is here oh they made a
startup company on this okay oh good
okay well I need to find out about this
anyway I thought this was just lovely
work where you essentially combine
desktop video conferencing with a book
that can be synchronized that either end
at least two party I don't know whether
they've done multi-party but to party is
really the sweet spot and and this was
very clever because it also had an agent
that would come in and start making cute
or intelligent comments trying to get
people to talk if they weren't already
talk talking and you know I think this
is lovely work anyway so we've started
to think about what we can do for ebooks
for reading and we came up with one of
the world's worst names the accessible
large print listening and talking ebook
alt and the idea was to be able to deal
with the original idea was to build sort
of the equivalent of a talking book and
a large print book okay so they could
enlarge the type but it could also read
it aloud and those two technologies
talking books and large print books
seems to be different technologies but
also we figured that it
be a little smarter than that it could
not only talk but it could listen and
that would enable it to be able to so
you could read for somebody you could
record a play with people taking
different parts or you could read and
then the person could listen to it again
so I'll just show you a video we made a
little while ago about alt
alt is an app that helps people read by
themselves and together with family
members like an electronic large print
book type can be enlarged for
individuals whose vision is poor it can
also be shown on a high def display or
TV for family viewing like books on tape
the text is read aloud for people in
their eyes shizzle was the word i have
seldom heard him mention her under any
i'm a synthesizing the voice actually
closes it bristles not just first three
reported books it was cut final DNT
pines cancer sufferer remember alt is
accessible to people with motor
challenges such as occurs in ms and
parkinson's it can be controlled by this
mobile keyboard or a connected keyboard
that also provides a stand for the ipad
it was not that he felt any emotion akin
to love for Irene Adler all emotions and
that one particularly were employed to
his cold precise but admirably balanced
mind all can also access a million books
by the internet archive so let's pick
the category children's literature
english and we find Alice's Adventures
in Wonderland and will download that
family members can read books aloud to
all users readings are recorded and can
later be heard by the user twas brillig
and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble
in the way all mimsy were the borogroves
and the mome raths outgrabe
and now you're going to play it back my
veto Steve got higher and gimble in the
way I Lindsey were the borogroves so
this is an area where we're just really
getting started and the interesting
opportunities are to think about sort of
the old classic space-time taxonomy zuv
from cscw literature and think about
people reading together at the same time
at different times face-to-face or
across space and this this we believe
has a lot of opportunity again for for
seniors who are isolated and lonely in
order to embed social interaction in a
cognitively interesting task space so
the last part of my talk is and I want
to go up to self-actualization the soul
and we started this work about eight or
nine years ago and I was working with a
social worker Elsa marchiali who worked
at a place called baycrest that has a
lot of residents who have dementia and
and she had done a little project in
which he had made a little 15-minute
video of somebody's life and it seemed
to really be valuable to them to look
back at the video and so we we managed
to get some Alzheimer Alzheimer's
Association money to look at it more
systematically and so our project was
called multimedia biographies and it was
really targeted at the very large number
of people who at the moment there's
about 40 million people with dementia
worldwide the most common form of
dementia is Alzheimer's disease about
eighty-five percent of cases the
dementia or Alzheimer's disease and
that's supposed to grow to 66 million or
more by 2030 and there's also a new
condition that's only been recognized in
the last 10 years called mild cognitive
impairment
which in which you start to have memory
problems and some issues of confusion
and disorganization that doesn't detect
or measure as Alzheimer's disease but in
fifty percent of the cases if you're
diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment
within four years you'll be diagnosed
with with Alzheimer's disease so these
are people who are very aware of the
precariousness of life and anxious to do
what they can to not to prolong it but
to enjoy it and to possibly preserve
their history for their families etc etc
so we worked with a dozen people over
three years of the project half of them
with MCI and half of them with moderate
or mild Alzheimer's disease and we sent
out so-called multimedia biographers who
worked with these individuals typically
for about six months but very
intermittently to sit down and say well
what's the story of your life now in 12
of the cases in eight of the 12 cases we
worked with surrogates for the
individuals at all children for example
in for the cases the for the six cases
with MCI we work the individuals who
were still healthy enough to say I want
to tell my own story and so we had to
work with them to figure out what is the
story of their life and and then go out
and capture and digitize all sorts of
past archival material you know
photographs in a shoebox old super 8
cartridges etc etc sometimes shooting
new material Mike massimi did a lovely
project as an intern at MSR Cambridge
five six years ago six years ago maybe
in which he did a project like this also
using sense cam to help capture new
imagery and and so we did this one of
the things we wanted the show is that
this was practical to dude to develop
something that would be valued by the
individuals and the families without the
expense of imagine imagine Scarlett
O'Hara
uh coming to the end of her life and
saying okay well gee I'd like I'd like
rhett and insofar as he still cares or
others to remember what my life is like
okay we'll make gone with the wind as as
the story of my life okay now that i
think would cause three hundred million
dollars or something like that so we
wanted to show that this could be done
by undergraduates in various disciplines
they didn't have to be trained
cinematographers with about a hundred
hours of time so let me show you two
examples very very edited down this
woman was brought here from South Africa
five years roughly before this video was
shot this work was done by Tara kool
hain who some of you may know she works
at and Microsoft in one of the product
development groups and ms f is is sort
of reflecting on her life while watching
in some sense the story of her life come
in front of her
look there yeah you did
so if I hadn't edited down as much you'd
see numerous examples of her saying like
oh table mountain top Oh etc etc stasis
but she also re-experience Azure
remembers feelings it was very good to
live there the real payoff of this
proved to be when individuals watch
these with adult children typically or
with with partners and so here you see
ms Zed also with mid stage Alzheimer's
watching the story of her life with her
daughter who is also the narrator of the
of the video and you'll hear the
daughter both recorded and live Rastus
really stunning
what an excellent
you are looking so beautiful
then she goes laughing for another 20
seconds or 36
my sunshine away so the the power of
this for reconnecting and encouraging
conversation is really quite quite
compelling as with every one of these
topics there's still many many research
challenges to what extent can we use new
technologies such as sin scam or i guess
the Vikon review now or glass to capture
new video material to what extent can we
use social media to gather a raw
material together and then somehow
combine it into what's really important
which is transforming individual
memories and experiences into stories
which i believe is what what all of this
is is all about I now want to just say
very briefly about so if you think about
preserving your identity as you reach
critical stages of life in terms of your
physical health and your mental health
what about the end of life and I just
have one slide about this my PhD student
Mike massimi currently in the second
year of an internship at MSR Cambridge
has really been a pioneer in thinking
about this actually coined a phrase the
net those sensitive design donatos is
the Greek god of death and the idea is
to think about how to design
technologies and systems and environment
that acknowledge the fact that we're not
going to be here forever and so what you
see here is a screenshot from a
wonderful website developed by a friend
of mine Kathy castor it's called best
endings and it's the goal of the website
is to encourage you to think talk learn
plan and share about what she describes
there is the shocking realization a
hundred percent of us are going to die
other kinds of work in the Fieri and I
don't have time to go through the the
papers in detail but in
the forthcoming cscw conference 2014
there's a paper by someone named
Ferguson who I believe is a grad student
at McGill and Karen Moffitt and Mike
Missy me and one other person the talks
about technology in hospice care hospice
care is a setting in which you basically
acknowledge that someone is near the end
but you're trying to make them as
comfortable as possible and we've been
particularly interested in that in my
group is that the kind of video
connection technology that we're talking
about with in touch might be relevant in
hospice care and then Mike in cscw 2013
published a paper that talks about can
technology be relevant after there's
been a death in terms of unlike
bereavement support so we've been doing
this kind of work for about 11 years now
only the last four or five into the
nametag lab when I started I thought we
were dealing with memory prostheses
because in fact one of the things that
got me started was reading a classic
paper from blocking the name of the
fellow he used to be at Europe arc and
now lives in Silicon Valley anyway was
towards an electric electronic memory
prostheses it was written about 1990 and
I read it again about 2000 and I said
boy we haven't gotten too far have we
and so but but I've now realized as
we've done this work together with
collaborators from the Health Sciences
etc it's not just about memory and
cognition it's about identity efficacy
and self-worth and it's not just
technology for individuals it's
collaborative technology for family
community caregivers and that was
illustrated very strongly by the PhD
thesis of my crew finished a few years
ago and that was published in a believe
in chi and and participatory design the
goal is not just about prosthetics but
about the rehabilitation of health and
the preservation of health and it's
obviously multidisciplinary and this is
not work that can be done in the lab
it's got to be done my students have a
huge burden because I asked them not
just to build compelling prototypes but
to make it robust enough to take it out
and try it with real users in real
environments etc etc there are lots of
other research challenges in this area
that that haven't been in the topics of
disgust remembering important objects
remembering to take them with you and
finding lost objects is one that one of
Gregory a bod students started to work
on about 10 or 12 years ago and i
believe is still not solved recalling
names is one that we've dabbled that a
little but but we haven't solved there's
been a fair amount of technology using
things like Kinect and other things to
help people who have walking conditions
or or or but the notion of being able to
monitor your walking in real
environments and detect both trouble
spots with the human like something
wrong with the way your leg is working
or a problem that's caused by the
environment bumps things you could trip
on is very interesting and then finally
there's the phrase nor plus the city and
I don't have time to go through it in
detail but neuroplasticity relates to
the notion that our brains are not as
they used to be thought sort of pretty
well set by about age four or five and
then yes we could cram morph information
in but you know if we had an IQ of 120
that's pretty well we would stay but
there's increasing evidence that as the
that even late in life if the brain gets
what some people call insults to it like
like a gunshot wound and we've seen
several cases of that unfortunately in
the last few years where where people
have gunshot wounds and start to do
remarkable recoveries and it's partly
because of neuroplasticity and the
ability for the mind to increase its
what some call cognitive reserve to
to be resilient in the face of adversity
and so I believe there's I I don't have
the time to go through a description of
or my views of the so called brain
fitness industry but there's a brain
fitness industry now that believes that
you can build these little exercise in
if you just sit in front of your your
Nintendo device or your whatever for a
half hour a day you will get smarter or
you'll be able to delay cognitive
decline and what I believe is the
interesting challenges to harness our
abilities to to stay physic to stay
mentally sound through conversation
through exercise through normal everyday
I companies even through playing
classical games like scrabble or poke or
a bridge or chess will be better for us
than these same brain fitness exercises
a brief plug as I faced 25 years ago
when bill Buxton and I started teaching
HCI we couldn't find teaching materials
to to to teach from even though ben
shneiderman assures me that i've had
looked a little more carefully his book
was almost ready and we could have used
it so that then led us to write some of
the early readings collections in HCI
and now there's a new approach to this
developed by the same Mike Morgan this
time Morgan and claypoole and so I'm
editing a series of synthesis lectures
on assistive rehab in health preserving
technologies the upper row are volumes
actually out and the the bottom row are
things that are in preparation the one
on autism is coming out literally any
day now why do we do this well this is
sort of a quiz how many of these eight
productive mostly still alive although
not all senior citizens do you recognize
we can't all be Casals or Picasso's or
Mandela's org orbit
but I contended by doing works such as
what I've described from others and from
our lab we can enable lots of seniors to
have additional years of happy healthy
contributing lives thank you for your
attention and I'm happy to stay as long
as you want for questions and discussion
and I encourage those of you who are out
there if you are out there and I wish I
knew who was out there that if you know
how to text any of the people whose
names I mentioned before you could text
in a question or email them a question
yeah Mary
showing that these technologies are
actually having a positive
right and that that's that's a function
of sort of the breadth first approach I
chose to take let me let me talk about
the man and in many cases the work we've
done you know is to news we don't have
really solid results but I'll talk about
the multimedia biography case so in that
case with 12 people we certainly first
of all we showed that we did of a
efficient relatively efficient
production process and then in the 12
cases we saw lots of anecdotal evidence
in the we we went and videotaped the
people when they looked at the first
time the video the world premiere of the
story of their life and then we had them
watch regulating then came three months
later in six months later and we did see
lots of instances which we counted in
many cases and of people having
enjoyment having engagement connecting
with their family let me give you one
specific example there's a another group
and another in another continent and
another university that has worked on a
similar problem about how to use
multimedia to engage seniors in
reminiscing and they have argued
publicly many times and I've been in the
audience several times and have seen
they have argued that you don't want to
do individual multimedia you should do
generic multimedia that simply gives you
scenes of your city as a way to
encourage seniors to reminisce because
they have said it might make you feel
bad and might bring back unhappy
memories so we actually have a count for
example in the the 12 times three videos
we talk of people watching this of how
many times people seem to smile give
verbal explanations of delight or
pleasure or whatever as opposed to the
oh my god I'm so sad
ed ed cetera et cetera and it was
something like 15 to 1 in terms of
joyful moments so we do have some data
but but but not nearly enough and again
it's it's very very hard to do this work
and as as you you know as you probably
recognize as you're starting to this
work with with tracking tracking
emotions and and affecting emotions how
do you do ecologically valid field
research in a way that doesn't disrupt
behavior is ethically sound I don't know
whether do you have to go through ethics
boards here do you have an ethics ported
Microsoft okay a minor re process well
we have major IRB process and when we do
the right thing by not just doing work
from my laboratory but collaborating
with people at any of the teaching
hospitals then then we then we have to
go through ethics at U of T and also at
the teaching hospital so so I know
students who've been held up for months
and months and months with IRB so yeah
Jonathan how people react to being
involved or the pii because the pii both
for the research but even more for
deployment to the degree that I start to
get into this it was a real problem you
start putting video in in places where
other people might walk into room
this you know you're showing videos with
the faces are yeah it doesn't have the
same effect right yeah um um I'm not
what were the two choices again well
you're quite search and an actual
deployment but also it's so one of them
is you know whether things will make
people feel depressed so forth the other
is just revealing the fact that you're
recording information well there there
there no no no they're wondering what
you're getting into well we're running
into we're running into both and uh but
for the moment we're dealing with
research obstacles and they're concerned
about confidentiality and concerned
about privacy etc etc etc and it in and
the issue of for example video
surveillance of seniors what people at
Intel have reported that I've heard them
report publicly is that very often like
if you want to in so-called smart home
technology which I think has been a bit
oversold and I don't think there I don't
think there are a lot of smart homes yet
which is why in in the second part of my
talk I talked about little aspects of a
smart home like monitoring fluent water
flow or possible Falls not an entire
smart home what people of Intel have
said to me and said publicly that
they've discovered that the senior
citizens in whose homes technology might
be deployed are much less worried about
invasions of their privacy than there at
all kids are worried and so but but
there are absolutely critical issues
here and and and as well as how do you
decide when something works well enough
to deploy it you know pharmaceuticals
before they do play a drug and that's
not that they don't have huge they don't
kill lots of people nonetheless but but
they still first try it on a few dozen
and then they tried on a hundred and
then they tried on a thousand then the
prayin hundreds of thousand before
what's going to happen with technology
like this when when the FDA or or
whatever once this starts to realize
these are medical instruments that
effect will we ever be able to deploy
anything because we'll never get to try
this on thousands of people I mean maybe
social media you can but not you know or
let's say any of the devices that I saw
today the the video proxies let's say
let's say Microsoft decides to
commercialize those or find somebody do
it how are you going to how are you
going to run this with honor on an
actual randomized combo trial with
thousands or tens of thousands of people
before deploying it so there this this
this leads to interesting kinds of
ethical and practical problems and and
anyway other questions comments someone
out there yes with my stories how this
how does the multimedia production
improve on or is it different from just
having photo albums um we we haven't we
haven't done that study and it would be
into it would be interesting to do this
because we got very little money and and
then never went for follow-on money I I
believe or my speculation is that
because we're used to sitting around a
TV screen and because more people can
sit around it then around a photo album
there's something there's there's
increased potential there although the
disadvantages is costlier and I mean I'm
not saying you should do one one of the
other I think people should should use
everything but the and then the other
thing is I think the I think we're we've
only scratched the surface is the
potential of social media and the
internet to help you gather material for
morale from families dispersed over the
world around the world and and and thus
have a richer experience including of
course a dynamic met one with video and
not just with photo albums but you know
I wish my parents had saved more photo
albums so yeah was going back to your
point about multi-disciplinary
narration and to your question about
research that shows you
so I feel like that literature does
exist outside of HCI you know in speech
pathology or rehab medicine or cognitive
rehabilitation I guess having networked
and kind of both sides of the point it
will see a lot of that collaboration
that I would expect to see see kind of
HDI people doing their work and then the
people in health or education doing some
of the same work but I'm just wondering
if you know of examples where these kind
of collaborations are starting to take
place well I mean we're I mean yeah
they're there are certainly examples I
mean I think of in on the west coast on
Terry oregon health and sciences
university group under jeff k I think
really has a superb collection of sort
of technical and medical expertise Alex
Michailidis is group does it we try but
it's it's it's hard to get people to
often to make the commitment to you know
because if you're I don't know if you're
an assistant professor of neurology or
something you probably have to be pretty
courageous to say okay I'm going to go
and spend a significant amount of my
research time working on some crazy new
stuff with with technology as opposed to
doing the kinds of things that you know
others in the field have done before so
it's it's there are disciplinary
boundaries there are cultural
differences between the the disciplines
in terms of how they share knowledge
Jonathan has written a lot on this I
mean in in KY you know we go into these
shootouts once every three months in
which we know eighty percent of the of
the papers will be knocked out or maybe
if it's cscw a more enlightened process
now only seventy percent whereas whereas
most medical disciplines use journals
for for that kind of shoot out and say
okay we want you all to come to the
meeting of the Alzheimer's Association
and you know you'll submit abstracts and
as long as the abstract seems moderately
coherent and
ontopic will accept it so one of the
reasons I'm editing this series for
Morgan and claypoole is my hope is to
the bridge these disciplinary chasms and
get people are crossing and when the
most recent one that's about to come out
by Julie kheench locally and Gillian
Hayes and Gregory a fountain and Matthew
I forget his last name and in Boston
really looks to me speaks to technology
people and autism people and draws on
the literature from all these
disciplines and even the literature is
in its own silos I mean there's there's
the ACM digital library and there's
pubmed and there's so it's it's really
hard to bridge those field of health
informatics is changing that a lot
though that's where I'm seeing
and doctors are very willing to
they're very well trained gauges
well thank you all for coming around
stick around afterwards and hit anyone
wants to come chat in a more one-on-one
environment and if anyone is still out
there and not watching the Red Sox and
the Tigers send in a question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
