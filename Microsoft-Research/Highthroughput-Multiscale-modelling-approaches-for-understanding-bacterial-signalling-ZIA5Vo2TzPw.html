you
okay good morning and it's a pleasure to
have been hall with us today Ben did his
PhD in Oxford with Mark Simpson where he
worked on development of new
computational tools for a new
computational methods to study dynamics
and function of large molecular
structures and then he continued to a
postdoc at the center for integrative
systems biology directed by Judy
Armitage where he worked with Judy and
others on them on the studying of
bacterial chemotaxis signaling and I
think this is also the topic of his his
talk today so I'll let you good morning
so today I'm going to talk about the
work I carrot some the work carried out
in Oxford relating to multiscale
modeling of bacterial chemo sensing and
specifically today I'm going to be
talking about modeling ter than the
bacterial chemists the model back to
your chemoreceptors tar and tsr with two
different types of approach one is a
high-throughput strategy to understand
large bodies of mutagenesis data that
have accrued over the past 30 years in
the literature of just the transmembrane
regions of these proteins and alongside
this very much larger structures
simulations of structures of complete
structures of that entire diet entire
system I always talk about what exactly
those relate to and the key thing we'll
trying I've been trying to do here is to
relate the dynamic behavior of both the
small small components and the complete
system to the front to real to the
function and how the signaling is
signals are passed along the length of
the protein I'm going to start off
however giving a little bit of
biological background on the system are
interested in and the system i'm
interested in is back to your chemotaxis
now this is the response of a bacteria
such as coli to its environment that is
it then the technique by which it moves
towards foods food sources and away from
toxins and this is achieved by a biased
random walk by alternating between
running behaviors where it swims in a
sin
direction and tumbling behaviors where
it randomly rotates in randomly rotates
into new directions it's able to bias
its motions towards the food sources
away from toxins and this is achieved in
the cell through a pathway indicated
here through coli whereby a binding
events ATS the AG the receptor domain of
the key receptor its communicated across
the cell membrane into the cell and
causes either activation of the kinase
key a court man if it's a repellent
binding which then caused downstream
phosphorylation events and ultimately
Celt running or in the case of
attractant binding caused is the
inhibition of the kinase key a witch
then late leads to sell and the
inhibition that Lee and leads to sell
running so it's alternating between
these running in tumbling behaviors
which allows the cell to go to one as
one source rather than the other yes so
what happens is that yes there's a foot
there in coli there about three or four
flagella purcell and what happens is by
rotating in one direction they determine
if it's going to run because the for the
gel the flagellar filament which are
long rod like structures arranged into a
single body and then propel it across a
propellant one direction when they
rotate in the opposite direction they
cause the cell to tumble because this
this bundle which is coalesced come to
pass they all fray off in two different
directions and the cell changes its
direction and that's achieved by
downstream activators such as ki y
phosphate which is phosphorylated by the
kinase ki a which is that which is which
is been in turn activated by the key the
chemotaxis proteins so it's a complex
system even in the models models ayer
sali coli csr antara the syrian and
aspartic chemoreceptors and that really
models for the whole of bacterial chemo
the methyl accepting chemoreceptors but
also bacterial sick signaling in the
general so they really have been they've
been studied extensively over the past
30 40 years but also they can be used to
give insights into other systems such as
bad a bacterial antibiotic resistance
and other things and in this specific
case I've been looking to model mostly
the structures just from a car like
because for this particular system there
are most of the structures and most of
the components available yes the
chemoreceptors are just the bits on the
surface that's the best I'm focusing on
that particular aspect and the key thing
we're interested in within this these
chemoreceptors is how the signal a
signaling event goes from the sceptre
domain here through a very small motion
of about point one five nanometers along
the length of a pro seen through the
transmembrane region through a HAMP
signal transduction domain and
ultimately to a coil coil domain which
then binds and effects downstream
effectors over 25 nanometers so there's
a small small motion is communicated a
small motion about point one five
nanometers is communicated over 25 25
nanometer protein we really want to
understand this signaling event and what
we have in terms of data is we have
structures of the receptor domain with a
ligand bound and unbound we have some
dice of low-resolution disulfide mapping
information on the transmembrane domain
which is less useful but it's still in
still data we have a NMR structure from
a related ham domain and we have a
structure of the core core domain and
what we know through mutagenesis and
also through cell activities within the
cell all of these domains can be altered
to change the signaling through it
through the system so we can turn the
silt sell off by mutating any one of
these different components that's it I'm
talking about physical atomistic
structure so exactly yes no this is this
is the physical so the mark I will talk
about the models in a minute but yes
everything is represented explicitly and
we're looking at the apt particular item
positions and I think really the key of
what we're trying to do here is to
connect the various disparate data
sources have been generated over the
past 30 years in a predictive fashion
and so these go from the schematic level
diagrams where we've got information on
the domain positions and the domain
orientations we have a high resolution
information on the physical structures
of the individual domains disconnected
from the complete chemoreceptor and then
we have low
an information on the complete system
and really what we had to be able to do
is take the sequence level data this
high-resolution data and this low
resolution data and come up with a model
which is both coherent with all the data
that's available but also is able to
predict new things that can be gun
tested by experimentalist or can be
tested by further simulation and really
the two approaches I'm Philip for this
involved tries we're trying to address
this aspect of how the man how the
different scales relate to one another
so 11 approach has been to iteratively
build bigger and bigger models of the
system from the individual structural
components which have available trying
to build models of initially the
complete length dimer which is
represented here in the middle from the
individual pairs of domains and multiple
domains by exploiting overlap building
bigger and bigger systems and seeing how
they interact with one another and how
they behave on their own in this context
i'm talking about a structural model so
a proposed structure physical structure
of the Kimura sector yes that's correct
it depends on the representation it
depends on the representations we're
generally going to be talking about
coarse-grained simulations and so we're
talking about thousands and tens of
thousands of particles for the biggest
systems we're looking at we had 450
million particles and we had to include
all the particles because it's a multi
body problems and so we explicitly yes
that's correct and alongside this we've
been trying to address lots of data
there is on just one component of this
that is the transmembrane region by just
simulating just individual components in
a realistic environment and then relate
and in a high-throughput regime which
allows us to get very good statistics on
the behavior and understand in detail
exactly what's precise motions are being
undergone and the hope is that we are
able to draw these two different types
of approaches together to get an
integrated view of how this structure
works as a system how the individual
components relate to one another and how
signals are passed through from this
receptor domain to the coil coil region
the key tool we've been using here is
molecular dynamics and in particularly
using court what we know as coarse grain
force fields these refer to the martini
and bond force fields which have become
increasingly popular in md in the past
few years and reduce the system size
bottom about four non-hydrogen atoms
that's carbon oxygen sulfur nitrogen to
one coarse grain particle this increases
the speed of the simulations massively
because it means there's a quarter of
the number of particles in the system
that would be compared to a detailed
system but also it smoothens the energy
landscape because there are fewer
particles the energy air is more quick
to it's quicker for the structure to
explore conformational space and the
really objective here is to just to
reiterate is to generate predictive
insights into macromolecular behavior so
we know that the complex macromolecular
structures can link structures function
through the dynamics through the
behavior over a period of time this
changes in structure a period of time
well what we want to use is the dynamics
of the models on distinct scales to
understand the behavior of the structure
as a whole a structure of system really
so I'm going to start off by talking
about the high-throughput simulation of
just transmembrane components in order
to perform this kind of stimulation
we've developed a novel software for
perfect specifically for performing
high-throughput simulation so what we've
developed is a tool I've called sidekick
which is a software package which sets
up massive numbers of simulations based
on a limited set of information so that
is it creates models the structure in a
realistic environment from an input
sequence or set of input sequences or
input sequence and a scanning mutant as
will being performed in the experiments
and then all these simulations are run
over a high-performance computing grid
and the real strength of this is that it
automates everything that is it from
this from an input sequence it will
generate the system it will then run the
simulation in a robust fashion checking
for crashes and then all analyze it for
you a simulation is a nap yes and
yes as in molecular dynamics so it
iteratively solving the F equals MA to
generate new positions over a period of
time we have to integrate numerically
because it's a look because it's a multi
body problem so what happens is we
generate a trajectory where we see a
series of the structure changes over a
period of time in terms of the model
changes its behavior but also water was
able to move around its lipids are able
to move around yes or it may it may
follow through if you perturb one end
you might expect it to not be one of the
things you learn to test that's what
individual simulations do consists of
yes yes but also we want to get very
good sampling so one of the issues with
especially with large systems I was
talking about with up to tens of
millions of atoms is you can only run
them once because they require massive
super computing resources to run them
whereas with these small systems where
and an automated pipeline we're able to
run this massively and duplicate so we
can both search sequence space for lots
of different mutants but we can also do
multiple replicates to ensure we're
getting a realistic behavior okay so to
break down the pipeline itself what we
start off with we start off with the
input sequence from that we were able to
generate a model of the structure of the
course models structure the helix in a
coarse-grained force field we then place
this helix in a box containing water
lipids and counter ions and initially
these warth this water lip encounter
eyes is all mixed up randomly so despite
the fact that we're interested in a
bilayer we don't start off with a
bilayer we allow the bilayer to
naturally self-assemble over the period
of the simulation the about sort pardon
the bilayer so the lipid so okay so the
cell is surrounded by a lipid bilayer
and that lipid bilayer has specific
properties including a hydrophobic core
an interface your region which both has
elements of hydrophobicity and
hydrophilicity and then there's outside
the membrane itself which is water and
the transmembrane region i'm interested
in simulating is specifically within
that bilayer the bilayer consists of two
layers of phospholipids
so the phospholipids have hydrophobic
tails which put air point since a
hydrophobic core and hydrophilic will
polar head groups which point on the
other swords the water and these these
bilayers really maintain a separation
between the inside of the cell and the
outside and so any signal has to pass
through the bilayer yep every simulation
effectively has a different viola and
the advantage of this is then it reduces
bias because of your self assemble a
boiler there's no way of predicting
you'll get the even an even number of
for example lipids on either side of the
bilayer you get the same bilayer every
self assembly and so we've done this
self-assembly to reduce the bias in the
system so we're putting less apart from
the initial position the helix we've got
the bilayer is not the same and so there
should be greater degree of variation so
then based on with this system then we
then perform what I've turned robust md
simulation which basically means that we
run the sim run the simulation through
standard md packages such as gromacs we
then check to see if the simulation has
crashed and then if it has crashed then
we restart the simulation from the last
good time point was slightly more gentle
parameters and then we continue this and
continue the simulation from that point
finally concatenated all the results
into one continuous time trajectory at
the end of it we so the thing about the
feature we have with the coarse-grained
force fields is we don't always get we
can't always predict the appropriate
time step for md so md requires several
several inputs one of the most crucial
of which i think is the time step so
what you want to have is a time set
between individual iterations of the
integration of the law Newton's second
law a and where you need to have a time
step which is shorter than fastest
motion of the system with the
coarse-grained force fields because
they're relatively new we're not always
sure what the right time step will be
for a given system for a given
simulation and so we can't always
predict from the offset which we want
which we would want for a particular
system so what we do is this when we say
more gentle parameters the key thing we
do is we reduce the time step to about
half now the downside to that is it
means it runs half as fast but if it
does run
whereas we have a faster times that
we're able to explore more
conformational space more quickly based
on this simulation of just the helix in
a boiler then we analyze it based on key
metrics describing how the helix it's in
the bilayer in terms its position
orientation and likelihood to peer in
the bilayer different simulations and
then we can then mutate and replicate
that is we can repeat this cycle but
different gila seas or four different
randoms therefore different random input
seeds so we can effectively replicate
this and get very good statistics for
each of the behaviors and the strength
of this is where as previously people be
able to maybe run a single simulation of
your protein of interest see how it
behaved as times gone on people will
then try to expand this to looking at
multiple ones and comparing these
behaviors back to biological activity
and then furthermore people will if they
have the time and they're particularly
enthusiastic they may have tried to
repeat these two gets good statistics
the problem with this kind of proach how
of those it's very time consuming
management and curation of the data as
well as analysis become a problem when
you've got large numbers of disparate
simulations which you all have to
analyze individually with the sidekick
automation what we're able to do is is
on at least an order magnitude of 200
magnitudes larger scale and we can also
automate this all through a web
interface so we can remove members of
simulations generate massive amounts of
deep data just from typing in the
sequence right there tell it the
sequences and press and go essentially
the kid we're bringing it back to the
back to the bacterial chemotaxis system
the particular helix were interested in
connect the receptor domain to the to
the signal transduction domain the ham
domain so crosses the bilayer and this
is transmembrane helix to and its
proposed to carry information across the
bilayer from the receptor domain to the
signal transduction domain now the
structure the helix is walk like and
what that means is it has a very simple
hydrophobic core indicated here in red
with flanking aromatic residues which
lock the pet lock the ends of the
peptide into the interfacial region well
that means is that the hydrophobic
region in the middle keeps it in the
bilayer whereas the the flanking rear
flanking aromatic residues lock the
position lots of positions forensic
kinetically
moving out of that orientation it said
to be what like because this resembles
an artificial peptide that has been used
to understand membrane behavior called
Walt and as so because we know this is
relatively simple the behavior of the
peptide in isolation is a sensible model
for proposing how different
modifications may in general alter such
a system so that is how the mutants
change the behaviors yep so what we
because we know that this there this
helix biologically resembles a model
system which we can understand in
isolation because it's quite simple we
hope that we'll be able to it we hope
it's a realist reasonable approach to
just treat this peptide in isolation to
understand how it moves in isolation
from the rest of the protein to
understand how it will move in the
context of the whole protein so because
it's simple we'd expect its own behavior
to be dictated by the warp like peptide
yes that's right for now well we'll get
on to the bigger stuff soon so the key
problem that we haven't with the field
of bacterial chemotaxis is that we've
generative in vast amounts of
experimental data generated over the
past 30 years where people have mutated
almost every residue in the
transmembrane domain to every other
possible residue and then measured the
output in terms of other how the cell is
swimming how the downstream effectors
are altered and how that how the whole
system changes however the problem with
all the mutagenesis work is that the
experiments are difficult to interpret
in terms of the biophysical event of
signaling so you can't measure the
actual structural changes which are
induced by the mutant two cards
unambiguously link a particular mutation
to particular biophysical events to a
particular biological survey ball and so
what we would hope to do by looking
through all of these mutants is to be
able to assess how the biophysics how
the mutants alter the biophysical
properties the peptides a move make it
move up and down in membrane and then
relate that back to the biological
observables and say this is
unambiguously the model for signaling
yes so it's an interesting question so
with the systems we started on I'm going
to talk about in a second I are the the
systems with a trend they make the moat
the easiest the easiest sets to look at
so for example one particular set has a
trend where half the mutants are active
and half the mutants are inactive now
the advantage of that is that we can
then compare all of you the various
metrics we're generating for all these
peptides back to that trend and see
where the trends correlate what is
rather harder to look at is where you've
got data sets where they've got for
example from a genetic screen where the
mutants mutations can appear anywhere
and the active patterns in activity in
any activity have no clear trend and are
harder to interpret okay yes they they
come from other people's experiments
exactly yes yep though ultimately we
hope to use these to predict mutants to
improve the experimental protocols and I
can talk about that later if it's of
interest so from all the mutant data
that has been in the literature as well
as crystallographic data have been two
major models of how signals are passed
across the membrane into the cell one
suggests this helix of interest tm2
slides by about point one at one and a
half angstroms or point one five
nanometers towards a cytoplasm on
attractant binding so it's a very small
motion and this small motion then causes
a downstream set of effects which lead
to cell set to kinase inactivation now
in contrast this has been supposed by a
variety of different experimental
methods but in contrast to that recently
a model has been proposed where this he
same helix rather than in viewing a
sliding motion undergoes a very small
rotation about 26 degrees in the
membrane and this small rotation then
cause the clockwork like set of
rotations in the downstream physical
machinery the hamp domain the signal
transduction domain and then this course
is the downstream effect and so what we
really like to do is to address this
large body amused
and say do they favor one model or the
other favor the other yes so when I'm
talking about when I talking model
earlier I was talking about a structural
model so that is the Pacific 3d
positions the atoms in space now i'm
talking about a model of the mechanism
of signaling so that is the proposal
that a helix undergoes a sliding motion
or a rotation motion so that it's a
different kind of model but they it's
related to the others these are based on
mutant mutational data and
crystallographic data so we have the
three for example for certain structures
we have the three-dimensional positions
of all the atoms of most of it most of
one particular components and they
appear to have been moved by about one
and a half angstroms and in the ligand
bound versus the not ligand bound this
is proposed from for example from that
crystal structure that there was a this
shift furthermore you can actually label
experimental you can label different
parts of the protein you can see if you
can observe that one and half angstrom
shift but because it's so small it's
typically hard to access on experimental
experimental scales and it's very hard
to get a decent signal compared to all
the noise you get so some of the
measurements are not necessarily on the
transmembrane domain which is what their
proposed to affect so there's a variety
of different information but it's all
generally indirect and also there's the
interpretation of the mutant data which
is obviously open for debate or
potentially open for debate so what we
start off by is looking at the aromatic
residue mutants of the aspartate
receptor tar in a particular we've
looked at a trip van tyrosine asymmetric
scan which produce a very distinct trend
in behavior so these are aromatic
residues which anchor the peptide in the
membrane so they produce specific
interactions with the interfacial region
that is the edge of them the bilayer and
therefore their proposed to either pull
the helix up or down depending on this
we've been moved up or down in the
sequence we also look where they
experimenter they also looked at
removing some of these anchoring regions
and replacing them with our means and in
each case I've run 100 100 nano second
martini simulations
for each mutant that's available and
that's a standard procedure for this to
give you an overview of what this data
look like what you have is the sequences
of all the transmembrane regions which
was studied by the group and what you
can see is in each of them they move
this wy motif up and down the sequence
from the wild-type which is the middle
and what they observe is that kinase
activity increased when you move it
towards the c terminus at the top and
decrease when you moved it towards the
end termos here at the bottom this this
this this is the lab experiment for with
which we're comparing so the
interpretation of this result was that
the helix is pulled up and down by the
specific interactions that tryptophan
tyrosine with the interfacial region and
that was it so the idea is that this
position the helix is pulled toward the
cytoplasm because the tryptophan
tyrosine have been moved up in the
membranes of drawing the helix down
however the problem with it being a
helix is that as well as changing the
position in the map membrane it also
changes the rotation along the helix
this also potentially could change the
rotation in the tilt behavior of the
helix as well so that's this thing we
explicitly looked for when we look to
the bilayer position however what we
observed was that the helix the active
mutants the inactive mutants were both
displaced relative to the wild type in
the bilayer with the inactive mutants
being pushed towards the cytoplasm
active mutants being pushed towards the
periplasm in good agreement with the
piston model this concept of the peel
it's just sliding up and down they're
both their mood shifted by about one to
one or half angstroms relative to one
another which is a good and an
unexpected result this is this this is
the ND results yet or one DMD results
furthermore when we looked at the
rotation and the tilt behavior there was
no correlation between the trends that
observed in the experiments and the tilt
or rotation of the gila sees so that is
we can only see a correlation between
the change in the position and the
change in position the biological
activity and so what we propose from
this is actually this is good support
for the piston model whether it's just a
sliding of the helix up and down
alongside this we look to the different
set of mutants where this trips fund in
the anchoring church fans were there
removed from the sequence and replaced
with something which doesn't have the
same anchoring effect one mutant where
it was removed mimics the previous
system where we mutate the same
tryptophan we remove that tryptophan
cause the downstream kinase being
activated we change the remove the trips
down at the other side of the membrane
we only get a very weak inactivation and
then when we remove both of them we get
a mixture of the behaviors that are
observed in both when we look at this
data set what we see is actually there's
no change in position here but we do see
is there's a very distinct change in the
tilt of the helix in the membrane and
this tilt now correlates with a kinase
activity a tilt now correlates with the
kinase activity so the individual point
mutants cause an increase in tilt about
two or three degrees whereas the double
mutant causes an egg tilt of the roughly
five degrees in total so these are very
small motions but very consistent with
what the experiments of total so far
again looking at this data set there was
no change in the rotation behaviors
observed so again there's no correlation
between rotation of these gila ceased
and the experimental observable that
that's true I think it's what exactly is
going on in the membrane is something we
can only really understand when we've
got both this kind of data which
suggests that it might be a pushing type
force and the data for the complete set
because then from what we hope is be
able to relate the behavior on a very
small scale for behavior on a larger
scale that we able to take those two
results together understand how they're
causing the downstream signaling so even
if there are these small motions we need
to understand how these muscle motions
then may lead to the downstream effect
yes
at the moment it's not thought it's not
known how so I think if I understand
your question correctly you're
suggesting that the tilt is not enough
actually there may be external forces
applied from the whole structure yes so
we're not able to experimentally
determine that that kind of observable
and I know people have tried to do this
by specifically labeling it with
techniques such as solid-state NMR the
key problem and the reason why this kind
of approach is valuable is that you
can't address this experimental you
can't actually assess the position and
orientation of the helix in the bilayer
experimental you can only look at
downstream experimental observables so
there is no direct way of getting this
kind of insight now I appreciate what
you say we need to both observe it
observe it both in the larger system and
in the smaller system but the problem is
the largest system is too large to get
this kind of good statistical data the
results we get from the larger systems
typically only come from a single
simulate some single md simulation and
so not really statistically valid in the
same way they're still qualitatively
useful but they're not they don't
produce the same kind of information so
without wanting to go too much longer
about the psychic side of things we also
looked at two other sets of information
one what keep principally now where they
introduce basic residues both into the
interfacial region which we talked about
previously but also into the hydrophobic
core of the membrane and this has been
done by site-directed mutagenesis for
tar from salmonella and the related
prayer protein trig which would text
glycine in a genetic screen the
interesting results are here that the
results from miller the site-directed
mutagenesis indicated that there was a
very distinct piston swinging piston
type motion and this was a ser the
conclusion the experimentalist now
in contrast the genetic screen data
didn't produce a clear interpretation it
wasn't really interpretable an
interesting property there was a basic
residue introduction into the new
hydrophobic core course two distinct FET
effects in adjacent positions we look at
the miller data in simulation what we
find is that they really reproduce what
we've seen previously a swing piston
type behavior exhibiting both changing
Tilton positioning it great in agreement
with what we would expect from the
previous results and this is just a
quick demonstration that with the
graphics we look at the site air the
jessic screen data this is rather more
complicated but we because what we see
here for the two neighboring positions
which we get different activities we see
we see the same behavior in terms of
displacement so this seems to contradict
the results we've had previously however
the one oddity about this result is that
when we look at the rotation now the
kinase active states both have a much
stronger preference to one particular
direction but also I rotated roughly 180
degrees compared to both the wild-type
and the kinase inactive mutant so for
this specific case what we propose is
happening is actually that the system
may be broken by this extreme rotation
which hasn't been observed previously
that the rotation here is much larger
than any rotation which is proposed
based on the structural data that's been
available and actually this is a natural
event leading to the biological readout
and these sorry these are circular
histograms where the colors indicate the
population of a particular rotation
direction so Reds are very highly
populated blues are unpopulated you can
see there's much stronger preference in
one particular direction for the three
three basic residue mutants relative to
the wild type but also these active
mutants are facing completely opposite
direction to both the wild type and the
kinase inactive mutant and this is the
same data representing a slightly more
conventional format and so what we're
left with is a signaling state
hypothesis where we say that the helix
slides down in the membrane in response
to a attractive binding event increasing
in tilt and changing position leading to
downstream kinase inactivation we can't
rule out of this stage that this transit
you may require the helix helix whose
ability to rotate particularly in light
of the bound the result from the bound
guards in the data and also it's worth
saying that in the context of the
complete system we may not be able to
separate the different mechanistic
difference between the changes in tilton
the position because of the fact there's
a wider structure there which may change
these behaviors so that's all I'm going
to talk about today with regard to the
high-throughput the next set data I'm
going to talk about is the dynamics of
the complete structure and the complete
structure represents a real problem for
molecular modeling and that is because
typically MIT there where you've gots
large stretches of missing structure
they've become cause major problems for
molecular modeling type approaches and
in particular the transmembrane domain
is structurally uncharacterized at high
resolution so this creates a big gap in
our knowledge which normally would be a
challenge furthermore with regard to tsr
it is large it is dimeric that is the
individual conveniently link chains
always exist as a dimer those dimers
frequently exist as a trimer of dimers
so that's three times to these trimers
of dimers then exist in a very large
hexagonal array covering about 22,000
nanometers on the cell pole and which
communicate information throughout the
throughout the array and in addition to
this there are other key regions as a
missing which connect the different
domains as well as the trail as the
transmembrane region so it really poses
a unique problem for us this
we get so I characterized it slightly
differently we don't know where some the
scale is a problem in terms of guessing
the amount of resource and treating it
appropriately so running it long enough
so we can understand if it works or it
doesn't work I think the there are
misses they're missing data regions but
all I think the third problem would be
there is also we also know that there is
to a larger structure that we're not
able to model so for example beyond a
trimer of diamonds is very complicated
to model because people don't understand
how the hexagonal or a packs there isn't
experimental data there so we are unable
to model that and we've got to be aware
that we were explicit missing out that
aspect we can put any atoms in any place
the problem is it's validating them
after the events because some
simulations will allow you to
discriminate between good contacts and
bad contacts but many simulations won't
give you that kind of predictive power
so they might be able to tell you things
are falling apart and the more
complicated the system is and a larger
complement system is the less likely you
are to be able to be confident that what
you're observing is real so what we do
here is we try to exploit what we notice
we term a self-assembly that is we allow
this ordered regions the structure to
equilibrate in the hope that they will
fall into roughly right the right
orientation in particular we do use this
for the set of the transmembrane region
when it was modeled as attached to the
receptor domain so we use the receptor
domain to initially see the positions of
the transmembrane helix ease and then we
allow them to come together over a
period of time by running simulations of
small pairs of domains and compare
individual components then we use
homology modeling to stitch these
individual components together and
reinforce the original structural data
onto the system so we hopefully
reproduce something realistic homology
modeling is where we take similar
structures that are available in
literature to the sequences we're
interested in and we use those similar
structures to build a structure of the
thing we're interested in even though we
don't have any direct structural
information on the data that's available
so it's a way of taking data from
experiments and
okay by using this domain Oh taking the
domain a person using the overlap we
were able been able to generate two
different models of the structure one
where we impose symmetry explicitly
which resemble the left which very
closely resembles the pictures you will
see in the literature of how the
structure is proposed to look but also
an asymmetric one where symmetry has not
been imposed which seemed to have a
bending around the handling and it's
really not clear from the offset which
of these would be experimental II fade
but even though that one is the picture
that's used in the literature a lot of
the time so we run simulations with both
of them the simulations we ran with
coarse grain molecular dynamics have
talked about already and in this case
we're using the bakula dynamics to both
validate the structural models but also
to gain insight into the dynamics of
protein or relate these dynamics to the
protein function and in each case we ran
for four replicates about five
microseconds so these relatively long
simulations compared to the very small
simulations before what we observe that
the structure domains are stable and
largely maintained their faults this is
a good validation because the proteins
not falling apart what's more we see a
bending observed a long length of the
protein which generates an asymmetric
receptor regardless of whether we start
with a symmetric receptor an asymmetric
receptor so bending always occurs this
bending is at the Hat weekend we've
identified as being at the HAMP demain
or neighbors the ham to me and could
potentially be very large up to 60
degrees though the modal position is
about a bend of 30 degrees so really we
had to investigate this and we had to
validate this with experiment this has
not been something that when proposed
previously when we went over and comb
through the experimental data what we
found is actually there's lots of
disparate data which seems to suggest
there may be a bending event the best
data is available will is comes from
lipid nano disk preparations so these
are little patches of membrane which are
able to be cut out in which you insert a
single protein what we observe when we
look at the e/m data is that you can see
you can observe you can see individual
nano discs which is the flat region here
that I'm highlighting and you can see an
individual receptor dimer in this nano
disc and you it was symmetric you would
expect it to be 90 degrees to the
compared to the baile what we actually
observe is there is a bed
ending around hand this is the clearest
image in that particular from that
particular still but actually this has
been observed throughout all the
diamonds that have been prepared in the
air so this is this is probably the best
evidence that this is real alongside
this we've know that the kink region
correlates to a known area of processing
sensitivity so a region which you would
expect to be more bendy and furthermore
upcoming unpublished cryo-electron
microscopy data seem to indicate the
hole on the whole array seems to
indicate there maybe this kinking below
HAMP but that's rather more difficult to
quantify having not been published we
can then go back and try to validate the
structural models with other
experimental data it's available
particularly a transmembrane region for
which we didn't have high resolution
data what we find with disulfide mapping
experiments our results are broadly
consistent so the orientation the Gila
sees agree well that the positions may
be slightly different and the orange
regions here which face one another
indicates regions of high efficiency
cross-linking which means these regions
should face one another in the structure
and indeed they do when we look at the
Hampton main which has an unusual
internal packing units available high
resolution structure what we see is that
the key interface is maintained so the
interface we know to be sensitive to
mutagenesis is maintained throughout the
length of the simulation however the
packing has been arranged subtly to give
what is known as a knobs into holes
packing a classical packing for coil
coil regions as opposed to the observer
entally observed knobs two knobs packing
which is relatively than usual and this
has been achieved by helix sliding
you're one of the second helix as2
towards the coiled region below it and
what we think is that this is actually
giving rise to the observed some AC
asymmetry and bending in the structure
we can then try to fit for further
validate this with an alternative
modeling approach and this is elastic
network modeling I'm not going to go
into depth on this but this is another
low resolution technique for
understanding long-term dynamics and
these really further support kinking
around the hampden main identifying the
hinge between two rigid bodies in the GM
indicated by the region without any the
green region between the red and the
blue region and the anisotropic network
model which seems to the arrows here
indicate the bending motion along the
length of the protein focused in on the
hamp
a gaussian network model it's a type of
elastic network model which is
one-dimensional I can talk about that
later I'll be very happy to it's
specific is it it's like normal mode
analysis if you're familiar with that
okay so however the dimer is only one
one interesting structure and there are
other interesting structures too so the
trimer of dimers is the is known to
activate the downstream kinase and so is
thought to be the minimum subunit
required for signaling however the
bending of TS are the tsr structure we
observed makes a free self-assembly
where we just have three of the proteins
in the box and let them come together
difficult because the degree of bending
requires we have a massive massive box
to do this so what we did was he started
from initial structural model based on
the crystal contacts of think
experimental observables and we restrain
those crystal contacts what we observe
is zipping along the length of the
structure which occurs very quickly to
form a rod like structure which is
retained after the restraints are
removed to show you also mean by that we
start off with this tent-like structure
with the rod individual dimer rods
coming away to form a triangle with the
space in the middle well we see after
500 nanoseconds is there very rapidly
coalesced to form a single bundle a
single rod we can then compare this
directly to experimental evidence and in
this particular case we're looking
enough that there is something direct to
compare with cryo-electron tomography
results seem to indicate that our model
which shows a bundle stretching from the
core core region here all the way to the
transmembrane and receptor main here is
agrees nicely with the experimentally
observed a PO low resolution a post
structure where you can see the bundle
stretches from the typical call to the
transmembrane region here furthermore if
you to look at the ligand bound
structure which we not simulated you can
notice there is a break between the hamp
domain and the coiled-coil domain which
would seem to indicate there may be a
value that the bending we observe in the
Diamonds may be significant for the
signaling process itself just to go
quickly over the dynamics of the trim of
diamonds without restraints what we find
is the destruction the contacts are
stable even after the restraints have
been removed and we still so show some
bending around the hand
me so how do we interpret these two
slightly two different data sets in two
different behaviors well the structure
is highly dynamic so it's certainly in
isolation it's very free to bend and
throw free to move and so what we
propose is actually that this is this
dynamic behavior is indicative of a
general model whereby the hamp hinge is
tightened or loosened to create the
bending and to cause downstream kinase
inactivation and so what we proposed on
the basis of this is other modifications
that we know happen in the cell alter
the wider structural stability to
tighten or loosen this hand hinge
however this is these this is very
valuable for individual dimer trimer
dimers models we want to move beyond
isolated structures though because the
cell is much more complex environment
than the model systems we had here the
model membrane environment lacks several
elements we know a required function so
the membrane existing it's curved there
are a much more complicated mixture of
lipids and there are very high
concentrations of proteins and so what
we've been able to do is we were able to
take the models we've generated and
we've built them into very large 70
nanometer basical systems which can be
simulated a supercomputer resource so
these are the fifth 15 15 million
particle simulations this is a nice
experimental analogue because we know
that receptor arrays localized to the
cell pole that is a region of high
curvature in the membrane we know that
one particular lipid karyotype and pulls
at the cell poles and regions of high
curvature enlarged isolated membrane
vesicles as that's 40 sfera blast
furthermore we know that receptor dimers
are not thought to exist in isolation in
vivo but trimers I've diamonds can
loosely associated so we'd expect is
that dimers have an intrinsic in
tendency to aggregate whereas trimers of
diamonds should have a lesser propensity
to aggregate so we've starts off with an
empty lipid vesicle we run a a realistic
mixture of the lipids of important
scardale i pan DPP E and D PPG and
mimicking the experimental determined
quantities what we see is with no
proteins there these lipids remain mixed
over a period of a microsecond
dissimulation so they don't naturally
partition
we then could take that vehicle that
we've generated we can put the protein
models we've generated into that so we
can distribute them evenly over the
surface and then we restart the
simulation and run for two microseconds
to give you an idea what these things
look like the outside of the surface you
can see here on the Left the dimers
sorts of spot over the surface creating
quite evenly and in this the Mott the
model on the left on the right here with
the tribes of Diamonds equally evenly
distributed and in each case we've got
about that we've got 30 dimers for each
free similar system now on the surface
of things it doesn't look very busy but
because these things are so long what we
find is actually the core is quite
densely packed so there's at least 20
angstrom animators between every down
there in the system but there's quite a
lot of room for interaction between them
over the course of simulation well we
see is that the protein diamond is self
associate very tightly to form extensive
contacts which mimic those that we've
observed in our tribe of diamonds model
this is a very good validation for the
trimer of diamonds model we talked about
previously furthermore the tremors of
diamonds associate but they make less
extensive contacts so the structures
with a lesser propensity to aggregate
don't make as big air interactions with
their neighboring proteins furthermore
we can make conclusions about the
specific lipids and what we find is that
cardio life and closely associate with
the protein structures in the membrane
in a specific fashion and just to show
you what happens over the course of
simulation going back to this half shell
we remove the front half the lipids to
reveal the proteins on the inside where
you can see over the course of two
microseconds is that extensive bending
and interactions are observed in the
dimers here where we actually see them
start coalescing and wrapping around one
other whereas in contrast the tribes of
divers do interact but they make very
have very much smaller interaction
surfaces sort of how do we interpret
this well this validates the rod-like
model of the structure the time of
dimers in a sense it is stable and the
dimer self associate to generate model
contacts but beyond this the specific
cardiolipin contacts also indicate the
cardell life and partitioning may not be
induced by prem brain curvature who's
been proposed previously but actually
being juiced by the protein interactions
in
cells and the proteins themselves may
move to regions of high curvature in the
membrane so finally to sum up we've gin
I've generated cold great models of the
track the CSR trimer dimer and trimers
of dimers and i model over two decades
worth of transmembrane helix mutants the
complete systems are stable they're
largely consistent with experiment and
show kinking at the ham domain induced
likely by a swinging piston observed in
this the motions of small hela seas
causing a bending and the tightening or
loosening of the hand hinge furthermore
the dynamics may be indicative of a
model of kin receptor activation through
subtle changes in his hamp packing this
hand hinge which changed the kink
properties and turn the signal from an
arm to an off state how would you go
beyond this well I think the results
here are all it's fair to say the
results here generated largely
structural and the model proposed whilst
we've got specific quantitative data
from the high throughput simulations
have been largely qualitative in some
senses once we have the position of all
the atoms in space the interpretation
we're putting upon them is a generic
bending interpretation rather than a
specific number so the further one and
further problems to this is that the
direct experimental validation is
difficulty for a large extent impossible
given the current available techniques
so lots of the things we've been talking
about may be separated from a so
separated from any validating
experimental technique by at least one
layer of interpretation because of the
experimental measure the actual
experimental measurables so really to go
beyond what we've got here as well as to
expand the system will also read their
to explicitly address the network
effects and see if we can relate the
observables we see in our simulations to
wider models the network see if we can
predict experimental observables rather
than just structural observables and I
just need to acknowledge the various
people who've worked with this work was
all done this is work all done in Oxford
under muck with Mark sansom and Judy
armitage and thanks for and I just want
to thank all the people who helped out
different stages on the way and thank
you all for listening
so at present we're the only people
who've been working on the
high-throughput simulation of the trans
mara helixes to the extent we've been
working on now there are other automated
systems for running md simulations
however I think I to my knowledge
sidekick is the only example of
something where people have tried to
make an end-to-end pipeline so it can
all be you can do all the simulations
and get all the analysis you want to the
web server you can get more data if you
want to reanalyze the data but we can
actually it you can be completely
shielded from the nitty-gritty of the
how the data is generated and the to be
honest vast amounts raw data that's
generated so I didn't mention it with
about six or seven terabytes of data
been generated over the past year by the
sidekick pipeline now to make that
manageable you have to use the
analytical metrics with regard to md of
the complete structure there are people
working on individual components but
again nobody's working nobody has been
looking to build the models the complete
structure because they've been because
of long-standing issues with missing
data regions because we've been able to
overcome them using the coarse-grained
folding approaches we've been able
uniquely make press on in this space
it's very likely though once we bear so
the sidekick data has on the
transmembrane helix ease has been
published once we publish the the work
on the chemoreceptors the complete wild
scheme receptor is currently under
review and we'll make those models when
we make those models available what's
our expected of being exploded more
people in the field trying to express
that exploit the entire system
not not a particular method not this
particular methodology so there are
people working on this from a systems
level and so for example Dennis sprayer
Dennis spray and Karen looked off of
work for a long period of time on models
of how the tribes of dimers communicate
information through the array and
equally people have also modeled how the
information is passed throughout the
cell and so that level of modeling has
been going on and that's been going on
for a very extended period of time but
for the specific aspects I've been
talking about the structural modeling
there hasn't been as much available
whilst there has been some data made
available for particular components
they've either not done it through a
high-throughput regime or they've not
look to model me a complete system in
the same way the results were able to
generate this a very much unique to the
Proteas we've used yes
it is something to shout about but it's
causes a lot of problems for a lot of
different ap because its problems but it
also creates opportunities the problem
is we have to store it we have curated
and I've not talked about the technical
details of how sidekick has been
implemented but also we need a very big
file system because the amount data
you'll be generated requires it is
unusual to have that much data but
especially because of the weight because
the way it's been generated in an
automated fashion it really one of the
things we've not done yet which would be
very exciting be to try and mine this
data so having run individual
simulations for a particular purpose and
to take all the data in aggregate and
see if we can derive any new rules and
new ideas from that data only pick out
flaws in the model is not obvious just
from looking at individual data sets
that is something that would be very
exciting to me and that's why I think we
have to keep the raw data even if we
only for large numbers of particular
problems we don't look at the metrics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
