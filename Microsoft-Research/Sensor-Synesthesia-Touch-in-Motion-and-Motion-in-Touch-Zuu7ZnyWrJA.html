mobile interaction
likewise mobile devices typically
include motion sensors to support
techniques such as automatic screen
rotation to explore techniques for
handheld mobile devices that leverage
the multi modal combination of touch and
motion we implement a number of
interactions using a Zune HD as well as
Windows Phone 7 the user can hold a
thumb on the screen and zoom in on that
point by tilting the device the rate of
zooming depends on the change in the
tilt angle tilting in the opposite
direction zooms out this affords
one-handed continuous zooming unlike
pinch to zoom which requires two hand
automatic screen rotation while useful
makes it hard to surf the web while
lying down but holding the screen while
pivoting the device locks the screen at
his current viewing orientation
a small padlock icon provides feedback
of the state rotating to a new
orientation automatically removes the
lock alternatively in some applications
holding the screen while pivoting the
device might be used to rotate objects
on the screen about the center of
rotation indicated by the thumb in our
prototype photo browser the user can
touch a photo and shake the device to
delete that specific photo shaking that
photo again undoes the deletion this
interaction shows how touched + motion
affords contextual gestures that are
specific to an individual object on the
screen to select a region of a photo the
user can frame a portion of the screen
with two thumbs and then tilt the device
to crop out the desired region moreover
this motion gesture is smoothly
integrated with multi-touch zooming this
shows how motion sensing fluidly
supports additional interactions while
maintaining consistency with existing
multi-touch conventions
the preceding techniques Illustrated new
gestures that are possible when we put
touch in motion
but we can also adopt the reverse
perspective and instead consider the
motion and touch that is the sensory
ripples that are induced when the user
touches the screen for example the user
can scroll through photos by swiping the
screen as usual but a hard onset to a
dragging motion allows one to instead
rearrange the photos without resorting
to a distinct editing mood
likewise from the calendar tile on the
home screen the user can tap normally to
view the agenda for the day and then tap
again to navigate to the current
appointment or the user can instead tap
hard on the calendar tile to drill down
directly to the current appointment and
the system animates the tile according
to how forcefully the user struck it as
sensed by the devices accelerometer to
lend a fresh nuance of expression to
tapping a further possibility is to
optimize touch interactions by
recognizing the context of use for
example here we can see that the motion
sense by accelerometers and gyros on the
device are quite distinct when the user
interacts with the thumb versus a finger
of the offhand here we see a second
example where the motion sensors are
used to distinguish which corner of the
device a user taps on without resort to
direct touch sensing at all collectively
these techniques represent a hidden
dimension of touch that hints at how
direct interaction is about much more
than just touch and can be greatly
enriched by considering the interplay of
touch with other modalities including
motion sensing this can be considered
from the perspective of putting touch
and motion with new multimodal gestures
as well as from the reverse perspective
of seeking the motion and touch to sense
subtle nuances of touch interactions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
