you
and instead of talking to you about
incredible innovation and how are we
going to deal with that I'd basically
like to talk to you about sharepoint
architecture only joking add you for a
minute though so listen last 30 minutes
this is really most important for me I
actually kind of think it's important
for you so I have got a comedy job title
chief and visioning office so the reason
we invented the job title is I work for
a company you will well know in our day
jobs we love to talk to you about the
technology and the products that we make
if you think about those in the context
of what you've just seen there's
something missing and the thing that's
missing is the human beings that use
those products because actually none of
this works if we can't wake up the human
beings to the potential of what we're
doing with technology and where we're
going to go so we created this position
to try and show people that to really
focus what we think the future of human
beings are going to do the reason
specifically for the job title is I kind
of think of my job like it's about the
future of humanity and given I think
it's about the future of humanity I
deserve now I demand a job title with a
certain degree of pomposity I think
you'll see her achieve that I also I
told me mum when I was a kid I said mum
one day I'm going to be CEO of Microsoft
you just watch me you may be aware there
was recently reading a job opening for
that position this is still the only way
I'm going to pull that off the problem
my I stand in front of you and
individual dedicated my entire career to
the world of IT 20 odd years in the IT
industry I've chosen to work for one of
the world's largest technology companies
I have gone to the extremes of personal
grooming to grow a beard and a ponytail
that's how committed I am to my industry
and guess what I quite like Star Trek
Star Trek is really important right
because it sets a backdrop when you're a
young naive gullible kid like what I was
Star Trek teaches you that technology is
supposed to be a force for good in our
society it's supposed to be this
transformational force that enables
human beings to achieve more than they
could do on their own now my problem is
like you I've got lots of experience in
the IT industry I look around at how we
all use technology every single day and
I do not see that release I see a prison
I see something that constrains how we
work controls how we think
and the biggest challenge we face if you
think about all of the incredible things
we've seen today is not whether the
technology is going to work it's whether
the bloody human beings are going to
want to aspire to do more with
technology than they do today the
biggest challenge we face with
technology is what my dad calls the
interface between the keyboard and the
chair it's us human beings because it's
our lack of aspiration for
transformation that holds us back it's
our innate desire to want to replicate
old ways of working with new
technologies Jamie's vision for
interaction will come to nothing if we
never switch from the keyboard a design
143 years old designed for another world
we have to do things differently and
this is my job my job is to start
helping you to think differently to
provoke questions in you last year wrote
a book called business reimagine which
was essentially just a provocation that
said how we work today is not working we
cannot go on in a digital society simply
replicating analogue ways of work the
book this year has called the rise of
the humans and the story is all about
data it's about machine learning you
lucky people have all been given a free
copy in your packs that's how good we
are my publisher says thank you i'm also
a cheap date you can get both of the
copies for free online but these stories
they're not answers i used to be a
consultant i know better than to give
you answers this is a questions this is
a debate for you all to really think
about what do we need to do to make this
happen but i want to tell you that
second story because i think it frames
quite nicely what you've heard today
because it starts in this place I call
the digital Dell use a world of too much
information we exist with too much
information wherever we go whatever
we're doing there is too much
information thing is though we've kind
of had that problem for a long time I
would argue that we've had too much
information as a society since the
invention of the printing press because
at that moment in time we had access as
a society to more information than any
single individual could consume in their
lifetimes the fact we have ten times
more or brazilian times more today it's
kind of irrelevant we've still got too
much but what makes it worse is these
bloody things these beautiful engaging
lovely connected mobile devices that we
carry with us wherever we go whatever
we're doing because thanks to them we
now have too much information wherever
we
whatever we're doing we will from the
minute we wake up to the minute we go to
bed be glued to one of these devices we
showed that the fifty-eight percent of
the average UK workforce will check this
within 15 minutes of waking up fifty-two
percent of them will check it within 15
minutes of going to sleep we fill in
every nook and cranny of available time
looking at this screen and yet this is
where we are we're still here technology
frustrates us a quick test who doesn't
get enough email my I'm going to write a
punchline to that joke we get the pain
but that's not what this is supposed to
be right but are this philosophy that
everything we need to learn about the
future we can actually find out from our
past and it's based on that philosophy I
would like to place all of the blame for
our current problems with technology as
a society with one single individual
it's a Scotsman Alexander bloody Graham
Bell right it's his fault he started it
because he had a dream I had an
invention in eighteen seventy five if
you wanted to communicate across
geographical distance the only choice
you had would be to engage into
machine-to-machine communication yes
there was a human being involved but all
the human being did was to scram
transcribe the message into a series of
dots and dashes that then gets shoveling
down the length of copper wire to
another machine his invention turned
that into a human experience he enabled
human beings to engage in what they do
naturally to talk to each other even
though they were separated by vast
geographical distances problem is we
didn't stop there and we now live in
this wonderful world where thanks to
these devices I can pick this up I can
stand pretty much on any street corner
in the world and I can phone anywhere
else in the world but something
interesting is starting to happen a dark
side is starting to emerge because as
good as technology is at connecting us
when we are geographically separated
increasingly it's disconnecting us when
we're not geographically separate when
we're in the same room when we're
sharing the same experience it happens
at work how many of you work in an
open-plan office how many of you sit
your desk and your open-plan office
emailing person sat next year what time
we go for lunch no no we're going to go
on bloody there talk to them all right
for those of you had kids you'll
recognize this picture let me tell you
about copy at family time in the cop in
household we will say once in a while
you know what wouldn't it
nice let's all sit down to dinner at the
table together as a family right I sit
down my son sits down my wife sits down
within minutes my work phones out my son
brings out his nameless tablet the rice
think about it wife gets out hover we
sit in our own little digital bloody
world's nobody's talking to each other
we'll sit and watch a movie and then
guarantee you when we watch a movie two
out of the three of us will be watching
the little screen in our laps not the
big one in front of us technology is
disconnecting us from each other from
the experience that we should share it
happens in real life how many times do
you go to some public event a concert
New Year's Eve Trafalgar Square doesn't
matter which and you see it right you
see hundreds if not thousands of people
enjoy that event from four inches behind
a clothing rectangle just bizarre I
asked about why are you doing that it's
all right i got an HD camera on my phone
right I'm like yeah so I right called my
eyes right just strange anyway what we
have to remember for all of this stuff
and this is the key point right we're
just the first generation of a digital
society we're still figuring out how
this stuff works we haven't figured out
how it actually augments what we do we
just kind of drift into lots of
different ways of using it and my theory
is the way we use it today is preventing
us from actually getting it to where it
should be the place where it lifts our
capabilities because we've adopted we've
created a series of coping mechanisms
that we think help but actually cause
the problem I want to talk to you about
four of them the first one is this thing
I call skimming where we will by choice
skim across the surface of the ocean of
information without ever ever diving
deep you'll see this manifest itself in
a number of different ways your boss may
say this to you miam do it to your team
you will send them an email that says
don't send me a long bloody email
summarize it in two or three bullets if
it can't be summarized in two or three
bullets I can't read it or have you ever
sent an email and got the response tldr
too long didn't read right this is a
world without context this is the same
kind of world you know when you're doing
that research project and you want to
show off so what do you do will you go
and use a search engine to find a quote
that's pertinent from a book you've
never read right brilliant search
engines are fantastic for that in all of
those scenarios what you have done is
you
stripped away the context of why that
information is relevant what happens
when you make decisions on no context or
little context you dramatically increase
the risk of them being wrong so this
isn't to say that you shouldn't be
precise that brevity isn't good but
actually you understand what you throw
away when all you do is skim on
information now skimming supported by
another coping mechanism a coping
mechanism I called snacking and again
it's pretty much down to these devices
because thanks to these devices I can
snack on information whenever I want any
time of day it's brilliant we will fill
in every nook and cranny of available
time to look at a little screen I work
in London we only have five floors in an
office building near Victoria I don't
know anybody in my organization that
will travel less than two fours without
checking their phone for email in the
elevator you see it every day in london
on the tubes on the esk it takes 45
seconds to go from top to bottom or
bottom to top everyone's they're glued
to their email now the thing is that's
kind of okay but we're making those
choices without being mindful about what
it does to us how it changes our
relationship with the environment at
that specific moment in time i'll give
you a personal example i got son he's
eight years old I kind of like putting
him to bed at night and there's this
little window of time between when he's
in his pajamas and when he's actually in
bed waiting for his story and in that
window of time I'm completely redundant
in the proceedings because he's in the
bathroom cleaning his teeth I've got a
couple of minutes right so what do I do
with a couple of minutes of time well I
do what any good working parent would do
with two minutes of spare time I put me
hand in me pocket I just have a quick
look see what's going on at work
oblivious to the fact that the minute I
do that something really important
happens because the minute I look at my
work email mentally I'm no longer at
home I am now back at work I am in the
context of work now best case he gets
into bed and he gets a story from a
slightly distracted dad worst case I get
one of those emails and we all get one
of these emails from time to time and
this is an email from your boss or your
colleagues or a customer that just said
you at your father's of rage and if I
get one of those emails you can forget
his bloody story because I'm off down
I'm gonna fix this right now the point
is we all felt good by the way
we all have times in our lives when we
need to be checking our phones when the
project is over running when we're
waiting for an important answer from the
client maybe we work for the emergency
services i don't know but my theory is
that's not every night that's not all
the time and we don't make a mindful
choice about when we should be looking
at screens and when we shouldn't we just
drift into that usage without being
mindful of what it's doing to us at that
moment in time so in all of this you'll
see this is about positive technology
choices the third coping mechanism is a
thing about filters this is about search
engines and recommendation engines and
the only point here is you need to
understand that increasingly those
search engines and recommendation
engines are showing you things that the
algorithms think you would like and
that's great like we need their help we
would never knife and fork our way
through a world of too much information
without them being able to do that but
understand that when all we show you is
stuff that we think you like how do you
ever find the things that you don't know
you like what is the opportunity for
true discovery true serendipity in a
world that is ultimately predicted so
again the trick with search engines and
recommendation engines and filters in
general know when they can add value
know when they're going to hinder what
you're trying to do but the fourth and
final coping mechanism and I wonder
there's one I want to talk to you about
the most because it's the worst it's the
most dangerous and it is the lie of
multitasking we are taught to be a
successful individual in the 21st
century even as a male of the species
right I should be able to multitask
right that's my success will come right
there and the thing is in doing that
we've completely forgotten that
multitasking is not a human trait
multi-time tasking is a concept from
computer science it was invented in the
mid-60s by a bunch of computer
scientists in white lab coats who are
trying to get central processing units
to become more efficient we've just
adopted it as human beings and what we
don't realize we've done research we've
done research with other people we've
looked at other people's research and we
show consistently that the average human
being male or female that whole thing as
a myth is a third less efficient when
they multitask a third less efficient
but it gets worse because every time you
switch context every time you get
distracted you actually introduce a
massive time delay between when you
complete the distraction and
when you get back to the work that
you're doing before you were distracted
we did some experiments on our own
people because we're like that at
Microsoft and what we found was
startling we found that there is a
chemical and cognitive process that
prevents you from going back to the work
that you are doing because the brain as
a reward mechanism but basically every
time you do something that the brain
feels contributes towards your future
survival you get hit of a little hormone
called dopamine and the thing about
dopamine is it's quite nice and when you
get one hip dopamine you'd quite like
another one thanks very much and the
challenge comes that the brain thinks
you searching out more information
snacking on little tidbits from Twitter
checking your next email looking at the
next link is more important for your
survival than you actually sitting down
and using the thing that lives between
your ears so what happens when you
finish your distraction rather than
going back to where you were before you
left your brain basically says hang on a
minute before you go back to the hard
work when you check your email out when
you see what's going on Facebook see
what the footy scores are and you will
meander your way back to the work that
you were doing the average time delay
from completion of the distraction to
getting back to where you were is 23
minutes every distraction so understand
this thing that we think is the savior
of productivity makes us a a third less
efficient and introduces a massive time
delay every time we get distracted how
long does this insanity have to go on
before we start to realize there is a
different approach we require for the
world of work the big problem in all of
this is those for coping mechanisms all
combined to leave us in I think quite a
dangerous place I worry for our society
I worry for a world of people who are
glued sleepwalking into they're using
their technology every single day as a
society we are losing the ability to
think deeply we don't do it anymore
everybody exerts everybody else's
opinion if you want to know what people
really think they'll just tell you what
they saw last on facebook they haven't
thought about it because they're too
busy looking at screens and we need to
turn this around and the good news is
it's actually dead easy to turn around
because we've just got it the wrong way
up we're running around complaining that
we've live in a world of too much
information or man there's just too much
email can't find our God is just too
much and then in the same breath will
tell you that your future success
belongs to how well you use a world of
too much information so we're
essentially complaining about having to
much of the very raw material that will
provide our future success how stupid is
that that's like me walking around
complaining I either got too much money
or too much chicken tikka like two
things in my life I'm never going to
have enough off so let's just turn it
around it starts to see this thing we
should see the dell use as a gift if you
look at all of the things that you've
seen today they are all fed by having
access to more and more data and not
just big data sets but lots of varied
data says that's what makes a difference
we can do it with our customers we can
stop seeing our customers in a single
dimension most organizations they just
think about the transaction that the
customer is about to enact they don't
see that the customer is a holistic
whole human being human beings exhibit
10 to 12 different personalities every
single day you better figure out which
is the primary personality of the
customer before you're going to give
them any decent service I should
understand who the customers related to
in social that will change my view of
them will change my understanding of
them and so the point about the deluge
when it comes to your customers is if
you can lift up your eyes and you start
to look to that dough those data sets
that are increasingly out there and
start to connect them and pull them in
and analyze them you will think very
differently about what your customers
are who they are and what they want from
you you can do this with your employees
as well we've already heard so much
today on wonderful presentation earlier
about what we can do with our inboxes
but this concept of unboxing your inbox
is absolutely crucial but don't wait for
new tools to help you sort through the
chaff ask yourselves why are you
communicating through email now don't
get me wrong emails wonderful I love
email when it's used properly but we
don't use email properly today we use it
as a catch-all for everything my inbox
is full of information that has lots of
value from my colleagues but it's locked
away in my inbox why is it in my inbox
it should be being shared elsewhere what
we're beginning to see is a very
different culture of collaboration
emerging individuals who have a
personally rich experience of social
media do great things with their friends
and family over Facebook or Twitter on
weekends they realize that when you turn
up somewhere and your first choice is to
share information rather than to hold it
back wonderful things happen and this is
what we're seeing now that culture is
starting to permeate inside organized
shins these are worlds where knowledge
used to be power right to people their
first choice was to share nothing but if
you can start to change your cultural
approach to collaboration you start to
open things up you start to behave more
like a network and the brilliant thing
about behaving like a network is it's no
longer about the individual success or
the success of the individuals in your
organization's it's about the cumulative
power of all of your people you can
engage with any node on that network and
you will access the entire power of the
organization underneath all of this and
all of the stories you've heard today is
the power of data I'm not going to talk
very long about this because we've spent
so long but I want you to think about
this thing called a data dividend you
have access to your own data you have
access to other people's data again lift
up your eyes don't just look at that
data and look down at your boots about
how it's going to give you a better
insight to your customers and maybe make
your prose I don't know why you need a
Northwest accent to that but it kind of
just makes it feel good you know or you
know or use that data to have better
analysis on your process you should be
looking at that data and you should be
looking for how is this data going to
transform my business maybe there's new
revenue models maybe there's new
products that you could make maybe in
conjunction with other people's data
there's a new service you could create
that's how you should be thinking about
your data dividend it is the future it
was talked about in terms of water
before but actually this is the fuel
that will power rack on our economy it
will power what we do as individuals
data the real point of data to me is
actually not the data itself is the
tools that we use to use with we use it
with and if you've heard something today
I really hope you understand that it's
machine learning is the thing that
unlocks the potential of data machine
learning is huge matete machine learning
will change how we interact with
computers it will change our
relationship with computers I would
argue it will take us to a place where
it changes how we understand what it
means to be human because we will get
such an insight from the data that many
of their old concepts that we have of
being human will be brought into
question we've seen things like the
real-time speech to speech language
translation these things are
transformative think about the potential
of that think about my eight-year-old
son do I bother to get him to learn a
foreign language at school because the
reality is when he reaches his world of
work it will be a
redundant skill now I get that's
provocative i get there are lots of
reasons why you learn a foreign language
but it's one example of how
transformational this kind of power that
machine learning officers is but if you
want to understand the power of machine
learning you also have to understand
some of its limitations you have to
understand how it works and this is the
best example I can think of for helping
you understand what machine learning is
and how it does so there was some email
that did the rounds back in 2003 based
on some proper academic grown-up
research from Cambridge University that
showed as long as I keep the first and
last characters in the same places if
you speak English I can mix up all the
rest of the characters and you'll still
be able to read this is that true yeah
perfect now the thing is this is a bit
counterintuitive to us because when
we're kids at school we're taught that
language is logical language follows
rules right language follows rules like
I before E except after C but what they
don't tell you is that there are 923
exceptions to that rule there are more
bloody exceptions to that rule then
there are to the rule itself language is
not logical right it's not logical it
doesn't follow rules it's a pattern and
what do you do as human beings will you
spend your life curating a pattern of
language in your brains and when the
brain is presented with something like
this slide it calls upon that pattern
and it uses that pattern to reassemble
think about the statistical probability
of what that word might be that's how
machine language herb machine learning
works what do you think happens when I
show this slide to someone who's just
beginning to learn to speak English so I
searched show it to my son who's just
forming his language skills they can't
bloody read it they can't make sense of
it because they haven't built that
pattern this is the limitation so the
stuff that we heard about the
environments afternoon they thought is
only as good as the models the patterns
that they get provided with and back to
write back to what Andrew was talking
about Andrew hinted at but never said
there's lovely principle in robotics
called more of X paradox which is
essentially what we think is really
really hard cognitive stuff dead simple
for computers and algorithms but the
stuff we take for granted we think is
really simple every single day stuff we
learn from when we're kids to you know
write to adults is fine motor control
the ability to pick stuff up throw
around
not be able to squash stuff it's really
really hard and Laura vex paradox
basically says yes you can create the
world's best chess player can't pick up
the pieces can't set up the board these
things are not yet possible and not
going to be possible for some time to
come so that kind of boils down to me
that you know when we start talking
about algorithms and robots this is
where most people go this is a world
where the algorithms answer our email
and the robots do all the heavy lifting
and we sit and our fat backsides and
rejoicing know all of the glory of the
great stuff we've created that's not my
future at all because actually it's the
human beings that need to create those
patents the human beings are going to
have to do a lot of the manual labor for
the time being the human beings are
going to have to provide the context
between the patents and help them
understand why they're relevant but I
wanted to give you some things that may
be a bit more tangible for you to take
away and think about things that you can
think about either as individuals or as
your organization's number one I kind of
think that we're all here because we
want to deliver transformational
experiences to our customers and I want
you to understand you cannot delete do
that you cannot deliver transformational
experience to your customers unless you
have two things really crucial in order
to do this number one you need to have
employees that are empowered to be
transformational you need an
organizational culture that supports
transformation in your people from the
bottom of the organization to the top if
you haven't got a culture that supports
that you will not do it and secondly
those people they need access to the
tools that will enable them to be
transformational tools that help them
break free of email tools that help them
create and share information connect
with other people share and collaborate
in a way that was never before possible
this is the only way you're going to do
it and if you can't get there then
actually give up now and the rest of the
world is going to pass us by if we don't
and what that means to most
organizations you've got to stip think
stop thinking about yourself in terms of
an organization instead you need to
think what a friend of mine about what a
friend of mine cause intelligent
organisms because organisms are
brilliant they evolve they react they're
malleable they respond to changes in
their environment organization stone and
we're heading into a really ambiguous
future really uncertain future nobody
knows how it's going to play out but one
thing I will tell you for certain is you
need an organization that's going to be
able to
respond and react to those changes
quickly and we're not going to do that
based on the structure of the
organization that we have today for most
organizations that means thinking very
differently about their people too many
organizations they think about their
people in the specific domain of the
skills they use to fulfill their job
description or think about yourselves in
that context you represent a far broader
picture of skills and experiences than
just those you use to fulfill your job
description I have a whole bunch of past
experiences bizarre stuff I do on the
weekends all of that has value to my
organization if only they can find a way
to tap into that and when you tap into
that you work towards that out the
organism that gives you the agility that
you need fundamentally a lot of it comes
down to data and if you want to be
successful with data you need to create
what we call a data culture inside your
organization's this is crucial at the
moment when we talk about data most
people's eyes glaze over and they think
about the data scientists that they
employ and they think the data is a
world for those guys they can tell us
all the answers and then we'll do smart
stuff with it wrong where we're going
we've seen a lot of this today is the
tools that make data accessible are
becoming closer and closer to normal
human beings people like us it's a bit
like remember Microsoft Excel about 10
or 15 years ago when you needed to write
a formula in Microsoft Excel you needed
like seven manuals a PhD in about three
weeks and if you were lucky if you are
really lucky you might get the syntax
right and it would work what happens
today I click on a bloody button in the
ribbon and it autocompletes for me tools
like power bi as your machine learning
are tools that are bringing the power of
data closer and closer to regular normal
human beings your employees so we need
to equip them with a kind of culture
that makes them inquisitive that makes
them want to kick down the boundaries
that exists between the finance
department and the marketing department
and the sales department wants to have
access to the data wants to be able to
stitch together disparate data sets to
gain new insights because when you equip
them with that culture and then they get
access to the tools these are the people
that are going to transform your
business they're going to transform what
your organization is capable of and then
there are two things I want you to think
about on a personal level it's about
your own relationship with technology
not asking you to make any changes I'm
just asking you to think about it
the first thing is this thing called
mindfulness which I admit is a bit of a
trendy topic at the moment there are
lots of people talking about mindfulness
but if you will just humor me think of
mindfulness as a spectrum a one extreme
is the West Coast us definition of
mindfulness where it's all about Zen
Buddhism and meditate listen I'm not
knocking that right if that's your bag
that's cool but what I really want you
to think about as the other end of the
spectrum it's the british version of
mindfulness which is just being
pragmatic so if you are the sort of
person that is sitting in a meeting with
your laptop open taking notes or you're
sitting in a meeting with other people
with their laptops open taking notes and
we all know that taking notes in a
meeting basically means catching up on
your email or checking out facebook
don't have the bloody meeting it's a
pointless waste of everybody's time
don't be in the cafe or the pub with
your friends and family checking out
your Facebook feed pointless waste of
everybody's time the crucial skill to be
successful in the 21st century is not
multitasking it's simply this it's being
able to make a positive conscious choice
about whether the technology can or
cannot help what you were doing at that
specific moment in time be really
definite about it if I pick up my phone
now is that going to help me in the
things that I'm doing yes or no and if
it's yes fantastic fill your boots if
it's no put it down leave it put it away
make that choice every single day
because that creates space for
creativity creativity is hugely
important I would argue that I don't
care who you are what organization you
work for what role you have with that
organization there is room for
creativity in your role creativity is
the birthplace of innovation it's where
the great stuff comes from but we
squashed creativity from our lives we've
pushed it out and we push it out in a
couple of domains and I want to call
those two places back so first is about
having a physical space for creativity
you cannot be creative as a human being
in a busy noisy chaotic open-plan office
it does not happen can't happen the
brain is not wired to work in that way
they're great to collaborate they're
great to catch up with your workmates
they're great to share ideas but when
you have to be creative in yourself to
be thoughtful to write the report to
create the new concept you're not going
to do it in the open plan office so you
either need to make sure you have access
to a quiet space in your office or
better still you need to be
ported by an organizational culture that
enables you to choose the best location
for you to do the work you have to do
real proper flexible working so you can
choose to be working in a location that
is conducive to you be to be creative
the second dimension I want you to think
about in terms of creativity is make the
mental space for creativity all of the
stuff you've seen today is useless
unless you can take some time to step
back and think about how it might apply
how it might evolve would that mean to
me when I mean to my organization and
you're not going to do that when you
spend your lives snacking and binge
feeding on the empty calories of all of
the trivial bits of information we look
at all the time so you need to make sure
that every single day you're taking some
time away from technology to use the
thing between your ears and it might be
when you take a share it might be going
for a run taking the dog for a walk
doesn't matter when it is but if you
create that space and you do it
consistently I guarantee you your brain
will surprise you that the kinds of idea
is the kind of evolution that it gives
you based on what you've done so this is
not my future right this is not the
Terminator the internet believe it or
not is not Skynet I have a very
different view of the future and it's
basically this I see a future where we
human beings rise up and stand high and
tall proud on the shoulders of the
digital giants that we've created we use
technology to lift our capability as a
society to do more than we could do on
our own it's a bit like the debate we
had when I was a kid right so when I was
a kid and I was doing my math so level
if you don't know what no level is it's
kind of like a GCSE but harder
clin it was a point in our society where
we were debating the role of the pocket
calculator and the education of our
children because they just become
commercially afford what everybody could
afford a pocket calculator as a result
of that societal debate I did my master
audio level with a log book and a slide
rule now let me tell you I'm a better
mathematician with a calculator than I
am with a tabulated bit of paper and a
slightly bit of plastic yes I need to
know the basics of arithmetic but the
technology lifts my capability as a
human being this is exactly the same
debate we're having today it really is
and so what we should be doing is what
are the basic skills and trust me it's
not things like learning about how to
use word or office or any specific
programming language because I guarantee
you if my son gets taught those at
school they'll be redundant skills by
the time he enters his world of work
because there'll be different tools what
he really needs is things like critical
thinking deep thinking communication
skills collaboration skills how to stay
safe all of these things these are the
basics if we equip our society with
these tools with these capabilities and
we also have this aspiration to want
more from technology to use it to
transform rather than do the same on set
up a bit better then finally we will
have the opportunity to rise up as human
beings ladies and gentlemen thank you
