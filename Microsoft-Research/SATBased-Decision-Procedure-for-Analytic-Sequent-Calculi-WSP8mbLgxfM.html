you
it's my pleasure to introduce hora de
half who's visiting this week we're
going to finish a paper by Friday and so
but but not on this talk the talk it is
on as we can see on the slide on
analytic calculi and sat and and sorry
is a postdoc at Tel Aviv with muli who
is visiting us earlier this summer and
look forward to talk thank you ok thank
you for inviting me to talk here and so
this is a joint work with the young is
also from Tel Aviv University and this
is a work in progress this means that we
still don't have papers and but this is
our current state exploring this topic
ASAT based decision procedure for
analytic sequent calculi so few words
for the about the motivation for this
stalker so sequent calculi are a
permanent poof theoretic framework I
guess a midlist it is needless to say
that because they provide is a hole here
algorithmic presentation of logic and it
is there a suitable for a variety a
large variety of logics many non
classical logics that will be the main
issue in this talk and our goal in this
work was to try to effectively reduce
the ability problem in a given
propositional sequent calculate to set
and which of course this is not possible
for all this variety huge variety of
logics but only for a small subset of
them and ultra first try to explain this
small family of sequin calculated we can
handle and okay so such if you some
background some notations so we take
sequence to be objects of the phone a
gamma W
that will gamma and Delta our finite
sets of formula this automatically means
that all our systems are fully
structurally they have all the usual
structural holes contraction and
exchange because gamma and Delta our
sets not multisets or sequences and this
is again a the usual thing the intuition
behind a sequence so if we have this
sequined this is a set of formulas
another set of formulas you can think
about it is this implication the
conjunction of the formulas in the left
side implies the disjunction of the
formulas of the right side but this is
just intuition because we are dealing
with non classical logic swear we might
don't have these connective so have them
with unusual interpretations and so this
cannot be a theorem some interpretation
of theorem in all the systems we study
yes because you take this form you
automatically get also travel problems
while you get weakening person no we
don't get to begin d right we can we
have to add to our systems a contraction
and exchange and an expansion the
opposite of contraction our built-in
thank you please interrupt interrupt me
whenever because we are very small group
and yeah so this is the most famous
calculus lkd its paw positional part and
afghan sin and we have this identity
axiom and the cattle gamma and Delta are
meta variables four sets of formulas in
a and b ra mehta variables for formulas
and each connective we have here a
conjunction disjunction implication each
connective as tools one for introducing
it on the left side and one for the
right for the right side i guess this is
a well-known and this is the first
example of sequin calculus and the next
example is a for a logic studied
invented the air here I think for
positional primer logic this would be a
running example in this
this talk so we have all the usual
structural holes just as before
weakening and cut in identity axial and
logical rules are a bit different for
implication for this Junction we only
have the right all we don't have the
left work and for implication this is
the usual hole for introducing
implication the left side but this all
is a bit different let's go back before
we had in lk we had a be this is in the
left side is in the right side from this
you can deduce a implies B on the right
side and in the hole in primer logic we
have only this be here and now am the
left side and it is not hard to see that
this multiplied conclusion calculus that
I present here is equivalent to the
sequence tile natural deduction system
that appears in the paper in the paper
of the klemish FNA and URI so so this is
LJ s
so this is an intuitionist allergic
because now here I give them multiple
conclusion and calculus so it is not
possible operations yes if you if you
take this lk and you change the whole
for a disjunction a implication and you
don't allow this Delta here then you get
LJ and something which is equivalent to
LJ but here we take the multiple
conclusion calculus for primer logic and
you're right saying that this I can take
single conclusion and we'll get the same
the same logic if I oh meet all these
deltas in this case in this case
specific calculus list would not use it
would not change anything yeah yeah
I showed the school's address bless this
bro
his reaction was what a stupid rule
already know be what's the point to be
useful easeus right sorry
so just going to this is a classical
covers in what sense classical you
either question
so it's not a classical you mean you
have station's name with words that it's
equivalent to one where you also drive
the deltas yes it's a multiple
conclusion calculus but it is equivalent
to a single conclusion calculate all the
dentist I I think that Parma logic was
introduced originally as intuitive some
sort of intuitionistic logic but i must
say that i'm not sure that it isn't
intuitionistic logic for me it is more
close to classical logic than two
attorneys intuitionistic logic but it is
a matter of a point of view and so this
is the general family that we study we
call them pure sequent calculi pues si
con calculi a proposition sequin
calculated include all usual structural
wilson so before and any finite set of
pure logical holes and this notion is
due to everyone in this old paper from
91 so this whole would be a pure we have
gamma and Delta on both side the idea is
to allow any context if you have this
gamma and Delta in all the premises and
the conclusion we call it a pew hole but
this will will not be a pure wool
because you don't have Delta on the
right side and also if you know many
rules for modalities they are not pure
because you change the context so we
allow only this kind of simple hoods we
call them pewls and this is the
calculated we can a work with in this
work here is another example and just to
show that there is some variety of pure
calculus so this is for the logic of the
cost of the cost us the logic holds see
one this is one of the most fundamental
paper consistent logics where from a and
negation of a dress some cases where you
can you cannot deduce any formula you
want and the idea is that you take the
positive fragment of lk all the positive
connective without negation and you add
all these holes that involve negations
so we have the also introducing negation
on the right but no all for introducing
in on the left this is what gives us the
power conscious that nature we have this
all for double negation all these
special rules for negation and
conjunction and other connectives so
this
system appeared in this paper and I just
give it here to show that it is a pure
system you have gamma and delta gamma
and Delta in all holes or promises or
conclusions so it falls in our scope
vessel which one if you said be to not a
this on the left knows if you said each
of that a then you get gamma dot that a
then you have a google password so i'll
try to see what so the only thing you
get from from the one on the left hand
side is
give your bypassing which made the upper
language away the second rule to the
left not this one so if you do strips a
new pattern matching with e de nadie but
if you yeah I think that's the opposite
side here in here yes we get not not a
which is a be to them A's and you will
love that a but you have the negation of
a and you aim the right side that we
could as well I i if I copied it
correctly from the paper I don't believe
there is a redundant tool but maybe I
need some very mistaken copy paste but
this is the most problematic all in this
system because if you have this a and
not a it couldn't be it shouldn't be
redone get the right edge ok I'm not
going me to the details because it's not
so important the this worked one is
trying to be general this is just a
specific example for yourself this is a
you don't have
is gamma and Delta yeah this is the
purest systems you don't have
restrictions on the context anywhere so
it falls in in this family of systems
now the poverty of analyticity of the
calculus is also crucial for this thing
to work and this is of course
problematic but because it might be too
strong the requirement but let me
formulate it so we say that the calculus
with analytic if the fact that there is
a derivation of a gamma L Delta implies
that there is a derivation of gamma rho
delta using only the sub formulas of
gamma and Delta this is an analytic
calculus in some cases we will allow you
a weaker notion that allows the
negations of the sub formulas and gamma
and gamma and Delta as well not only the
sub formulas also there negations and it
is easy to see that if we positional a
pure calculus is a defined before is
analytic accounting this definition on
the weaker definition that is identity
decided simply because you can enumerate
all possible proofs and I want to say
that analytic view calculi exists for
some not so many but there are some
important propositional logic so of
course classical logic and primal logic
is so in the examples dyscalculia are
analytic all important three and four
value logics have analytic a calculi and
power consistent logics and I'm sure
they are molded I don't know about but
these are the families of logics that I
can recognize easily that have pure
calculi analytic pure Calgary I can see
the
if a calculus and the lignin is
decidable but where are you rely on
purity Yeah right this is not a this
will be true if even for a non pure
calculus but I I will only consider pew
calculi because this is the these are
those that we can do this the last
sentence here and this is the first
observation that there is a simple
reduction of drivability in analytic
view calculi to sat so in these cases we
claim that it is possible to replace a
full search by a Sat solver and and this
is the first observation that led to
this work in later say few words about
it and then go to several extensions
sorry
kissin verified
emulation because of something
I have few sites few slides about this
how to do that okay is important for
your particular reduction to set exactly
if you if you take nope you calculate
then you can do almost so you can do
many model objects and obviously the
reduction to sat would not be simple
simple it is meant to say linear time I
will have several more restrictions for
linear time but we want to have a linear
time reduction to set not just a
reduction that you have will also save
in NP and our reduction goes a unlike
the delayed I think the reductions in
the papers of primal logic in most of
them our reduction goes through the
semantics so we'll have first semantics
for every calculus and then use it for
their reduction to sat so this is
another observation in I found it in the
general sense in a paper of visio that
pew calculi can be characterized by two
valued valuations so it doesn't matter
if the calculus is for a free valued
logic for valued logic or whatsoever you
can always use two valid valuations and
the idea is that each pupil is easily
translated into some semantic condition
we just read the whole a form a semantic
point of view and if you join all the
semantic conditions of the rules in some
calculus you in calculus g you get the
set of G leg evaluations this is the set
for which the calculus is sound and
complete I have an example in the next
slide but this would be the general fear
and once you do these two steps then a
gamma rho delta is probable in g if and
only if every legal valuation is the
model of a gamma delta so each calculus
g induces a set of g leg evaluations and
this is a usual notion of a model
evaluation is the model of gamma 0 delta
if either there is some formula on the
left side which is false or some formula
on the right side which is too so all
our valuations are two valued and thinks
are relatively simple
once you see the reduction you see that
it is almost evil another reduction
sorry the translation of falls to
semantic conditions here is an example
for the calculus for c1 it took just a
few rules not all of them so for example
what does what does this all mean from a
semantic point of view it gives us this
condition the value of if the value of a
is false and the value of negation of a
should be true this is the semantic
reading of this floor and this one would
say that if the value of a is false then
the value of the negation negation of a
should be false then each a mole you can
find this easily the semantic condition
and you obtain a set of valuations the
valuations that satisfy these conditions
for which the calculus is sound and
complete and this is a crucial
observation that we get the semantics
which is non-deterministic this means
that the value of the compound of
compound formula might be not uniquely
determined by the value of its sub
formulas so if I know for example that
the value of a is true and there is no
condition here in general case that will
tell me what is the value of the
negation of fate can be either true or
false and by doing by allowing this kind
of weird valuations non-deterministic
evaluations we are able to do everything
with two values only to own false and
simply read the holes from a semantic
point of view and the general theorem
that I showed before tells us that this
for every system this set of valuation
is a sound and complete for this
calculus
yes of course yes there is no other
option if you want to have only two
values and to do three and four valued
logics you use non deterministic
semantics we were the first
yeah I yeah I worked with it during my
PhD studies and I found two in very old
works of for example shooter and Angie
loud all of them use non deterministic
semantics without saying that so it is
very useful once you start from an
arbitrary proof system and you want to
find the semantics and the reduction to
start would simply be let me go back one
slide you can easily observe that all
these conditions can be formulated in
propositional classical logic and then
the reduction to sat is is very easy you
associate a variable X a for every sub
formula a of gamma rho delta you
generate a sort of clauses for the
semantic conditions and you apply the
semantics on discloses on every sub
formula on every XA like that and then
if you have you want to decide whether a
gamma 0 delta is full verbal you
generate singleton closes XA for every n
gamma and negation of XA for every I in
Delta and you get that gamma rho delta
is provable if and only if the set of
clauses in is not satisfied
so what for classical logic this would
be equivalent to that segment coded yes
yes simply translate everything to jump
in yes for the I will say a few words
about the complexity so of course it's
one of the crucial things is that there
is a linear number of sub formulas here
so you have a linear number of clauses
let's see the example in the case of
primer logic so this would be the holes
for primary logic that I showed before
these are the semantic reading of the
holes so you see for conjunction we have
the usual thing the two usual truth
table of conjunction actually for
disjunction we only have this whole this
condition if the value of a store the
value of be stored in the value of the
disjunction should be to you don't have
the other thing that if both of them are
false we cannot know the value of the
disjunction can be added to or false if
our implication we have this usual thing
for if the value of the first argument
is due in the second is false then the
value of the implication is false but we
as since we only have this or so the
other thing that we have is that if the
value of be stored and the value of the
implication is full so we don't have any
ol tells us any condition that tells us
what to do if both the value of a is
false in the value of B is false then it
is completely free the value of the
implication question
okay just let me know and now we do the
reduction so gamma L 0 Delta is provable
in this in this system of primer logic
if and only if the following set of
clauses ins not satisfiable so we have I
have your only conjunction in
implication though to have shorter
slides I omitted the extinction dude so
this would be the three closest that we
have for conjunction and we have them
for every formula of the form a
conjunction be in data cools in gamma L
0 Delta so this would give us this
number one part of this number one this
will give us the second part and this is
equivalent to this second do the second
condition here and implies B we have
these conditions the one this is 43 and
this is 44 and as I said we have a
single door closes XA for every n gamma
and negation of XA for every I in Delta
and gamma rho delta is provable in
primer logic if and only if this set of
clauses is unsatisfied in this
particular case i should mention that we
obtained lee with then essentially the
same reduction that appears in in the
paper of the klemish avenue and from
this general point of view of reduction
of pure calculi 22 sat and you can also
note that how all these clauses in this
case our home closes and for the case of
primal logic this is what makes it so
efficient so not only that our reduction
is linear also we will have a linear
time algorithm to solve this sat
instance using a home SAT solver
why'd you fire
if I had to Parma logic yes
Justin
then when they say reduction just go
through and I don't know I have to think
about it but can you fish thank you so
you
so so so 44 m primal magick with the
universal rules
more quantifier qualifiers I see
the reductionist later
so you can do the semantic embedding get
your sister I guess I guess it will work
and get a reduction to data loggers that
we just add bearable yeah these become
booze we didn't check it I guess the
Florence is disengaged with the
quotations I'll get the quotations ok I
think I have quantifiers in the father
Walker list but if not I can shoot at it
let me say a few words why does it work
all this idea this reduction in the idea
is that we have semantic analysis it e
and this is the property which is
equivalent to the electricity of the
calculus the semantic property which is
equivalent to the analyticity of the
calculus is stated in this theorem if G
is analytic and we assume this is
something not not so fair to do but we
assume that the input calculus is
analytic if G is analytic then every G
legal a partial evaluation a partial
evaluation is evaluation is defined only
on a subset of formulas and then I also
assume that its domain is closed on
under sub formulas if every legal
partial valuations can be extended to a
full G leg evaluation so this is would
be the semantic meaning of analyticity
if we know that G is analytic then we
have this property this is something
that we we polled and this is a property
which is essential for the correctness
of the reduction because once you find a
satisfying assignment it only gives you
a pal share valuation it doesn't give
you a full valuation which will be a
counter model and then you have to use
this theorem to show that this partial
evaluation can be extended to a full
valuation this is a crucial here and for
this reason we need the calculus to be a
analytic and otherwise it won't work I
mentioned here that something that I
like very much is that the other
direction of this theorem works as well
so if you know that every partial
evaluation can be excited to full
valuation this would mean that the
calculus is analytic from a syntactic
point of view that poof's can be s
second proof can be confined to the sub
formula
yes sorry I'm pressure if I personally
so suppose you did the translation and
now this extra versus sent back on set
are you saying that the model that the
sets over produces has to be changed if
I go back then we have these clauses
only for the sub formulas occurring in
in gamma 0 Delta so we don't have
anything for this formulas which are
outside and if you want and the
soundness and convince general theorem
talks about a full valuation so you have
to give for a okay and you have to show
that if you find this small model you
can extend it to a full that every
direction says that if if every Jellicle
partial evaluation can be extended to a
full one then G is an elite should allow
two valued evaluations yeah we every
pure calculus has to value the semantics
according to the youjizz view if this
view of course we only speak about pure
Cecil's yeah and this gives you a
semantic method to prove analyticity and
in many cases it is very easy this is
not the main issue in this work but I
think it's nice to mention it for
example for lk analyticity of lk is
usually a consequence of cut elimination
and then you have the sub formula
probability but this gives you an
different method you only have to prove
something that there is nothing to prove
here that every a partial classical
valuation whose domain is closed and L
sub formulas can be extended to all to
all formulas mrs. to Rivet people don't
even bother to mention it a usually that
partial classical valuations are
extendable and if you have this property
than the calculus is analytic and this
is just a reminder what i mean by
calculus is analytic I should have began
with that
about the complexity of the reduction so
for now we have this assumption we are
trying to weaken it but suppose that the
holes in the calculus G have the
following natural structure that
everyone will contain some main formula
and all other sub formulas and all other
formulas a cell formulas of the main
formula this is what we had for
classical logic for primal logic for the
park consistent logics we allow also
negation of sub formulas but it doesn't
change much in this idea in this case
the reduction that i mentioned requires
only linear time and this we did not
implement deeds but implemented it but
we think that it is possible to use the
same data structure that is used in in
papers in these papers
sorry what you call main formula you
didn't appear in our papers but mature
collection account for more so it's
going with mother formula yet and there
could be more than one yeah we are
working on on weakening this condition
because for some rules it is it is too
strong I'll have an example in the last
slide we don't you want to say something
like there should be a formula dating
that includes all the atomic formulas of
the olin and not that a lot of formulas
or sub formulas of this is the the small
details and we're we use the same path
tree with the hormone amelie ders and
all of the other stuff that you had to
do we think that the same can be used to
do this reduction okay so last thing
about this general reduction without
quotations the next part of the talk
would be adding quotations but as we as
I noted before for proposition apply my
logic we get only home clauses and in
this case this logic can be decided in
linear time and and this is well known
and it is different from the original
linear time algorithm that appeared in
the paper of urine in tan Emma and if
you want to be again general we can
recognize a family of calculi we call
them home pew calculi for which we will
get on clauses and we can decide them
all of them in linear time using a whole
SAT solver if they are analytic of
course and this would be the condition
for every hole in our you should have
this property the number of premises for
every rule are in G the number of
premises of hours left side is not empty
this number plus the number of formulas
on the right side of the conclusion it
should be less than equal to 1
unfortunately don't have many examples
because primal logic a and you can see
here that every rule the number of
premises who's left side is not empty
plus the number of formulas on the right
side on the conclusion you forget about
gamma and Delta is is always a less than
or equal to 1 this is just a general a
characterization of we indicate the
cases in which you get air horn closet
but we check the discharge what is it is
zero it's the little mistake and because
there are no no if no promises who's
left side is not empty and ash and then
there are is one because we have one
formula here so if you take the usual
rule for implication if you have this a
ill then I will have the ash ll would be
one because I have one premise with non
empty left side and the HR we also be
one because I have one F normal on the
right side of the conclusion together it
will be more than than one and it won't
work but it is a correct to say that we
don't know other calculi useful calculi
that fall in this family we what we can
do i think is to go into the duel horn a
fragment and then you can do do a primal
logic you can in every some some
connective which is dual to implication
and then it is also solvable in a linear
trying but i'm not sure about its using
in practice the dual horn is one at most
one negative and it is also decided it
can be decided in linear time
yep
now quotations this would with the main
difficulty of course because or decal
primal logic in office does not suffice
and you have to use quotations and you
have things like this p said AQ said p
said a implies B and we try to adjust
our reduction to quotations and to see
what we get what is the semantics and
the say the same thing but we add
quotations and quotations are simply a
unary modalities we will denote them
like this box 1 box 2 and so on and so
on and for primer logic you have you can
have two options how to add your
quotations the first option would be to
decorate all the holes with this perfect
with these perfect says here in so in
all active formulas everything except
for the context we add this perfect
switch this is a matter variable for
some concatenation of disunity mode
modalities and we add them to all
premises on to the conclusion you do it
in all holes and you get a system which
is equivalent to the hilbert system in
this paper for primal logic we could
with the quotations well you have a
liberty and a system and we we prefer
the Jensen system so we work with with
this one but there is another option and
alternatively you can take the the same
propositional calculus and don't change
anything and add this one additional
whole the name is not so good the KD !
let's call it KD AK do a hole that
allows you to take this is not a pool
but we still allow this soul allow you
to add a prolific should be the same
perfect of course when it is the role is
applied to all the formulas on the left
side and all the formulas on the right
side and this name comes from a
functional Kripke Frank's this is the
hole that is used for functional clip
confinement this ole was used for boxing
box and diamond actually the same when
the Cape Kaleem is function f raquel pia
model is functional then if you want to
have a hole for box you will take this
one and this is the same world that is
used for the operator next in ltl so
somehow quotations behave exactly like
next of of the temporal logic ltl and
from this point of view and this is a
easy to prove proposition and edit m for
other people calculus if you take this
wall and you add it or alternatively you
go into this approach and perfect all
the premises and all the conclusion with
this thing you get the same logic the
same things are derive abell so these
took these two options are equivalent we
will go in the general study with this
whole this is not pure yeah but we will
define the very simple definition that a
pure calculus with quotations is a
propositional calculus like you read
before augmented with this special rule
which is not pure akd all this would be
a general a pue calculus with quotations
I am Not sure that the word quotations
is the right word in general but we
don't have a better de sel modalities of
a very restricted the assault bill
people would say that they are unusable
just like the this special implication
but a.d.d bank is the name of the mod
the axiom from modal logic when you have
you require the accessibility region
relation to be a function a full
function usually people take the same
name of the axiom case as mode illogical
and use it for the whole but we can
change it because we didn't find a it
anywhere else
intuition about this proposition so the
rule that pads the modality each
non-convex formula it seems like that's
going to let you derive organize that
have sort of a different quotation dance
wit search for each term in in Delta
first this one is adding it uniformly
across why is why are the equivalent and
maybe something again here is it for
example here it is this role should be
the same so you're right saying that a
might include more quotations inside but
I can apply for example if we don't have
these quotations here I can it's not a
good example I am I can try to start
same box mr. know the same box but a
priori gamma what somebody in gamma may
start with rotation yeah I mean I stay
in the open in there is no but these are
going to add the quotations to the front
right yes so that means the uniformly
they would all share the same rotation
suppose gamma is one for me you're
inducted go and suppose gamma star
sexploitation Delta doesn't uh-huh then
you get different
the vacancy but if you have multiple
terms in Delta then all of them are
going to start with the same quotation
prefix intensity done or the conclusion
in the conclusion i right but you have
we you are weakening yeah I can try to
recover this argument it was really
simple I can try to think about it later
which direction bothers you you think
that this might be weaker than than the
other or i can try to see one of the
directions was easy but this we proved
the form a syntactic point of view just
showing that this wall is admissible
darren and their iced earth yeah you
have you have that in single conclusion
usually but the same thing works it
would become good
and so this is the definition of the
pure calculus with quotations take a
propositional calculus and add this
special k devil this is the approach
that we chose and this is a nice
property that we proved it this always
preserved analyticity of the calculus so
if the calculus was analytic as we
assumed and you add this special hole it
will still be analytic and in particular
if you take the primer logic and you add
this KD all you get an analytic system
which is a bit different from the first
calculus this one with all of the
perfect size inside the walls this
calculus is what we call it locally
analytic if you have a proof of gamma
rho delta then you have a proof using
the local sub local formulas of gamma
and Delta not the sub formulas the local
local formulas or if are defined here we
will need them later as well um it will
formula is local to itself if you have
some connective a diamond and some
perfect then boy a perfect AI is forever
I is local to this a formula it's not a
sub formula but its local to it and you
take the transitive closure so if a is
local to B&amp;amp;B is local to see than a
local to see so we this is the main
reason why we prefer this all because we
are more close to the original a
tradition in sequin calculi we want them
to be analytic there are some other
properties that you can use that if if
you can prefer to use the usual notion
of sub formula which is less complicated
I think I don't know
we use em I've one uses it all the time
so of course I did not invent it but I
don't know if he invented it I don't
know this is this is different than this
it's the same there's not any tickets
that you were at the sample you Lucifer
museum okay so if I understand in like
in some logics you need to extend extend
the doors yourself for me a little bit
yeah cool so you have some generalized
and electricity poverty negations on
things like exactly what would be there
we want to do the reduction and again
our reduction is based on the semantics
and we are not going to do it doing
proof searcher so what would be the same
the general semantics of pio calculi
with quotations and the equivalent think
to the two valued valuations here would
be to valued functional crit care models
and this definition is straightforward
we have a triple double eww is a set of
possible words we have this a
calligraphic r which assigns the
function it would be the accessibility
relation it is a function our box from
w2w to every quotation so we have a
function as many as wave quotations and
we have this a V here that a science
evaluation VW this is evaluation like we
had before a function from the set of
all formulas of the language to false
and two so we have VW for every world w
in our set of worlds and the
interpretation of box of the quotation
is the usual thing for every a world
quotation box and formula a the value of
box a in the world w m so usually modal
logic it would be it should be true if
and only if all the accessible words the
value of a is too here we have only one
accessible words we can use this
function so it is the value in the in
the one accessible world in the unique
one of the formula a and the idea is
exactly as we're before in g legal clip
cam models the semantic on conditions
are imposed on
function VW so the same semantic
conditions that we had before that comes
from that come from the logical holes of
the system we impose them on each
function in each valuation vw's on each
world we have these local local
conditions between the values of
compound formulas and their components
and we have the soundness and
completeness that the gamma 0 Delta is
provable in g g is a pure system with
quotations if and only if every g legal
this is the notion of g legal Kripke
model is a model of gamma 0 Delta I
having an example very similar to what
we had before take the same sequin
calculus for the power consistent logic
see one but add this world is quotation
would so we have exactly the same four
conditions that we had before but but
they are applied on each VW for every
world we have these local requirements
from the evaluation and in addition we
have this special condition for the
interpretation of box which is the usual
thing in modal logic now using these
semantics we are able to extend the
reduction for pure calculi with
quotations and still in do it in linear
time and then the idea is that now we
have a variable X xpress prefix a for
every formula perfect say that is local
to gamma 0 Delta instead of sub formula
with local formulas and again the number
of local formulas is only linear and
this would be this is crucial for the
linear time of the reduction and we will
generate the same classes as we had
before but now we apply them on the
local sub formulas local formulas of
gamma L 0 Delta not the sub formulas i
have another example in the next slide
and this can be done in linear time and
correctness is now proved by showing
that if we have a satisfying assignment
of course this there is no nothing else
to prove you
then you can construct for him a cake a
counter model and here we use the fact
that the underlying propositional
calculus is analytic again for the rib
for the the thing is that you have to
show that partial a cube keyframe
partial evaluation can be extended to a
full one and you use this syntactic and
electricity which we assume on the
calculus yeah we use tools like Suffolk
series hey I don't know about Suffolk
series but we need the same data
structure of this 2nd ed tree that
represent the formula with the hormone
amelie ders and all this so we imported
all of these ideas to in order to show
that this can be done in linear time for
the translation just true yeah
because of this enemy to
knock on door
so the next night has spent a very
quickly so far all the creepy models
essentially linear where do you have
models that are forests so if you have
just one quotation it would be like just
like ltl and when you have more of them
except a q3 it's like a suffix three
what's not clear is how you search over
pretty models the Kripke mother's
prometric to the construction as well as
the accessibility
so we translation to set are you going
straight there so I don't have here
these details but what we this is the
current translation to set this does not
if you get us to get a satisfying
assignment let's look at the example so
this would what we get what would you
get for a primer logic so for every a
formula prefix a and B that is local to
gamma rho delta will you will have these
three clauses and this does not give you
a croupier model just if you get a
satisfying assignment for this you can
have some valuation and it tells you
whether this is true or these things
like that from this we have to show that
we can construct a crib commode and the
idea again imported from your work is
that the perfect says would be the words
of the create a model and and this would
the values from this assignment would be
used in the crib commodities search yeah
yeah it was thinkin so my confusion was
I thought that you're going to search
through the crinkle models but that's
not what you doing indeed you if you
take the the rules of the against system
and write down there
yeah in the core and exercises now for
the kg so it's the same day the KD bank
and and the other sort of system are
equivalent so
what what is it with what we have to
prove and I guess this is the mode yeah
it gives you em this requirement the
semantics of box but it doesn't affect
the the reduction you're right and it is
just a it's not so long but it's not so
short so proof that if you have a
satisfying assignment for this you can
construct from that equivocal model we
did with respect all the conditions and
the usual interpretation of the box of
the quotation I don't have the details
in the slides something so will it be
correct to say that in your cookie model
every world corresponds to a path of
quotations from outer to inner exactly
exactly and what we had to prove is that
again the key thing is that you get a
crusher model and some formulas are
defined in some worlds and you have to
show that you can check both katic full
model from that and I think that in this
case specific case we don't have
variables but if you are strictly
reduction to data log from a his papers
then you get actually the same the same
result I mean so I don't think this is
it should be new for primer logic didn't
agenda you think is the generality and
the other point of view that we have
here a semantic one and I think I skip
this but I guess it's obvious that it
means that analytic calculi with
quotations can be decided by a SAT
solver and that if you have a home pew
calculi analytic one with quotations
then you can use a whole sub social
justice we had without quotations and
this would be the last part in general
part of the talk I have two slides of
small extensions for primer logic that
we can do using this general framework
but this is would be very specific so
each of these was tailored and the idea
is that all these things here are not
provable in PI my logic the usual the
original one with quotations so we
cannot prove that a implies a because
you don't have the whole for debt and
also from a somatic point of view if a
is false then then you cannot know what
would be the tooth value of implies a
and so all the other things but all of
them are classically too and we would
like to recover them to have them inside
a primer logic so I don't know about the
application whether this kind of
formulas really appear in practice there
this is just a small variety but if they
have importance then and for these we
can handle them and if we do this it
will get a bit closer to classical logic
and the only thing that you have to
verify using the general result before
is that each of them preserves the
energy city of the calculus so if you if
you add this axiom as a pure you have
this gamma and Delta and no promises
only just one and one conclusion and if
the calculus is still analytic for
primal logic without quotations then the
calculus with quotations would be
analytic in this whole procedure for
reduction to a horse at a can work so is
this suggestion tool to add
truth valuation the evaluation function
for each of these axles to treat the cam
I'm not sure if read the formulas and
the axles
atomic so he of a and B if I say tht
yeah this will be the semantic condition
you are this yeah yeah yeahs did for
every for every formula of this form
that you have in your assumptions of the
things that you can comment it so a and
B as a has or has to be present in the
fall hey and me in tonight so the third
yeah very fearful it has to be present
if it does that you do go wrong here's
of a and E but you loop over all sub
formulas there are this kind of
implication that's why it's game day
exactly
so hard not sucker if you have proof
wants up from the SAT solver can you
recover the art waterproof and I don't
know I don't know I didn't think about
it and how you mean to study down for no
I was just curious this you know you
were saying we had in hand let it
persist over so so we know if it's true
it has an analytic proof yes okay Brad
number after the Sun think this is what
you asked me for before I beginning to
us yes non-trivial it see what work
exactly what they know i had the
internet heroes esteban in what we
discovered we used this translation that
you mentioned to get a look and then we
used
c3
drinking sleeper cell instead of using
kind of take a look
because it was here and then was the
problem because you sufficient say kind
of proof and so what what should we do
and so esteban work on this so it's not
exactly same answer but pretty clear
that the answer is yes but you need to
do some workers for more hair of course
but in general I think it's very nice
because we knew some--this for most or
maybe all of them it was clear that can
be done but that you can get them for
free from jail
yeah recent but i think is one big one
of the extensions like the transitivity
transitivity covers this flexibility
here yesterday 2000 hours but then you
need to do with the quadratic for
transitivity yes I don't have to unstick
it too heavy then you have to exactly to
go on in for overall all pairs like you
so when do that incrementally besides
check the model under it satisfies
that's activity
your exit
so there is some progress the very last
formula yeah the very last formula is
the only one which let me finish with
his theorem and then we'll stick with
indigo the last formula here then we
don't want to do this each for each by
hand and we try to find something a bit
more general so what we were able to
prove it is specific for primer logic is
that if a B does this sequence is
provable in Parma logic then the
addition of this axiom scheme a tu
primer logic would preserve analyticity
of the calculus and these geese this
gives us all of these because if you
take the corresponding air will be all
of them up our probable in classic in
primer logic and what is nice is this
this is can be done again now you have
an extended system it is calc with these
axioms then if you are able to prove
something like this you can take this as
as as another axiom and you can get even
closer to classical logic and you can it
depends on the depth that you want to to
have in your formulas and the same thing
for a disjunction if you have a LLC and
Bao see both overbilling primer logic
see should be some some formula will be
then the addition of the axiom a or b 0
c 2 prime a logic preserves its
analyticity and this gives you all of
these this should this requires a
special treatment but this is different
from you what you told me about your SPL
project because this is only speaks
about the most press the main formula
not inside and for this we have we still
have to do some hard cock solution
because this all does not have this
natural structure that I spoke about
that you have this material may inform
will and that all other formulas or
Excel formulas this is not true here
this may not generalize because bad in
the case lost formal more genuine see
the conjunction set design concept then
the
production decision procedure is linear
only expected time run it realistically
it's problem but I don't know what
happens if this Junction is only the
most the outer connected then if you
take these sets you before so if you
have a or b implies see this should be
exactly the same as CEO as a boa implies
c and this is not what this kiss
forgives you just give you this Junction
on them on the most a outer level of the
formulas particularly in general but it
shows the core so there is a real
problem girl and the final thing that we
are able to add is a is to add the
bottom connective which is always fall
so we can add this soul to primer logic
this is problematic from the in the
hilbert calculus but in gates in
calculus there is no problem to do that
and you can add so this means the bottom
is always false but since we have some
weird implication in this junction we we
have to we can add to recover some of
the report is so we can add this axiom
and this and this all of them out win
classical logic but you can add him to
put primer logic if you want to have
this also there and all these extension
are still we still have a linear time
decision procedure using a horn SAT
solver that's it most of the things I
mentioned so of the Father work that
will still have to do we want to allow
with your notions of analyticity in park
consistent logics you don't have the
usual analyticity of this negation of
sub formulas we wonder if there are
other useful logic that can be reduced
upon polynomial SAT fragments so whether
primer logic was then the only important
one I don't know is your question about
variables so we still haven't studied
that and of course what you just
mentioned these sets that we we can't
say anything about it yet
and that's it thank you thank you
taking-the-clothes-off fish okay thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
