hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
Emma's packin MS research welcomes you
today for this combined lunch event this
one little plug for MS pack please go to
whack whack em ice pack find out a
little bit more about our political
efforts and our speaker series we've had
over 40 events so far this year it's a
few more coming up just jump right into
it Stephen Johnson who's the author of
nine books featuring everything
including everything bad is good for you
where good ideas come from and the
invention of air there's infinite in
addition to his columns in Wired and
discover he's published in the New York
Times The Wall Street Journal and many
other periodicals he has co-founded
three influential websites including
feed F EE D Newsweek named him one of
the fifty people who matter most on the
internet and he's appeared on The Daily
Show with Jon Stewart the news hour with
Jim Lehrer and his most recent foray
into television is for this book and a
six-part mini-series on PBS exploring
the history and power of great ideas
please give a warm Microsoft welcome to
Steve Johnson you know show up in your
bio like the Newsweek thing about 50
people matter most on the internet that
was from 1995 it was a real honor but
unfortunately there were only 50 people
on the internet so it really so I'm
really glad to be here let's get rid of
this whole message this this is this is
my ninth book and I actually kind of
trying to get back home to New York I
was in the Bay Area yesterday and took
this little detour through Seattle on my
way back to New York so that I could be
here because I have come to Microsoft
for all nine books even dating back to
my
first one interface culture so I
couldn't you know not be here and the
difference is with this one is that for
the first time there is a whole
television series with me in it
accompanying this this book so this is
the first project that I have kind of
co-developed as a book and as a TV show
in in in in parallel basically so it's
it's a whole new kind of adventure the
show started airing last week Wednesday
nights we ran two episodes another
episode aired last night it's gonna run
for the next three weeks available
online and I thought it'd be fun did you
show you this little trailer we have
just 90 seconds to give you a sense of
what the shows like if you haven't
gotten a chance to see it and then I'll
tell you more about it I don't know if
we wanted I don't think we needed to dim
the lights oh there we go imagine
observing Earth from a distance for the
last hundred thousand years
people who actually made the modern
world people you probably never heard of
I'm Steven Johnson I write about ideas
and innovation this is the untold story
of how we got to now it's here the
Clarence Birdseye we'll have the
beginning of an idea that will turn out
to be one of the most transformative
ones of the 20th century
I think it'll probably take us about
three days do you take you three days
bird's-eye hunch will take decades to
finally pay off the modern world of coal
does not get any weirder than this
now you're getting a dolphin tug it's
the idea behind it that's important
they put a kid inside the whales hat
you guys get me out of here it was an
epic and changes
we make our ideas and they make us in
the tribe
so there you go that's the big
television program I hope you can see
just from that how fun it was to make it
has this I mean it was it was a lot of
work I've never worked so hard on
anything in my life
and I was writing the book while we were
making the show so I would we did we
shot it all over the world and so we
would do these 10-hour shoots and then I
would go back to the hotel room and work
on the book and it was crazy but it was
a great kind of collaborative process in
a show and a book that really is in many
ways the celebration of collaborative
innovation working with the team on that
was really really extraordinary it turns
out to be actually this is something we
didn't really think about consciously as
we were making it but I think it turns
out to be a really good show to watch
with your kids it plays really nicely
the the stories the kind of history I
think we spent a lot of time trying to
make sure that the stories would be
fresh to a well educated you know
erudite historically well-read adult so
we came out with a bunch of things that
I think most of you will not have heard
but to an 11 year old or a 12 year old
or 13 year old it's it's presented in a
way that doesn't quite look like your
normal history show and and it's got you
it's kind of playful in this way and so
I Mike I've watched it with my kids and
they I the fact that I'm in it is a
liability to them you know they're
they're like oh dad geez don't do that
it's so embarrassing but you can see
them getting kind of pulled into the
narrative into the storytelling and the
kind of adventure of it and let me tell
you a little bit about what what the
book in the show is trying to do so it's
it's it's a story an account of
innovation and of course you know you
know this even better than I do
innovation is this you know it really
kind of abused buzzword now everybody
talks about innovation how do we make
our society more innovative how do we
make our companies more innovative how
do we make schools encourage innovation
but a huge part of the conversation and
the kind of default settings in a way
too
to the way that we define innovation is
really focused on the tech sector on
companies like Microsoft and companies
like Facebook and you know kind of a
startup culture in Silicon Valley and
and along the west coast in places like
Seattle and so when we think about
innovation there's kind of this you know
default tendency to think of it in terms
of you know the 25 year old who's got a
new app that maybe it's gonna go public
and make a billion dollars like that's
the narrative that you know we we have
in so many places now and that's fine I
mean I love this part of the world I've
been a participant in this part of the
world I love my gadgets as much as the
next person but I will I wanted to
remind people with this project that
innovation is actually broader than that
and our lives are kind of populated by
all these things that are so kind of
commonplace now so ubiquitous that we
don't even think of them as technologies
or as innovations and yet they have this
amazing long history of creativity and
human ingenuity and collaboration that
brought those things into our lives we
think about things in our lives
for instance we have a show and a chat
and a chapter on the innovation of clean
drinking water the fact that we all in
in this part of the world can go to a
faucet and pour ourselves a glass of
water and drink it and not worry about
dying of cholera
48 hours later as we would have just 130
years ago in any large city in Europe or
the United States um that is an
extraordinary thing that is an amazing
achievement that you can have cities of
a million people or ten million people
and waterborne disease is really not an
issue anymore in again in the in the
developed world and the story of the
people who kind of contributed to that
situation is is of long and rich and an
extraordinary series of series of
breakthroughs and and and big projects
that are just as important to our daily
lives and to our standards of living as
you know those the smartphones and the
gadgets and the computers
we don't celebrate those achievements
nearly enough and so what we tried to do
is basically each chapter in each
episode is kind of one thing and we
could have unwind the 500 year history
of the thousand year history of this
thing so last night we had an episode
about glass and about how glass was
arguably the most important material of
the last thousand years and we have one
about clean and clean drinking water and
light and sound and cold and and time a
wonderful episode about clocks that
aired last week so it's a fun adventure
and one of the things that makes it I
think really fun one of our the kind of
narrative devices that we have at our
disposal on this is we talk a lot about
and I write a lot about in the book
about the unlikely hard to predict kind
of secondary effects of new innovations
as they as they ripple through society
and the book I started calling these
hummingbird effects it's kind of an
elaborate metaphor do you think about
the hummingbird is this creature was
writing the book largely in California
and our little garden has a lot of
hummingbirds there and I got kind of
interested in the evolutionary history
of hummingbirds and you know you think
about it flowers flowering plants and
insects kind of evolved together and
create this complicated symbiotic
relationship the kind of relationship of
pollination and that over evolutionary
time seems to be largely kind of
confined to the flowers and the insects
but then at some point in in kind of
deep history this bird slowly evolved
ziz strategy to hover next to plants in
a way that no other bird can do which
involves incredible extensive kind of
re-engineering of the the wing of the
hummingbird so that it can hover and
flap its wing its wings at this
extraordinary rate and it starts to
participate in this process and so what
seems to be in nature relationship
between insects and plants ends up
re-architecting the wing of a bird and I
thought that is kind of a nice metaphor
for what happens with technology all the
time or new ideas in science or new
ideas
in the machines and the tools we use
someone is designing a tool inventing a
tool for one specific purpose trying to
solve a very kind of locally defined
problem but in doing that they set off a
kind of a chain set of chain reactions
that affect completely different parts
of the of the world in ways that would
have been very hard to predict in
advance so one of the classic examples
of this one of my favorite stories rough
in the book is it's a story about air
conditioning so air conditioning is
invented at the beginning of the 20th
century by a guy named Willis carrier
who goes on to found the carrier
corporation and initially he's he's
hired out by this printing shop in
Brooklyn that is trying to deal with
their having difficulty with humidity
levels in the in the kind of hot summer
months and they're printing these color
magazines and the ink is running because
it's too humid in the print shop and so
they hire this young engineer carrier to
come in and basically build a big
dehumidifier which he does but it has
this kind of secondary effect of making
the air cool as well as drier and it
successfully solves this problem of
causing the ink of keeping the you know
the ink from running on the page as they
print but they noticed that jeez
everyone suddenly wants to have their
lunch in the room with the giant
dehumidifier and so character starts
they could probably do something with
this and so he goes off and and kind of
invents this whole new technology of air
conditioning but the big change the kind
of the full hummingbird effective it
doesn't really kick in until after World
War two when the carrier Corp and a
couple of others introduced home air
conditioning units they've condensed the
technology down to the size of a window
and then their central air it's
introduced for people's homes and that
sets in motion almost immediately the
the largest migration of human beings in
the history of the United States all of
these people move to the Sun Belt the
desert states to Florida to places that
were borderline you know uninhabitable
you know they were at the turn of the
century there were a hundred and seven
people living in Las Vegas right and it
has been recently the fastest growing
city in the United States which tells us
something about the United States but
whatever the
and so all these people move to these
places like Phoenix there were just very
hard to live in because it was 110
degrees during the day but once you had
air conditioning it changed the whole
balance and that sets in motion a
dramatic re kind of configuring of the
geopolitical map of the United States as
there's like a 60 votes wing in the
electoral college from the northern
states to the southern states and it's
that southern Sun Belt coalition that is
central to Ronald Reagan's successful
bid for the presidency in 1980 it is
entirely possible that Ronald Reagan
would have been elected president in
1980 if air conditioning had not been
invented but it is absolutely true that
he would have had to have built a
different political map in his route to
the White House without without air
conditioning so you cannot tell the
story of Reagan's presidency without
somehow telling the story about air
conditioning and Willis carrier it's not
it's not at six degrees of Kevin Bacon
thing right it's it's two degrees it's a
real part of the story but we tend to
not talk about history this way the and
and you can see these effects going back
and even into things that we think you
know stories that we really know one of
my favorite stories involves Guttenberg
and you know like most of you in this
room I'm sure I've felt like I had a
pretty clear understanding of Guttenberg
and the importance of the printing press
and it's you know interesting effects
transformative you know probably the
most important communications revolution
of all time but there's a side of it
that that I hadn't kind of stumbled
across until we started researching this
this project which is to say that when
the printing press gets introduced to
Europe and all of a sudden literacy
rates start to rise and people who are
not you know monks basically begin to
read something interesting happens to a
significant portion of the European
reading population which is if they
start going I can't read this I am
farsighted I can't make out these
letters on the page and what's
interesting about this is that there was
a significant portion of the population
particularly those who'd made it to
being 40 years or older who who were
farsighted all along but they never
noticed this because they had almost no
me to look at very small objects as
close to their eyes right now unless you
were like a seamstress you really didn't
have occasion for that using that part
of your visual faculties which may be
one reason why it's so common that we
lose our kind of reading vision when we
hit the age of 40 it's just there wasn't
an evolutionary penalty for that in the
past you just didn't have to look at
things like that so all of a sudden this
new technology exposes this flaw in our
biology on some level and that requires
a new other technology to get into
circulation which is reading glasses or
spectacles which had in fact originally
not surprisingly been invented by monks
who were the only people who were
reading in the in the in the society and
the kind of monasteries before Gutenberg
and so all of a sudden thanks to the
introduction of the book and a sense of
kind of a market signal goes out through
Europe saying you know if you make
lenses and gonna put them in the form of
these spectacles you can make some money
and so suddenly Europe is awash in its
kind of these pools of expertise in in
lens making and for the first time there
all these people who were very good at
creating these little little objects of
glass this is part of the importance of
glass in society and because people have
a natural tendency to kind of tinker
with their inventions once they come up
with these new technologies before long
people start saying hey if I take a
couple of these lenses and put them next
to each other I can make things that are
very far away look very close and and if
I actually put them in this other way
here I can make these very small objects
look much bigger and the telescope and
the microscope are invented and this
revolutionized this science on so many
levels
Galileo takes telescope within five
years of its invention and sees the
moons of Jupiter and you know overthrows
you know a thousand years of theology
the microscope takes a little bit longer
it takes about 70 years to really make a
dent in the in the universe when Robert
Hooke it takes his microscope and he
starts doing these detailed drawings and
in his amazing work this is a flea and
and one of the most important ones
actually one of the most important
images really in the history of science
he analyzes the tissue of a cork and he
notices these little box
is in the cork which he calls cells and
this is really the first time anyone had
visualized and named the cellular basis
of life so just think of all the
extraordinary things that came out of
our ability to look through microscopes
think of what health and medicine would
be like if we didn't have microscopes
and so this understanding this kind of
scientific revolution that came from
telescopes and microscopes is again
directly but surprisingly connected to
Gutenberg we think of Gutenberg as being
involved with science in the sense of
people were able to share and store and
circulate their information and their
studies and cite other people's research
thanks to the printing press but he also
triggered it in this way that he never
thought of which is that he he made the
world kind of interested in lenses which
led them to telescopes and microscopes
so that's one of the one of the things
that the book and the show tries to do
is to take you through these kind of
surprising connections but the other
thing I think it's important to do and
there we spent a lot of time with this
in in this in this project is looking at
in a sense that people's mistakes and
their their kind of failures to see
things that should have seemed obvious
to them or seem obvious to us now
looking back with hindsight we tend to
tell the story of you know technological
progress or scientific progress as a
series of successes you know the history
is kind of written by the victors and so
yet every school kid learns okay then
Alexander Graham Bell invents a
telephone but in fact if you go back and
look at the history innovation it is
littered with all these kind of weird
dead ends or places where very brilliant
people failed to see some obvious thing
and yeah I think it's important to teach
this because one it's an important part
of the story it is what happened and two
if we're thinking about encouraging
innovation in our own society in the in
the sense of the present tense we want
to do it we want we're we're guilty or
we fall victim to these blind spots
ourselves all the time so learning from
the kind of historical stories I think
it's really important and and I think
the best example of this is this story
about this French inventor
had a great French name Edward leon
scott de martinville and he was a guy
who invented a device for recording
audio in the early 1850s it was called
the phone autograph he got a patent for
it in 1855 and I know what you're
thinking Thomas Edison invented the
phonograph 20 years later you know
what's up with this why what this
doesn't sound like the story we know but
if in fact it was this brilliant
invention it took in the sound waves
kind of at the back of this vessel here
and the kind of frame of it was made of
this parchment that would vibrate and it
would pass those vibrations on to this
little pigs bristle at the end of it
which would then write the waveforms
onto the rotating cylinder which you
could then unfold a piece of paper and
you could see this recorded waveform for
the first time you know what had ever
done this before so it was a brilliant
invention almost a generation ahead of
Thomas Edison right you know you're
doing something right when you're that
far ahead of Edison so why have we never
heard of this guy the answer is that he
forgot one key feature which was
playback there was no way to listen to
the audio that you had recorded so you
could look at these nice waveforms but
you couldn't actually hear what you'd
recorded this turns out to be a feature
that people find very desirable in their
audio products who woulda thunk it he
and it raises yeah I mean what I love
about this is he didn't it wasn't like
he was trying to add the playback
feature it never even occurred to him it
was in his his blind spot right he
couldn't see this kind of basic
functionality that you would think would
now seem obvious and and the it raises a
question of level like what the hell was
he thinking right why would anybody want
this and the answer is that he was
obsessed with stenography and dictation
and a shorthand and he'd seen how people
had developed this technique of
listening to someone speaking and
creating this little code that they
could scribble out in real time and they
could learn to read that code and turn
those symbols back into an imagined
kind of language in their heads and he
thought well that's great I can just cut
out the middleman I can just automate
that process and I'll convert people
will speak will convert it into sound
waves and then people will learn how to
read those sound waves and and you'll
have this kind of automated
transcription and you know if you think
about it that actually was a pretty good
bet right I mean human human beings have
been very good since the invention of
alphabets at taking weird little
scribbles and turning them into an
imagined language and our hats right so
why not assume that we would do that
with sound waves it just turns out that
for whatever reason it is not part of
our cognitive toolkit no human being has
ever learned how to turn that into you
know language so it was it was a dead
end on some level they actually and we
interviewed these guys there's a great
kind of audio historian group called
first sounds and they found these
Scrolls they were called funada grams in
the paris archives and so they scanned
them and brought them digitize them and
converted them back into sound just a
few years ago like a hundred and fifty
years later and they've played it this
is in the show we listen to it actually
they play it and initially they're like
oh we're listening to a little girl
singing and they realize they're playing
it twice a speed and they slow it down
and it's and it's Scott's voice singing
oh Claire de Lune from the grave 150
years later so he finally got his
playback function it's just it just took
a little while and it's amazing the
other thing that's interesting about it
is it's very staticky and in the show I
say that it sounds a little like a
horror movie soundtrack you know and but
it it's also the kind of the first
instance of static of kind of mechanical
noise you know then it's a sound that
we've become you know our ears have
become very familiar with but this is
this is the kind of first place where it
was it was created it just wasn't heard
for 150 years anyway it's like it's a
crazy story so so there are a lot of
examples of that of trying to kind of go
back and look at places where people
failed to see something that they should
have seen because that's a part of the
story as well and sometimes a dead end
for a person like Scott who more or less
died penniless and whenever heard of him
the idea that they
sat out into the world ends up having a
life of its own even if it doesn't work
out for the inventor so no one really
ever bought a funada graph and it didn't
become a popular technology but in the
audio community people were tinkering
with them and about 15 years later
another inventor was tinkering with the
phone on a graph and figured out a way
to add audio come output to it and that
inventor was Alexander Graham Bell
inventing the telephone so it ended up
setting the stage for the true
breakthrough that did become a
commercially viable product so so even
even the blind spots can sometimes be
productive ones the other theme that I
think is interesting particularly in the
context of a company like Microsoft is
it's thinking about platforms as a as a
way of engendering innovation and when I
say that I understand everybody in this
room because yes obviously we know you
create a big platform that everybody
uses and creates higher-level innovation
on top of that that's the history of
software but I one of the things that we
try to do is to say that that process is
actually much longer it kind of predates
software and then when society comes
around and agrees on a set of standards
or kind of units or kind of measuring
terms or some other kind of basic
agreement about how things should be
kind of classified or the language we
should use to describe phenomena in the
world that creates a kind of
intellectual platform that encourages a
lot of innovation and actually ends up
encouraging a lot of Humminbird like
effects where you know someone was
trying to solve a specific problem it
ends up doing something completely
different and there's a great example
that in in the time chapter an episode
on the on the history of standardized
time zones you have no idea how hard it
is to make compelling television about
standardized time zones we really spend
a lot of time it's actually one of my
favorite secrets of the whole show of it
so until around 1880 every single town
in the United States was on its own time
you would do a local reading of where
the Sun was you know in that town and at
the point where the Sun was highest in
the sky that was 12:00 noon and you set
your clocks off of that which meant that
as you moved from east to west across
the country each town was a little bit
off compared to the town
a few miles over so it would be you know
12 noon in New York and you know 12 old
1157 in Jersey City and if you went up
to New Haven it would be I guess would
be later be 1206 or something like that
as you moved around you'd jump around
minute by minute by minute and just like
farsightedness in the european
population this was a problem that
nobody noticed it was a problem that
wasn't a problem because nobody had any
need to coordinate schedules in a sense
in real time with people in other towns
this is something that it never even
occurred to you as a problem like you've
got on your horse or group you're you
know wagon or whatever and went over to
some other town it took you an hour to
to get over there and when you got there
if it was three minutes later who cared
right no one you know no one even
bothered with this when what changed all
of that was the railroad the railroad
technology exposed this up until that
point invisible flaw in the way we were
measuring time because suddenly people
were moving around at high speeds
between towns on a very regimented
schedule where if you didn't know what
time it was it messed up all your plans
and so you would have these situations
where you you would leave New York at
noon and you travel an hour and a half
to New Haven and your watch would say it
was 1:30 but you were on New Haven time
so actually it was 137 only the train
you were traveling on took its time from
its originating station which was in DC
so it was 137 New Haven time 12:00 1:30
New York time but the Train time was
actually 154 and you were connecting to
a boston-based train so according to the
boston-based rank if nobody could tell
what time it was anymore right it was
just impossible to figure out and there
were these elaborate charts that were
made where it was like how to calculate
what time it is and all the stations if
you are starting in Washington DC and it
was like literally like four hundred
numbers on this tiny piece of paper and
you'd be like okay I'm in Wilmington I
think it's 12 54 so people realized that
this wasn't going to work and so they
had to come up with this convention of
standardizing time agree
and then they also added this feature of
of time zones and this was a an idea
that it started in Canada and in the UK
and took a long time to come to the US
actually was really funny there's but
quote from a couple of these letters a
lot of people resisted the idea because
they thought it was unnatural to not
have noon be the point at which that you
know the Sun was highest in the sky so
there are all these kind of angry op-eds
you know kind of nineteenth-century
op-eds letters the editor written by
people saying like we will not have this
devil's time brought to Cincinnati you
know that kind of stuff but eventually
largely led by this guy William Allen it
was this railway clerk who became this
big evangelist for this idea they came
up with the standardized time system and
in the original map the that was used
for 20 or 30 years the time zones did
not follow state lines where they do now
they followed the rail lines and so the
Allen divides the map so that at the
termination point for each of the rails
that's where the the time zone would
switch over shows you how much our sense
of time was being driven by railroad
technology at that moment so that gets
set in place and again this is the kind
of thing we never even think about this
as an innovation but it made a whole way
of life possible and it in fact in the
20th century enabled something
completely different
because it had created this platform for
time that Allen and his peers weren't
thinking about it at all which is that
it enabled mass media it enabled radio
and television to coordinate air dates
and air times for shows not something
was on the agenda at all in the
nineteenth century but suddenly what you
had this it was possible for the first
time to say tune in at you know 10:00
p.m. Pacific time on Wednesdays on PBS
as you should because that's where my
show airs
I did that you can't do that unless you
agree on what time 10:00 p.m. Pacific
Standard Time is right and so that's the
power of kind of platforms like this
this is agreeing on some kind of
convention enables all these other
inventions down the line that that
aren't even in your in your field of
vision at all now when you when you look
at history this way this is really
history that that differs from the
traditional kind of telling there there
are characters and people that are
important to these stories but I think
there's an inevitable sense that in a
way that the the ideas and the and the
machines and the technologies and the
and the platforms are kind of driving
the process as much as the individual
human beings in a funny way right we
tend to tell history in terms of the
great figures of history the great men
of history as they often are or big you
know military battles and things like
that but but if you look at the the the
last 500 years from this angle what you
see is that once ideas get into
circulation once these technologies
start to circulate through society in a
way they have a life of their own and
sometimes people almost feel like kind
of vehicles for those for those ideas or
those or those technologies not so much
the creators but more almost like a
vessel but I don't I spend a lot of time
particularly in the book trying to
stress it it's not purely a case of kind
of crude technological determinism it's
not just that the kind of new
developments and Technology dictate the
way everybody lives what happens is
actually the there's a kind of a
complicated dance and interaction
between those two layers humans choosing
making choices about how they want to
live and the technology kind of pushing
them towards certain solutions certain
formations certain ways of being social
or organizing decision making and things
like that and one of the best examples
of the the power of kind of individuals
to shape the way technology is used is
in the chapter and the episode on life
it's the last little story I want to
tell you and then we can oh
and up for four questions and involves
Jacob Riis who is actually one of the
better-known people that we talked about
in the show the great late 19th century
kind of muckraking progressive a
journalist working of Danish origin
working in downtown New York City at a
time when neighborhoods like five points
were among the most dangerous most
deadly most disease-ridden and really
most awful places to live on the face of
the planet when the most kind of densely
populated neighborhoods a whole kind of
condition of slum living that really
hadn't existed in that modern form until
the 19th century in cities like London
and New York and because it was such a
novel experience people outside of the
city it just had no idea the conditions
people were living in that they were
cramped into these you know single room
tenement houses with you know 20 people
living in a room with no windows and
terrible epidemic disease terrible
conditions and there were there the
beginning there was people tried to
write about it that there were there was
actually a small kind of little cottage
industry industry of tourism to go to
places like Five Points the phrase
slumming it was actually invented around
that time where they would be guidebooks
it'd be like you could go down to these
neighborhoods and see these wretched
people but there was no political
outrage about it there was no sense of
we need to change this this is not right
that people are living in these
conditions and Rhys was as a reporter he
was intimately involved in this and he
was trying to get the word out to the
wider population and get politicians and
get the general public mobilised in a
sense together give him a proper sense
of outrage about what was happening in a
city like New York so he wrote all these
articles but somehow the words just
wouldn't do it and and he actually had
kind of line drawings commissioned to
show the conditions but they all looked
kind of quaint you know I was like oh
look at the four people you know it
wasn't it wasn't it just wasn't gripping
right and he had this idea you know
photography had been around for 30 40
years at this point and he was an
amateur photographer and he had this
idea if he could photograph these lives
in these conditions that would be the
thing that would
finally change public opinion but the
problem was it was just too dark one of
the things that made these places really
awful places to live as they often had
no windows and very very low light
conditions and photography at that point
was entirely dependent on full daylight
you could not photograph outside of full
daylight in any any any shape or form
and in fact even a full daylight as you
know from looking at these old pictures
you had to stand still for like 30
seconds which is why every picture from
the middle of the 19th century is you
know like action shots you know and and
so trying to photograph inside a room
much less inside a room with no windows
you literally couldn't get an image and
so there were people who were starting
to experiment with the idea of what we
now call flash photography and there
were there people worked with limelight
which they'd used in kind of
illuminating theatres but everybody look
like basically a cadaver when you
photograph them with limelight and and
there were other things that were you
know just dangerous and they were just
set fire to things but but one day in
the 1870s Rhys is at home and he reads
this little four line item in a New York
paper over breakfast about a new
technology that had been invented by a
pair of German scientists called bleach
Lake which literally means flashlight
and it was this new way of illuminating
photographs it's basically a small
controlled explosion but it shoots off a
kind of a pretty good light that you can
photograph too and we actually recreated
those exposures you saw it briefly in
the in the video we got an old kind of
photography historian nerd kind of
person to actually recreate this
bleached like powder and we set off
about 20 of them with with me setting
them off with high-speed film so we have
this amazing slow-mo images of these
explosions going off and really a look
of tremendous courage on my face
I captured that I was looking like I'm
gonna blow my hand up for this stupid
show I can't believe I have to do this
yeah anyway it's really cool thing but
so Reese hears about this blitz like
technology and he goes and races off get
some and within a matter of weeks he is
going into these five points slums and
into people's houses and come storming
in and like setting off small explosions
in their houses which was alarming but
he gets his pictures and he puts his
pictures into a very famous book now
called how the other half lives and he
also goes around the country showing
these images in in public lectures with
the with the magic lantern and it's a
it's a big event throughout the country
and it's an interesting thing because
that practice of going into a darkened
room with hundreds of other people and
looking at glowing images on a screen
would become very commonplace in the
20th century and it would be a space of
kind of wish fulfillment and fantasy but
the in may case is the first time that
Americans actually had that experience
we're looking at these images looking at
conditions of terrible poverty and
deprivation and that book and those
images turn the tide I mean if you have
to figure out where the progressive
movement started you know what were the
key events that started the wave of
reform that that cleared out a lot of
those slums and and that you know the
Teddy Roosevelt and others really began
to kind of champion this book and and
Jacob Reese's work is clearly one of the
defining kind of early causes of that
and there's no way this book happens
without flash photography without glitch
like but here's the point it was
inevitable that someone was going to
invent flash photography by the end of
the 19th century there were there were
so many people working on it and as so
often happens with with technology an
idea becomes kind of ripe there's the
the building blocks of the idea the
existing technologies and materials the
concepts the market come together and
that idea becomes part of the what we
sometimes call the adjacent possible
and simultaneously all around the world
they're people working on that problem
that happens again and again and again
in the history of technology and it
certainly was happening with flash
photography it was going to become a
mainstream technology by the end of the
1800s but what was not inevitable is
that one of the very first uses of that
technology would be to transform public
opinion about the conditions in in some
neighborhoods like five points that was
Jacob Riis that was his intervention
into that kind of inevitable march of
technology and I think that's what we
have to keep in mind that there is this
kind of beautiful and an amazing dance
between progress and technological
progress and scientific project that it
has its own logic sometimes and we have
to understand that logic and and there
isn't an somewhat inevitable sequence of
what gets invented after what you can't
invent a microwave oven in 1650 however
smart you are right you have to work
within your moment in time and when
those inventions do come out they end up
transforming us in ways that the
inventors don't necessarily predict
that's the hummingbird effect but we
also have choices and we have the
ability as individuals or as groups and
as organizations to take those
technologies to take the new openings
they have and use them for purposes that
we think are morally or socially
valuable and that's we have to kind of
in a sense keep our eye on both of those
balls at the same time because they're
important and I think essential part of
where progress comes from so that's a
little overview of the book and the show
I hope you guys get a chance to check it
out love to hear your questions or
thoughts
yes the online questions is what is your
favorite client spot moment and
inventions well I think actually the
story of Scott the question is what is
my favorite blind spot moment
intervention Scott is certainly probably
my favorite but since I already told you
that story the other one that it's
really great I wrote about a little bit
in where good ideas come from the book I
wrote four or five years ago is Lee Lee
de Forest and and the vacuum-tube
one of the co-inventors of the
vacuum-tube invented this thing called
the Audion and he divorces his beautiful
figures brilliant guy but what's just
wrong again and again in understanding
what he was inventing so he's his credit
classic thinker it's like I've invented
something incredible and then he
misunderstood why I was working and and
he built this early vacuum tube to - he
wanted he was really into the idea of
amplifying audio signals to make radio
so that radio would be loud enough and
have enough bandwidth to basically
transmit music it was a big audio buff a
big opera buff and so he set up this
using this new invention he had he set
up this demo of radio music broadcasting
in New York I think in 1912 I think it
was and he set up these microphones at
the the Opera in New York and then
invited journalists to listen to radios
that he designed all around the city to
hear this amazing music kind of wafting
through the air under their radios and
yeah gets the New York Times to cover it
and all this kind of stuff and and they
all sit there and turn it on and it just
sounds awful like it said it's not the
technology is not ready it doesn't sound
like music at all it's like just pure
kind of static and noise and so he he
ends up getting almost going to jail
because his investors are like what are
we doing investing in this you just
completely made a fool of yourself and
he sells off the technology to what
becomes Bell Labs and Bell Labs takes
this this prototype kind of a vacuum
tube and discovers that
DeForest had invented a lot of cover
things he gotten it all wrong he thought
that the that the gas inside the the
tube was really important in fact it
needed to be a vacuum
hence vacuum tube and so once you took
the air out of it it actually was much
better at its job and then became known
as a vacuum tube and a couple other
things he just he kind of mangled so he
he again he made a huge contribution but
it was through these series of missteps
and the other funny thing was once radio
became a successful technology it was in
fact you used to transmit music almost
immediately but the music that it was
used to transmit was jazz jazz went
because of radio almost entirely because
the radio jazz went from being a very
local regional music in there like
Mississippi Delta and you know Chicago
in New York to a national music what a
crucial turning point in the history
race relations in the United States the
first time that African American culture
was coming into white American homes and
African Americans had radio shows like
Louie Armstrong and Duke Ellington on
and from the Cotton Club and so on they
were broadcast all around wrote so big
change in the role of African Americans
because of radio combined with jazz and
DeForest hated jazz he was like an opera
buff and so he would write he would
write these angry op-eds I could write a
whole book of just angry op-eds that
we're like you know like yeah like what
have you done to my invention you've to
baste it with this boogie-woogie
was that it's like it's all so I use
this kind of tragic figure anyway so
that's another good good one yeah let's
go here and then we go yeah so you
talked about this juxtaposition is that
tinkering right and so how do you see
this balance between production
engineering which Microsoft and a lot of
established companies are very good at
and experimentalists engineering where
people are leveraging things they don't
really know about making the lateral
jumps right though something like
Arduino right than the Internet of
Things in the maker space I think it's
not that everybody's now a better
electrical engineer it's that it's
democratize that so that kids can tinker
in piezo so how do you see technology do
you see this trend accelerating is the
power dynamic shifting how what's your
view on that that's a terrific question
that's the kind of question you get when
you go to Microsoft I love it
you know I've written a lot about
tinkerers right so in mention of air for
instance about Jose Priestley the the
chemist who you know did all of his
experiments in his home lab in his
kitchen at the end of the 18th century
and and and John Snow and the ghost map
was basically an independent kind of
researcher so I've had kind of almost
like a kind of romantic interest in
those figures like I just like they make
for good stories and there's something
appealing about it but as you said what
happened kind of between now and then is
that a whole system of kind of an
industrial innovation in a sense you
know got developed where it's like oh
there's a system now we have these large
teams large corporate entities and and
Edison is a really interesting
transition point their transition from
Addison to Bell Labs to then the kind of
model world and I talked about this in
the light chapter that Edison figured
out this this system were like okay
we're gonna have a team of
multidisciplinary people and we're gonna
be in the lab we're gonna kind of define
our problems there is going to be some
experimentation in here but we're gonna
work within these constraints we're
gonna give them for instance options in
the company like there was you know
early compensation structures that then
would become really important in the in
the tech sector so then that becomes the
dominant model for the 20th century is
that the new ideas come out of these
larger organizations and you start to
see that break a little bit with the
startup culture and the garages of the
1970s there was some company in Seattle
they were there's two kids I don't know
anyway and I but I did an interview with
your founder of mr. dates three weeks
ago it was really it was so good I got
to meet him and we did this interview
about progress which is online you
should check it out but I had him sign a
book for my kids
and he wrote a wonderful thing about
like I can't wait to hear about your
innovations but I really wanted to say
like dear Clay Rowan and Dean do not
drop out of Harvard because all my kids
I guess they're consoling like why do we
care about get grades dad Bill Gates
dropped out of Harvard you know like
so anyway so so edits and I think what
we're seeing now exactly with that kind
of maker movement it is the is the
revitalization of that kind of tinkerer
tradition and I hope we can get this
kind of an interesting balance going
where you know the the companies I mean
I look I see it in my kids schools
they've got like a maker room now in in
with like some 3d printers and stuff
like that that's and I to my mind I mean
I that's that that is as interesting
intellectually as well as professionally
right for the kids because it creates a
space that is all about your own weird
curiosity about how the world works
right and so that we have that that kind
of open-ended exploratory model of
innovation thriving again which I think
it really is and it's certainly in this
part of the world that that's terrific
and I think you know there are certain
big problems it's hard to you know it's
hard to ship very complicated big
software without you know kind of
traditional structure and their other
big engineering problems that are hard
to do but that that we have that
tinkerer culture back I think it's a
really good thing yeah right
in listening to to your lecture today it
seems like I can't help but draw
parallels between your your book and say
and in your series and Jamesburg yeah so
you say connection so yeah did you draw
an inspiration from that and would you
say that this is sort of the modern-day
sort of extension of that well it would
be very flattered as people think that
so for those you don't know there was a
series and a serious books by wonderful
super interesting British guy named
James Burke the first called connections
and there was connections two and three
and also a show called the day the
universe change and produced by the BBC
but they ran on PBS here I interesting
they I didn't they were running on PBS
when I was a kid but I never saw them
and then after I wrote my second book
emergence
which had this very Burkean kind of
subtitle of the connected lives of ant's
brain cities and software people started
to say new books remind me of did you
ever see the show
James Burke whatever and so then I went
back and kind of rediscovered them and
so certainly in influence and
inspiration the they're different the
show is very different stylistic aliy if
you go back and look if you go back and
look at the connections there it's it's
they're different I'm gonna just say it
like that it's you know it's just more
contemporary it's almost 40 years old
right you know so but the thing that I
think is really interesting about it is
when you think about telling history
this way particularly on television that
to come up with an an analog of another
show that approached history this way on
television you have to go back 40 years
because to me that seems really bizarre
like I feel like there should be like
half of all history shows should be told
this way it's great to have big you know
I love Ken Burns
I love the Roosevelts was the great
serious you know I loved you know let's
do a big show about the Civil War that's
great that's an important part of
history but this version of history it
seems to me in terms of what our actual
lives are made up of and what our
day-to-day existence is made up of you
know compared to you know the lies I
think about how many shows are just
about kind of weird old aristocracy you
know that just er you know it's almost
like gossip about kings and queens you
know those people are not relevant to
our lives they're interesting and
salacious but it's not that important
whereas this is really what the mountain
world is made of and so I think it's
weird that there aren't like 10
connections between me and James Burke
rather than just kind of you know the
two of us out there but anyway yeah yeah
yeah I mean it's there's there's room
for more you know and I think it
actually is true in in books there's a
genre of a book of a historical book
that is that it is a little bit more
common and that have done well books
like you know Cod if you ever read or
longitude
where you take this kind of I'm gonna
write a whole book about a fish and talk
about how this fish changed the world
and all these surprising ways
and those books do do actually really
well so in terms of the historical
writing there is more of that kind of
mode out there but it hasn't been as
popular on TV so it may just be that
it's really hard and nobody likes shows
like that and I'm gonna feel embarrassed
about it but I don't know
what we seem to be doing alright in the
first three weeks so we'll see yeah how
did you pick your innovation so you know
that eight six six six episodes yeah it
was interesting process again this was
the most collaborative writing project
I've ever been on in my life which was
great because I've been preaching you
know the importance of collaboration but
actually writing my books I would kind
of write them alone in my study so that
you guys should really collaborate but
not me
so this was you know because we were
developing as the show in a book at the
same time so we had you know this team
mostly in in London and I was in
California so the time zone issues were
a little complicated and we we knew that
we went into it with the idea of the the
episode on cold because I had written a
little bit about the Willis carrier
story and the Reagan thing just as an
aside in where good ideas come from this
what often happens with my books is I
have like I write a whole book about
something and there's like two
paragraphs about some other random thing
that I just stumble across and I'm like
that should be the next book and I kind
of blow that up so I knew that that was
go straight and then the the executive
producer Jane root had come to me with
this story about this guy Frederic Tudor
who was the Ice King of the early 19th
century built a multi hundred million
dollar business shipping frozen blocks
of ice from lakes in New England to like
India and Brazil and the Caribbean and
made a vast fortune doing this which was
an incredible story cuz he basically
took something that was free and
abundant and took it to someplace where
it was so rare that I mean if you grew
up in the Caribbean in the 1800's you
would have never seen ice in your whole
life right especially the beginning of a
hundred years solitude if you guys
remember this is about the time that ice
whatever the name of the imaginary
country is in that book and so that's a
great story in a crazy story and so we
knew we had kind of we could start with
Tudor and end with Reagan and AC so we
knew there was an episode there and then
because I've written the ghost map about
snow and cholera we thought an episode
about clean drinking water would be good
and we could tell the ghost map story in
there which I didn't tell in the book
actually cuz I was like we have a blue
ghost mac segment about that 1854
outbreak in the show but in the book I
was like I've already written a book on
this I'm not gonna bore somebody he was
already heard it so we had those two
episodes and though they were kind of
our template and we we wrote scripts and
I kind of co-wrote that and I wrote the
chapters at the same time and then
discretion what the other four were
gonna be and we looked at I don't know
we looked at about twelve or thirteen
different things and it was you know the
variables were we didn't want them to be
high tech things so we didn't want to
have an episode on the smartphone or
something like that had to be ubiquitous
had to be something we don't think of as
technology anymore I had to be
interesting characters particularly for
the show you know the producers are
always like there have to be people that
you know we can talk about that have
personality which I realized actually in
doing this talk about collaboration and
working in a different medium that all
my books have been in a sense skewed
towards the ideas away from the people
and every time I found myself in a book
having to do something like describe
what somebody looked like I would always
be like oh this is so stupid who cared
what he look like you know like I just
like let's get through the idea that he
had you know and which is alright be
like the worst novelist in the world
every like here's John he had a nose and
two eyes you know so so we had up people
and then we had to have those
hummingbird effects like we it had to
set in motion all these change so we you
know we threw around a bunch of you know
we talked about doing money and currency
we talked about doing skyscraper as we
talked about I had this idea which we
may do more seasons of this which would
be really great and one of them once I
really want to do is the history of
illusion of technologies to trick our
eyes and of seeing something that
they're like perspective and painting or
moving images and so on but I couldn't
persuade anything else that was a good
one and so we you know was this kind of
process and then and we had the the
episode that aired last night if anybody
saw it was really interesting because it
was it was one of all about glass and we
kept going back and forth trying to
decide whether it was an episode about
vision and technologies of seeing
basically which involved a lot about
glass or whether it was about this kind
of magic material that made all these
things possible some of which involved
vision and we actually shot a version of
it that was really vision first and then
we changed it around and made it more
about glass and but I wrote the chapter
all along knowing that it was going to
be about glass and actually the chapters
is the first one and I think it's
actually my favorite chapter in the
whole book so even once we kind of hit
on a basic structure we sometimes had
some tinkering to do but um yeah it was
very it was long I we were working out
for four years so it's been a long time
was shot in about nine months once we
really got going but there's a long
preamble okay one last question I guess
if there is one or okay great I've
ridden hard ridden uh-huh
hi little is obsessed with this program
called Yvonne think and I actually
started this company with beta works
called findings which didn't
unfortunately really work out so I I am
basically so I have this thing called a
spark file or just write down every
random idea that I that I use and in
that file itself is like 75,000 words
long now I've been keeping it and I just
do that in a Google Doc actually so that
I can keep it but in terms of managing
all my notes and things that I grabbed
from stories I'm from you know research
I try now really try and read everything
on the Kindle and I used the
highlighting feature in the Kindle which
then you can get to at the Kindle page
at Amazon but it doesn't have the
features that I used to love and even
think where I could kind of generate
interesting connections between small
chunks of text but it's too much of a
pain to get it this is what we're trying
to do with findings but then Amazon shut
us down by the way if any
knows anybody in Amazon I'm angry at
them like some other people the
publishing business so they're so
they're just sit there at Amazon and I
can search them and I can grab the
quotes and paste them and that makes
life a lot easier than having to
transcribe them but but I used to be
able to with this program kind of say
hey I'm looking at this quote from this
book find me other quotes from
everything I've ever read that are
related to that and I've kind of lost
the ability to do that so my brain is
slowing down because of this alright
thank you all so much it's so great to
be back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
