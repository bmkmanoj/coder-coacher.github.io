you
so welcome to the deep learning
symposium it's the first of its name we
started the tradition of deep learning
workshops at nips in 2007 at that time
it was a submit we submitted a proposal
for a deep learning workshop to the nips
workshops and it was rejected this was
the beginning of deep learning we
decided to have the workshop anyways
thanks to see far we organized a
workshop during the afternoon the
afternoon we're usually people went to
took the bus to go to the ski slopes and
we had lots of people nothing like this
but compared to the size of nips in
those years and since then we've had a
lot of workshops they've grown and I
guess in last year the nips organizers
thought that there were too many people
going to DD planning workshop and it was
hurting the other workshops so they
decided to create this symposium slot
where there would be only a couple of
events at once in peril which is good so
we can have more people and also it
leaves more room for other workshops
during the moral and Saturday other d
planning workshops or other kinds of
workshops alright so this year we have a
beautiful team of organizers so I want
to thank in particular mark rollio
rollio runs Otto Hong likely Mac
swelling and Andrew Inge and as you'll
see we have a great list of speakers
there are lots of talks there are mostly
short talks with time for questions
afterwards encourage you to go to see
the website to see the details of the
program and also we have a link to a
poll where you can still until the time
of the panels you can post questions or
vote for questions that you think we
should discuss input
right so it looks like this you can
click on the questions you'd like to
have us discuss or add your own
questions now this this workshop this
the symposium we've done something
different we've done an experiment I and
others in the organizing committee as
well as other people in the sort of deep
learning community think that it's time
that we rethink the way that we're doing
publications conferences and so on in
our community and probably in other
communities and there was a set of ideas
proposed by yond O'Connor few years ago
that I encourage you to go and see if
you want to see more about this this
thinking on his webpage it's called a
new publishing model in computer science
and the basic idea is that we'd like to
take advantage of the fact that
technology has changed you know the
current ways of organizing conferences
journals and so on was was you know what
we could do best 50 years ago but with
the internet and the way that we are
writing papers these days we can speed
up the rate of progress of science speed
up the speed at which IDs are exchanged
at which they are made available by
others built by others disseminated and
evaluated so that science works better
we don't know that we have the right way
of doing this so we need experiments one
of the experiments is working very well
as you know is archived in the last year
or two especially we've seen a race to
post things on archive to be the first
ones to have done thing X or Y and its
really speeding things up it's it's it's
very interesting experiment is working
but it's also asking a lot of questions
about how we should disseminate our
results and evaluate the best results
and the purpose of evaluation really
shouldn't be you know what I should put
on my CV and and and and stuff it should
be a kind of collaborative filtering
work where we try to find what other
people have found interesting so that we
can filter and read the things that are
most interesting so in a sense that this
symposium is trying to play that role
and I think workshops in general and
conferences should play a role in
helping us figuring out what are the
most interesting results that have
happened recently so that we we get to
know about them quickly in in yawns
template you'll see a lot of other ideas
including the notion of an open market
for ideas and the idea that journals or
conferences shouldn't own a paper like
it is currently the case but rather
should be essentially organizations that
give a stamp of approval saying okay so
we like this paper we think it you know
you should pay attention to it and and
we are a body of researchers of
scientists that are trusted in a
particular area another direction where
I think we need to do a lot more
thinking is the reviewing process and
the experiment we've done this year on
the symposium is also playing with that
a little bit I you know if if you
receive papers review and you don't
really care about those papers you don't
do as good a job as if you are able to
tell others what you think about a paper
you just read that you you actually
proactively decided to read because it's
something you care about is it topic you
care about so that's that's something
we've experimented with and I'll tell
you a bit more about that so we decided
to change the way the traditional way in
which people submit papers instead what
we have done is asked influential
researchers in the field to tell us
which papers we
should present or which speakers we
should invite so it's a it's so the
information is going in the other
direction we're not trying to replace a
conference here we're trying to figure
out what what were the most interesting
papers in recent months or over the last
year so we we set up a website where
people could post information about
papers they have written or papers they
have read comments and and sort of
ratings for papers and we asked a large
group of researchers in our field to
engage in the process of providing these
feedbacks and evaluations online in in
in a way that we could have even
discussions and that would be actually
be useful to the authors so see ya for
those people who wonder this is very
different from the usual review process
there is no actual submission there's no
guarantee that because you post
something on that website that is going
to be reviewed we for now we leave that
to conferences so the website was set up
by pranav rush poor car and I would like
to thank him very much he's at Stanford
and and Andrew in convince him to help
us to set up this website called
recommend papers at org which is meant
to be useful for other events at least
it's an experiment and if you haven't
played with the website looked at it
contributed to it I encourage you to
have a look at it so we have a long
program as I said most of the talks is
going to be 15 minutes followed by
discussion we're going to have a first
break for coffee then we got to have
more talks the panel discussion as I
said we'll try to be focusing on the
questions you want us to discuss
and then we have a break for for dinner
there should be food that we can have
access to finger food as well as time
for looking at the posters and then we
resumed with more talks until our final
half-hour panel discussion so here the
people who gave us their recommendations
and let's thank them for their
contribution to this
and in addition to print off we're going
to thank the nibs general chairs kareena
cortés and Neil Lawrence for organizing
this new system of symposia so that's it
