thank you for coming my name is Amy
Draves and I'm delighted to welcome
Colin Adams to the Microsoft Research
visiting speaker series he is here to
discuss his book zombies and calculus
this is a novel that provides clues on
how to manage a zombie apocalypse using
math to calculate the best way to
survive colin is the thomas t read
professor of mathematics at Williams
College he was honored with the high mo
distinguished teaching award which is
the highest teaching honor given by the
math Association of America he is also
the author of six previous books and a
humor columnist for the mathematical
intelligencer please join me in giving
him a very warm welcome thank you thank
you very much thank you very much
everybody thank you very much for being
here it couldn't have been easy getting
here given all the zombies that are out
there right now so congratulations on
still being alive me it took me seven
weeks to get here seven grueling weeks I
lost my dog I lost my best friend you
know how long we've been best friends
we've been best friends for three weeks
this whole things really changed the
nature of relationships hasn't it but
the laws of life that was caused by my
trip here is going to be offset today by
the number of people that are going to
be saved by what I have to tell you here
today because I am going to tell you how
to survive the zombie apocalypse we are
currently living through one of the most
horrific periods in the history of
humankind suddenly makes Paris Hilton
seem kind of unimportant doesn't it
she's gone by the way and so it's been a
while now it's been a few years there
not a lot of us left we're doing the
best we can under the circumstances me I
used to be a professor at Williams
College in western Massachusetts a math
professor before the zombie apocalypse
descended upon the college the college
is gone now so much for tenure but on
the other hand a lot of other
institutions have disappeared as well so
no more police no fire department no
hospitals no super Stop &amp;amp; Shop no
crossing guards no cappuccino latte no
more organic kale it's all gone this
very building that written right now
this building used to house one of the
most important
in America what is it now it's just a
place to protect yourself from zombies
it's really sad now some of you may be
sitting there saying to yourselves okay
so this guy has survived this long but
so have we why should we listen to him
what does he have to tell us why does he
know so much but in fact it is true that
I used to be the advisor on zombie
affairs to the president that's right
the president of new Western
Massachusetts or at least I was until he
was eaten by the vice president now I
want to tell you how to survive the
zombie apocalypse and the first thing
I'm going to explain is a lot of
misconceptions that people have about
zombies let's talk about some
misconceptions about zombies okay number
one they are the dead that have risen
now that's just patently false okay they
are actually people have been infected
by a virus okay they get bitten the
virus gets into the bloodstream goes up
through the blood through the
blood-brain barrier and then it gets to
the brain where it liquefies most of the
brain in fact all of the higher brain
functions reaching the point where now
people devolve into an earlier
evolutionary state the so-called reptile
brain is all that's left and those
people then our seems as if they are the
dead that have risen but in fact they
are not they are actually functioning
beings at that point number 2 zombies
can live forever without sustenance now
that also is silly okay there are no
living creatures that can live forever
without sustenance if it were true that
zombies could live forever without
sustenance we just take Jim's all over
the United States we put treadmills in
them we put zombies on the treadmills
we'd have volunteers sitting in front of
them I forgot one thing here and then we
just power we can generate as much power
as you ever need it okay so so it's
silly zombies need sustenance just like
everybody else does okay number three
zombies can be cured now as I said the
zombie brain has been liquefied and you
cannot cure a zombie so if you see your
mother coming toward you looking like
she's just going to give you a big kiss
that's not what's going on and if you
hesitate for a moment it could be your
last moment okay zombies cannot be cured
a lot of people believe that they could
that was the zombie rights movement
they're gone now okay there are no
zombie rice people left anymore they
shouldn't have opened up the membership
to the zombies now I want to talk a
little bit about how to survive the
zombie apocalypse now I see a few people
here who are dressed appropriately
you're dressed appropriately right a
zombie can't right through that jacket
that's smart things like this are great
hot
the equipment like this that's hockey
equipment like this lacrosse equipment
like this best thing to do is go to the
nearest high school go in there it's
going to smell pretty bad in the locker
room but look for stuff like this it's
great protection okay the other thing
you have to worry about which is very
important is long hair so if you have
long hair you're running a huge risk and
so I did bring a couple of these along
here anybody who needs them bath caps
okay very important you'll take a bath
cap here you go bath kept anyone else
want a bath cap bath cap I think you
need one there you go okay number three
now this is the thing that's really
interesting and maybe one of the most
important things to understand about
zombies and that is zombies are not
smart in fact there are dogs that are
smarter than zombies not that that looks
so good that's really that's perfect
okay so dogs some dogs are smarter than
zombies and I'm gonna give you an
example this is a dog named Elvis and
now this is a dog who belong to a guy
named Tim pennings and he wrote this
article do dogs know calculus that
appeared at the college math journal and
this dog loves to fetch so Elvis just
loves to fetch and Tim pennings lives
right on the shore of lake michigan and
so what he would do is he'd get on the
shore and he'd throw a ball into the
water diagonally into the water and
Elvis would take off after it now the
thing you have to know about Elvis is
here's a picture of what's going on
Elvis can run seven times as fast on the
beach as Elvis can swim in the water and
so what Tim pennings did is he throw the
ball in at various diagonals at various
distances and Elvis would take off and
what was truly remarkable is that Elvis
seem to be able to find that optimal
point the best possible place that you
could go into the water to minimize the
time that it took him to get to the ball
now that's something you can figure out
with calculus where that point is and it
was as if Elvis could into it where that
point was it's kind of an amazing thing
all right so let's think about what
would happen if you did the same thing
with a zombie all right so here we are
on the shore of lake michigan and of
course you know if you throw a ball in
the water zombies not going to go after
a ball in the water okay that's not
going to work so we're going to throw in
Charlie Sheen okay so we throw in
Charlie Sheen here's the zombie and the
zombie what's the zombie going to do the
zombie should go along the shore certain
distance and then cut into the water but
no every single time the zombie heads
straight for Charlie Sheen no matter how
many
times you throw them in same thing
happens over and over and over again ok
so the zombie always heads for where the
person actually is so I actually have a
video of this then i'm going to show you
right now this happened on the campus of
williams college to demonstrate what
happens
you see the zombies down front their
typical typical zombie behavior instead
of running across the front and up the
stairs like any rational human being
would do they don't have the brains in
their head to do it that way instead
they have to come straight for me
straight up the chairs it's gonna take
him a half hour to get here it's very
sad those are professors Garrity and
Morgan from no way of a campus so i want
to show you another incident that
occurred actually very early in this
whole process on the campus of williams
college where there was a Dean I was
watching from a window up above and
there was a Dean trying to escape from a
zombie and trying to get to the bronfman
Science Center so here you see the Dean
and here you see the zombie now if the
zombie were smart with the zombie would
do would be to cut off the Dean because
the zombie is actually moving faster
than the Dean this happens to be an old
d not moving very fast in the zombies
moving faster and if the Dombey went
straight for the Dean the zombie would
succeed in catching the Dean just like
we're going to see right here so the
Dean's moving like that the zombies
moving a little bit faster and right
there you see the zombie catches the
Dean alright but unfortunately for the
zombies sake that's not what happens
because the zombie always tries to head
for right where the beam is at any given
moment so in other words its direction
vector the zombies direction vector is
always headed towards the Dean the deans
Direction vector is headed towards the
Science Center where he's going to get
safe so let's see what happens when the
zombie is chasing the Dean and what
happens as we go along the zombies
vector has always pointed straight at
the Dean the zombies arrow and we go
along and Dean makes it to the science
center because of the fact that the
zombies always heading to where he was
let's watch that in real time so the
dean's trying to get away the zombie is
still moving faster than the Dean but
because the zombie is heading for where
the Dean was the zombie never succeeds
in catching the Dean as the Dean tries
to escape to the bronfman Science Center
ok so we'd like to try to analyze this
situation a little bit more carefully
we'd like to figure out what is that
curve that the zombie went along as the
zombie was trying to chase the Dean so
let's take a look at that and then we
can determine depending on the relative
speeds of the zombie and the Dean
whether or not the zombie is going to
succeed in catching the Dean so we're
going to look at this curve right here
we're going to assume
the beam is starting over here a
distance of X 0 from the zombie and then
the Dean is always headed straight for
the bronfman science center and the
zombie is always having its direction
vector pointed straight at where the
Dean is let's move things forward a
little bit in time so we'll call the
speed of the Dean s sub D and the speed
of the zombie s sub Z so let's move
things forward a little bit in time so
here is a position of the zombie at this
particular instant in time where a
certain amount of time T has already
passed and you'll notice still the
zombie has its direction vector pointed
straight at the Dean um we can we're
going to call the coordinates of the
zombie X comma Y and that's what we want
to determine is what is X comma Y as
time progresses so will first look at
the coordinates of the Dean you'll
notice the x-coordinate Dean has to stay
at X 0 because that's a vertical line
right there the y coordinate of the Dean
will just be the Dean speed times the
time that will give me the y coordinate
of the Dean because that's how far the
Dean is travel than any given time T all
right let's just compute some of the
differences between these coordinates so
down here you'll see the difference in
the x coordinates the zombies
x-coordinate was X the deans
x-coordinate is X 0 so that's the
difference in the two x-coordinates the
difference in the two Y coordinates will
just be the deans y-coordinate minus the
zombies y-coordinate s sub d of t minus
y ok now this particular line that you
see right here you will remember from
calculus is what we call the tangent
line ok and the tangent line has a slope
that is the derivative so in fact the
derivative dy/dx of this particular
curve that we see right here is the
slope of this particular line right here
but is something that you learn very
early that slope is always given by
taking rise over run so that says dy/dx
should be the rise over the run in this
particular case which means dy/dx is
equal to s sub dt minus y that's the
rise / x0 minus X that's the run and
this is a differential equation ok
that's a differential equation that if
we can solve we will then know what this
curve is ok so this has to be satisfied
by the X and the y that occur that give
me the coordinates of the zombie ok so
let's take a look at that equation
alright so we're looking at that
equation we'd like to know if I have
of this form what does y look like okay
and I want you all to be thinking your
own head oh I kind of think I bet you I
have a guess as to what that's going to
be okay so everybody sort of trying to
think in your head okay what's that
going to be and we're going to call q
the ratio of the speeds the speed of the
beam to the speed of the zombies so the
relative speed so we get some sort of
parameter there that we can use all
right has everybody figure out what they
think that looks like well this is it
anybody come up with that one it's it's
bad it's nasty okay so this is actually
kind of a nasty equation but it turns
out this is the solution to that
relatively simple differential equation
assuming that Q is the speed of the Dean
divided by the speed of the Dombey
zombie okay so this is kind of ugly
however we can still use it very
effectively to determine when the zombie
is going to catch the Dean given a
particular value of that relative speed
q all right so let's look at that
equation I'll put it at the top there
and you'll notice the capture is going
to occur when they have the same x
coordinate the zombies following the
Dean along but once the zombie has the
same x coordinate is the Dean the zombie
will have caught the Dean so that means
capture is going to occur when the x
coordinate of the zombie equals x 0
which is the x-coordinate of the Dean
now notice what happens when x equals x
0 in that case this term right up here
disappears ok that's all 0 so all this
big mess here is gone and all we're left
with is this okay so the y coordinate of
capture occurs at Q over 1 minus Q
squared times X 0 okay so let's take a
look at that in various situations to
see what that's telling us so captures
can occur in this particular situation
here and here we have the situation
where he had the Dean starting at x0 and
let's first look at the case where q
equals a half so that means the Dean is
moving at half the speed of the zombie
when the Dean moves at half the speed of
the zombie plugging q equal to half in
here we get y equals two thirds of x0 so
that means the Dean gets about
two-thirds of x0 up up this line before
the zombie catching them okay not a good
situation okay that's bad all right on
the other hand what if Q is equal to
three quarters so the Dean is moving at
three quarters of the speed of the
zombie how far does the Dean get this
time the Dean gets to 12 fifths of x0 ok
so the Dean gets quite a bit of a ways
up okay so that's not so bad and in fact
that's far enough to make
to the bronfman science center so the
Dean makes it to safety in the case that
the ratio of their speeds is
three-quarters so that's good news okay
that's great okay what would happen if Q
equal to 1 so that means the Dean and
the zombie are actually going at exactly
the same speed well in that case you'll
notice the zombies always going to be
following the Dean and in fact in that
case capture never occurs y equals
infinity the Dean never gets caught okay
now the bad news is unfortunately as I
told you that in fact it was Q equals
three quarters and yes the Dean did make
it in the bronfman Science Center
unfortunately the Rothen Science Center
was full of zombies and it really didn't
turn out so well so that's too bad for
the Dean okay so now I want to look at a
different situation so this was a
situation where I had the zombie chasing
someone who's moving in a straight line
but a particular situation that occurred
when this all started on the campus at
Williams College was a circle pursuit
where I was riding a bike and I was
trying to attract a zombies away from
some other people and so the situation
is this one I'm riding a bike around in
a circle the zombie is going to chase me
but still the zombie is always going to
be headed straight towards where I am ok
so the zombies direction vector also
called the tangent vector to its curve
will always be pointed straight at me so
we want to figure out what that's going
to look like so my coordinate first of
all we have to figure out so I'm on a
circle of radius capital R I'm going to
call my angular speed Omega so my angle
is going to be Omega times T at any
given time my x-coordinate I'll call X
sub a for Adams y sub a for Adams and
you'll notice that X sub a is just going
to be equal to our cosine Omega T basic
trigonometry this divided by this and y
sub a is going to be our sine Omega T ok
so I can figure out very easily
coordinates of my point on a circle as
I'm moving around that circle at a given
speed now the zombie so this is now the
zombies coordinates again the zombies
coordinates the zombie is moving along a
curve and I'm going to assume that the
zombies coordinates right now x of t y
of t ok so i have a curve given by x of
t y of t and if i want to find that
direction vector that always has to
point towards me that direction vector
is simply going to be the derivative of
this particular parametric equations of
this curve so the
velocity vector which is the derivative
X prime Y prime is tangent to the curve
and it has length equal to the speed of
the zombie ok so that's the thing that I
want to have pointed towards me it's
actually the zombies velocity vector and
also keep in mind that it has length
equal to the speed of the zombie because
we're going to use that to our advantage
in just a second ok so now the zombies
velocity vector is supposed to be
pointing at me at position a just as I
said so this is the zombies velocity
vector right here and so that says this
thing x prime for the zombie y prime for
the zombie points at X of a y avait ok
so I now have one vector that's pointed
straight at me and that's the zombies
velocity vector um now there's a second
vector this point it straight at me if I
just take the coordinates that i have x
aya and i subtract the coordinates that
the zombie has that will give me the
vector za and that is a vector that
points straight at me because it is in
fact the vector that is go starts at the
zombies position and ends at my position
so this is now a second vector that
points straight at me at any given time
from the zombie to me all right I want
to try to get rid of the length of that
vector I don't like the length of that
vector so i'm going to divide that
vector by its length and that gives me
what's called a unit vector pointed
straight at me ok and a unit vector just
means that it's length is one whenever i
divide a vector by its length which is
this here i get a vector that has unit
length one so now I've created a vector
that points straight at me with unit
life ok so again we're going to let s
see be the speed of the zombie as we did
before and i'm going to multiply this
vector by SC and by doing that i have
created a vector that points of me that
was the unit vector the points at me but
I've manipulated its length to be the
length of the velocity vector because i
multiplied it by the speed that makes it
the velocity vector there is only one
vector that points straight at me that
also has length equal to the speed and
that is the velocity vector so we've now
created a vector that is the velocity
vector right here all right now if I
just write out what that means the
velocity vector was X prime of Z Y prime
of Z and over here I've got all this
well this can be unpacked ok I can look
at the x coordinate and the y coordinate
of this and when I do that I get DX DT
that's the derivative up here is equal
to this expression
and dy DT is equal to this expression
just by looking at the two components of
this vector and breaking it up into
these two equations and this is a pair
of what are called coupled differential
equations okay so if we can solve this
system of two differential equations we
can then figure out what the path of the
zombie will be as it chases me along
this circle now the last thing I'm going
to do here is remember we did figure out
what X sub a and y sub a are those are
my coordinates as I ran around the
circle so I'm going to add those into
the top I'm going to play sexy babe I r
cosine Omega T and Y sub a by our sine
Omega T they're messy they're ugly but
these are the two equations that dictate
the motion of that zombie as I'm riding
in a circle on my bike this way I'm
riding in a circle on a bike okay great
so all we have to do is solve these
equations that would be wonderful can't
be done okay nobody has everybody able
to solve these equations these are very
difficult messy equations to solve so
you can't solve them so what do you do
instead you just run a computer using
these and see what the pads look like
okay so let's take a look and see what
happens if you use these equations to
govern the path of the zombie so here's
the first situation the zombies in red
and it's chasing me as I right around on
the bike and you'll watch what happens
and it seems to be sort of coming in on
that little dotted circle there that red
dotted circle okay let's try another one
so at this time I started the zombie up
here i'm going to start the zombie down
here this time still chasing me still
always trying to head straight towards
me using its velocity vector headed
straight towards me and once again it
seems to be struggling in on that red
circle it's kind of interesting that
it's doing that and in fact that will
happen all the time no matter where you
start the zombie the zombie will always
have a path that slowly works its way in
towards that red circle if you started
over here it looks like this if you
start it over here it looks like this
that happens again and again and again
that circle is called the limit cycle
okay so that's the limit cycle and
you're finding the zombies always ending
up near near to the limit cycle if you
start a zombie right on the limit cycle
as we have right here and you know that
it's tangent vectors starting out
pointing at me right at the start and
then you let it go what happens is this
it actually follows me around the whole
way around always stays exactly the same
distance from me all the way around that
circle and ends up in the same place
that it started at if I end up where I
started okay so it just stays right
there the whole time
so what's happening is it's tangent
vector is always pointed its velocity
vector is always pointed straight at me
and as we go around it just stays
pointed straight at me all the way
around never varies always pointed in
the same direction as we go around there
okay um so what happens if we start with
a bunch of zombies all following me will
notice what they do guy almost caught me
there and you'll notice they bunch they
bunch on that limit cycle okay so they
all bunch up and they all do this and it
doesn't matter where they start the only
assumption i'm making which i didn't
mention before but the only assumption
i'm making is that all the zombies are
traveling at the same speed ok so the
zombies are traveling at the same speed
but if they do that they will bunch just
like this now you can use that to your
advantage as for instance occurred in
this particular situation that again
occurred on the Williams campus to
students trying to escape
ride my bike and see if I can help him
so let's see what we can do here of
course safety first all right i'm gonna
try to attract the zombies to me here we
go wish me luck let's see what happens
all right you zombies hey follow me come
on you zombies follow me over here come
on not so smart anymore you used to be
academics to not anymore are you that's
good good zombies come on working like a
charm nothing like an afternoon's bike
ride with a bunch of zombies behind you
in a pack I'm riding in a big circle
around the quad right now so you notice
they're starting to follow me they're
starting to group together and the idea
is that the zombies are always going to
head towards where I am and what that
means is they're tangent vectors are
always pointed straight at me now
because of that it turns out that no
matter where they start they end up
actually grouping in a clump and they
end up following me on a circle that has
a smaller radius than my circle so my
circles bigger than theirs because i'm
writing faster than they're moving but i
end up getting all of them to follow me
so eventually they'll be all together in
which case these people can escape all
right the zombies are probably me okay
you folks I think you're clear you can
get out of there and get the safety as
quickly as possible all right looks like
they're good now I just got to get to
safety so hang on just a second I'm
gonna brain around come on you zombies
so there you get the idea so you could
actually use this to your advantage if
you know the fact that these zombies are
going to follow you in a circle and
they're going to clump together that's
that's a huge advantage now I want to
talk a little bit about the long-term
prognosis okay so this has been a few
years now since this whole thing started
we've survived this far but how long
will this go on so first let's let h of
t be the number of humans at any given
time let's let z of t be the number of
zombies in any given time let's let the
hdt be the rate of change in the number
of humans and let DZ DT be the rate of
change in the number of zombies and
let's first think about what happened
initially initially for the zombies
there was unlimited resources and those
resources were us okay
they had plenty to eat they had plenty
of people to convert into zombies and so
there was this immense growth in the
number of zombies and that was
exponential growth that you see right
here so that's exponential growth
initially when the initial moments of
infection occurred we saw exponential
growth in the number of zombies okay but
that couldn't be sustained forever
because eventually the number of people
that are out there starts to drop the
number of zombies grows and the number
of people drops and so eventually you
find yourself in a case of logistic
growth and this is the case of logistic
growth where you can think of this as
the rate of change in the number of
zombies will be proportional to the
number of zombies times the number of
people left who have not been killed or
turned into zombies ok so we're losing a
lot of people here this is still
proportional this because this is really
keeping track of the number of
interactions that there are between
zombies and people if there's very few
people left then there's not going to be
a lot of interactions if there's very
few zombies there won't be a lot of
interactions so when either of these two
terms get small there won't be a lot of
interactions if both of these terms are
reasonably big you'll get more
interactions to get more people turning
into zombies and their growth growth in
the number of zombies will continue if I
multiply that out and then think about
what's going on here's the curve that
comes from that so called logistic
growth curve and you'll notice this
first term when Z is small this term is
a lot bigger than this one because Z
square is going to be smaller than Z so
this is a big term and this is actually
exponential growth so that's the growth
that you saw initially is right here
that's the exponential growth you see in
the beginning but then it tails off
because of this term right here and in
fact you can see it better on this one
as soon as p0 minus Z gets small DZ DT
is going to go to zero which means this
thing has to flatten out it has to go to
have a derivative of 0 which means
getting closer and closer to a
derivative of a zero which means it's
going to tail off with time okay so
that's the medium long term but now I
want to talk about the really long term
I'm sorry this is the equation that you
get from that logarithmic growth and so
that's logistic growth okay logistic
growth okay so now I want to talk about
the more greater long-term situation so
this is very long term and it turns out
that these two differential equations
that give me the rate of change of the
number of humans in the rate of change
in the number of zombies govern what's
going to happen and so this first term I
want you to think about if there were
knows
whatsoever and humans had lots of
resources then in fact the rate of
growth of the number of humans is just
going to be proportional to the number
of humans humans have a tendency to
breed and as they breed they create more
humans okay so that's what that term
represents but of course there is
interaction between humans and zombies
when zombies are around and every time
there's a human zombie interaction not
in every case but often in those cases
we lose some humans each time that
happens which is why we have this Myna
beta minus beta times capital h times
capital z so that's the rate of change
in the number of humans for the rate of
change in the number of zombies if there
are no humans around the number of
zombies will drop and the reason the
number of zombies is going to drop is
because as we said before they have to
have sustenance in order to survive they
do starve to death zombies can starve
together to death unlike what a lot of
people assume and so you will lose
zombies if there's no humans but every
time there's a human zombie interaction
that can increase the number of zombies
and so that's what we have this term
right here okay so these two equations
are supposed to govern what happens to
the number of humans in the number of
zombies all right so let's look at those
two equations and i'm going to factor it
capital eights out of the top 1 i'm
going to factor a capital z out of the
bottom one and then let's look at the
critical points critical points is where
the rate of change of the number of
humans and the rate of change of the
number of zombies is zero those numbers
are not changing so those critical
points are going to correspond to
solutions of this and there's two
possibilities you could have both h and
ZB 0 that would certainly make this true
and you can have h equal gamma over
delta which would make this 0 and z
equals alpha over beta which would make
this dear so those are two possibilities
for so-called critical points where we
would be in stable populations let's
talk about the first one when hnz equals
zero it is definitely true that the rate
of change of the number of humans and
the rate of change of the number of
zombies are both zero the good news is
the zombies are all dead the bad news is
we're dead too okay so that's not a
great situation so we don't really want
to be in that situation so we'd like to
analyze what happens in the other
situations so I'm going to use this fact
that that by the chain rule i can write
DZ DT in this way and then i'll divide
through and i'm going to look at what is
the rate of change of the number of
zombies depending on the number of
humans okay and I'll get that by taking
equation I had for DZ DT and dividing it
by the equation I had for d HD t so I
get an expression that looks like this
okay and I'm now going to look at that
in the zah plane okay so each point in
the CH plane will correspond to a
particular number of humans and a
particular number of zombies and this
will correspond to a slope and so I'm
going to draw those slopes what's called
a slope field in the HZ plane so H is on
this axis down here Z is on this axis
over here you remember that critical
point which was Z equals alpha over beta
H equals game over Delta that's this
point right at the center but if these
other points i can have horizontal
slopes here that's when DZ DT equals
zero all the way along there over here I
have vertical slopes that's when the hdt
was zero and so DZ over th will be
infinity ok and I can also draw some
other slopes and the slope field exists
and from that slope field i can create
solution curves that just touch these
are the tangent lines to the solution
curves and they look something like this
and so we want to think about what
happens if we start on one of these
solution curves and we're just going to
travel around it ok as the number of
humans in the number of zombies varies
so we're going to start at a point over
here and so here's the situation and
this was a situation we started it in
this situation initially when the whole
zombie infection started there were very
few zombies and there were a lot of
humans ok so we were right here and then
what happened was the number of zombie
started to increase very fast so the
zombies went up very fast and as the
number of zombies went up the number of
humans started to go down as the zombies
increased in number than the human
started to drop and we found ourselves
in a position like this ok lots of
zombies very few humans then because the
zombies had nothing to eat the number of
zombies started to drop they started to
starve to death and they didn't have
anyone to convert to become zombies and
so this thing started dropping down here
and we find ourselves in a situation
where the number of zombies and the
number of humans was low now in that
situation because there were so few
zombies the human race had a chance to
recover had a chance to procreate and
the numbers started to grow back again
and this is where we are today we're
back here at the point that we started
at where they're very few zombies but
very many humans now of course the
zombies are poised to make a comeback
because there's humans to eat and humans
to convert and we're going to find
ourselves going around this
again and again and again so we find
ourselves in a situation the cyclic
situation where the number of humans is
large and then it drops down low the
number of zombies is large and then it
drops down and we just keep going again
and again and again like that now of
course this is the case that we care
about the most but there are other
situations where this occur very famous
case is on aisle Royal National Park
which is in Lake Superior this is a
national park and lake superior and that
island had been colonized by moose and
the moose had lived there for a long
time and they were on the order of 2,500
moose on that island when one day two
wolves swam across to the island and
established their own little colony on
the island and they started eating the
moose and so the moose population
suddenly dropped and as the moose
population dropped the wolves were
thriving until the moose population got
too low at which point the walls started
starving to death and so then the moose
had a chance to recover which they did
and then the Wolves had a chance to
recover and this cyclic property the
so-called predator-prey models occurred
actually in this particular situation
they've been keeping track of the number
of wolves in the number of moose now fur
for close to a hundred years I believe
this and they see the cyclic behavior
that occurs right there so it's not just
for zombies that this occurs so anyway
we're going to be trapped in this
situation of this cyclic relationship
with between the number of zombies and
the number of humans for who knows how
long unless we can be smart and that's
the trick so I'm just going to end with
a couple of credits here but keep in
mind just try to be clever and then use
the zombies lack of intelligence to your
advantage
I missing an arm and brains are all I'm
eating all week it's true but in my
heart was still there would be so let me
take you to Windies you dessert yeah I'm
a zombie baby ain't nobody perfect
so thank you very much for listening i
really appreciate you coming and
listening thank you thank you very much
thank you and I would be happy to take
any questions or comments or suggestions
for how to survive the zombie apocalypse
anything's useful yeah please you're
talking about the zombies as opposed
relation to the falls of neuse Royal
National Park yes and you end up front
with actually two will swim across yes
and I assume there was a similar thing
with windows ami start destroying us all
what it was a research monkey and a lab
that got out in Twinkies later or
whatever that is there a way to grate
some of that into mathematics of like
here's the unknown that may come in
here's like the unknown that make him an
actually destroy that loop you drove
here so I mean in you know once once the
loop gets established as in the case of
the Wolves as in the case of the zombies
in the case of the zombies it was a lab
at Harvard where they were experimenting
they did some things they shouldn't have
done but once it's established then that
loop can continue unless you can come up
with something else but maybe you're
suggesting doing something else to
disrupt the loop is that what you mean
now you know that would have to be able
to eat the zombies then and then you
would have predator prey predator prey
interactive and I wonder that would
create a more complex you know you know
you know sometimes when you try things
like that you regret it later um I see
that's an even better idea yeah I mean
maybe maybe it would work i don't know
uh but there is some there is some risk
involved in creating super zombies i
think the other thing is that zombies
have an evolutionary avoidance of eating
each other that's one of the things and
so if you're going to come up with a
super zombie it might be difficult to do
because that's to their evolutionary
advantage not to eat each other which is
which is in fact the reason that these
viruses that infect them don't allow
them to do so that's my understanding of
the technical questions yes yes yeah
yeah other questions or comments yeah so
people who don't ask out who this
they're all gone now actually it's very
sad but they're they're mostly gone yeah
no it's uh it's yes yes yes that's right
no that's that's that's the hope is that
people will take this to heart in and
learn calculus that they'll be safe in a
situation like this yeah there's some
interesting questions actually they come
up here's one that somebody asked me
when I gave this talk a couple of weeks
ago actually and I think it's an
interesting question so we know what
happens when you take a circle and you
ride in a circle and the zombies heading
straight for you and we know what the
path is a zombie does it it moves in on
that perfect circle limit cycle what if
you're on an ellipse just change it a
little bit okay so instead of being on a
struggle you're on your lips you sort of
squashed it down a little bit you're
going around the ellipse the hard part
is it's even hard to figure out what the
parameterization of an ellipsis if
you're going at a constant speed that's
not so easy to even figure out but let's
say you're doing that so going on a
constant speed you're on your bike but
you're riding in an ellipse what path
does the zombie take is there even a
limit cycle I don't even know the answer
to that quite honestly it's not even
clear that there is a limit cycle and if
there is what is that limit cycle what
does it look like and it's kind of
interesting because it you know when you
play around with it you can see that it
does some very weird things and so
there's a lot of kind of questions like
that that nobody's ever thought about I
don't think as far as I know so you know
the mathematics of zombie pursuit it's a
whole new field yeah yeah kind of a high
level question but a you some of the
Romans you made Sofia the mat gene by
Dean Devlin I think you were to book
about the idea that's Method thanks RNA
or in the case of the dog that would go
catch the ball and so I know there's
been a lot of research about this and
some people been talking about whether
the idea of actually we're actually
doing those equations in her head Dave
Lee or just something that we've
actually evolved whatever that actually
does it but I'm in the case of your
example of the zombies why they move in
straight lines which makes all this
possible what what part of that brain do
you think they'd actually be a thing
that's actually destroyed that prevents
them like that you go for the mammalian
to the reptile brain yeah the dog has a
mammal brain so it's able actually do
that well I mean it's really interesting
because although it's true that Elvis is
smart enough the Elvis is a really smart
dog
should say all this was a really smart
dog elvis passed away last summer was
very sad but Elvis all this was a really
smart dog and dogs when they chased a
rabbit do not try to cut off the rabbit
they always head for straight where the
rabbit is in fact so in fact the vast
majority of dogs don't know that they
should try to cut off and you know it's
trickier with a rabbit I guess because
if you head to where the rabbit is going
to be the rabbit often goes the other
direction rabbits smart enough to then
head into separate directions of the
rabbits not going in a straight line
path but dogs tend to head for where the
animal is in most animals when they're
hunting will do that they won't cut off
the animal they will head for where the
animal is at that particular instant
velociraptors the cycle yeah yeah yeah
so can math provide hope for a professor
that's slower than the professor that
actually made it to us to the center cuz
if summaries are just generally faster
than yes yeah so I certainly one of the
things that we talk about in the book it
is the fact that if you think of the
various speeds that people have as a
bell curve as a normal distribution that
there are certain ones this is one of
the characters argues that we shouldn't
try to help these people who are down at
this end of the bell curve because they
don't have a chance that if you're if
you're moving slower than the zombie
then you're in trouble and and I think
that's true i don't know like there's no
curve that you can create that will
protect you if you are slower than the
zombie right ventually the zombie will
catch you so so you're kind of stuck in
especially because if the zombies
heading straight for you if the zombie
was doing something else you might be
able to figure out something like
supposed to zombie was always heading
for where you were you could maybe turn
around and go the opposite direction
before their zombie realized that you
could sort of make it longer for it to
actually yeah yeah but but in general no
no solution for that I'm afraid that
group mostly gone by now unfortunately
yeah yeah no that's true
okay um one of them is just do you know
the history of the word zombie ah i
don't i don't know the history of the
words on me it's very interesting
because i've gotten a little bit of flak
because i picked a particular model for
zombies which is not necessarily the
standard model you know the standard
model is they are the walking dead and
they don't need sustenance and they
essentially live forever until their
bodies decay away and and I needed this
model because I wanted to be able to do
predator-prey models and I wanted to be
able to have them starving to death and
so I needed for my equations to be able
to work I needed this particular model
but some some zombie a fishy and O's are
very unhappy about that so I obviously
am NOT as knowledgeable about zombies as
some of the other people who are out
there who take it take it very seriously
as it turns out yeah yeah the other
question was around and since we're
having a little argument around he says
when I'm under attack by zombie how will
I have time to stop and make these
calculations tool that will help me
figure it out on the run and so I
suggested a study ahead study up now I
think I think somebody's got to create
an app right yeah somebody's gotta quite
an app that's to protect yourself I'm
not going to remember unless I'm
constantly doing it it's just not
practical to practice it every day do
you have any suggestions for what to do
when the apocalypse hip hits other than
studying calculus books uh well I mean
obviously my recommendation is studying
calculus right and if you can keep
yourself alive long enough while you're
studying calculus it will be to your
advantage definitely but but beyond that
I mean you know you know there are
various things that people saying for
instance they say move into the second
floor of your house and then destroy the
staircase okay and I think that's true
cuz zombies can't climb where else in
the book actually that I have the
characters actually move up to Canada
because it turns out that cold
temperature causes the zombies to
hibernate because they did devolve into
this early revolutionary state and then
that allows me to do newton's law of
cooling of course I manipulate things to
do the things I want to do and what they
do is they move up to Canada and they
build tree houses and they live in tree
houses up in Canada where the zombies
can't get Emma where they can pull up
the rope ladder and and at night they're
safe and so yeah so little things like
that I think
that you have to use to your advantage
yeah yes it's a coincidence that you
mentioned a reptile brain I mean that
that's sorted scientifically not
accurate but it's a widely read book
among trial lawyers that's that right
yeah it's called a reptile ah is that
you want to pick a jury and then make
your your trial arguments based on the
fact that you're appealing to the
rem-pod the alleged reptile portion
brain Oh interested and you use it just
the way you stated is very similar
language yeah yeah true it's not true at
all that there is an underlying earlier
say I still believe I mean you can tell
me that I'm wrong but I still believe
that we did of all from animals of a
much different type and there's probably
some portions of our brain that came
from that right you know I've always
loved that idea but you don't you know I
get no I think you know I mean right i
mean weird i'm shocked by how similar my
thought processes are to my dogs you
know i'm shocked by that i'm shocked by
how smart my dog is and how the
relationship that we have and the fact
that we can have all that and i am
convinced that that's because we evolved
from similar animals and and so my guess
is that that there really is some stuff
that's left over from from some point
that formed the basis of what became
human although it might not be a reptile
necessarily but trial lawyers is i can
consult i'll make a fortune yeah it'd be
great yeah thank you okay thank you
thanks for coming everybody thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
