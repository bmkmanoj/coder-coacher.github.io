think of all the ways we interact with
technology in a given day over breakfast
I check my calendar launch the weather
app to scan the day's forecast another
to check traffic updates and finally a
force that confirm the status of my
flight look at all this stuff that I've
just taken in all before leaving the
house and to top it off I'm out of milk
but wouldn't it be great if technology
could take care of all this for me by
now you've heard about the next version
of Windows Phone we want to take a
minute to show you how Bing is enabling
a new class of experiences like Cortana
designed to make your life easier a team
of computer scientists across a range of
disciplines developed the components
that make up the Bing platform building
on bings massive index platform
incorporates advanced machine learning
speech recognition entity understanding
and stream processing that makes sense
of trillions of pieces of information
about the real world instead of you
having to monitor the fifty thousand
flights in the air today or the seventy
thousand cars on the interstate blocking
your commute the Bing platform does it
for you looks like a one example of how
these pieces come together Cortana
remind me to buy milk when I leave the
office tonight when I talk my voice is
sent to the Bing platform or speech
recognition technology turns what I've
said into text and employs natural
language processing to better understand
what I mean because I previously confirm
with the system my office address it
recognizes what i mean by office my
reminder is then passed to a system
which manages data streams by data
streams that could be anything from the
status of my flight the breaking news
from my favorite sports team too in this
case my location so when I leave the
office it knows to tell Cortana to
remind me to buy milk making sure I have
milk in my cereal it's just one example
of how the Bing platform makes my life
easier check out windows phone and bing
com soon to experience how we are making
technology increasingly personal helpful
and
