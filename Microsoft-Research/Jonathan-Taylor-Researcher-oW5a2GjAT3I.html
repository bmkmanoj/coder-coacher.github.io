I'm in this large group called the
machine learning in perception group and
this group's sort of grand goal is to
understand large data sets and or data
in general try to pick out patterns in
data try to pick out structure and model
that structure so that it can be used in
higher level applications so one thing
we might do is try to fit a model so
that we can make predictions about
something that's going to happen in the
future or we could try to take image
data which is something coming through a
camera this is what I do and try to fit
a three-dimensional model to it so that
we understand what's happening in the
world my role has been developing since
I was an intern and basically through my
postdoc has been a very common theme
that I've been working on estimating
human body shape and inferring human
body motion from image data so a color
RGB image or a depth image coming from
the Kinect right but recently we've been
really focused on hand post estimation
or hand tracking and so essentially we
have this image from the Kinect and
we're trying to infer by all the joint
angles in the hand so i think my
proudest achievement here is actually
creating a hand tracker that were not
afraid to let other people use right so
our hand tracker works real time and
we've let other people use it when I
started my first internship I had no
idea that I was going to arrive for a
second internship and I had no idea I
was going to go on to a postdoc but that
first invitation where Microsoft reached
out to me and gave me this opportunity
implanted this sort of the sort of
entirely new stream of research so I
became excited about and I met the
people here and they're very focused on
helping me develop that idea and they
were encouraging about me coming back
for a second internship and the post dog
and then is turned into this
each year microsoft research house
of influential speakers from around the
world including leading scientists
renowned experts in technology book
authors and leading academics and makes
videos of these lectures freely
available
