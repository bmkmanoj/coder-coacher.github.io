Krishna's we are here some almost 45
years ago he wrote the Bible on
branching processes that even though
there's a lot of further work on the
topic it still looks a state-of-the-art
today in many many results were just
optimal so there's nothing better to do
and yet his continued and had lots of
impact on the area later and
particularly he tell us something about
branching processes today this thank you
thank you all for asking me to speak
here this is really nice I want to talk
about the problem or called coalescence
and and I will talk about coalescence in
branching trees so here is a very simple
version of the problem
take a binary tree so you a rooted
binary tree that is so you start with
one vertex at time 0 splits into exactly
two vertices and that in turn splits
into two and so on so you notice that at
level 1 at level 0 there is exactly one
vertex at level 1 there are 2 and at
level two there are 4 2 squared and so
on and you can guess that at level n
there's going to be 2 to the N vertices
so now supposing so supposing you choose
2 vertices from level n by what is known
as simple random sampling without
replacement which means there are 2 to
the N
where this is available there are
totally and choose two pairs that you
can choose and you choose one of those
pairs with equal probability
supposing you choose say two vertices
and now you trace their lines back until
they meet call that like all the
generation where they the lines meet
except in so picked so then trace their
lines
back their lines back in time till they
meet say at Generation X at level XM
clearly they will meet all three they
will meet at the origin but they could
be much before that so the question is
what is the xn is going to be a random
variable the tree itself is
deterministic but I've injected
randomness by my sampling procedure so
the question that we want to ask is what
is the distribution of xn 1 and 2 what
happens to this as n goes to infinity
so these are two questions that we want
to ask and this is actually very easy to
answer in the following sense you notice
that the following probability
calculation is very easy if xn is going
to be anywhere from 0 1 2 3 up to n
minus 1 I'm looking at the interaction
so the meeting place must be at least n
minus 1 all the way down to 0 but if I
wanted to be less than K then at level K
I have 2 to the N vertices each of these
individuals have a time n minus K left
to them so they would have 2 to the N
minus K descendants by time N so if I
want xn to be less than K that event
happens with I have 2 to the power K
where this is and I choose two of these
guys and then look at their descendants
and then I want to choose one from each
of these things so that are 2 to the N
minus K times 2 to the N minus K so
these are the number of favorable ways
of producing a xn less than K divided by
the total number of choices which is 2 n
choose 2 so this is the exact
probability for k equal to 1 2 all the
way up to n now you can choose this is
it this is indeed equal to 2 to the K
times 2 to the K minus 1 over 2 times 2
to the N minus K 2 to the N minus K and
the same to say denominator is going to
be 2 to the n times 2 to the n minus 1
over 2 and that 2 will cancel with the
numerator 1 and this is so xn less than
crazy so xn is less than King to first
choose the common level K there are 2 to
the K vertices and I choose 2 of those
guys and I look at the number of this
and then supply at time n minus
a time future time in which is n minus K
so that's what this calculation but this
is this is equal to I can pull out the 2
to the K from here so it is 1 minus 2 to
the minus K and then pull out the 2 to
the N from here which is 1 minus 4 to
the minus N and then I have 2 to the K
times towards the gate two to the 2k 2
to the 2 K cancer through the 2 n 2 to
the 2 n all of that cancels so this is
the exact probability and this converges
as n goes to infinity to 1 minus 2 to
the minus K so we have shown that X sub
K X sub n has an exact distribution
which is approximately geometric and in
the limit it is a geometric random
variable
now clearly what we did for the case of
binary tree can be done for any binary
tree where or emery tree or it's at
least deterministic well since I'm I
worked in branching processes as he said
for a long time so a natural question is
what happens if the tree is not
deterministic it's a purely random tree
so the question that we want to ask is
so this is what if the tree that you
have the rooted tree that you have is
yeah a galton-watson or repel word or to
be honest with Australians bgw VP Vienna
make galton-watson branching process and
it is a tree now you remember how that
is generated so you are given the
following a probability distribution pj
j grid not equal to 0 pj non-negative
and then summation PJ equal to 1 then
you generate so this is one to generate
aw indexed family of random variables
jeg written or equal to 1 n equal to 0 1
to infinity of iid random variables with
distribution PDA
then you define the population size in
the n plus first generation to be the
number of children born to the
individuals in the answer generation so
if there are certain individuals in the
NT generation each one of them produces
children according to this process and
then C and J is the number of children
born to the jth parent in the inter
generation and this works if return is
positive if Zedan is 0 the population is
already gone there is nobody to produce
anything so it'll stay at 0 oh sorry so
0 is what is called an absorbing barrier
once you hit 0 you're stuck at 0
otherwise you can go this so then the
following result this is a well-known
theorem goes back to Galton himself and
then whatever and Watson who produced
the wrong solution is that the
probability there n equal to 0 for some
N greater than or equal to 1 conditioned
on Z not equal to 1 is equal to 1 if the
mean number of children produced per
parent is less than or equal to 1 and
it's strictly less than 1 if this M is
greater than 1 so that's a very
well-known result namely the mean number
of children produced has a role to play
in the tree surviving for indefinite
time or terminating in a finite time so
there are many more results and here is
a classification M is the mean the
quantity there M greater than 1 is
called 1 sorry 1 less than M
the infinity that's called supercritical
mm equal to one is called critical and M
less than one is called subcritical and
I'm going to discuss one more case which
is not been discussed in my book on or
any other book for the model it's called
M equal to infinity case explosive case
I will talk about that as well alright
so now let me describe the results for
these cases the visuals we all studied
in the literature first so if you take a
super critical branching process and let
us assume that there is no extinction it
is P naught is 0
so here is the first result that we can
state so theorem 1 let P naught be 0 no
extinction and let the mean number of
children born to one parent is be finite
so then well I'm picking only two
individuals at random from the
intergeneration the edge generation is
not going to be dead it's going to be
growing very rapidly then the
probability I'm going to call the
coalescence time accent - that's a
generation number and these two randomly
chosen individuals meet their lines meet
X n 2 is less than K conditioned on the
tree itself so in other words remember
there are two sources of randomness the
tree itself is randomly generated and
then I'm injecting randomness by
sampling but suppose the tree is
generated in the next room and you bring
the tree here and then you do the
sampling on the vertices that is what
this conditioning means given the tree
you look at this quantity limit as n
goes to infinity
of this exists and is a function of K
and T the tree for K grid k equal to 1
to infinity exist and what is more for
almost all trees this is a proper
distribution and PI K of T converges to
1 as K goes to infinity so in particular
the limit distribution exists for extent
2 it's going to depend on the tree and
of course by the bounded convergence
theorem the unconditional average also
exists so this implies in turn that the
probability that xn 2 is less than K
without the tree averaging over all tree
also exists because this is bounded by 1
and selecting expected values ok will
converge to PI K which is equal to
expected value PI K of T now so this is
theorem what when M is finite but
greater than 1 so this is the super
critical case and if I have time I will
indicate the proof for you then let's
look at the critical case here is a
problem in the critical case we know
that the tree is going to die out with
probability 1 but then I want to do some
sampling so I'm a mathematician so I
will assume that the tree is not dead
so I'm conditioning on an event where
the event probability is actually going
down to 0 I'm not the first one to do
this cosmoGirl have already did this
Cole MacGrath did this way back in the
late or early forties so in the critical
case is this is m equal to 1 and of
course m equal to 1 is a possibility
with P 1
equal to one but that's a purely
deterministic tree everybody produce is
exactly one child and we want to rule
that out if you rule it out and say
let's assume P 1 is less than 1 if P 1
is 1 there is no extinction the same
everybody produces one challenge so on
so forth ok in this case what is your
intuition xn 2 well we have two
condition on the fact that at time n the
population is not extinct number one
number two it has at least two
individuals well fortunately for us kool
Moe bra had proved a very beautiful
result long ago and that is a following
it requires the finite second movement
hypothesis so let me quote that yourself
for you so M equal to 1 and then P
naught P 1 is less than 1 and supposing
you assume that the finite second moment
exists so assume all of these three
conditions it's a given if all this
conditions hold
then the survival probability is going
to die like 1 over N and the population
size is going to be outdoor and then 1
the probability Zn is positive that is
the process is not extinct we know that
that probability has to go to 0 but n
times that converges to Sigma square
over 2 as n goes to infinity this is
something that cosmoGirl had established
number one number two the probability
that Z n over n is less than X
conditioned on on extinction if the
process is not extinct how big is the
population roughly speaking of water n
which is distinctly different from the
supercritical case where the population
explodes
geometry great it turns out that this
converges to 1 minus e to the minus 2
over Sigma squared X for every any X
positive so he proved this result so
yeah I see you was a student it was not
there is also a sub critical to self do
which is attributed to your lung so we
did some research and then eventually we
attributed to Kolmogorov but you are
right this the name of well again there
are two outlooks so we have to be I am
your gloom in the am Wroclaw which you
know which one you know better so I just
thought I'll call mahogany students so
then it turns out that the in the in the
critical there is one more result that
we need which was not proved by :
overall but which I proved just a few
couple of years or a few years ago and
that is the following here is x 0 and
here is timing supposing at time n the
population is not extinct
conditioned on the event that's an event
of some very small probability then go
to level K the population is not extinct
by time and therefore it cannot be
extinct at like 10 K but then there are
large number of individuals at that time
say ZK and look at the lines initiated
by each one of them each one of them has
a certain number of individuals left but
some of the lines could be dead some of
the lines of not dead so now look at the
following process V sub n is going to be
you look at Z n minus K super K comma I
divided by n minus K times the indicator
function of Z n minus K I Super K
positive
for all those four I equal to 1 to Z
circuit in other words I go to level K
there are ZK individuals each of them
initiates a line of descent and then
look at what happens to their population
size in each one of them divide that by
n minus K and look at only those lines
for which the population is not extinct
by timing so now this is a collection of
points on the non negative half line it
has a random collection of points so
it's what is called a point process
question what is happening to this point
process and I showed that this point
process so this is bla bla bla you can
put my name on it if you like 3v and
conditioned on Z N greater than or equal
to 2 or Z and not equal to 0 it hurts
but enough to this is a point process so
you have to go to the space of point
processes and talk about V convergence
in the space of point processes you can
use the laplace functional blah blah
blah and so on so yeah that's a good
point K has to go to infinity and n has
to go to infinity so so let me write it
down let K and n go to infinity K go to
infinity such that K over N goes to u
where u is between 0 &amp;amp; 1 so it has to be
roughly of the same order as n ok
supposing that happens then so this is
the third result then we and conditioned
on the unknown being nonzero converges
in distribution to a random point
process where the number of individual
number of Bob so it's going to converge
to remember there is this is a
non-negative quantity a whole bunch of
non-negative quantities and this will
converge to the following is going to
converge to it
one so either to either say a random
variable V where the haters are going to
be gull exponential distributed and V is
going to have a certain well-defined
distribution coming from here so let me
write down that precise result I because
this is very useful to sell that it
comes up in another context also in it's
not in this paper
it converges to a point process a
Terminator 2 ETA n sub u where the eight
eyes are independent random variables
exclusive distributed n sub view is
geometric with parameter u so you
generate a sequence of iid Gaussian
expression random variables and then
generated independent geometric random
variable with parameter you call the den
sub you then go fix only these random
variables so this is going to be a
random point process on the non-negative
offline that's what this will converge
to so it's not easy to prove that result
but it requires the Laplace functional
and then this book of this Norwegian
mathematician who's at Auburn what is
his name I keep forgetting I will give
the reference set of kallenberg
kallenberg has a has a very nice method
called laplace function method to prove
this so you have to use that so the here
xn 2 so in the in this case you look at
xn to xn 2 is the conditioned or non
extinction the population is not extinct
now Excel to you to take two individuals
at random in the intergeneration trace
their lines back and see when they meet
and the question is what is happening to
xn 2 now notice in the super critical
case xn 2 is way back in time here it is
not way back in time xn 2 is roughly of
the order n it's less than u converges
to some function H of U
and this H of you age of zero plus is
one H of one minus is one H is
absolutely continuous on 0 1 so there is
a proper distribution function such that
xn 2 over N converges to that
well xn 2 over acceptor has to be
between 0 &amp;amp; 1 so in other words the
random variable that it goes to it is in
the open interval 0 to 1 sorry
not one of course thank you this is 0
plus is 0 I meant so the H is a
distribution that is sitting on the open
interval 0 to 1 is an honesty
distribution it is a non-trivial
distribution so the coalescence takes
place somewhere in the in the middle of
the day interval
it's neither close to the present nor
close to the will the past yes I can
write don't but well you asked for it so
I'll write it down
if you've ever liked complicated
thinking it is going to involve this
random verbs H of U is going to be equal
to 1 minus expectation of fee of your
new you know again you remember is going
to be a geometric random variable with
parameter U and then so our fee of J is
going to involve expectation of
summation 1 to J either I squared over
summation 1 to J enter I whole square
well yet I 1 802 8 a J or iid
exponential one random variables so the
the formula for H is not very simple
it's a little bit it comes from this
point process idea now notice that this
quantity this is an interesting problem
in itself if you take iid random
variables X ibi ID so there's a problem
we will use a different pin that there
is
- all right okay so I have the cover
here so here is a interesting problem
with xib iid random variables say
positive random variables then if you
look at 1 to nxi square the numerator
denominator is 1 to n X a quantity
squared the behavior of this sequence
was studied by number of people in Bell
Labs for example long ago and notice
that if the mean of if the random
variables of a finite second moment the
numerator is going to be like n the
denominator is going to be like N
squared so this whole thing will go to 0
but if x i's are have heavy tails if X
is suppose in the domain of attraction
of a stable of water all for less than 1
then these two guys are going to be
roughly the same order of magnitude and
so they will not go to 0 but that kind
of a thing comes up here but then here
there's no problem because yet our eyes
are going to be iid yet I are IID
exponential one random variables so
everything is going to be okay here this
is going to be dying at the most at the
rate like 1 over J and that's enough to
make this thing proper so in the super
critical case corazon 6 plus way back in
time in the critical case coalescence
take place neither close to the event in
the the infinite past or the present
somewhere in the middle and it turns out
that the in the so called sub critical
case sub critical case is the following
where M is less than 1 so theorem 3 sub
critical
here M is less than one remember what M
is M is the mean number of children
produced but per parent and if it is
less than one the population is dies out
so the question is again you of the
condition so it turns out so that is M
less than one so theorem then the
probability X n - n - X + 2 is less than
K conditioned on certain positive so the
cordyceps is very close to the present
it is not very back in time remember the
in the sub critical case the number of
individuals that live at time n is going
to be a pair proper going to a proper
random variable that will that's so this
converges to PI K and for every K 1 less
than or equal to K less than infinity
and then PI K goes to 1 as K goes to
infinity so to summarize we have the
following situation so far if the mean
is greater than 1 and the publish is not
extinct Collison is going to be way back
in time if the mean is 1 and the
population is not extinct then the
coalescence is going to be very cool
somewhere in the middle so roughly of
the order n times u where u is somewhere
between 0 &amp;amp; 1
and if it is M is less than 1 the
coalescence is going to be very close to
the percent so now I'm going to consider
one more case and that is the explosive
case and then I would like to apply
these arguments to what are called
branching random walks so explosive case
explosive cases when M is infinity when
each person produces number of children
random number of children whose mean is
infinity but then it turns out that I
need one more hypothesis the probability
so I this is in addition I have to
assumed that summation
pjj greater than X this is the so called
tail probability and it's going to go to
0 as X goes to infinity but I wanted to
go to 0 reasonably slowly is is equal to
X to the power minus alpha times a
slowly varying function that means what
L of C X over L of X goes to 1 as X goes
to infinity for every zero less than C
less than infinity like log X would be
slowly varying but any power of X will
not be slowly varying square root of x
will not be slowly varying as X goes to
infinity and with alpha between 0 &amp;amp; 1
so that's my hypothesis about the
distribution of PJ if this is so then 1
the probability that the coalescence now
and again I'm assuming P naught is 0 so
they there is no extinction at all
possible and in this case again the
coalescence is very close to the present
xn less than K converges to Pike in as K
goes to infinity in other words in the
rapidly growing population Collison's
takes place very close to the present in
reasonably growing population Collison
Sigma is very close to the beginning in
a critical case it's somewhere in the
middle in the subcritical case also as
close to the beginning now in the
explosive case something interesting
happens also this is so here is a Seidel
result if this is due to PL Davis danish
dutch mathematician and then david gray
an english mathematician and that's the
following so assume M is infinity
and PJ belongs to the domain of
attraction of a stable law of war golfer
namely this condition this is a
necessary and sufficient condition for a
repeater to be in the domain of
attraction of a stable law proved by
fellow if this is the case then you take
two individuals have them produce
branching independently of each other
then one of them will wipe out the other
so this as follows namely if you look at
the population size at the n plus first
generation that is equal to summation j
and j j equal to 1 to is this event the
population is made up of the individuals
produced by the people in the end
generation now these random variables
are all independent identically
distributed conditionally independent of
ZN so it divided by 1 over z n to the
power 1 over alpha and multiplied by z n
to the power 1 over alpha so take logs
on both sides log ZN plus 1 is called
this quantity say we sub n for the
moment is equal to log BN plus 1 over
alpha log z n so that in turn suggests
that alpha to the power
oops again keep it outside over to the
power n plus 1 times log Zn will be
equal to alpha to the power n plus 1
times log BN plus alpha to the power n
Times log ZN ZN plus 1 here and look
here and i can go down the line and then
it'll it essentially so the form alpha
to the j plus 1 log b j j equal to 0 to
n so this would suggest remember alpha
is less than 1
all 4 to the j says is a geometric
sequence summation alpha to the j
converges v j's are identically well
will converge in distribution to
something so it takes some more work to
show that this quantity converges and if
that is so so this is a theorem now let
me write down as a theorem and the here
is an indication
the proof but it's not really approved
yet so theorem let PJ let M be equal to
infinity and summation pj j greater than
x be asymptotically x to the power minus
alpha times L of X L slowly varying at
infinity alpha between 0 &amp;amp; 1
if that is the case then all 4 to the
power n Times log Zn converges to a
random variable say you with probability
1 and the probability that you equal to
0 is 0 U is a continuous random variable
which says basically if you think like
you know in 2d bases alpha to the N
times logs at n is approximately like
you if that is the case log Z n is
approximately like 1 over alpha to the
power n times u alpha is less than 1 1
over alpha is bigger than 1 call it Rho
equal to Rho to the power n times u if
that is the case the population size ZN
is like e to the U times Rho to the N
that means the population grows
unlike the Malthusian rate of growth it
is super exponential and the pop well we
know the optimum distribution has
doesn't have a finite mean so this is
not that much of a surprise but here is
the interesting thing
supposing you start one line of descent
and I start one line of descent both of
the same distributions then zenon super
1 is going to be like e to the U 1 times
Rho to the power n Z and super 2 is
going to be like e to the u 2 times
super it rho to the power u 1 and has a
continuous distribution
so u 1 cannot be equal to u 2 which
means if i were to take the ratio of
these two guys is going to be u 1 minus
u 2 times Rho to the power n later go to
plus infinity or go to 0 so 1 will wipe
out the other so
which may explain the fact why the
coalescence is very close as a present
if you take two individuals very likely
they are coming from the you know same
ancestor that sort of proof that's an
economist proof not a mathematicians
proof but that's roughly so now so I've
described some basic results for what's
called coalescence coalescence in this
case is the problem of generations that
are meeting okay after some time now I
want to give an application of some of
this so you can see where to go any
number of directions you can think about
what happens to a continuous time
process what happens to to type
branching processes multi-day branching
processes and so on lots of things so if
you have good students put them on but I
wanted to go in a slightly different
direction and I want to talk of what's
called branching random walks ah this is
the problem I said I kept it outside
for too long I keep alright okay
branching random walks
so branching renta what is a branching
random walk well it's a branching
process plus a random walk in post on it
so you start with an ancestor at time
zero and then this ancestor has a random
number of children and this answer is
located at some site X X naught is a
location of this ancestor
but this children essentially migrate
from where the parent stays and go to a
new place so they go to X naught plus X
1 1 X naught plus X 1 2 and then X
naught plus X 1 C 1 the number of
children born to this parent ok and then
the children of these children do the
same thing they migrate from where the
parent lives to a new place and so on
so I if you look at Zeta n is the actual
position of all the individuals in the
intergeneration x + 1 xn to xn z n so
this is the position the point process
generated by the positions of the
certain individuals in the nth
generation question what is going to
happen to this in particular we know
well this question makes sense only with
let's assume that P naught is 0 and 1 is
less than M less than infinity for the
moment consider that case and now what
will happen to this point process as n
goes to infinity there is two source of
randomness the tree itself is random and
then the jumping is also random so we
need to make some assumptions about the
jump distribution and I already
mentioned my assumptions about the tree
structure so let P not be 0 let X 1 1 X
1 2 X 1 3 1 this random vector well
supposing I make a simple assumption
that they are all identically
distributed with mean 0 and then finite
variance so that's not such as well
there's essentially other ways you learn
to subtract of the mean and then
expectation of X 1 1 square equal to
Sigma squared is finite so now the
question is what is going to happen to
the empirical distribution what is the
distribution that I'm looking at 1 over
N summation indicator function of X and
I less than or equal to X I equal to 1
to Z N or 1 over that's what I'm looking
at the proportion of individuals out to
the left of X but I roughly know well ok
so here is the idea of analyzing this
you have a large number of individuals
located all over the place and you want
to know what is going to happen to the
empirical distribution of the point is
it on the on the rail line or whatever
space that you are in now notice if I
pick two individuals at random from this
collection and trace their lines back
they're going to make way back in time
which means that they have lot of time
to evolve independently that means that
positions are going to be like an
ordinary random walk and they're
independent as well and therefore you
would look at the empirical distribution
namely this particular quantity so this
is a theorem under this hypothesis if
you look at number of individuals which
are who are to the left of say Sigma
times square root of Y sorry Sigma times
y times square root of n divided by the
total number of individuals this is the
total number of individuals this is the
proportion of individuals whose children
or the number in in the in generation
who are located to the left of Sigma
times y times call it again not
surprisingly this will converge to the
normal standard normal distribution
function in problem in probability as
well as in mean square and the reason
for this is that if I take two
individuals at random and trace that
lines back they're going to meet way
back in time so essentially their lines
are any independently developed well
yeah that's a little bit harder but yeah
it's almost surely so so this is one or
something and now you can also there are
some variations of this if you don't
want to assume finite second moment but
if you they assume that these
displacements are in the domain of
attraction of a stable law there will be
a corresponding version of that but I
will not go into that one so I will one
last rest of that I want to state is
that there is in what happens in the
explosive case
so again take the branching around the
walk peanut is 0 M is infinity and
summation PJ belongs to the domain of
attraction of a stable of water alpha in
this case notice what is happening if we
take two individuals at random from this
collection then their lines of descent
are going to be meet much sooner very
close to the present so they have a lot
of portion that are common and then
there's a small portion which is not
common and that could get wiped out by
the denominator so what happens is this
in this case this is a theorem as you
again the text expectation of X 1 1 is 0
expectation of X 1 1 square is equal to
Sigma square is finite then if you look
at the number of individuals to the left
of Sigma Y times square root of N and
divide that by NZ n consider this
stochastic process why I said indexed by
the parameter Y over the whole real line
for each fixed Y this converges to Y a
random variable so this is converging
time I want to claim this Delta Y minus
infinity less than oil is an infinity
where Delta Y is going to be the
indicator function of a standard normal
random variable does not equal to Y
where n is the N 0
and then here I have to deliberately
left or in what sense do I mean by this
well this is this is a family of random
variables indexed by minus infinity to
plus infinity of Y this converges to
this for every finite collection y 1 y 2
YK but then these processes live in the
scorer heart space minus infinity plus
infinity so it would be nice to prove
that this converges to take place in
this cohort topology as well but
fundamental convergence plus tightness
is required I have not been able to
prove tightness yet but I've been able
to prove the fundamental converges so
this converges in distribution to this
Delta Y where Delta wise you go to the
next room
generate the standard normal random
variable bring it here and then
construct the trajectory notice that if
I give you the value n the trajectory is
going to be 0 for a long time and then
jump up and then you're going to stay at
1 so I have proved this result there
namely for finite damp finite number of
coordinates why wouldn't wait to wake in
the convergence in distribution takes
place but I would like to prove that
this is tight as well
say I have not been able to prove yeah
so did you remember the coalescence
explains very close to the present that
means the DDT yeah so this is reproduce
to the coalescence happen close to the
present that means that much of the
trajectories how much of the things have
a lot of things in common only the last
bit is going to be different
all right so let me see what time do I
have 420 I'm supposed to stop now right
yeah well okay so let me what is the
original paper right here then there is
there are many many directions you can
go to for example one direction would be
what happens in the to type case of the
multi type case in the multi type case
you've choose to two individuals at
random turn and public and they enter
level they could belong to two different
types and their ancestor could be an 8
another type what would happen to these
things and then you can talk about what
if individuals live a random length of
time in other words continuous time
branching processes and then there is a
process that my my another are three of
my brother's son he is a probability as
well and also in the Indian sort of
Indian Statistical Institute in
Bangalore and when Shrikant Iyer
we worked on it and we considered the
following problem you have a branching
process and each individual has a
certain random length of life and during
their lifetime they move accordingly a
Markov process so this is a branching
random walk but branching Markov process
as it were and then again you look at
the distribution of the point process
generated and there are some results and
there we I did that paper was written
long before I did this work on
coalescence so we have Woodleigh results
with a finite mean but the infinite mean
case is open I mean a number of forms
are open I have listed a whole bunch of
open problems in that paper that I wrote
for the conference in Spain about six
months ago so I can describe them to you
but there I will stop
yes I know how to do that but this on
your webpage yeah my son was able to
find all of them there you know I told
him I think he did something and then
out sort of all these papers but I don't
know how to do them myself but he may do
you have copies of all my papers of no
not yet you can download them so yeah
actually in the last page of this there
are there's references and I can at
least write down the references so you
can take a look at by the way there's a
beautiful law paper by legal on it was
the extension theory and random trees
where they also talk about the
coalescence problem and that appeared in
this statistics or stochastic process
and application and there's another
paper by Adrian Lambert coalescence
times for branching processes annals of
up read probability and then Kersting
Schwinns Burke and Wacoal Binger the
evolving bethe Collison in an electronic
general probability and then there's a
bunch of papers of mine so the
references are here all right ok ok
