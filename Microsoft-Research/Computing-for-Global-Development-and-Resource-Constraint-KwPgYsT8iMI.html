hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
so my name is Ed cutrell I manage the
technology for emerging markets group at
microsoft research in india in bangalore
and what i wanted to do today was to
talk a little bit about the ways in
which computing and research are sort of
working toward issues and global
development and in particular amount
imagining the ways in which we can
design for constraint and resource
constraints of various sorts and i'll
talk to you a little bit about what that
means but the idea is to sort of start
looking at maybe not the people that are
living in Silicon Valley and in Seattle
and in Boston and London but trying to
look at actually the rest of most of
where people live and the ways in which
technology can be used effectively to
improve the quality of life in different
ways so just a little story about where
I'm base this is Microsoft Research in
india and you know there's a lot of
traditional computing kinds of research
on this list here but in particular I
want to call your attention to this one
here which is the most important one
because it's the biggest this is the
technology for emerging markets group
and this is this is the group that I
work with and the basic idea behind the
group this is to give you some
orientation about what we're going to be
talking about today is to try to
understand the different people that use
technology in developing communities
what do they want what do they need what
what are their desires and aspirations
then to take that understanding and
design systems that can effectively work
with them and contribute socio-economic
development and then finally to
collaborate with development
organizations with government with
Microsoft with academics with all kinds
of folks to scale the stuff that works
we're very multidisciplinary and a lot
of what we want to do and what's really
interesting about work in this space
is that it really takes advances and
understanding and research from lots of
different perspectives to make it work
effectively and you'll see some of that
in the talks that we're going to hear
today so without much further ado what I
want to do is introduce the three
speakers that we have today we have
Andrew cross he's a research program
manager at microsoft research in india
then we have a did this fresh set he's a
professor at iit delhi and then finally
elizabeth belling who is a professor at
university of california in san diego
what Santa Barbara it's an SB not SD in
it okay and so these three folks
actually taking a little bit different
perspectives on the way in which they've
approached some of these problems in
technology for resource constraint and
really looking at how IT can be used for
socio-economic development so Andrew
thanks Edie
I have to switch the sides oh and I
should say probably what we're going to
do is have each person talk for about 20
minutes and then we'll spend the last
half hour or so just chatting a little
bit so you can ask questions at that
point any of the individual speakers or
if you just got something that's burning
in your eyes you just really want to
talk about so great thank said so as he
said I mandram in the technology for
emerging markets group in India and this
talk will be a little bit of a departure
I think from some of the other talks and
then its technical nature or lack
thereof but I hopefully will kind of
argue that the kind of work that we do
you know it's still very intellectually
stimulating and interesting and the
problems require lots of creativity and
on-the-ground understanding and I think
that actually computer scientists and
engineers are uniquely positioned to
look at these problems because of how we
approach problem solving and breaking
things down the problems so I'll kind of
talk about some of our methods and two
projects in particular as we go through
so kind of how we do our work generally
this is just how we start a general
approach to the problem this is some of
our group visiting a local site
generally we go through NGOs or
government or other people on the ground
because they know the problem space much
better than we will at the beginning at
least for the technology experts and
they're sort of the domain experts and
well again what's interesting about this
this field is that you know you're not
designing for yourself at all in fact
you're designing for populations
extremely different than you a lot of
times when you're thinking about
innovating in different ways you're sort
of designing for yourself but what I
like but in a lot of ways this
population is very different you know
not many of us grew up on a dollar a day
perhaps or speak the language it doesn't
have an alphabet or are less than
literate so you know spending a lot of
time in the field is kind of how we
understand the population our market
research in a way and so oftentimes
we'll spend a lot of time there some of
our group members pinnix been extended
time in the field and sort of bring
these problems back to kind of the
research lab a little more different
environment where we maybe prototype
ideas think about different ways that we
can address the problems that we've come
up with three our field research and
then of course we take those back out
into the field and do some prototypes
with with our partners in the field we
do some research experiments and in the
best case of scenarios when things are
going well we kind of scale those out
once we've done some initial success
so throughout this this process that
we're kind of and i should say as ed
showed the different people in our group
this is more than just computer science
and engineers we have ethnic offers
sociologists linguists they're all kind
of working together in a very
interdisciplinary way to understand
these problems from different
perspectives and come up with some
ideally innovative solutions so one of
the themes that we continually see
working out in the field is that devices
are scarce and my devices i mean you
know a lot you know there's there are
mobile phone penetration is becoming
increasingly common even in very remote
places but these are again our dumb
phones or no not all the capabilities
that a lot of other phones have there
are not a lot of computers and when you
do it's one for maybe a hundred people
as opposed to individual competing
devices so special purpose devices are
scarce but we find is that other
resources are more plentiful like paper
which is just something that maybe is
not intuitive but there are other
resources that are extremely common in
these places and they're easily sourced
and easily replaced and paper is one of
them so again that the theme is a bit
different how can we use these existing
resources with some technological
innovations in the back end to replace
some of these special purpose devices so
11 problem space you might think of as
engaging students are engaging an
audience that any professor or teacher
or speaker will have faced at some point
then how do i kind of gauge the audience
right now I'm talking to you but how do
I get information back from you and keep
you engaged throughout I can tailor my
talk or my lecture based on what you
already know so one kind of example
special purpose device that's been used
in certain contexts is something called
clickers which if you haven't seen it's
basically a individual electronic device
where I can ask a multiple choice
question you can respond in one way and
I could have some feedback kind of the
pulse of the room these are a little bit
outdated now but you might have a
smartphone app that does the exact same
thing but again what it requires is that
everyone in the room has an active
electronic device that requires power
and personal you have to own one which
isn't always common and then other
things like battery changing and all
that and these have been shown in these
developed context where they have been
deployed to have education pedagogical
benefits to the classroom so these are
great devices but of course the downside
is a very expensive something like
thirty dollars a piece so it's not ideal
for most environments so again thinking
well we have paper what can you do with
paper well this is one of the projects
that we've worked on which I'll show is
actually you know the idea behind the
clickers how can I get
real-time feedback from you so something
that we developed is called cue cards is
basically this just paper with a machine
readable code on the front so it's
unique for every person in the audience
so every see every person here might
have a different card and I can ask the
same exact thing a multiple choice
question and you could respond by
rotating it in four different ways so
every person's card is unique so I know
exactly how you've responded I get the
same feedback I either have a webcam or
one single smartphone at the front of
the room scanning the audience so again
I can get your pulse on on a quick
question that I've asked in real time
but addressing the lower cost you all
you have is this paper here which if it
gets lost stolen torn you can just print
off another one fairly easily so it also
has some other interesting aspects one
it's anonymous other people don't know
how you responded so maybe you're more
comfortable answering and so we've
deployed this in various scenarios with
some with some schools here so another
domain is improving medication adherence
so I don't have to explain too much why
that's very important in some disease
states of course it's very important
with tuberculosis is the one I'll talk
about but one design that's come out in
and again certain context is these
electronic pill boxes which can do many
things first of all when you open them
there's a electronic pulse that sent
that basically says I've taken my pill
for the day you can also have reminders
that can glow a light to remind you to
take your medication all these sort of
other interventions to help you ensure
you take your medication and they's
again in these clinical trials have
shown demonstrated improved adherence
but of course again they come with a
cost these are like a hundred dollars a
piece so not exactly practical for a lot
of places around the world so the next
project I'll talk about in a little more
detail is another paper based
intervention that uses technology to
kind of replace this which is basically
a paper envelope which i'll also show
here so a lot of these medications come
in these blister strips and another
place is not so much in the US but in
europe in india's particular so we've
made these custom envelopes which again
is just a paper envelope that wraps the
medication so when a patient dispenses
the medication like in the bottom left
here the pills break through these
perforated flaps on the back of the
envelope which reveal a hidden number
and that number is not predictable to
patients before they've taken them their
pills and they can report that number to
us using a freak also again they do have
access most people get least access to a
simple dumb phone
so they can send that to us in this case
they're filling in the last four digits
with the four that they found under
their pills in this particular regimen
you take four pills so again they have
we have a real-time way of knowing that
they've taken their medication we can do
the exact same things send reminders
have other incentives or counseling
encouragement based on this real-time
information if a patient has taken their
pills but the only electronic they need
is the phone which they're already kind
of intrinsically motivated to have keep
charged keep topped up they use it for
other reasons so now we can do the same
kind of tracking that these special
purpose devices do at drastically lower
costs so I'll speak a little bit more
about this project and kind of where we
are with it and how we're we're scaling
that up so I mean adherence is a big
problem not just in emerging markets all
around the world patients either are
taking too many drugs or not the right
drugs they don't finish a course and
this has much a drastic consequences in
certain diseases obviously you always
want to take your medication to recover
and not have side effects from the drugs
but in TB which is a bacterial infection
if you start the course of treatment but
don't finish then you could develop
drug-resistant strains of disease so
right now we have very good drugs for
first-line tuberculosis they're low cost
and effective but for for other
extensively drug-resistant forms a
disease for new strains we don't have
drugs and for the more common ones it's
a much longer regiment involved
injections are much more expensive so as
everyone probably saw with the Ebola
outbreak recently that if some of these
drug-resistant strains kind of break out
especially in a dense population like
India you have a very real global threat
so beyond just feeling better we have a
real motivation to kind of prevent the
situation from happening so there's a
lot of reasons why people may not take
their medication it's not just a memory
thing people may forget there are side
effects but a lot of cases kind of an
educational thing that this is a
six-month course for tuberculosis and
you start to feel better after the first
month so a lot of people think well I
felt better after a month why do I need
to keep taking drugs so it's really a
long term conversation with people to
make sure they finish their full six
months but in response to this problem
of non-adherence the wh 0 and the indian
government have kind of embraced this
this model called directly observed
therapy dots which requires that
patients come into a center to take
their drugs the only way to get free
drugs is to visit the center across the
six months several three times a week
for the first two months once a week for
the last four which is a huge burden
obviously loss of work you're traveling
kind of
against that you're in a hospital out of
the day so but that's the only way that
they've really at least advocated how
you can prevent people from dropping off
the medication so kind of our solution
as I said we've got these custom
envelopes and this this different course
you take three a day so once you've
taken your pills you have this number
that you can find and you send the call
and again this is there's a lot of kind
of creativity and understanding for the
solution you have to understand the
population you know this might be non
literate population has to work in India
which has more languages than I could
even list it also has to work for
populations and remote areas so again
this is you're designing for a very
different situation and it's kind of
there's a built-in system around at
first we can send your reminder that can
be a message that can be an audio voice
we thought thought of other experiments
maybe that's your doctor's voice maybe
that's your mother's voice or your
spouse's voice just other ways to kind
of keep you invested then you send the
call then you know the higher level is
again the these treatment programs which
could be a hospital could be a
government-run program they're
monitoring these patients so what now
they know on a daily basis how many of
their patients have taken their drugs
and who hasn't so you can kind of
differentially manage different patients
if you're perfectly it here at every day
taking your drugs then we don't really
need to be so involved in your treatment
but if someone starts to drop off then
we can be alerted in real time and get
people on the ground to do more
counseling they can visit do what it
takes to kind of get you back on so
that's how they get a message in the end
of the day these are how many patients
haven't taken so so again at a higher
scale when you start you know that's 10
patients when you start to think about
an entire state an entire district you
have a much better analytics about
patients you know again paper is very
common to the current state of the art
is just to kind of take a mark every
time a patient takes a drug and
obviously that's subject to bad data you
don't don't really know what's happening
so maybe somebody's just checking
everything or everything is unreliable
so this is a more transparent way so
just where we are with this project in
particular we're now scaling up we've
got trials in least sites and different
paces in India both urban and rural
settings of course it involves a huge
host of collaborators we've got a lot of
government actors there we've started to
get some traction with them some NGOs on
the ground which are really kind of our
you know the real change happens from
the people on the ground that are in
acting the patient's our daily basis the
technology in this case is just giving
them more information to better manage
their patients and then there are some
some big funders that also helped that
and of course we're doing research you
know just what seems like a very simple
thing the layout of this envelope has
gone through several iterations the
right way to do this in a low-cost way
working also with the drug manufacturers
to integrate this into their process
we've done lots of qualitative
interviews with patients to understand
you know one of the right attitudes we
don't want this to be you know Big
Brother looking over your shoulder have
you taken your medicine it's more about
a kind of an engagement a conversation
and a lot of patients in this
circumstance actually really enjoy the
extra kind of push that somebody
actually cares you know you go to a
hospital and stand in line for three
hours to the hundred other people get
your drugs and go but now somebody's
actually following up with me like what
I do my homework if no one graded it so
in this case you know you're sort of
doing your daily duty to yourself and
your health and somebody's saying great
job you've done you've done it today so
I guess the the general theme this is
one particular project and I should have
mentioned the first project will
actually be there tomorrow if anyone's
interested seeing more but kind of this
this notion of an traditional computer
science or optimizing for something its
its efficiency its speed maybe it's for
more luxurious items it's so it's
optimizing for something and a lot of
these projects were optimizing the same
way it's just for cost and the
environment so you're doing a different
kind of market research understanding
who your different customer is it
involves a lot of participatory design
which I think will hear about and the
other talks as well but spending a lot
of time in the community cuz you're sort
of can't trust your intuitions at first
you're designing for such a different
population that I mean over time you
start to understand better but it
involves lots of collaboration with nog
refers and other people anthropologists
on the ground and then of course using
an existing infrastructure that you know
we've got these special purpose devices
that have shown demonstrated benefits in
various context around the world but how
can we use what's already existing in
some of these other parts of the world
where cost is a big factor how can we
use other existing resources to have the
same benefits just kind of a thought to
leave you with i showed you two devices
one was the audience response one was
medication adherence electronic pill
boxes with the explosion of the IOT
devices smart watches and everything
you've got a lot of these special
purpose devices coming online that are
each going to be out of out of reach
price-wise for much of the world so what
else can we use that's existing
infrastructure existing devices to have
the same demonstrated benefits so that's
it for me
I think we'll turn it over and do
questions at the end yeah thanks
great good afternoon everybody thanks
for being here and thanks to it and the
MSR team for having me so I my name is
Adi I wear two hats I teach at iit delhi
in the computer science department and i
also run a startup called romani and
it's just like what taking off from
where andrew afraid we sort of saw the
importance of participatory design and
how to design innovations in a very
frugal manner and how we can use paper
and all sorts of all these other things
so i'm actually going to take it a bit
beyond that i won't talk so much about
part participatory design but more about
my experience with gram vaani in what it
takes to scale up a particular
innovation and one of the key messages
basic i want to leave you off with which
are the state up front is that what we
found was that the technology actually
plays is just a one part to the one one
piece to the big jigsaw there's many
many other things we need to get right
to actually build systems which are
scalable and which can actually bring a
scalable social impact so i'll go ahead
and it's actually work let me
acknowledge I won't read out the names
but it's a whole army of people from
Grandma any from IIT and tons of other
collaborators with whom we've been
working over the last three years in
building this system so the bulk of the
work that we've been doing is around
this field called community media and
what it basically means is that how do
you design media or information sharing
systems for communities and typically we
are talking about geographically
localized communities so how do you
empower people to create content to
share information and knowledge with
each other and given the context for
operating in which is that these systems
are don't need to be low-cost and
affordable there's also literacy
challenges that we need to figure out
and bulk of these areas don't have very
good internet connectivity or people are
not really capable of using the internet
so there's a whole bunch of very
interesting mechanisms that have come up
so community radio for example is used
in a big way which is like a low-power
FM radio station where the idea is that
people come to the radio station and
create content locally so it's about
local content creation
and consumption which makes the whole
information very contextual several
other very interesting organizations
have been working with community video
where they hold these kind of public
video screenings so they train people
from the villages in creating videos
about local things local issues could be
on corruption could burn other awareness
oriented topics and these are then
screened publicly in physical gatherings
of people and then there's wall
newspapers there again people are
trained women are trained as journalist
and these wall newspapers are
distributed put up on was so very very
interesting ways and the main theory of
change over here essentially is that
once you empower this community then one
thing it does is that because the
content they're creating is very local
very contextual it becomes much easily
understandable by the people so so that
is hopefully going to bring about very
effective behavior change so rather than
creating some mass media messages and
sort of pushing them down people's
throat over here you're actually
creating a discussion about the topic
and the idea is that once you get people
to discuss these things they'll
understand it much better they get a
much broader perspective about these
things similarly once you do have these
kind of open media platforms in local
communities it can lead to a lot of
empowerment because people are now if if
it's actually women talking about it on
the mic you can imagine how much of a
feeling of empowerment is actually going
to bring how much confidence is going to
inspire it's also very interesting in
terms of governance and accountability
where if you're talking about problems
on an open platform then it you're
essentially holding service providers
accountable which could be local
governments you're talking to and we've
seen example after example of how it's
actually improved things so the media
platform can actually become a change
agent and lastly it also serves a big
role for community building because this
is like a local platform now that people
have there's cultural programs that are
being aired that are being broadcast
local youth events that have been
covered so it really helps bring the
community together so where do we come
in well we started seeing that there are
there are all these fantastic
initiatives around community radio and
video but there are several challenges
with the community video for example
it's not really scalable you need to
organize all these physical gatherings
and things with community radio
similarly there are other challenges
that the geographical range is limited
but we've seen that mobile phone
penetration has increased and it is
there pretty much everywhere every
household has a phone even in remote
rural areas so we started seeing that
how can we actually use mobile phones in
in these sort of loaded literacy
environments and this is not the only
project but several other projects
including a very interesting project
from X of research itself course
teaching at suarra and so together we've
actually we found sort of like a silver
bullet in some sense of enabling
communication using phones by bringing
up ivr systems interactive voice
response systems so I their systems are
what you typically get in a call center
right when you call and you get these
automated prom saying press 1 for this
press 2 for this and so on so we've
actually innovated on top of that that
people can call and they can record
messages right so they can record voice
messages or they can listen to messages
left by other people right so it can
become actually like a discussion forum
that somebody calls and they record a
question let's say on agriculture some
other person calls you can listen to
these questions and they can help answer
these questions right so it can serve as
a means of information sharing locally
similarly it can be used for news it can
be used for putting up problems that
people are facing in government schemes
lots of different variations so the way
the whole system actually works is that
there's an IVR system where people are
calling and recording messages and
listening to messages at the back end we
have a really an army sort of of content
moderators who are sitting and listening
to each of these messages that people
have recorded
and they figure out which messages to
publish returns to reject so the message
essentially goes to an editorial
filtering process which partly we need
to do because it's in voice so we can't
automatically sort of process it and
partly also to make sure that no bad
information or messages are going out
and the good thing is that we are then
able to tag and categorize these
messages and which then serves as a way
of building of very interesting insights
on community perceptions so soapy when
people are talking about let's say
social issues that you're interested
about early marriage or domestic
violence through this mechanism you're
actually getting a lot of user-generated
content very much like on internet
social media like Twitter or Facebook
and you can figure out there for what do
people believe in what are the
perceptions and you can use a
strategically to design interventions so
that's also part of our business model
actually agrimony that we run these sort
of campaigns in a sponsored manner so
somebody pays us to run these campaigns
and we then analyze and push the data
back to the providers so the system has
actually been working it's got a lot of
traction currently we get over 10,000
calls a day on the system people spend
almost eight minutes on average browsing
around listening to messages leaving
messages and like I said local news is a
big component over here agriculture and
health information is another big
component governance and accountability
is also has a big role where people are
actually leaving messages on corruption
in government schemes or problems
they're facing not getting paid in time
schools not opening and time and the
system has helped bring many of these
issues to a redressal so what are the
key points Ashley though what I go now
deeper into is actually talking not so
much about the technology itself but
about many other things that you need to
get right and which is has actually been
pretty much like unpeeling and I
and just like I'm peeling onions makes
you cry it's literally been like that
it's actually been a very very hard job
so technology design of course but
things like what Android also spoken
about this very very interesting
challenges that how do you actually
design solutions how do you build
technology architectures how do you
think about usability in our case is
also a lot of scope for machine learning
and things so I won't touch so much into
that but one of the first topic shall go
a little bit deeper into is that how do
we actually inform people in the first
place that such a system actually exists
right because these are actually media
dark areas so which means that we can't
use television or newspapers or those
sort of things to advertise and
therefore we have to rely on offline
mechanisms so the way and again this has
to be done in a scalable way so what we
started doing was that we said working
very closely with local NGOs and local
organizations and through them we
started identifying volunteers in the
field and these volunteers we said that
we also would give you financial
incentives which would be pegged to the
call volume that you are able to
generate from your region so that will
quite well and these volunteers they did
things like wall paint things like the
ones you see here the organized workshop
the distribute pamphlets so so very
exciting partly we ran into issues with
scalability because we have to engage
directly with each volunteer and then we
actually came up with a nice idea that
we started forming volunteer clubs where
we put groups of 10 volunteers into a
club and this was phenomenal because it
actually shared the responsibility that
in case some volunteers were slacking
the other volunteers in the club could
pick pull them up and it also brought in
a strong feeling of ownership because
with each Club we gave them their own
local system which they could publicize
they could use it for whatever purposes
they wanted could be news could be women
related issues and that was very very
interesting if you go deeper into
analyzing the cost of user acquisition
that we were seeing again very very
interesting insights that we call that
in some sense we figured out the killer
app
vacation that local news at the district
level is what works we also know what
sort of volunteers you recruit and these
volunteers are on the left over here
where the cost per user acquisition is
is very low on the other hand if we look
at clubs where the cost of user
acquisition is higher based on the
financial incentives we are paying then
very interestingly these are actually
women lead clubs and we're seeing that
these are inequalities which are very
deeply embedded in society that women
for example they don't have as regular
access to the mobile phones the phones
are owned by the husbands so they only
have access when the husband comes back
from work for example or the movement of
women is restricted so it's not very
easy for them to go out and tell other
people about the system so it's very
interesting that we are seeing that
although the work that the women are
doing is very very intensive and they're
very dedicated but the cost and the rate
the growth rate of these clubs has been
hard in between there are all sorts of
there's a range and which typically
depends on how dedicated the volunteers
are and and those sort of things so also
raises some interesting philosophically
that from from a typical user
acquisition standpoint we know how to
grow but if you really want to think
about going and bring your women on to
the platform then it's more expensive
and how should we go about financing
those those kind of things yet another
very interesting aspect is in terms of
user training because the users reaching
out to many of them are first-time uses
of any sort of automated information
technology right so the very fact that
they're actually calling into a system
and they're not speaking to a person as
the other end but is actually a machine
that's the that's that's talking to them
that itself is alien so in a separate
experiment we saw that we were using a
radio station to broadcast instructions
on how to use I via systems but even
with repeat usage only
about sixty percent of the people were
able to use the idea properly and but
only when we did some training over the
phone or in-person demos that's that's
what improve the user rates so this is
another way in which the soul offline
model that we had we've developed has
been very useful that will actually now
even more than eighty percent of users
that within three calls they're able to
figure out how to record messages and
those messages actually get published on
to the system so one key message
basically wanted to outline with this
discussion was the need for offline
mechanisms and user training and user
acquisition which is very very important
and which is completely non-technical
that we need another aspect we wanted to
go a bit deeper into is content that how
do we figure out what content do people
want and how do we mold all of that so
but you're in half back we basically
serve it people that what do you think
mobile money means to you and most of
the people say that it's about social
issues so they were attaching a very
social development sort of character to
it fewer people said that is about
livelihood right but when we asked them
that what is it that you want to hear on
mobile money then it was just the
opposite that they actually wanted more
utilitarian sort of information about
jobs about employment about government
schemes that they can avail so the
challenge for us was that the content on
the system is completely user-generated
so how do we change all of it how do we
get about getting more of the livelihood
content or content that people actually
want so again it took us some time to
sort of confront the the idea that we
are not just a technology company but
we're actually a media company at the
end of the day because we're moderating
messages and doing all these things so
so we gradually started expanding a
Content team and we started creating
many interesting in-house programs and
discussions so these are actually trial
straightforward translations from Hindi
so they might seem a bit odd behind
equivalent of these programs
like straight from the heart and stuff
see sounds more interesting very started
soliciting content from people about
their travel experiences about the day
to day life from women from merchants
from farmers and that gradually helped
change the overall character of the
system that people started publishing
and listening more to entertainment
related content rather than just
grievances which which is an important
because it helps draw more people to the
system the second aspect that we also
did was that through our whole volunteer
network we were able to start solid
sitting news and even programming around
women so this all of this really helped
make the system more broad-based than
just being addressed around social
issues and that helps in in turn in
terms of more user retention more a more
attractive system to onboard users so I
briefly mentioned earlier that getting
people to talk about their own
experiences that's actually very helpful
for other users on the system because
they're able to relate to the
information because it's mo contextual
so we've had several such stories so
things like a youth who listens to a
program on early marriage or some story
that somebody else is left that when I'm
added early it I got too many
responsibilities and I had to give up my
school and I had to take up jobs so once
people hear the stories and actually
motivates them for behavior change so
another challenge for us was that how do
we systematize this that how do we
actually make this whole idea of
contextualizing information as as
process which we can replicate for
whatever sort of aspect we might be
interested in bed early marriage or any
sort of other social issue on which we
want to create discussions so over here
the size of the bubble that you see is
in some sense proportional to the amount
of content that was generated during a
particular campaign on an issue and the
x-axis as content quality so over time
we've done several such campaigns and
we've we've had some interesting
findings that some of these campaigns
like the ones marked as Sesame or this
long acronym bitches stands for a
program centered around a girl who who's
grown up in a village and gets a job in
a city and and so on so these were
actually can't content programs
developed for radio broadcast and which
we played out on our forum and we were
essentially using it to anchor questions
around these episodes that what do you
think this character should have done or
can you report some stories around what
you've seen happening to this character
in this TV serial or radio serial so
that did not resonate so well with the
people a similar program that we
actually created in-house way beyond
shielded recordings by Ashley bringing
voices from the community itself that
resonated much better so very similarly
the way we run most of these campaigns
is that we would start putting up some
facts to the people right facts about
medicine price hike or child sex abuse
and get people to give their own stories
so these things have been way more
successful another aspect we worked on
was through a game where we would put up
a case study and ask people what they
thought about it and only when they
answered that question not in terms of
whether the answers right or wrong but
just a fact of answering then we would
move to the next question so so we're
doing these sort of different
experimenting with these different
formats which around information
contextualization and we're now also
figuring out what sort of impact is
being created in terms of improvement in
awareness but it's very interesting that
how do we actually make this into a
replicable process some sorry I'm out of
time so in very very quickly i'm also
going to touch upon another key aspect
that while there is so much activity on
the forum in terms of content being
published and people
putting out stories and learning from
each other can we also translate it into
some actual change happening on the
ground and specifically in terms of
improvement and governance and
accountability so some aspect we've seen
is that if if you are empowering a
volunteers to actually take up issues
directly with the government department
very often that works because there's a
fear of escalation that these stories
are going on to a public forum onto a
voice newspaper or a voice media of
sorts and that's helped we've also tried
some other things where we've actually
had formal partnerships with government
departments where we've written actual
letters that so-and-so person has
reported this this problem and we
verified it and here is a complaint that
you are formally filing with you and
there are of course scalability issues
and the key challenge lies in sort of
merging both these modules together the
volunteer module with this
institutionalized sort of a module in
some areas we've also played around with
working together with the political
system by doing something like a report
card for local politicians and Howard
problems in two different colonies
juxtaposed against each other and
redressal rates we've also done some
work with the administration by linking
it up with performance management I
won't go into the details but but
basically the key points I wanted to
leave you with was that other than the
technology design there's many other
aspects which which need to be brought
in creating institutionalized structures
and building community ownership is one
key element that that's required
figuring out formats for information
contextualization that can create
behavior change that's another very
interesting thing and lastly how do we
figure out how to work the system really
so I'll stop with this and for the
unsold problem with financial
sustainability and how do we make money
that's yet another long talk thanks
so we've got some time for some
questions hopefully some of you guys
have I mean one of the things i think
that Elizabeth's talk did really nicely
here was also illustrate that this isn't
just about global population it's not
marginalized populations all over the
place you know and whether it's Native
Americans around here people in inner
cities for that matter and then the
populations and the you know moving
populations of people for like Lord
displaced persons etc and and they all
have their own unique needs in their own
context and I think that all of you guys
brought this up about how important it
is to understand what the needs of the
people are you collected all that great
data in the network area so you can
start to understand what do people need
about the internet and how do we then
answer that question I think that's true
for all of you guys and so um any
questions for any of these cool stuff
anybody yes wait to the mic to run to
you because I think they're recording on
this
thank you for a very inspiring docs I
wanted to ask you about especially the
first two speakers perhaps but also for
the I guess the question is is the gap
between the computing haves and
have-nots in some sense permanent is
this something where you see it
converging so I mean if you think about
it in terms of a research program you
know that we might launch in order to
handle this I mean it could be the case
that this is a short-term phenomena that
you know in just five years or so you
know things may change so for example
cell phones in india you know used to be
a time when that wasn't as commonly
available now it just seems like
everybody has a cell phone and so is
similar phenomenon going to happen with
computing power and so forth so that we
may not necessarily think of it as a
long term research problem sure well
definitely a mobile phone coverages is
obviously you know in places that didn't
have ten years ago they are but I'd
still say that there's still a huge gap
between kind of a mobile experiencing
the internet experience which kind of
Elizabeth touched on so just the fact
that you have a phone in a place you
didn't have before doesn't mean that any
gap is really close you're still
trailing way behind kind of the
frontrunners as far as bandwidth goes
coverage goes just the whole experience
and certainly you know not just another
field kind of the sports of speech
recognition obviously it's come a long
way in certain languages but then
there's whole swathes of languages that
we have no data for and you know a lot
of these services that kind of rely on
that blue trails for a long time as long
as it's not we don't have the data to
really catch up so even though there are
changes happening I wouldn't say they're
really converging I'd say that there's
still a huge gap between and that will
continue because we got this long
trajectory in both fields that those
still remain a gap in an interesting
research problem for for a while I don't
know if you yeah no I mean I sort of
just wanted to build up on that that the
point so much is not about whether using
technology is the solution as of now and
tomorrow whether it be technology beaver
so the broader point is that
the context are different when we are
talking about these different
populations that we are working with so
so the applications need to be designed
keeping that context in mind the
technology depending on whatever
technology is cheaper at that point or
more appropriate at that point those
need to be looked at so the point is
that the broader problems are likely to
persist right the broader problems which
would require design thinking to solve
which would require user training to
figure out how to how to train the users
and which will require you know just a
much better understanding of the needs
of these uses those sort of things are
going to persist actually I think this
gets back to this question about
research programs because I mean I think
that the problems like this are really
good examples if there are some really
hard problems that we don't have answers
to yet and that actually are exactly
what people like you can be looking at
it's just that not knowing that these
problems exist is actually I think a key
piece and starting to be able to target
them but I think there's a lot of really
hard technical problems that remain for
research to be done it's not going to go
away in the next 5-10 years these are
these are real serious issues other
questions
my yes
I mean he ran from General Washington um
I think it can be interesting to see
these talks and very interesting
projects thanks a lot for the
presentations I think people's the
information is really depends on their
income level where they are living but
it's kind of interesting to see like
what had the priorities for people's
information needs I think about those
locations with very poor availability of
the technologies you can probably look
at what are the top needs of people like
for the information versus in a very
developed the world you see even several
years old Kate playing with the internet
all the time and I think from that kind
of use is very hard to see what is the
apartment was not important I think that
may be a very interesting technology
research about what is the priority of
people's information needs depending on
like their income level their social
status etc and I think I'm not an
interesting as a researcher I would like
to see you know they're a very popular
discussion on the smart cities and the
smart communities I think what you
people have been doing could be a very
beginning point for that kind of
research work or maybe that kind of
projects certainly I think everybody
talks about smart cities they are
referring to different things depending
on where they are right so their target
and their availability of funding for
doing these things but to me I think to
make our work scalable or maybe being
able to be copied to more places there
should be some kind of a common
structure or framework to be extracted
from these very interesting pilot
research work I wonder if you guys have
also been looking at these things and
what you can share with us about the
potential theoretical framework that
could be used for for smart cities
comments
it's a definitely good thought provoking
we hadn't really looked too much at that
but as far the first comment I guess on
people's motivations what they're
actually finding I mean this came up in
all of these presentations and audis
work with these voice systems that we've
done some work on these systems that
started out as just information
dispersal or political grievance and
things and what it turns into is like a
American Idol a lot of people just want
to sing entertainment because have their
voice heard as kind of a you feel like
well maybe people are coming for
education information butts actually
just entertainment or having the worst
roads which is always interesting you
design for one thing and then you find
out that people actually want something
else and maybe you should redesign it
for that purpose but this gets to the
point of actually paying attention to
what they want and this is actually you
know understanding the context a lot of
times development work is very sort of
patronizing a lot of ways where it's you
know we think you need this you know
it's all about education is all about
income or whatever and often it's they
want just what everybody else wants you
know it's faceboook it's communicating
with other people it's entertainment
it's watching the football game it's you
know but they just don't have that
access when they have the access they're
just the same as a lot of other people
now there are additional needs that they
have and they're coping mechanisms for
the constraints that they have and the
fact that you know Facebook doesn't work
very well over a one megadeth second
connection stuff like that but but I
think you would find that in a lot of
ways they're just people just with other
constraints yeah
anything else yes
alright so in the general CS education
domain we've seen a large push towards
like can we get everybody to coat sort
of approach to things and I realized a
lot of these people are not going to
just suddenly discover how to code
overnight but I'm wondering if there's
been any movement towards trying to
create devices or technologies that are
possible to teach to these sorts of
groups that they can design their own
stuff so to speak either for bike I'm
trying to envision helping my sister put
together her network for her house long
distance I can tell you this is not easy
even with some with a college education
and I wonder how much there's actually
been working like how do I just create a
network ad hoc really easy for a bunch
of people i don't know if that's
researched well one thing i can say for
that last question I'm going to defer to
somebody here but but in terms of like
programming and this kind of so I mean
there has been some work on this I'm
going to tell something that's been
going on here at MSR for a little while
called touch develop and the idea behind
this is a system that allows you to do
some basic programming with a smartphone
and so the idea is that you don't need a
big IDE you don't need a computer you
don't need it because for a lot of these
folks the only computer they're likely
to ever see in the near term is a thumb
and so then the question was can we
design something that actually you can
do basic programming tasks understand
logic do some basic programming with
just a phone and they've done a pretty
cool job so I would suggest you check
that out as well does that extend to
designing an ad hoc network and
think so but but I mean the software
side is a little different but I think
you oftentimes see in these communities
just people learning things you wouldn't
think of the entire ecosystems spring up
of people learning how mobile phones how
to repair mobile phones had a couple one
together from five different broken
phones these are not college-educated
people but just there's a need for
someone to fix the phone so they find a
way to fix the phone there's a need to
kind of get the network running against
a lot of a lot of innovative and
creative ways to keep these these
devices and systems running when they
the optin break I don't know creating
one from scratch but there's a whole you
know market for that kind of talent
which which comes up but it is an
interesting question is there a research
thing here and I think that a lot of
this is is harder than it needs to be
yeah and so then there's you know can we
make it easier anything else we're
almost out of time but you know maybe
everybody wants to bolt to get the early
coffee anything else any last comments
from you guys all right thank you for
attending yeah thank you so much and i
er to go into this area exactly i think
as much as anything that we i wanted to
sort of get this in front of some folks
as well i think one thing that's
important that is harder i think in this
domain did a lot of domains is as andrew
and adi mentioned and and elizabeth as
well is that this is often a very
multidisciplinary endeavor and doing
that in academia can be hard you know
you have to span these departments you
have to get different peoples and
different sort of the piston illogical
ways of thinking lined up and it's tough
but often in my experience the really
cool stuff happens at that overlap
whenever you get the those conversations
happening so i would urge you to sort of
you know try to reach out to some folks
in other departments see see where it
goes this is actually really rewarding
and it's super cool stuff there's lots
of low-hanging fruit you just got to
have to know
look yeah and it's fun at the end of the
day right looking at the three other
people and putting things out in the
field all right let's get our panelists
a final round of applause thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
