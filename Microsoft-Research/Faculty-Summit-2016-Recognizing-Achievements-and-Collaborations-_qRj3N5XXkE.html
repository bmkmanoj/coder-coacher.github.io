introduce to you Rick Russian maybe I
don't need to tell you who rick is but
Rick founded in nineteen ninety one
Microsoft Research iris he is currently
the chief technology officer in the
applications and services group so Rick
you're on great thanks Jeanette clicker
I do but not right now later so in
December of 1979 I took a couple
graduate students out to sea star trek
the movie that was the very first movie
I was just a young research I just
started at Carnegie Mellon University
and that started a long tradition of me
taking out people that I work with to
each new Star Trek movie as they came
out and two weeks from Friday I'm going
to be taking out about 1,500 people to
lincoln square theater I'm actually I've
rented out the whole theater it's
actually more complicated I've done this
theater thing many times before but but
this is the first time I actually had a
sonic contract with like the home office
in Texas so you can see was a who was it
was it was kind of a large event for
them and in so we'll have fun hopefully
I'll be dressed up in my Star Trek
outfit it's a Picard outfit if anybody
was wondering and my wife will be
dressed up in her skimpy skirt Star Trek
thing and we'll be greeting people as
they come in so it should be it should
be a lot of fun you know people have
asked like why do you do this for Star
Trek in particular I mean there's a lot
of other science fiction things we know
you're a big science fiction fan and and
for me it's I think what distinguishes
distinguish Star Trek in my mind in
particular is this sense that you know
one of the gene roddenberry's
fundamental
so you know principles around Star Trek
was that he viewed that the future as a
sort of positive optimistic thing right
was this multicultural you know
optimistic Federation that you know had
your exploration as its key mission if
you remember the mission statement for
the original Star Trek series it was to
explore strange new worlds so I was
number one to seek out new life and new
civilizations that was second point and
the third was was really thing I think
that has inspired a lot of people which
is you know to boldly go where no man
has gone before and aside from the fact
that that's a split infinitive it really
did make this point that this that you
know this Federation this you know this
this huge amount of effort was really
about exploring it was about discovering
and yes you know there were dark
episodes there were war episodes there
was really silly episodes but that sense
of fundamental optimism about the future
and what can be done in the opportunity
to bring many different races and many
different peoples together in a common
cause of discovery that really was
something that I always felt inspired me
and it was I think had a huge impact
they also had some very fundamental
principles you know one of you for those
again who remember the series I don't
know how many your Star Trek fans are
here but there was this notion of the
prime directive the idea that you know
they didn't want to interfere with races
that hadn't achieved warp drive you know
so they would try to stay out of it you
know they didn't always do that but they
tried right principles are about trying
sometimes and you know as I started
microsoft research in 1991 you know I
had my own mission statement and my own
principles that I worked against the
mission statement that i created as I
saw the organization was also in three
parts the first was to move the state of
the art forward in all the areas in
which we did research so
is fundamentally about exploration it's
about research it's about about you
pushing the frontier the second was to
take the things that we created the
ideas that we created and work as hard
as we could to get them out into
products into people and again that was
really the sense of we want to create
but we also want to have an impact the
last part of the mission statement was
was really the only part that really
specifically spoke to Microsoft which
was to ensure that Microsoft would have
a future and in interestingly enough I
think more than most people probably
realize I've been here for 25 years now
a lot of what Microsoft is today and in
to some extent the fact that Microsoft
is actually here today is because of the
research and the innovations that have
come out of microsoft research over the
years so really has had that kind of an
impact and in that kind of change my key
principle sort of like the prime
directive was very much like what
Jeanette and Peter said today was really
not to interfere in this case not to
interfere with our researchers in
exploring the ideas and the things that
they were trying to do you know it's
it's very easy i think peter made this
point pretty well it's very easy to
start to believe you actually know what
the future is supposed to look like and
you know what research is important and
what research isn't and that's a very
bad fallacy that's easy to fall into and
so I always really looked at my
researchers as an organization that
really made its own decisions how is
that this principle that you know if you
treat people like children and you you
wind up with children and they behave
that way you treat people like adults
they behave like adults they make their
own decisions they find the right areas
to do research and they constantly
surprise you with amazing things now
three years ago this week I know that
because of Facebook
because Facebook polka to put it up on
my screen a couple of days ago I passed
on the leadership for Microsoft Research
to the next generation of leaders you've
heard from Peter and Jeanette today
Harry Shum is is sitting in the front
here heading all of TNR and and really I
think of the legacy that I passed on to
the research organization more than
anything else it was about the attitude
about research it's about the approach
that you take and doing basic research
in a company like Microsoft and
everything and everybody is said today I
think just reinforces that now I have
the so that's that's my reminiscing I
have the pleasure of actually my actual
duty here my work is to recognize the
achievements of some of the students and
collaborators that we work with and so
I'm going to do that one thing I'll say
before I get into this is that a
critical part of microsoft research from
the very beginning has been to work with
the academic community we brought in a
group of academics a number of whom are
here sitting at the audience to be our
advisors and the very beginning of
microsoft research and we tried to work
with the academic community one of the
programs we created fairly early on
really in response to what we heard from
the community was a PhD fellowship
program and the idea was to be able to
support some of the top young PhDs and
and recognize the opportunity that they
are going to be creating in the future
by supporting their work so every year
for quite a few years I don't remember
how long it's been going but it's been a
long long time we've had each of the
university's you know send in
applications with particular students
the
review the very best are selected and
that's where we get our PhD fellowship
program here are some of the names we
also have created what we call the
women's fellows program and here are
some of the names of the that of women
that are receiving those awards this
year as well and then over the last few
years we've created some competitions
for students the open source challenge
which has seen dozens and dozens of of
student groups participating here again
you see some of the winners associated
with that and then most recently we've
created this thing called the quantum
challenge to really tackle some of the
newer problems in quantum computing and
you see some of the students associated
with that now with those names having
been up on the screen I'd like to have
all the wait one more thing I've almost
forgot the ACM student research
competition we've been supporting that
since 2005 over 2,000 students have been
assisted through that program to date
over 200 this year and I know 10 of
those students are in the audience today
so all of the students whose names have
been up there or involved in this please
stand up and be recognized
so these are the people that will be on
stage in the future so I also this year
for our 25th anniversary we wanted to
recognize some of the faculty that have
had a particularly significant impact on
Microsoft Research we had nominations
from all of our researchers and from
that we selected a list of 25 faculty
I'll sequence to the names here some of
them are actually here many of them are
my friends and and really without the
support of faculty in the top
universities around the world you know I
don't think Microsoft Research could
have been able to do things that we have
been able to do over the years so I want
to thank not just these individuals but
all of you for the the contributions
you've made to microsoft research and
the friendship and the collaboration
that you've provided to us over the
years so can i don't know how many of
those people are actually here but if
you're here can you please stand up and
be recognized
again thank thank all of you and then
and thank all of you that are here for
the for the faculty summit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
