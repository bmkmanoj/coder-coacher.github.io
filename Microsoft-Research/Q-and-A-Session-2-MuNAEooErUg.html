hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading

you
the first question I'll actually combine
two questions one by onion tion hug and
the other one by for us mr essentially
the quiet the two questions boil down to
will be a pre jeanette we've heard a lot
of some of the research that has been
going on in in the computer science
space you mentioned about the health
space when it comes to areas of huge
societal impact things like say the
environment say even the other question
to the matter of enabling the minority
sections of society in participating and
doing big stuff what are some of the
things that MSR is doing or could be
doing that helped create these huge
societal changes and huge impact world
would it's it is this on yep okay it's
it it's actually a very good question
appropriate question here in india
because the microsoft research india lab
has a group called technology for
emerging markets that directly addresses
using technology using off-the-shelf
technology to have a societal impact
specifically here in India but also
other developing regions in Africa and
so on and the ninety nine dots project
that I talked about in using mobile
technology to ensure that patients
comply with the treatment TB patients
comply with treatment is just one
example of how this particular group is
having impact direct impact on in rural
areas in India there are many many other
examples there are a lot of people in
other labs who are interested in grand
challenges
whether it be energy or genome
sequencing I already showed you about
the stem cell prediction work and so
there's a because it's trying to mention
this morning we've got 700 PhDs or over
a thousand people in Microsoft Research
you can imagine the variety of research
done people with different disciplines
beyond computer science who have a real
passion for having impact on society
through their research thank you so the
next question is for you absent a lot of
these these folks out here will will
soon be entering initially programming
positions as they as they grow in their
roles there where they'll be working
with large teams of programmers what are
some of your hands for building systems
with large teams of people the most
important thing is keep it simple and
the next most important thing is use
abstractions because that's really the
only tool we have for being able to
effectively deploy a large team of
people the essential thing that
abstraction does for you is it makes it
possible for people people to work more
or less independently and if you don't
have that then everyone has to be able
to talk to everyone else and the cost of
that is obviously going to go like N
squared and it's not going to work when
n is bigger than five I say the third
most important thing is to write a spec
and that is to facilitate communication
among the team members and also when new
team members come on board they can read
the spec yeah programmers tend to think
the writing a spec is a waste of time
and as long as you can do the prejudice
at sidley true the difficulty is that
willpower doesn't work very well when
the TA team is not very small and it
works even worse as the system evolves
and has to change because you just
you're not smart enough to keep it all
in your head the next question is yeah
feel free to barbecue yeah this reminds
me of a story that I heard on the Jimmy
Carter after he stopped being president
was going around giving speeches and he
was giving a speech in Japan and he was
having sequential translations so he
would say a few sentences then he would
pause and trench translated would
translate into Japanese at one point the
president told a joke he took about 50
seconds and then the translation was
very short and everyone burst into
laughter and he couldn't understand how
could it be that this somewhat tricky
joke had been translated into three
seconds of Japanese so inquired
afterwards and he was told that what the
translator had said President Carter has
told a joke please laugh
the next the next question is for
Internet this is more to do with your
talk on computational thinking when we
learn math we usually learn to do stuff
do the arithmetic stuff before learning
the deep underlying concepts behind it
what's the equivalent to computational
thinking where what should we operate
operationally learn first in order to
imbibe the concepts of computational
thinking this is a great question and I
have two ways of answering it as a
researcher I the way I would answer it
is we don't actually know and let me
explain what I mean by that in in
centuries of learning mathematics we've
somehow figured out well first of all
before we get to that we we know by the
time you're five years old for instance
you have a sense of number you have in
fact the sense of greater than is shared
by other primates so we you have a sense
of number by the time you're 12 years
old you have enough mathematical
sophistication through the concepts
you've learned and through the exercises
you've done to learn algebra by the time
you're 18 years old you have enough
mathematical sophistication based on all
the concept you've learned beforehand to
learn calculus so somehow we know that
and somehow we have figured out how to
if you will line up the concepts of
mathematics so that we know what to
teach you when you're 5 6 7 12 18 and so
on I don't I and and there are research
areas that study how to teach
mathematics so the researcher in me says
I don't actually know the answer to that
question because we have not actually
studied from education science from a
cognitive science from a learning
science perspective how to teach
computer science what concepts in
computer science make a
has sense to teach at what age when do
when is the right time to teach
recursion I don't really know the answer
to that question from a scientific
perspective now that's me as a resource
Richard researcher speaking I'm not
actually going to necessarily wait
around for all the research communities
to come together and figure this out
much as we have done in mathematics
which is a much longer I'll older field
or physics which we have figured out
since Sputnik so the pragmatist amay
says well intuitively what do I think
children can learn at certain ages I
don't I think actually the computer
science community is still trying to
figure this out and laying down various
curricula in at four different age
levels I do think there are certain
concepts that one could teach pretty
easily young younger young greys for
instance when we teach on how to do long
division or teaching an algorithm but
when we learn long division in
mathematics at least when I learned it
my math teacher didn't tell me you're
learning an algorithm of how to divide
one number into another and get a
quotient and remainder and by the way
here's way to check it and that's a
different you know part of algorithms
and so on had I been taught the general
concept of an algorithm maybe I would
approach I would have approached
mathematics differently um so the real
point is I don't I I think there are
some concepts in computer science that I
think everyone can benefit from knowing
I mentioned if you like algorithms um
like what a state machine is ideally at
some time you know in making high school
you know what a invariant is
so then you can write specs so I I think
this is a exactly what the United
Kingdom has taken a really good first
stab at in terms of figuring out what
concepts in computer science makes sense
to teach at which grade level it's a
nice lead-in to the next question which
is for Syd this is from jitna bhi d so
during the course of the day we have
heard a lot of mansions of how people
with impaired science skills can help
other disciplines biology for instance
environmental science help so on from a
net perspective what are some of the
ways that we could be helping them hate
their skills that they have developed
over their years of undergrad training
to these other disciplines so from a
mech perspective as we said during the
talk as well it's it's it's a platform
their content basically content in the
way you use the platform place
significant role in terms of how
learning is improved so to answer this
question briefly I think it's again the
comp the platform itself is quite
comprehensive and if you have the right
kind of content which can actually come
from people like you as well it doesn't
really need to come from you know only
top-notch professors if you guys and you
think you can actually go and help the
community in a bigger and better way as
you mentioned in the question you can
actually start creating content on your
own and in turn put it on you know
platforms like make for others to kind
of go and make use of it and learn from
you know such technologies so I think
that's a good question to throw out to
the audience we have so many of you guys
here some of you have already used maxim
of you who haven't what are the some of
the things that you want what do you
want to learn what's the content that
you want to see what are the disciplines
that you want to focus more on what are
some of your thoughts about how
we both the research community Mac in
specific and the research community in
general could be helping you guys with
so like what would you like to see on
Mac just raise your hand maybe your
shout out something and we react to it
or Sid will react to it what do you say
one day course one day course or shorter
courses what else come on speak up
whatever you guys think yeah
so you mean to say more practical skill
testing platforms like coding within the
mech platform and such so good you
raised that so actually on that node
within Microsoft Research across various
labs there are lot of researchers who
are working on problems which are very
similar to what if I just mentioned so
in future we are trying our best to see
what all of these different technologies
across different research groups can we
bring together and put it on Mac to kind
of do the kind of you know stuff that he
just mentioned so you are right and
point well taken we are trying hard so
hopefully maybe in the next few months
you will see more and more improvements
coming on the platform any more hands
maybe you round the back there's another
hand this one there
so more animations within the videos not
straight animations yes so that's again
I have feedback wavered especially from
faculty so yes we are working on that as
well so the next course that you see
will actually have lot of those things
already incorporated into the videos
this is one handle the core subjects
like operating system core compiler
design that we already teach like
electives or something which require
specialization something like a computer
vision natural language processing so if
courses are available on such elective
subjects it's good for faculty and even
students so valid point again but on
that node one of the challenges we have
phase done will be very honest with you
one of the challenges we have faced over
the last two years is creating quality
content so I think we have lot of
faculty here we would actually request
all of you to come join us as community
and you know start creating content so
if you can create content not only will
your students benefit we can put it up
and open it up for the entire country
and you know all other people from
across geographies to kind of look at it
so we want to do it we are open to doing
it but we need your help so I would
request all of you to get together and
probably help us create more content and
put it on the platform we have 30
seconds left so one more question let's
say I saw your hand first some sort of
industrial glance of the knowledge that
they seek through mech that is the
actual application in industries because
it will give them practical as well as
theoretical knowledge so that's another
solution ok how the feedback will take
it yes well thank you we are out of time
for the Q&amp;amp;A I'd like to thank our
panelists speakers once again
each year Microsoft Research hosts
