you
okay let's go ahead and get started I
know this is a crazy day and I'm really
excited that our guest was able to join
us we've scheduled this a few times so
I'm please join me in welcoming dr.
Juliette shore she's a professor of
sociology at Boston College also a
member of MacArthur foundations
connected learning network before she
joined Boston College she was at Harvard
University for 17 years in the
department of economics and the
committee on degrees in women's studies
she focuses on issues of time use
computation excuse me consumption
environmental sustainability I've got
computation on the brain you're probably
has several books many of you in the
audience might be familiar with
sustainable lifestyles and the quest for
plenitude case studies of the new
economy in her previous work the
overworked American which is a
foundational text for people thinking
about the decline of leisure the
subtitle of that book from 1992 and the
overspent American why we want what we
want why we want what we don't need
which is one of my favorite titles so
please join me in welcoming Julie to the
stage thank you well thank you Mary it's
great to be here since we just have an
hour I'm going to jump right in and this
is a paper on some of the nonprofit
sites in what's called the quote unquote
sharing economy as people know the
sharing economy is a very controversial
topic and in my project we're looking at
a lot of different issues connected to
it today I'm going to focus on a subset
of what we've been doing let me just
tell you a little bit about the project
before I get into this particular paper
it is called originally what's called
connected consumption and now it's
connected consumption and economy it's
part of a MacArthur research network I
have the privilege of being an assister
network to the one that Henry Jenkins is
involved in
this is our website and most of our
papers are up there but it's been we've
been studying these sites since 2011 I
have a research team of total of eight
PhD students not at any one time we've
done at this point over two hundred
interviews hundreds of hours of
participant observation we have eight
completed case studies where we're
getting into some quantitative analysis
now of air B&amp;amp;B and we're asking both
sociological and economic questions and
this is just these are the members of
the team and there's lucca by the way
tom so you can see a picture of her so
i'm going to just run through the case
studies that we've done and a few of
them are in today's paper so we started
with a time bank which is a multilateral
barter exchange so we started with the
nonprofits the second is a food swap
where people come and trade prepared
foods with each other a makerspace a
place of shared tools members come and
they can use those tools air B&amp;amp;B which
of course everyone knows RelayRides
recently rebranded as Toro taskrabbit
which is a ariens a platform on demand
errands skillshare which is open access
education skillshare is one of the sites
in a larger case on open access
education that's the one that Luca is
doing and that sort of people who are
using online mostly free educational
materials we just started post mates
which is a mostly bicycle delivery
service we have a larger we're doing a
project now in quote-unquote gig labor
so we're also looking at favour which is
another one like this and so those those
are the case studies and I'm going to
tell you more about the three that I'm
going to get you today the TimeBank the
makerspace and if I
sometime the food swap so the let me
just start by laying out the question
that this paper asks and what we think
the contribution is and that is we're
looking at how social inequality and
mostly class although the paper also
talks about race and gender how it is
reproduced at the interpersonal level so
people like Pierre Bourdieu have
basically argued that social life is a
class structure social life and it it
does so differently within fields and so
we're looking at the consumption field
generally speaking even though some of
this is the maker space is a production
environment but it sort of goes into the
consumption we can we could talk more
about that so bored you argues there are
different kinds of capital in the world
there's not just economic capital which
is the sort of standard view but also
social capital social connections of
course became a very you know widely
used concept by researchers and his you
know I think his most sort of biggest
contribution is the concept of cultural
capital forms of knowledge skills
education and advantages which confers
status in this paper we're going to
we're looking at people who have a lot
of cultural capital shorthand kind of
education and taste family upbringing in
the educational system or what how you
build cultural capital and you can use
your cultural capital to get status in
particular contexts and that's what
we're going to be looking at the way
that's happening in these sites yes yes
just so you mentioned all these examples
of sites that you're looking at it in
the paper you think about more these
smaller scale sites that are maybe less
widely known to the public and then you
also mention some very broad ones like
your B&amp;amp;B so if you want us to like just
as a matter of interpretation of what's
going on think of these things you're
going to cover in more detail as models
of some sort but these
broader phenomenon or like how do you
see them fitting together in the broader
rug no let me just okay i don't know i
think i took out a slide that would
answer your question i'm going to come
back to it in two seconds but yeah so
i'm going to use the term practices of
distinction basically distinction being
something which confers status it when
someone acts in a distinguishing way
they're deploying their cultural capital
in a field a big innovation of bored you
is to understand there are these
different forms of capital and people
can use one or another to gain status
and position and they all connect with
economics so you can use your cultural
and social capital to gain economic
capital you can't always go in the other
direction but you often can okay so
we're going to be studying the ways in
which cultural capital is deployed at
the micro level in these sites as people
try and position themselves and how
inequality in this case mostly class
gets reproduced so okay so this the the
slide isn't there a couple differences
between these cases the cases I'm
focusing on today are nonprofits so
they're very different than air B&amp;amp;B
taskrabbit et cetera they are also as
you noted smaller scale so in some cases
the food swap and the maker space are
actually located in a particular place
so there's an actual site the TimeBank
is more like a typical platform economy
and that it's just it exists online and
people make the exchanges out in the
world it's a peer-to-peer the maker
space is really it's not a peer-to-peer
because it's a nonprofit that owns the
food swap is a peer-to-peer so does that
answer your question yeah and we've
asked different questions about the for
profits than the nonprofits I mean there
are some some of our papers incorporate
them all but the sum of these
sociological dynamics that I'm going to
talk about are much more prominent in
the nonprofit's than they are in the for
profits ok so the title of the paper was
paradox
is of openness and distinction and so
what we're referring to there is the
idea that these are sites which have an
overt commitment to openness or access
as they are often is often termed and
even more than that to some of them have
a really strong egalitarian ethic in
them and yet at the same time you have
these really intense processes of class
reproduction and class positioning going
on so that's the paradox that we're
interested in and I want to start to to
sort of set that paradox up by just
showing you some some parts of the
mission statements of these so the
TimeBank the mission is to nurture and
expand a movement that promotes equality
and builds caring community economies
through inclusive exchange of time and
talent very strong egalitarian
positioning and in fact of all of them
it has the most structural the biggest
structural commitment to equality
because it's rule of exchange is that
everyone's labor is equal regardless of
what it is so an hour of loyal airing
services equal an hour of dog sitting an
hour of software coding equals an hour
of driving to the airport so all
services are valued equally a huge
departure from the market valuation of
these services Kraftwerk's our maker
space that's our pseudonym for it is a
nonprofit organization furnishing
education tools works based on community
strong focus on community there to
empower dedicated fabricators including
hobbyist artisan early-stage
entrepreneurs the food swap the goal is
to create an outlet for sharing surplus
foods and offer an alternative to
store-bought items helping swappers eat
locally sustainably and affordably a
little bit less of the Equality in the
mission statement but you'll see there
there is a it also operates on a
one-to-one ratio for provision and
actually this thing which is a mason jar
are a ubiquitous item at a food swap
mason jar the actual the the terms of
exchange at the food swap are mason jar
for mason jar which is a kind of weird
thing but that's how it actually works
out and then finally Skillshare which in
this paper is the part of the online
open access education space that we're
talking about online learning community
where the world's best experts teach
World War skills provide universal
access to high-quality learning so all
four of these sites have a in their
mission statements and in the discourse
of both the founders and also the
practitioners the people who are at
these places they are all they are all
articulating this winter preneur sorry
yeah bad okay all four sites are located
in an urban area in the northeastern
United States to collect data we
conducted semi-structured interviews of
one to two hours with participants and
engaged in participant observation our
sample consists largely of young adults
aged 18 to 34 for various reasons but
they're also the sort of primary users
and innovators in these spaces for this
paper we're drawing on 80 interviews
with active users and about 250 hours of
participant observation and if people
want to talk more about the samples I
can do that but let me let me move on to
the cases so I'm just going to talk
about the class differences here but i
do want to flag that in the paper and
and in our research of course we found
also a lot of evidence of race and
gender dynamics exclusionary dynamics on
the basis of race and gender our sites
are heavily gendered so the food swap
for example is nearly all female the
makerspace is two thirds men at least
maybe more the TimeBank also
is very heavily female the open access
learning is more gender balanced and
these sites are all really
overwhelmingly white and participants
for the most part articulated this
course of colorblindness and that's
something we could also get into but I'm
going to go into the I'm going to talk
about the class stuff so I'm going to
start with the TimeBank this is just a
screenshot of it's a it's a quite
old-fashioned sort of antiquated
interface when the people who run the
TimeBank ask the users if they wanted to
add ratings and reputation as a feature
of this website particularly the older
participants said no that's very untimed
banky so it just it doesn't have ratings
and reputation and that is a part of why
or one of the dimensions of I think the
fount the fighting that we have so in
interviews participants highlighted
highlighted the alterity or the other
mnestheus of the time bank economy in
relation to buying services on the
market many are weary of the
impersonality of market exchanges and
they cast the participation as a way of
helping others are building community
mandy a coordinator at a non-profit
mentoring organization explained that
the time bank quote seems to be a much
more balanced and healthy relationship
where both parties feel important and
valued where there's a lot of mutual
respect for everyone and it's not as
hierarchical as the economy system of
regular financial markets victoria a
recent college graduate who wanted to be
engaged in community building lamented
that the market model of providing
services disconnects people reflecting
on a recent exchange with a mechanic
working on her car she complained I
didn't even have to talk to him after he
finished my car there was so little
interaction there and there was
something very important that happened I
put a lot of money into him fixing my
car and there was nothing really there
afterwards that's a lot of trust like I
had no real relationship it's crazy but
it's actually really
normal so many of these participants
were very critical of the impersonality
of the market and of the marketization
of personal services and so forth now
the time bank for these people is
something as I say really different
alternative to the market it's an almost
utopian space where I ideals of fairness
and egalitarianism are really present
and that's a big part of what draws
people to the time bank people normally
think of money the economy you get a
service and you pay for it people don't
even think another world as possible
said one participant so they have a
utopian orientation and you can think
about that one for one trading as a kind
of utopian exchange rate because it is
so much at variance with the big
differences in what labor is valued on
the market however the difference
between people's stated values and their
stated reasons for joining the time bag
and their actual practices turned out to
be quite significant and in many cases
and quite a number of our interviews
people only realize the contradiction
between the discourse that they were
using and their actual practice in the
middle of the interview to understand it
so oh yeah and this is I think I I
basically have gone over all this equal
valuation sense of worth about their own
labor people weary of the outsourcing of
services so here's the sample in the
time bank 21 female 22 white 8 mix of
Asian Latino in black 29 of the 30 of
bas more than half have mas and we have
four phd's all this is this is the
really extraordinary thing all had at
least one parental graduate degree so
when you think about the u.s. population
and the fractions who have graduate
degrees this is an extraordinary number
it is so rarefied in terms of
educational status 28 of the 30 were
raised in dual degree households meaning
both
parents had a ba or more on these are
people with super-high cultural capital
they tend not to be income maximizers
there are quite a few down shifters and
other folks you know people who were in
financial services we had one who became
a closet organizer so they're there
they're high cultural capital folks so
so we found that they they actually
acted in ways that were at variance with
the mission of the of the time bank Sam
a white 33 year old woman with a
master's degree laughingly confided I'm
going to be totally blunt here there's a
lot of educated white lady skills on
there and not so many you know like
carpentry and plumbing and electricity
and hairstylist all those things that
don't tend to be your stereotypical
educated white Cambridge lady skills
many of our participants articulated
some similar sentiments Sam went on what
I love about the time because we could
all be helping each other out with all
the things we know how to do getting to
know each other in the process at the
same time she filled that fear that in
practice the bank quote replicates this
weird segregation which we already have
all the time often the divergence took
the form of members not offering their
valuable marketable skills in the time
bank leading to the abundance of the
white lady skills boom owned by Sam Jill
for example told us about how she
refrained from offering skills she uses
for her day job actually no I'm
realizing the reason I don't offer it is
because i think it's worth more that i
could get more money um i don't think we
have Jill up here but the point is that
she she doesn't offer what she can do
that's really highly valuable members
similarly members who were
professionally qualified in one area
preferred to try their hand at skills
they weren't qualified in corry a lawyer
and social worker explained how the bank
reminds you about all the areas of your
life that you've actually learned things
like learn things in like gardening or
home repair things you never think of as
skills because they're not on your
resume so instead of offering lawyer
services
people could really use at that time
bankrate she's offering gardening and
home repair Kelly an energy healer who
all only gives introductory serve like a
first session and she won't give
sessions after that or melissa was
suicide prevention counselor on the
other side won't accept a trade from
someone who doesn't have a credential in
it Karen a programmer again that's a
valuable skill that lots of people could
use on the on the TimeBank expensive to
buy in the market she likes to put in
thermostats we also found a lot of overt
snob ism with respect to who people
would trade with so for example Jen
citing a background in marketing Jen
remark that in the postings quote the
way people express themselves and sell
their offers guided her selection of
trading partners thereby privileges a
cultural style of written communication
when pressed for details n explained
that the detailed professional
presentation an attractive wording of
the offer helped her decide on trades
she described her aversion to quite to
quote typos and sentence fragments
likewise Anna a member who jokingly
referred to herself as a crunchy granola
wholly devoted to the concept of the
time bank described having reservations
about not using credentialed
professionals for services she wouldn't
use them for electrical work plumbing
home repair car repair that could be
really disastrous she said so overall we
found that three fourth of the people
who made statements supporting the
egalitarian ideals of the time bank
unwittingly negated them in some way by
saying that their time was worth more
than other people's time and often
informants recognize this contradiction
in the middle of the interview so what
that meant was that trading volume on
the in the time bank was rather low
because it these people who are sort of
both enacting their own cultural capital
or distinguishing themselves from others
or demand
ending high levels of credentials or
cultural capital in from other people
were unwilling to make matches so that
the sort of extent of this capital
cultural capital positioning really
impeded the development of a robust
trading economy now this also happened
in the food swap which if I have time
I'll get to but let me now turn to ya so
that's a robust trading economy was
elusive and subtle and overt ways many
made distinctions between the worth of
their time and that of others let me
turn now to the craft works which is the
maker space and this is a place where we
found rampant distinction practices but
they were able to develop some
accommodations that allowed a lot of
action a lot of trading of time and
skills to go on but only in the context
of a hierarchical economy so they
although they had the ambition of of a
level community an egalitarian community
in practice they segregated into
multiple Spears so like the TimeBank
craft works is also positions itself
against the conventional so it's a place
of creativity it's a place that
constructs itself as different from the
world of work from the world of mass
consumption so that's a really strong
theme in a lot of the members views it's
a place where a lot of innovation occurs
and it's a place where there's very
little mundane activity and this gives
us a key or sort of an insight for the
way in which distinction is made and
this is actually one of the more mundane
things of just giving you a few pictures
from the place this is stompy a hexapod
robot being built by a group within the
makerspace let me tell you something
about our sample participants believe
the membership is about a third fee
email it never quite felt that way the
heavy users skew much more male the
space itself is highly segregated by
gender it's a very large space and there
are certain areas where women are and
these are the areas which are more into
art jewelry making sewing etc and the
the the more prestigious areas the 3d
printing the robotics etc tend to be
much more mail it's overwhelmingly white
we only once observed a non-asian person
of color working in the space and that
was over 18 months of discipline
observation the interview sample for
today that that's in this paper is 21
people 15 men six women one non white
mixed education levels here because you
have some high school dropouts who are
very proficient in various areas and so
forth you also people with grad degrees
and there's a kind of sub cultural
capital that's also important in this
space so how do people position
themselves and what's the way how does
cultural and sub cultural capital
develop here so one of the first things
we figured out was that what the way to
get status in the space is for your
activities to be as far from sort of the
necessary the instrumental the economic
as possible so that's a big board museum
theme high cultural capital people step
back from necessity so they display
their capital by showing how uninst
romentic so for example they do things
like build bicycles that are only ever
used once I'll show you this one of our
interviewers pseudonym job makes tables
like this they have holes in them
they're curved so that they're too big
to probably even get out of the space so
one of the things in the interview is he
talks about how unfunctional his tables
are a machine an exercise machine that
people can't use movie props Burning Man
giant sculptures we have a
burners there stompy the robot who say
they have no idea how their when they
finally finish stompy how it's they're
actually going to get it out of the
space because it's too big and what does
it do well pretty much what I can do is
just walk on cars so there's very little
mundane making we have one guy in our
sample who's actually using the tools in
the maker space to fix his parents
furniture after a fire most of what's
going on here is esoteric distance from
necessity etc we have a great I don't
remember she made it into this paper but
we have a great informant who she's
doing a lot of classes and her goal she
makes sex toys and her goal is to make a
different sex toy in every workshop of
the space literally like you know eight
or nine workshops so a lot of pride
about the non functionality the non
instrumentality of the thing here's
another single but use bicycle here's
another bike or you know they'll they'll
set up this and they'll have a
competition with these bikes that people
make they do robot competitions and
they'll use these they'll spend a couple
weeks making a robot they'll use it once
and that'll be the end of it so that a
lot of marks of distinction for doing
that second thing is that um look at the
time here yeah okay I'm not going to so
one of the things we found let me just
see what I have here okay so what are
the other dimensions of sub of the sub
cultural capitals esoteric knowledge and
and then sort of also sub cultural
capital gain through through people sort
of you know knowing a lot about these
maker spaces and so forth making
described as natural at this point I'm
in a spot that I could either personally
like individually make or have made
anything that is made says Joey so we
also found in the
interviews a lot of sort of bragging
name-dropping we did an analysis of we
found a sort of identified a high status
group and then we did an analysis of the
text how often these people's names were
used in other people's conversations so
they could get sort of reflect you know
they could get cred with the interviewer
based on their social connections in the
space and so you have this high status
group it's very clear in the interviews
and you have one of the women you know
complaining and and some of the women
also complain to us about this in group
a lot of one-upsmanship that goes on
here um esoteric cultural knowledge okay
I didn't know what this was from when I
went there someone had to tell me maybe
some of you don't know either it's from
Doctor Who yes just a lot of a lot of in
in group knowledge we also found other
indicators of the status hierarchy so
the i'm going to show you this one the
space when they started the space they
had a really great idea which was to
build these walls that gave people a
little bit of privacy but weren't so
high that they separated people from
each other it was really wonderful so
the whole idea was to build community by
keeping these walls down but what have
the high status people do they started
building up so they've created these
fortresses in there people read spacer
they've created these fortresses to get
more status claiming more space they
also you can also read the status map by
where people are located in the space so
the pious status people are in the
center of the space when we got our
rental area you know we rented a space
for a research we were sent to an area
of the maker space that is called the
suburbs so it's very out there and
there's a main thoroughfare that they're
a lot of Tours done at this space a main
thoroughfare that people stick to that
high status corridor this is
love this quote this is the guy with the
tables I don't know what I do I know how
to make all kinds of crazy stuff and MIT
gives me money for that so that's you
know we got a lot of that so um we also
found here that there are two currencies
unlike the food swap and the time bank
in which there's a single currency and
which is a feature of one of the things
we talked about in the paper is viviana
Zelizer concept of a circuit of Commerce
something different than a market or a
hierarchy or a network but its trade
relations among people the idea is that
there's a common currency here there's a
dual currency high status makers trade
amongst themselves for beer so when they
ask each other for favors or to teach
each other how to do things they never
use money that's a polluted currency the
sacred currency is beer but they won't
trade with ordinary people for beer so
if there are people who just got to the
space low status people middle status
people for them they trade with money so
they trade down for cash and amongst
themselves only for beer and it's part
of how you get a lot of robust trading
if there was only beer or only money you
wouldn't have nearly as much trading
because the hi folks are would be
symbolically contaminated by trading
beer with a low status boat right so
they demand this low status currency so
in some ways the maker space is very
very successful because there is a lot
of activity going on there's a lot of
trick teaching skills there's a lot of
helping there's a lot of skill transfer
there's a lot of collaboration and
community and yet it's segregated into
the by the currency segregates the
trading circuits okay let me just let me
just say one or two words about the food
swap and then I'll stop and we'll have
about 20 minutes for conversation
the food swap was is a volunteer effort
started by a few people young
professionals urban professionals one of
the impetus was that they had csa share
subscription farming where they get more
produce than they could use and they
wanted to keep this connection with the
farms going and so they said well I've
got all this you know basil or all this
kohlrabi all this you know what about if
we had a food swap we could prepare
something with then you trade it for
other people of course you know most of
the CSA so giving the citrix s produce
at the same time but never mind anyway
that's their origin myth was to use
their csas and so people come together
they make food and then they trade it
with each other the way it works is it's
a monthly swap there's a silent auction
sort of portion people walk around they
learn about the foods that are on offer
and then they put in bids on bid sheets
and then where there are matches made
people do trades so what is what's what
kind of stuff is getting traded at the
food swap well the first thing is it's
all about homemade food so you can't
take something that you purchased to the
food swap all the food has to be
homemade well what does that really mean
and it turns out that not everyone's
homemade food is acceptable or what they
would call real food or honestly so
there's a big discourse around
authenticity of food real food honest
food local food is important know your
farmer etc one of the things we found
was that consistent standards of
evaluation failed to develop and the the
trading volume was really low in fact
our food swap collapsed in the middle of
our research it just was it had sort of
gotten down to just so few people
although it had a steady influx of new
people coming and every year would host
a big cookie swap for charity and it
would get lots of people to that swab so
it had the ability to actually pull a
lot of people into it because it it had
access to lots of people were interested
in this but in
and it failed and it had to cancel swaps
a lot and you know only the founders
would show up near the end and so forth
and what happened was the criteria for
what were what is a home homemade what
is swappable was highly opaque it was
arbitrary it was shifting now they could
have easily done something about this
they could have put up on the website
this is what we're looking for in the
food swap here are the dues here in the
don'ts etc and people suggested that to
them multiple but they didn't want that
for whatever you know we can speculate
about why they prefer to be have the
food swap be a place where they could
exercise their own foodie distinction
and you know even if it meant that in
the end the food swaps failed so Oh
homemade turned out to be rather opaque
food had to be on the one hand and a
sort of part of the routine of daily
life so stuff that was to kind of
special to like only for special events
didn't do well at the food swap but the
everyday foods had to be authentic and
yet at the same time have exotic
ingredients so no brownies like you
can't bake brownies as one of the
founders like unless they're the most
amazing brownies in the world but
everybody can bake brownies so don't
bring brownies what is the ideal the
ideal was a lime marmalade so a
marmalade is an ordinary thing but it's
a different it's a different flavor it's
not orange marmalade with you know an
orange marmalade wouldn't go but a lime
marmalade would you're not allowed to
bring processed food you're not allowed
to bring Mason food what was the other
one oh if your food has a story with it
it's highly valued so there was a couple
actually they were grad students at MIT
who had a wedding and they made favors
for their you know these people pear
butter no you do know these people
actually yeah okay I don't remember
their names pear butter
it probably was in mason jars pear
butter in mason jars and they had a lot
of favors left over so they brought them
to the food swap it was one of those
popular items ever because it was
connected to their wedding so the
personal dimension of it I think you do
I will get back on that and then mason
jars turn out to be mandatory if you
bring your food in a ziploc bag it will
not trade this was like the beginning of
a mason jar craze okay food swappers
demonstrate competency in the space by
learning unspoken rules of the trade
while the food stop swap is discussed as
egalitarian open spaces they also serve
as arenas for attaining foodie status
and distinction so one of the things
about the food swap is that it's
connected to the gastronomic field which
is a very snobbish field in a way that
the maker space wasn't so much and
that's a whole other you know how then
the status positioning is different in
the two and let me just end with one of
the favorite quotes we have oreo
truffles so this was a new guy now are
the so the the veteran swapper ass now
where the truffles actually made oreo
cookies yes the new would be swapper
enthusiastically answered pleased with
his rya articulation of a store-bought
product into an innovative form oh well
then I won't be able to trade with you
because I can only trade for like really
homemade things like made from scratch
with no preservatives or chemicals or
anything because my friend doesn't eat
processed foods she only eats homemade
things things that she makes completely
herself so here you have a person who's
you know enthusiastic about his
creativity and so forth and he's getting
this really harsh put down by one of the
founders because he hasn't followed the
rules of the swap so let me add end by
just making a few general points good
intentions are not sufficient to create
truly open and accessible sites of
exchange in commerce you need a lot of
explicit attention to the social
dynamics of inequality that dominate in
the you know larger spaces of our world
whether if you're doing a food swap
whether thinking about the gastronomic
field
or if you're thinking about the race and
gender dimensions and so forth the
status positioning can be intense in
these spaces and we have a longer paper
on the maker space in which we basically
argue that the lack of because it's a
totally leveled organization with no
status hierarchy of any kind like most
organizations have some form of status
hierarchy although there's been a lot of
we couch it in terms of the leveling
that's been going on in American
organizations workplaces in general but
when you're in that totally in a world
in which there are no status markers
people will culture will be cultural
capital will rise as a really important
form of status positioning because you
don't have economic capital or social
capital so much to structure and that
that's a whole you know we could talk
about that we've had two outcomes the
failures of exchange in the most
egalitarian circus which I mentioned the
time bank in the food swap the role of a
dual currency system which facilitated
trades in the maker space but which also
institutionalized inequality and this
was that last at that point I just made
that the lack of visible status part
markers led to more competition via
cultural capital in the in the maker
space so let me end there and open it up
for discussion sure yeah I'm wondering
to what extent you think that the fact
that you were interviewing
this city effectiveness I my sense
having moved here three years ago from
West particularly status oriented
metropolitan area and I wonder if even
in say Chicago play out the same way so
I would say this is here the status
competitions are more on culture and
social capital I mean if you compare
Boston to say Dallas or Los Angeles or
so forth there the status competitions
are more about money so I wouldn't say
that it's a it's a more status oriented
place than some some other places in the
country that have different status
competitions so but but I would agree
that there's a lot of social and
cultural capital status competition
you're not to say that there's no
economic capital competition here but
this is a you know where the university
capital of the country cultural capital
really matters here a lot so that is I
think that is will help us see the
levels of status competition that will
affect the level so in Chicago you may
have a lower level compared to here I
think you would probably see some of
these dynamics but in a different way
you know the Midwest also has its own
the way cultural capital works also
varies across a country so there are
regional variations and also I mean one
of the things bourdieu argues is that
the metro poles are the sort of the the
big cities have you know Paris has the
most and then the regional centers have
the next in terms of both economic
capital and cultural capital so we are
in a super high cultural capital area
here so I think it would affect the
level I don't know that it would change
the basic analysis it just you know
there would be less of it it might
present somewhat differently but I don't
think it's the case and I don't think
it's the case
that you wouldn't see this anywhere else
I think you do but you just you would
have to look for it also in somewhat
different ways yes see this somewhere
else you would see it everywhere else
that this you mean is the idea that
people in a supposedly a latarian space
a nonetheless using distinction to
create status hierarchies and position
themselves as rights in ways that people
who should be being brought up by these
rhetorics in fact finders engineering
yeah that's yeah do something a little
bit particular with your work like if
you were to see a new space could you
yes where what type of person would be
the high status person in that space um
yes but I think to some extent will vary
by the type of space so there are some
things that will one of the liked in the
maker space for example people who had
high status and associated field so like
at hacker spaces or people had
connections to some of the high status
institutions in here like the guy who
talks about MIT or the sum of the
robotics people had been in some of the
companies around here so there's some
what we would call sort of
transportation of status from one place
to another and to some how much that
will dominate will depend on sort of how
alternative the field is so the site is
so if you have an innovation that's
really attempting to be very different
it will be sort of harder to just
automatically transfer status from from
one place to another but I do think it's
this is another interesting point I
think and this may speak to your
question to how it may work differently
in some different regions where I mean
one of the questions is how much a new
institution whether it's a you know a
new economic institution of the type
that we're looking at just adopts the
dominant configuration
of capital and status and and so forth
from the fields that it's adjacent to or
connected to and how much it's really
trying to do something different and
that will that will also that will also
matter there are there are maker spaces
that just pretty much adopt the dominant
and so the people who have status there
are the ones with the you know certain
kinds of jobs but here's an interesting
thing about this maker space no one ever
talks about their outset that was a very
rare point someone talking about their
outside job in fact you didn't even
really tell us what it was that this is
a space where people can leave behind
that world and part of what that does is
it doesn't you don't get the status from
that world so then you have to recreate
it you know you have to jockey for it in
a different way um so yes and yet i also
think i'm just not sure how much we know
about a lot of this stuff yet within the
sociological literature this is one of
the first studies that really looks at
this sort of the micro level the
interaction a level so it because you
know board you was kind of looking at a
at a more macro level so i'm not sure
where you know we have that one
prediction in the makerspace paper about
a leveled organization will call up all
this cultural capital competition yeah
take apart that sentence
provocative which one good intentions
are yeah it's official the first part of
the question is what would be sufficient
the second part of a question is what is
a truly open and accessible site and the
third question is if that's true and
what role do quote-unquote good
intentions are these ideologies play in
these spaces if not to do it's in the
second pregnancy well I don't know the
answer to any of those I could speculate
a little bit it's a what would be
sufficient I mean that's a like
sixty-four-thousand-dollar question a
lot of people are wondering about
structure matters so I think well one
thing we learned from the maker space
case was that total lack of structure
led to just rampant status positioning
on the other hand you can get the
structure you can put the structure in
like in the TimeBank case in a way that
really undermines its ability to have a
robust economy so you you know if you
get too far away from the market you may
really have problems if you get too
close to it you're just going to
reproduce the inequalities that are
there in the market I think you need I
mean clearly mean once and this is not
from my work for only or particularly
but I think a lot of work that's been
done on particularly race and gender
reproduction of race and gender
inequality would take the in sort of
more alternative context would take the
view that you have to have a lot of very
intentional process to see the ways in
which these inequalities are reproduced
because a lot of it and this is where
bourdieu is important is very subtle a
lot of it is very subtle and so you have
to you know be aware of the because the
thing about capital cultural capital is
it's the way it's deployed is through in
bourdieu's view is through its
naturalization so it's see
seems like it's natural it doesn't seem
like it's something that to take
something like you know esoteric making
like you wouldn't immediately think of
that oh that's a class strategy to do
something esoteric oh you know maybe
would if you were from like our one guy
we have I didn't read that quote but the
guy the one guy is like you know fixing
furniture and stuff who says no what's
wrong with these people here you know
they never make it has been useful he
sees it but nobody else ever talks about
it so forbore jus capital the deployment
of capital is naturalized so you've got
to go through a process of under really
of a reflexive you know to use a
sociological jargon a more reflexive
process to sort of figure out what are
the ways in which you are deploying your
cultural capital it's like that you know
all that stuff about unpacking white
privilege it's pretty much just the same
thing that people don't see it and so I
think they clearly have to go through
that and then you you've got to figure
out you got to figure out what you can
put in place structures that you can put
in place to kind of try and minimize it
yeah you see if you see these findings
in context of the kind of historical
changes from which they emerged so a lot
of these like alternative economic
practices emerged in the moment
post-2008 financial crisis when people
were trying to rethink their
relationship to the economy and this
kind of like there was a massive
cultural trend around around rethinking
economy isn't coming up with alternative
alternative ways of being in the economy
and at alternative ways of relating to
people and also a major crisis of
institutions of both financial plan
institutions and democratic institutions
including things that would you know
state-based institutions that would
traditionally provide social safety nets
and that sort of thing and so I wonder
if you see
if you see this or and and including the
kind of status based findings that you
described in relationship to kind of
these broader cultural trends and if you
see that if you see an evolution in
among your informant from a moment of
like optimism and excitement and
rallying around the potential here and
then moving into a kind of
disillusionment or a kind of a paradox
formation I guess and then also and so
yeah and like just how does it relate to
kind of larger institutions or generally
and then also I know hold on one second
oh my why the second one but if I'm
gonna forget the first one okay ya know
that like in your own thinking and your
own funding around this kind of work
there's been a move from a kind of
exploration of possibilities to a kind
of critique it seems and so I I was just
also wondering if also in terms of your
own thinking how is this shift its
Jeff's taking place yeah okay so um and
I think my answer to this also will come
back you know maybe a better answer to
yours so def so definitely the the crash
had an impact we have a lot of people in
our sample particularly in the less so
for these the nonprofit's because
there's no monetary benefits here for
the most part the little bit you could
get in the time bank but for the
for-profit sites where people are able
to monetize their assets and so forth
and their labor time we have a lot of
people with student dead or who are
unemployed and so forth so that that's
definitely there and I do think for the
nonprofit sites there that moment of
possibility after the crash what is
important the cynical interpretation of
what's going on is that this is a group
of people who were experiencing downward
mobility as a result of all these
economic changes
and our kind of mobilizing to create new
spaces that will give them opportunity
and status and privilege and so forth so
that's the you know that's the more
cynical way of doing it thinking about
it the the less cynical way and in that
in that work interpretation that the
rhetorics in the discourse are very thin
and I think you know we can definitely
say that about some of the for-profits
the rhetorics the the progressive
rhetoric is thin with the nonprofits its
a mix i think but i guess the other way
to answer this question which connects
with this is it was naive to expect that
it would be possible to build something
very alternative out of this moment
without much more history and practice
of really progressive solidarity and
progressive practice because basically
these are you know the people who are
coming into a lot of these are people
who have don't have a history of
progressive practice it's not like you
know we hear all there's so much talk
about Mondragon you know in the
co-operative movement and so with
Mondragon I mean this is a place that
had an enormous history of solo turistic
relationships a really strong working
class as strong you know other
institutions or the parts of northern
Italy now that have really vibrant
sharing economies that really are
sharing but these are places that have
decades and decades of progressive
practice so you know to take people who
really have very little experience in
that who have mostly very
individualistic upbringing and practice
and expect them to be able to
automatically create solo teristic
institutions is naive I think so I mean
that may be part of what we're talking
about here but the but but i do think
that which is not to be so pessimistic
as to say it can ever happen it's just
it's not going to happen overnight i now
it
terms of the sort of trajectory of
opinion about the sharing economy I
would say there that certainly the the
discourse and for many of the
progressive people who got involved in
it they saw a lot of promise they now
have a you know feel very disappointed
for me personally I would say you know
I'm kind of in between those extremes I
mean I maybe am less optimistic than I
was when I started but I was not ever
you know jumping up and down about the
for-profit part of it and that's part of
why we structured our work the for
profits and the nonprofit's because I
always felt that the for-profits you
know had a pretty high likelihood of
going to you know what I called in my
book business as usual but basically
very sort of normative relations and
their ability to create something really
profoundly progressive and alternative
you know there's always a question there
I mean I am pretty I mean I do feel I do
like this whole movement toward
cooperative play form cooperativism and
so forth and I think that that is
something that actually could you know
maybe move us in that direction Mary I
think you had your hand up Oh time for
one more question I don't want to steal
except okay talk to you again so maybe
it's not two hands go up solidarity yeah
okay so um thank you for your talk that
was really cool I just wanted to kind of
follow up on something that you just
mentioned about maybe one of the more
cynical interpretations would be about
people in a time of downward mobility
kind of seizing another path towards
some kind of power status for privilege
um I was wondering if the people that
you talked with um spent time talking in
a reflexive way about the ways that they
wielded power on whether in a formal or
get sounds like almost entirely in an
informal way where if even the
discussion of that itself was tabby this
is something that seems to pop up a lot
in
people who are putting together kind of
digital shared spaces where they'll talk
uncomfortably about their rules and kind
of play down the way that they enforce
what happens on their sites and wonder
if there's something analogous
discomfort with power and ability to
address it happening in the sense that
you're looking at um okay so just the
caveat to my answer is that we we don't
have I mean in this sample and then a
lot of the work we're not oh we did some
interviews with the people who actually
have formal power in these sites for the
most part we're just talking to ordinary
users okay I mean some of them might be
high stab obviously we've talked a lot
of high status users i would say people
were not particularly uncomfortable
about that so for example in the
TimeBank interviews when people kind of
realize the contradictions of their own
position it wasn't like oh my i can't
talk about that they were sort of oh wow
that's interesting you know it was sort
of more of a self revelation and and so
they were kind of open to that because a
lot of these people are I mean I sort of
you know maybe caricatured them a little
bit a lot of them are very earnest
people with good intentions I would say
the most kind of the least on that scale
or maybe some of the really high status
makers who are you know they will talk
about and they do talk about power
because there's a lot of power actually
there's a lot of conflict in that space
around governance and and formal power
and they're they're perfectly happy to
talk about it so it's not I wouldn't say
they're reticent about that yeah so
