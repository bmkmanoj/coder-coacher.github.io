invented the laser printer was a couple
doors down the guy that invented
computer graphics memory was was my boss
and it's like wow there's so many people
here that are just amazing in the
history of computers computer science
and be able to hear and be here and hang
out with them and learn from them has
been sort of the greatest treat of all
this is an incredible place I've been in
research and also computer science
research for many many years a few
decades and there's no place like MSR
there's so much stuff going on here I
mean people we have the brightest people
in many different areas
computer vision speech natural language
operating systems and somehow we
actually put these all together in ways
that you just don't see anywhere else
it's really unique they work because
they have this passion to to to figure
out this new idea and bring it forth to
the world and it's just amazing
