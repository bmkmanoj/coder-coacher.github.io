Microsoft Research I study software
development teams and build tools to
help them work better together the
project that I'm working on right now
comes from an observation that there are
teams that are mostly located together
except for one person who's located
somewhere else and the problem is that
person is out of sight and out of mind
now what we've done is created a device
which we call an embodied social proxy
that represents that person in the team
space it allows that person to
participate more fully in meetings but
even between meetings gives them a
physical presence i am george robertson
I'm a principal researcher at microsoft
research about a year and a half ago I
moved from the Redmond lab to northeast
harbor maine when i made that move i
needed to keep working with the team
that i was working with in redmond and
that posed some problems Gina vanilla
and I started a project originally
called George in the box where we
created a laptop with a webcam fat
laptop to meetings so that I actually
had a place at the table at the meeting
that wasn't quite good enough because I
couldn't see everybody room and I
couldn't see what was on the whiteboard
in the room so what we did was we gave
George a lot of different things to give
him a better presence in the meeting the
cameras allow him to see the meeting
better so this top one is a
pan-tilt-zoom camera that allows him to
see the person who's speaking what's on
the projector or what's being scribbled
on the whiteboard the next one down is a
fisheye and that allows him to see
everybody in the meeting room all the
time the large monitor gives him a
roughly life-size presence so he has a
seat at the table a speakerphone gives
him a voice that can be heard across a
room and allows him to pick up everybody
who might be talking even in a large
meeting the whole thing is mounted on a
cart that we can take from meeting to
meeting or between meetings as lives in
george's office here in red
and in between meetings what's shown is
the person's calendar and their
availability this is John's card over
here and we could just click the one
button to give them a call hi guys and
that's the embodied social proxies
