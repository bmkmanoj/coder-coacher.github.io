and this is dancing crow farm one of the
world's problems is Ian how do you
double the yield by 2050 to feed the
growth of the population in the world
this is a project that we recently
started what we want to do is we want to
enable data driven for me
the first goal is to give a real-time
view of the farm real-time pulse of the
farm to the farmer saying hey this is
what your farm is doing right now so how
do you even connect these farms to the
Internet it's so far remote the cell
carriers are very little incentive to
provide connectivity in the farms the
system that we have deployed here is
measuring soil temperature and moisture
and it's coming from this sensor here
what you see is a white-spaces device
the idea that we had was a farmer buys a
white space router plug it in the farm
and your entire farm is connected now
you can connect multiple devices and
connectivity is cheap so you can
actually deploy many more sensors in the
farm you could have a dense deployment
of sensors getting real-time view of all
the parts of the farm not only your soil
and moisture data but this is a high
bandwidth connection you can connect
cameras get real-time views from the
farm once you have all this data you
could then analyze the data to predict
what the future will look like I'm
actually really looking forward to how
the process will change this last year
has been mainly a data gathering
information collecting year for the
Microsoft research team I'm really
looking forward to seeing what research
they've gathered this year putting that
together with what I think is going to
happen next year and make predictions
for what I should plant when and where
