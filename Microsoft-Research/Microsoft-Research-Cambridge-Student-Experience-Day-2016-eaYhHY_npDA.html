of the stuff that's going on a high
profile world leading center like
Microsoft Research it's absolutely
incredible I mean I had no clue that our
technology was actually at that stage
it's completely mind-boggling
it's amazing computer science work is
done inside buildings inside companies
and as a school child you wouldn't
necessarily get access especially kind
of deep access to find out what's really
happening
the idea for the day is for us to give
you an insight into what working in
research here means and for you to
experience some of the technology that
has and welcome out there that not only
is it just like the standard computer
stuff you also get a much wider range so
you see stuff like UX and user
experience VR and AR and also like some
really wild stuff like the bio-computer
another fold up DNA into specific shapes
another thing that was really really
good was the AI minecraft that's a
really interesting concept because like
they were saying it means that they can
practice artificial intelligence without
harming anybody in without causing any
kind of destruction the experience is
amazing and I made some friends as well
and it was really nice just thinking
about other people's ideas they were
talking to each other about careers
they're getting careers advice what
degrees do I take if I want to do this
what do I do and I know getting really
good quality answers people are really
open and friendly you know for like I
could ask any questions at any point at
the time I didn't understand something
it's a really interesting culture I
think because when everybody around you
is really intelligent you kind of feel
inspired to think about things in a more
intelligent way there's so much
opportunity here everywhere from being a
designer to working with machines
there's just so much choice you really
get the sense that you're on the
forefront of the new technologies that
in the next few years will change our
daily lives expand your horizons and it
makes you think about competing in a
ways that you haven't thought of it
before if your teacher and you've got
the students who look like or sound like
they might be interested in computer
science career then come to some of that
Microsoft will give them a broad vision
of what that could be please watch out
on social media on Twitter on Facebook
and on myself comm research
announcements will be made there to get
your children to come here
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
