lectures freely available
we're gonna we're going to have a
relatively short session I've got three
people that I asked to come talk because
I thought they were doing and thinking
interesting things about populations and
data that we're off the radar the piece
of this that I've been thinking about a
lot is the people who choose not to be
on social media or whose stuff is masked
in some ways whether the people who we
can't study the way they're using it
because they aren't necessarily using it
and the so I've got three people that
are going to be talking as a part of
this zeynep to feki who you may remember
the K comes before the sea and her name
is going to is going to talk about some
of the research she's done on college
students and this particularly those who
opted not to participate in sites like
Facebook Lee Rainie from Pew Internet is
going to talk about some of the data
they have on on what people are using or
choosing not to use the the people who
are taking breaks from social media
things like that and matt buchanan from
BuzzFeed is going to talk about some of
the some of you may have seen the piece
that that he wrote in response to Alexis
madrigals the dark social concept and he
wrote a really interesting response to
that that I wanted to talk about in
terms of what we are not seeing in the
various statistics and things that are
out there so I'm going to turn this over
to zina on the way we're going to do
this is they're each going to talk for
10 to 15 minutes and then we'll take
some time for you to be able to ask
questions of them before we go on to the
next person so you can sit there it's
fine so okay
it is indeed my name right there and I
don't actually care about the K before
see it was just getting amusing how many
misspellings I was getting and I i'm
currently at the at center for
information technology policy and
Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton but
I'm an assistant professor at University
of North Carolina and I used to come to
events like these bunch of smart folks
and give like the strongest presentation
I could give about something I was more
sure about and people would go and then
that would be kind of be it then I
realized I'm wasting all the brainpower
I am going to present about stuff I'm
not sure about I'm completely going on a
limb I might really be stupid about this
and somebody give me feedback and
correct me and tell me you don't know
what you're talking about i think this
is a much better use of our the kind of
smart people here so what I want to look
at is was my kind of just four or five
here thread I've been thinking about
who's not on social media and also I've
been thinking a lot about why do we keep
discussing whether social media is
isolating or not whether it produces
loneliness or not whether it creates you
know this effect of more disintegrated
society because the data the empirical
data at the national level at pretty
much every country we have says that's
really not the case if anything there
are strong effects that seem to come
from television maybe suburbanization
but not social media but the debate
never keeps dying it was just a couple
months ago I think Atlantic had the
if a facebook making you'll only sort of
a cover story correct and it just keeps
coming up and up and up and teams not to
be the story seems I'm killable by any
amount of data so I started thinking why
is this story I'm killable by data I
mean what's the what do we need
beheading midget you know silver bullets
and I thought maybe this was a cohort
effect maybe this was just sort of a
generational effect and I've been
thinking about this and being a college
professor I get the survey of my captive
audience college students occasionally
and I noticed that in my surveys that it
was not a cohort effect that I kept
finding this persistent thirty to forty
percent of the cohorts I was surveying
that said I don't really like
interacting on social media I don't it's
just there's something not real about I
would survey the meiosis questions i
would get these percentages i would
track them that I would interview them i
would do you know more systematic focus
groups or more ethnographic studies i
would also just chat with my students in
the corridors i would find this non
cohort effect pretty persistent so I
thought okay maybe there's something
here so my early studies when I looked
at my so early days I would find about
ten percent non-users and they would be
a mix off late adopters immigrants
people who just come and something I am
going to call cyber a social folks and
I'm going to explain that a little bit
later but I did write about that a
little bit in a paper grooming gossip
facebook and myspace there was with
myspace back then a recent survey a
friend of mine ran a survey again in a
college and added a few of my questions
about this and he had a yes/no question
for are you on facebook I I didn't see
designing the survey a group said that's
not going to work so we have an end of
three hundred and three and one no so
there's no variation I can't do anything
with it it's kind of funny there was one
nun adopter in the whole survey yes it
was a convenience sample as a regular
college so Facebook is pretty common now
so what are the some of the effects of
adoption
that we know about there's a cohort
effects right my grandmother's not on
Facebook she's just not going to use it
but for example she also never used to
talk on the phone with me because she
grew up at a time where you got charged
by the minute so you'd call her and
she'd say hi Zeynep bye I'll see you so
maybe like thanks grandma you know and I
finally convinced her you know I'm not
getting charged by the minute which I
was lying at the time because it was an
international call but I wanted to talk
to her and she finally started chatting
and she kind of got used to it so it's a
there's a lot of covert affects people
who grow up with the technology might
not be very familiar it's still true so
that's fine there are social norms so we
have a lot of this odd our cohort they
are the 303 they're all on facebook
except one and I'm going to go check if
that's a data entry error clearly that's
a big social norm and you talk to
college students a lot of them will say
it is very hard not to be on facebook i
am recently seeing what I call the
refusenik crowd they're so cool they're
not on so you know Facebook they're so
above it all but that's a recent thing
and it usually requires a heck a lot of
a lot of social capital to begin with so
social norms political in some places I
do a lot of research on social movements
Middle East in some places there's a lot
of politics involving choosing a
platform you know being on Twitter on
China is a very political statement you
know being on facebook on Iran and in
Egypt i watched Twitter and Facebook
completely change meaning over the sort
of past two or three years so sometimes
it's a political statement and yes we
have this and I'm just sort of pointing
out some of the things we do know but
this is the part I'm going on a limb out
on a limb I think there might be
personality factors we have under study
that go into not necessarily the
adoption per se but how people use these
tools and what they get out of it what
they don't get out of it and I'm going
to talk about one that I've been sort of
playing with for years I don't have
anything conclusive but again such a
smart crowd i'm going to put it out
there and look like an idiot so I came
out
with the sort of working definition of
people who are unable or unwilling to
interact with search on social media as
if it were like same kind of thing as
face-to-face not the same of course but
as if it were a fully social interaction
i'm going to explain what i mean by that
i came up with this after talking to
lots of people who did not want to
socialize using these tools and yes i
made that up so there we go what is it
to explain let's go back and remember
something about face-to-face sociality
it is not it's very primal if you show a
four day old baby or a week old baby
faces like just like figures arranged
like a smiling face that baby will react
differently to that face then if you
have the same sort of figures arranged a
little differently if you have a crowd
of people and there's an angry person in
the crowd your brain will pick that up
very quickly there's a certain things in
our brain it's just who we are as human
beings we're social creatures and one of
the things in a lot of experiments if
you compare three-year-olds book chimps
chimps are better at math at three the
only thing three-year-olds are better
our social interaction reading faces all
those kinds of things there's a huge
amount of evidence on how primal and
important and significant and evocative
and in many ways primary face-to-face
interaction is in its universal now text
social requires a certain kind of hack
seeing words like flat on a screen and
having that same sense of presence it
requires a certain kind of hack and to
explain what kind of hack it is let me
give you guys an example of one you
probably don't ever think about which is
reading reading speech for linguists if
you talk to lingus for them speech is
this clearly oral thing language is an
oral thing it is nothing to do with your
visual system speech and language and
hearing yes you know we have deaf people
and they have a visual language but that
too is a kind of a hack but the parts of
your brain that are involved in this are
your speech site but we
can read and have that be transferred
into language that is a recent invention
it requires a lot of training for us to
do that's why we put kids through you
know K through 12 and maybe the first
four or five years are just getting
fluent in this thing called reading
since I academics tend to be very
literate people we don't really always
sort of think about what an effort it is
and the heck doesn't always work we have
people with dyslexia we have other kinds
of reading difficulties if you have
experienced that it just doesn't come
together you can't really use your
visual system as easily so maybe I
thought dyslexia is when the heck
doesn't work so maybe I thought there's
something to being able to evoke the
social presence through text that's also
the similar kind if you just don't get
the sense of somebody being present
there fully I don't know so the evidence
I have for this is that it's not a
cohort effect i have tested you know
I've looked at this as many age groups
as I can yes it is more you know in
older people who didn't grow up with
technology but it is not a cohort effect
I have interviews and surveys with kids
have grown up with this technology and I
see the stark divide some of them say
yes you know totally I can interact with
someone online socially and that's fine
with me and others who are like until I
am face to face that text is just hollow
it just does not work so I don't think
it's a cohort effect though although
there are it's not a proxy for anything
on the classic Big Five personality it's
not a proxy for extraversion it's not
extra vers versus introverts it's not a
lot of things that you think it might be
that you know personality things
sociality things that psychologists
measure routinely we have tested this
and it doesn't correspond to any of
these it's not a proxy for social
capital I interview these and I look at
their sort of friendship networks I look
at a social they are and there are some
you know being at the modern world as it
is shaped there are some disadvantages
if you're not very adept at interacting
online but they have similar levels of
friend that they see offline they you
know the sort of the people who don't
like socializing online are not
necessarily more or less lonely in fact
you it's very hard to find effects even
though the divided on whether or not you
like socializing online is so start it's
not even a proxy for whether you use
social media because as we saw on that
last one there was one nun adopter
people who don't like to interact
socially online are also if they're in a
place where this is the social norm
they're on Facebook they just use it
more instrumentally you know they might
post stuff they might be it's more of a
conscious thing I got to do this and
there's an instrumental aspect to it
it's not as expressive socially and also
the people who don't like to socialize
online i have found no evidence is tech
phobia they are very happy to do their
online banking and everything else so
what else could it be a proxy off where
is there a personality trait that is
emergent with these new tools that we
are overlooking how should we test this
or am I just completely off base this
i'm seeing this effect but it's actually
X or Y or Z so it's basically my plea to
prove me wrong that this is nothing
thank you
question so where we gonna take
questions directly or at the end okay
poor is different types of usage parent
if you work today yeah instrumental a it
so users it corresponds with
instrumental versus expressive you so
the people who are on the I don't want
to do this you know a I have like a
little scale for it and the people who
score high on the cyber a social scale
they will use it but they won't do
things like they won't sit and chat with
people unless they really have to they
don't get a social feeling out of it
there's there's there's lurkers
obviously they always happen and but you
see a strong breakdown in people who are
active but not interactive on social
media or not I haven't really know
because I'm looking at things like
Facebook where it's just I I don't
really see I haven't really tested
Twitter on this much partly because
Twitter answer a young groups there's a
lot of confounding factors it's kind of
hard to be it's easier when it's a
universal thing like Facebook because
everybody's on it the second thing I
haven't tested that Mimi was suggesting
earlier is things like video talking
over video becoming more it's that's a
story rare thing if that became
universal I could tested because of what
I'm trying to test its best tested on
things that they're all using yeah else
what if this isn't a proxy of anything
what if it's just kind of like a random
personal preference toward something I
mean what
well how is it quite interesting because
I mean you you guys have seen oh you
guys have seen that there's a recent
book thing you know this is a world
designed for extra roots and can we have
some introverted power and I'm like hell
for now if I'm extrovert when they put
me there but then I want to hide under
the table sometimes and so I get that it
may well be that it's a world
increasingly more designed for the cyber
social we might if it does turn out to
be something independent there might
have new disadvantages advantages it
could have consequences for sure yeah
books were scarce we would be allowed
not as a performance of our ability to
read
you can go the way back to you late
francis of assisi you or less IAM it's
going to be like he was known for
reading privately and that was for
marked on it was an unusual thing to do
so sort of winter and then now it's what
we are going to read privately that's
how we think of especially we're talking
about books you know we thought think of
that it's like facebook but i'm
wondering if maybe one way of talking
about this this some of the tensions
that you're talking about is it this
shift to reading it publicly again sort
of having this meeting me something
collective and sharing so perhaps people
one way of thinking about these people
block out it's as a reference for being
frequently that's a good question we
could look into whether there's more
bookworms among them or not you had your
hand up i have them that it's not
skiller literacy i have i mean there are
many in fact there's lots of people that
i know who are very tech literate and
who's still are like i am not going to
talk with you online you know it yep
just a couple of weight first one is
obviously the discussion of the primacy
of speech over writings can go back to
places like there's like two more
thousand years ago the thing that I'm
kind of interested in is someone who
doesn't really object they can't stand
when you split up all the time I'm like
wondering about like you know is there a
just sort of self-selection of like
weird you know I have people on facebook
i don't want to talk to you know so i
don't go there and I don't engage in
that participation is my cousin's
daughter seven what's awesome about
things I've been really difficult about
communicating broad context collapse
question that I mean a lot of people
face but and I'm looking at the college
students where there's a lot of people
they do want to talk to that it is true
there are difficulties but you know even
for costumes because now you got parents
on Facebook and all of that and
everybody's trying to negotiate that but
I wouldn't really found that come up
I've done a lot of interviews I haven't
really had people because of you were
worried about that usually figure out
the limited profile saying and then they
go on you know to escape parents they go
to Twitter to talk with they find
strategies to keep doing it but not
Facebook so I haven't really encountered
I am
sort of is it because I want a few more
folks are some more precision in some of
the terms using so purchase a school
night presentation would be you know it
could be creating the visible
representations it could be you know
sending a tweet it could be having some
comment to appear on Facebook but
participation can equally be listening
and I think we could replace the word
lurking but listening channel gate
properties but I think that how it seems
to me like you're thinking about
sociality is creating things that can be
observed or measured and i think that
there's an act of being present as a
form of participation that to me doesn't
seem present in your conceptualization
of sociality i'll just add listening as
a concept for social and in the comment
the knowing Mike's idea if he can't
stand talk these people obviously I'm
trying to get at here is more it's
usually something when I'm talking with
people about this is when somebody
you're chatting with someone or
interacting with Facebook do you feel
like it's a social interaction does it
feel real I mean I'm just sort of giving
up these are these are the worst people
used to me so that's what i use and
usually they describe it as it just
doesn't feel real so i am talking about
the interactive component not talking
about observing listening and you're
right that can be very social i am just
looking at this thing
that feeling have an ability to detect
Cylons that are then absolutely i think
you know they can it's a proxy for a
finely-tuned ability to detect sidelines
and we round to you actually we have a
paper coming out about adult on users
Facebook and one of the things that but
they can be content is that they
mentioned not getting value out of
facebook we just didn't see the
usefulness so it's eating value so what
are instead of like a personality factor
website you're describing it as a
motivational factor which is I have
certain types of things I've had to
accomplish with my life and Facebook or
social media may or may not be an
appropriate way to express that I feel
like that what about after that I mean I
that I find that even controlling for
that I see this effect so I mean yes
obviously that's why I want record
affect us and that obviously there are
lots of factors for adoption and non
adoption I'm just saying are we
overlooking one did you have
like one thing they said was they asked
akid to brush my teeth and they say most
people will you know a kid with
Asperger's won't you gesture so there's
certain things that they don't and they
can teach them
to better really just I got dumped at
the question that you're raising her
there really might be all sorts of
things that I'm not aware of that people
in other fields might say you know what
that corresponds to something
so you're a factor that you're
yeah you're not really
yeah that's absolutely sure the
difficulty is the other fact platforms
have so much confounding I'm thinking
about the same thing I'm thinking yeah
absolutely the mouse because just as
that longer corrupt practices I didn't
think that facebook is very specific
sociability and is not across
Farber
so my cyber a sociality questions are
not Facebook specific but what i have
done is sort of to geek more out on the
methodology is that i have tested them
among the facebook users which in the
last one turned out to be hundred
percent so my questions don't ask them
about facebook use I just have been
using the facebook adopted cohorts to
weed out people who are maybe not
adopting any of this and there's almost
nobody in my cohort that's on Twitter
and not on Facebook in fact I'm having
difficulty finding anybody who's not on
facebook at all so but yes absolutely
next time I'm doing qualitative
questioning I'm going to be asking more
about none just range of things yes
and the ways that about two-thirds of
them were actively disconnecting or
limiting their their iphone use not
totally but they were saying like this
is so overwhelming and it can take over
so much i'm going to actively disconnect
but they express it in terms of identity
and it was a specific strategy they do
dislike I have a I'm a natural more
natural person I want to get back to
nature they think you just like I'm a I
will fill some person
this is fragmenting my life but
expressing in terms of identity was
actually a strategy to make it more
scene for immutable fly solution twenty
percent of my sample said that at one
point and there they deactivated their
facebook profile which kind of blew my
mind as a number 20 / they had you know
exams they broke up with someone so
there's a lot of strategizing but I'm
talking about not using it but just not
being comfortable villa just kind of
idea whether you can get like let's just
say at your university you can kind of
compile a lot of these people together
and have them wish to say hang out on
internet relay chat together in
relationship to a classes you're taking
as a kind of control group or something
or a different sort of a cohort and
different media listening to an MRI at
the same time that's kind of what I'm
thinking just for a day you know an
entire semester as well did that can get
at some of the interesting questions as
to whether its personality affordances
these sorts of issues
thank you so much they not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
