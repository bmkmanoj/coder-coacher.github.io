hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
thank you so much for coming my name is
Amy Draves and I am delighted to welcome
William Gibson back to the Microsoft
Research visiting speaker series he will
be discussing his new novel the
peripheral bill would like to be known
for more than the terms he's coined or
for the inaccurate eccentricities
attributed to him he has written several
screenplays in television episodes and
has authored numerous short stories and
books including neuromancer pattern
recognition and zero history neuromancer
was the first novel to win the top three
science fiction prizes the Hugo the
nebula and the philip philip k dick
award please join me in giving him a
very warm welcome ok with no further ado
although i should say that I've scarcely
read any of this yet because this is
publication day and the first day of the
tour and it's like it's the first time I
hear it myself and it can be weird it
can be wonderful by me for me it can be
like whoa what could i right but anyway
it's all a process of acceptance really
because now it's now it's set in stone
but I'm starting I'm starting to suspect
that this is not an easy book to give
readings from because it's a long book
made up of lots and lots of little
chapters and the first hundred pages or
so are going to be like heavy going for
someone who's
someone who doesn't have pretty much a
native culture of reading reading this
sort of this sort of fiction because
there's there's no explanation of
anything anything that's going on and
neither of the two the two protagonists
who are in a sense in in different
worlds ever thinks about the technology
in their world nor in fact do they
understand how it works just as most
people in our world don't understand how
a cell phone a cell phone works so
you're seeing everything through this
character's point of view and she she
takes it she takes it all all for
granted and all I'll say about her is
that she's living maybe 15 or 20 years
from now somewhere it's never specified
where in the United States it's
apparently more or less southeastern I
didn't want the state to be identifiable
from from the text and none of the her
town remains unnamed and the other town
names in her state or imaginary as far
as I know if so it's no place in
particular every review says it's a
different place like it'sit's Alabama
it's Arkansas it's Virginia it's West
Virginia it's not really any place in
particular but I think it's probably
undoubtably colored
my childhood growing up in southwestern
Virginia and this is a character named
Flynn and this is the story of how she
got the online gamer handle easy ice and
what she does what she'd been doing for
a living she quits gaming for a living
because of what happens in this chapter
unstuck her in time day sleeping in her
bedroom how old was she 7 17 27 was it
dusk or dawn couldn't tell by the light
outside checked her phone evening the
house silent her mother probably asleep
out through the smell of her
grandfather's 50 years of National
Geographic shelved in the hall
downstairs she found lukewarm coffee in
the pot on the stove then went out back
for his shower in the fading light son
had warmed the water just right came out
of the stall wrapped in Burton's old
bathrobe rubbing her hair with a towel
ready to dress for the job something
she'd gotten from Burton in the Corps
that you didn't do things in the clothes
you set around in you got yourself
squared away then your intended to when
she'd been Dwight's recon point she's
made sure she got cleaned up dotted
she'd be doing that again again even
though it was the best money she'd made
she didn't like gaming not the way
medicine and Janice did she'd done it
for the money got so good at one
particular rank and mission
an operation north wind that Dwight
wouldn't have anybody else except that
he would by now she wanted to be sharp
tonight not just for the job she wanted
to see as much as she could have that
London maybe it was a game she could get
into Burton said it wasn't the shooter
she wanted to know more about the woman
see more of how she lived she went back
upstairs dug through the clothes piled
on the armchair found her newest black
jeans which was still really black and
the short sleeve black shirt from when
she'd worked at coffee Jones sort of
military patch pockets and those strap
things on the shoulders she taken the
coffee Jones embroidery off left the
Flynn and read script over the left
pocket her sneakers didn't work with
black but they were all she had she was
planning to have makin fab her some
funny ones but she hadn't found any she
really liked for him to copy back in the
kitchen she made herself a ham and
cheese sandwich snapped it into
Tupperware bent her phone around her
left wrist and headed down to the
trailer in the dark listening to the new
kissing cranes track Leon ringer before
the chorus she left it on her wrist hey
he said get him out yet alright sorry
hey she said get him out yet Holmes
getting ready to let them all go Leon
said Luke's decided the Lord's works
about done for now so what have you been
doing she asked the dog he said
shot a bunch of pool slept in the car
kept my ass off the street you talked to
Burton again she asked no he said they
put them all in the center of the track
at west davis high i could go up in the
bleachers and watch him playing cards or
eating MREs of sleeping not much point
maybe she thought it was dull enough to
keep Burton from going up there next
time but she doubted it when they let
him out she said you get him to call me
will do Leon said his kissing cranes
came back on she saw the tube of hand
sanitizer on the door of the composting
toilet it was covered with Q arse of
requisition numbers their ink starting
to fade but she had already used the
toilet in the house as she opened the
trailers door it struck her that Burton
never locked it didn't even have a lock
nobody was coming in without him asking
she had forgotten how hot it would get
sitting closed all day Leon wanted to AC
it but Burton wasn't interested he
usually wasn't there in the daytime
maybe her shirt and jeans hadn't been a
good idea she put the sandwich in the
fridge got the windows open as far as
she could a gold and black spider had
started spinning a web across one of the
foam tunnels outside she tidied up a
little straightening things as she moved
around the Chinese chair tried to adjust
itself for her she wasn't sure she'd
want to live with that but when she
finally sat down on it it was just right
took her phone off Bennett to her
preferred controller angle waved it
above the display checked badger
shailene was already back at fab still
showing anxiety and Burton was now
indicated off map which turned out to be
the hefty Mart parking lot in davisville
where she which she guessed would be
filled with big white homeland trucks
one of them with Burton's phone locked
up in it she frowned Holmes would know
that she'd just checked that
which was okay what wasn't okay would be
if they noticed that her phone was funny
nothing to be done about it though she
got out of Bajor and back into the
searches she had run for London the
night before she kept hoping Burtonwood
phone that they'd already let him out
but really it felt they would from what
Leon said so she kept clicking deeper
into random london city in the game was
London for sure but was something bigger
and harder looking grown up out of it
when it was time she got the login out
of the tomahawk case waved a finger for
milagros Coldiron SA and entered the
string this time she'd planned what
she'd look at going up she got a closer
look at the van as the copter emerged
more like an armored car than a van sort
of heavy shoulders like Connor strike
the base she'd come out of was Square
and dark she heard the voices urgent
still and just as impossible to
understand same time of day she'd
arrived before late duck late dusk
wetter clouds the building's black
bronze faced dough with condensation
next she located the street she had
noticed before the one that seemed to be
paved was something like glass lit from
underneath water under there moving
looked for vehicles seeing three as the
counter at ten o'clock ticked off the
20th floor the voices were gone she
first noticed it the gray thing as she
passed the 23rd a dry gray against the
wet dark metal color of dead skin pulled
from a blister size of a child's
backpack then she was past it giving her
full attention to a check in three
directions point recons
I'll big dark powers same height far
apart in their grid across the older
City hers most likely one of them no
whale thing in the sky now gaming having
taught her to pay attention to anything
that didn't sit she tried to get a quick
second look down cam at the backpack
couldn't find it it overtook and passed
her as she reached the 37th floor moving
that way it no longer reminded her of a
backpack but of the black egg case of an
almost extinct animal called a skate
that she'd seen on a beach in South
Carolina an alien looking rectangle with
a single twisted horn at each corner
tumbling straight up the building now in
a smooth sequence of sticky footed
somersaults caught itself with the two
tips of whichever pair of horns or legs
was leading flipped over then propelled
itself higher with the parent had just
used to grip the surface following it up
cam she tried to rise more quickly but
that still wasn't under her control lost
sight of it again maybe there had been
away for it to enter the building she'd
watched making print little pneumatic
BOTS like big leeches that moved
something like that but slower her
mother called a skate case a mermaid's
purse but Burton said the local people
had called them Devils handbags it
looked like it ought to be dangerous
poisonous but it wasn't kept an eye out
for the thing the rest of the way up to
the 56th floor where she found the same
balcony folded down but the window
frosted disappointing guessed she'd
missed the party but maybe she could get
an idea how it had gone bugs didn't seem
to be around whatever had kept the ride
up like an elevator was gone now she ran
a quick perimeter
check hoping for another window but
nothing had changed no bugs either back
to the frosted glass gave it five
minutes there five more than ran another
perimeter on the far side a great she
hadn't noticed before was steaming she
was starting to miss the bugs down
camera a very large vehicle with a
single headlight went by fast she just
gotten around to the window again when
it depolarized and there was the woman
saying something to someone she couldn't
see flynn stopped let the gyros hold her
there no sign there had ever been a
party room didn't look the same like all
the little BOTS had been moving serious
furniture the long table was gone now
there were armchairs a couch rugs softer
lighting the woman wore striped pajama
bottoms and a black t-shirt Flynn
guessed she'd only recently gotten out
of bed because she had the bed head you
can only have with hair that good check
for bugs she reminded herself but they
still weren't there the woman laughed as
if the person Flynn couldn't see had
said something had that been her ass
against the window the time before was
she talking to the man who kissed her or
tried to add that worked out after all
the party great and then they'd spent
the night together she forced herself to
do another perimeter a slow one watching
for bugs the runaway backpack anything
the steam had gone and now she couldn't
see where the great had been that gave
her the feeling that the building was
alive maybe conscious with the woman
inside it laughing high up in the
bugless night thinking that she felt
close heat in the trailer sweat
trickling darker now so few lights in
the city and none at all on the big
black towers coming back around she
found them standing at the window
looking out
arm around her just that much taller
than she was like a model from an ad
where they didn't want to stress
ethnicity dark hair and the start of a
beard to match expression cold the woman
spoke he answered and the coldness Flynn
had seen was gone the woman beside him
wouldn't have seen it at all he wore a
dark brown robe you smile a lot she
thought part of the glass in front of
them was sliding sideways and as it did
a skinny horizontal rod rose from the
forward edge of the ledge bringing up a
quivering soap bubble the rod stopped
rising bubble became greenish glass she
remembered the SS officer when she had
worked for Dwight face of the man at the
window reminded her she crouched for
three days on Janice and Madison's couch
taking her old phone when she ran to the
bathroom and back so as not to miss her
chance to kill him Janice brought her
the herbal tea Burton mater have with
the wakie he left white pills built two
counties over no coffee he said the SS
officer was really an accountant in
Florida the man Dwight played against
and nobody had ever killed him Dwight
never fought himself just relayed orders
from the tactician see hired the Florida
accountant was his own tactician and a
stone killer to boot when he won a
campaign which he usually did Dwight
lost money that kind of gambling was
illegal federally but there were ways
around that neither Dwight nor the
account needed the money they won or
cared about what they lost not really
players like thin were paid on the basis
of kills and on how long they could
survive in a given campaign she had
gotten to feeling that what the
accountant was but what the account most
liked about killing them was that it
really cost them not just that he was
better at it than they were but that it
actually hurt them to lose people on her
squad were feeding their children with
what they earned playing and maybe that
was all they had like she was paying
farmer John for her mother's
prescriptions now he'd gone and done it
again killed everyone on her squad one
after another taking his time enjoying
it he was hunting her and now while she
circled alone deeper into the French
forest than the flying snow but then
Madison called Burton and Burton came
over and sat on the couch beside her
watching her play and told her how he
saw it how the SS officer convinced he
was hunting her wasn't seeing it right
because really now Burton said she was
hunting him or would be as soon as she
realized she was while his failure to
see it was a done deal fully underway
growing a wrong path he said he'd show
her how to see it but he'd need her not
to sleep he gave Janice the white pills
drew a dosing schedule on a napkin the
accountant would sleep in Florida
leaving his character on some very good
AI but Flynn wouldn't so Janice had
given her the pills according to the
napkin and Burton had kept coming around
on some schedule of his own to sit with
her and watch and tell her how he saw it
and sometimes she felt him jerk haptic
misfire while she was held while he was
helping her find her own way of seeing
it not to learn it he said because it
couldn't be taught but to spiral in with
it each turn tighter further into the
forest each turned closer to seeing it
exactly right down into that one shot
across the clearing she found there
where the sudden mist of airborne blood
blown with the snow was like the term
balancing an equation she'd been alone
on the couch then Janice heard her
scream got up walked out on their porch
puked up t shaking cried while Janice
washed her face and Dwight gave her so
much money but she never once walked
point for him again or ever saw that
ragged France so why was this all up in
her now watching this guy with the
little beard squeeze the woman beside
him closer why when she had run a
perimeter around the corner did she take
it up to 57 and double back why was she
all easy ice now if this wasn't a
shooter thank
so I can take questions if anybody oh
yeah okay there's a mic so those of you
who feel bold can go to the mic don't be
shy
big fan hey
you hear me buddy so clogged yeah
okay okay hey mr. Gibson so I had a
question for you about Canada sequences
of your books like your first matrix
trilogy was a very different from like
all tomorrow's parties and zero history
that seemed to be set in the presence
but like a non we since about the
presence and then this book seeds be
less sci-fi but more about just the
world were in I was just curious if
that's a deliberate shift on your part
or is that just well this is that was
that was one of two narrative threads
through theirs and without getting all
spoilery there's another another
narrative thread that's like way sci-fi
and so but in a michael moorcock in John
Harrison possibly mervyn peake sort of
way like like very very post sing like
what you just heard those guys are like
15 or 20 years from now and they might
as well they might as well be now but
it's got like different it's got
different parts but my first three
novels whereas sat it never says but I
always figured around 20 35 and they
were written in the 80s and 90s and the
second set was written in the 90s and it
was set about now so now those the three
books that started with Virtual Light
those are kind of best read now is
alternate history because we didn't have
the great set which is your earthquake
and whatnot and and then i wrote the
three books that started with pattern
recognition which I thought of as as
speculative novels of the very recent
past because each one was set in the
year before its publications and but
I'm convinced that a lot of readers
never noticed that they weren't set in
the future in fact I I know that to be
true a certain number of readers never
even noticed that they weren't set in
the future which is sort of the bet I
had made with myself I used the tool kit
that I developed to do the fresh six
books to write contemporary fiction and
it felt very much it felt very much the
same but this one is not well for one
thing it's like I'm pretty sure that
this is a standalone piece it isn't a
sort of book that that in my opinion
should have any sequels and I've got a
pretty good idea of what the next one is
and it's completely it's completely
different again so i think i'm going to
try that stick with one off novels for a
while novels were originally called that
because they were novel there's that
thank you very much thank you hey also a
huge fan thank you know me so question
I'm sorry sis go story problems but one
of your personals you have this kind of
you briefly touched on the subject of
people kind of making a religion out of
AI I don't know and this is basically
something that they want to ask if
you've seen anything like this in actual
life maybe something is starting to
happen where people who don't understand
how cell phone works they make a
religion out of it you know that I well
Elon Musk Oh about 48 hours ago warned
that making a I was like like
trafficking with demons or at least so I
saw it claimed on Twitter
so the meme was the meme was was
drifting around and if I'm I wasn't
that's like it was back in the 80s I
wasn't proposing I wasn't proposing that
people i can sit actually an interesting
it's it's an interesting question like
could we could to be a religion based on
cell phones based on smartphones could
we not need all participating in a
religion based on smartphones without
even knowing it I don't know but in my
particularly when in my early work I was
inclined to look for themes in in
science themes in science fiction and
try to go and he go in the opposite
opposite direction and to actually why
there's a theme in science fiction that
they've been around since before I
started writing of demon like a I I
think Harlon L I think of a Harlan
Ellison story called I have no math but
I might scream I must scream which I
read used before I wrote neuromancer but
it's really a precursor in its way to
winter meat and neuromancer in in that
in that novel but when i wrote count 0
the people have the religion around a i
may be the if their world has Christians
the Christians think they're they're
trafficking with demons but they think
they're they're communicating with
ancient African gods like you know 11
peoples one people's God's wind up being
other people's dÃ¦mons somewhere
somewhere down the road that's a kind of
historical constant I think so anyway I
mean that's it I'm a rambling so i guess
i've answered it his best i can thank
you no sir um when it comes to i guess i
I don't know religious takes on AI and
all you've you have like what's his name
Asimov's last question and Frederick
Browns answer which I think make an
excellent counterpoint with each other
and am I guess sort of building on that
and something you said earlier about
these people are using technology that
they don't really understand or anything
like that to certain extent do you feel
this is sort of blending into fantasy I
mean in a way if you just changed the
window dressing couldn't it just be
magic and actual demons or what have you
you know then there's clarks arthur c
clarke dictum that any sufficiently
advanced technology is indistinguishable
from magic so there's with this book
there's there's are deliberate in
certain aspects of it was a very
deliberate choice to this kind of hand
wavy thing and say it's just technology
but that's like the 22nd century talking
talking to the to the mid 20 the mid
21st and none of the people none of the
people in the story are scientists and
their there are a few technologists so
nobody really in the story really knows
what the what the science is anyway but
I've never cared about the science
science I care about I care about what
emergent technology does in terms of
social social change and I think it's
actually being the primary change driver
for a very very long time now like very
much predating predating the digital
like back to cereal and cities those
were like way radical emergent
technologies ones and and we like that
we live on the top of a kind of pyramid
of technology we take the lower levels
cereal and cities and sewage we take
those absolutely for granted you take
them away with the rest of it
comes down so that's you know when I
when I got neuromancer I didn't know
anything about actual computers and feel
I've never made any bones about that
still being still being the case I do it
I infer it all from how I see people
behaving with it and I've always
inferred a certain amount of it from the
poetry of neologism in emerging from
from your from your field like the first
time I ever heard interface used as a
verb is you could have scraped me up off
the floor it actually happened in
Seattle it happened in a hotel near
seatac and I heard in turf ember
holy that is amazing it's going to
change everything and it did but I got
it I got it from the poetics and not
from not from technical or scientific
understanding so there's a kind of
playful coming out if you will with that
in in this book in like the key part of
the impossible that that I'm
claiming happens in this book is based
on something that the characters call
the server and nobody knows where it is
or what it does sis it if you can
decrypt your very difficult way into it
that you can then do really fantastic
things with your internet and so all
right good I guess the metaphors of
modernity night okay thank you okay
i I'm just wondering what your thoughts
are on the possibility of there being a
movie version of neuromancer ever made
and whether or not it would be a good
idea at this point oh I don't know it
would depend on it would depend on who
made it it there is it you know there's
a sense in which it could be argued that
neuromancer has already been made
piecemeal over the Pat over the past the
past 30 years like we've all seen bits
of bits and pieces of it on on the big
on the big screen and it could I mean it
could happen and it could happen and if
it happened it would be like you know I
would get a nice paycheck but the
results like who knows and I don't I'm
baffled by an idea that I did I think I
sometimes encounter is that a Hollywood
movie is the ultimate and final
expression of a novel without which the
novel remains a kind of larval fan
often people people to hold that view
our people who have never really
understood that the experience they had
reading neuromancer is absolutely unique
to them and as a one-time honors student
in literary critical methodology I I was
taught something called the interpretive
fallacy and the interpretive fallacy
which I actually believe absolutely in
this marvelous help with shitty book
reviews is that there's there's no text
it's like the tree falling in the forest
witness there's nobody there there's no
one text the text happens in the readers
head it's like a combination and no two
people no two people have the same
experience it's also true of a film but
more so more peculiarly so with a
written text and if the interpretive
fallacy is probably responsible for more
evil in human history than anything
else because religion is not a problem
until you get somebody thinks they know
what the Bible or whichever texts are
into says and you say no that's just
your interpretation of it to kill you
we can you can look on the internet it's
happening it's happening every day but
anyway I don't know I don't have any
news to report their eye on the
neuromancer front there does seem to be
there's currently more of a chance of
pattern recognition being turned into a
feature film and i can't even say very
much about that but that one my
Hollywood agent said he's never said
this to me before he said it's amazing
this is actually behaving the way these
deals behave before they become movies
so first for me anyway it's thank you
thank you if any of your books get
turned into films try to get Chris
Cunningham back on board oh I would love
it I love him hi there yeah I think as a
person who works in machine learning
computers that we all have a different
perspective like you talked about as we
read these books he would talk to
someone else I think that they read a
completely different book your last
question but I so I had I have two
questions hopefully you can choose one
or as answer both one is a seroma more
monday night you like you include so
many elements of a real culture in your
books whether it's cases jacket or or
you know the watches and so forth I'm
wondering if you do much research for
that stuff we just sort of sorb things
through your peripheral vision oh I do
almost no conscious of formal research
so that the catalog of stuff in my books
is actually a result of my own random
encounters with reality some other
question is and I read a book sometimes
I'm in all of the book or inspired by
eight or just think all i could do
better is there a book you read recently
that you just think wow that's the kind
of book that I'd you also would like to
write oh you look that fight you find
inspiring um most recently I was to be
recent this I was inspired I usually
can't read fiction while I'm writing
fiction so this book took a long time to
write so I'm really behind on reading
fiction really close friends of mine who
are like wonderful writers have
published what I'm sure completely
delightful books for the past couple of
years and I've scarcely been able to to
read any of them which i'm looking
forward to rectifying now but for one
reason or another I i was able during
the course of writing well i was able
during the course of writing this to
read Ned Bowman's second novel the
teleportation accident and it inspired
me it didn't inspire me to write
something like it but it distance it it
just inspired me that Ned beauman read
it like I've seen it reading this thing
going damn I am old and it's just like
delighted me because that I don't do
like I don't get that from from imagine
that the fiction all all that all that
much and more recently after I turned I
turned this in only in mid-july and
after after turning it in I I read Ned's
third novel glow which is sort of like
this isn't not that this does it justice
but just kind of a ballpark it's kind of
like if the three big in novels and
pensions the crying of lot 49 could be
engraved on the head of a pin because
it's not very long it's not a very long
novel and it but I I just loved it and
I've never quite read anything like it
except maybe the three big in
oats and the crying of lot 49 so I think
he's he's one to watch Thanks yeah since
you mentioned Elon Musk if anybody here
hadn't heard he was in the news recently
because he said that he thought
artificial intelligence was the biggest
existential threat that humankind faces
so I'm wondering what your thoughts are
on that subject on artificial
intelligence and ongoing research and is
it a threat or do you think that's
overblown door well I you know
considering the existential threats that
we're facing which get sort of catalog
that one point in this book that's not
that's not the one I would be I would be
wearing worrying worrying about I don't
know I remember you know it wasn't that
long ago that Stephen Hawking told us
that it was aliens said talk quit trying
to communicate with alien cultures
greatest existential threat we face well
no hey I I don't actually have any I
don't have any bumper sticker opinions
on a I've spent a certain amount of my
life trying to kind of evoke different
imaginary possibilities of what a I
could be like or or what it Wyatt what
it might mean but I can't really boil it
down into anything when when I started
to write the kind of fiction i right I
think I one way or another I I made a
choice to be try to be as agnostic as I
could about technologies and seemed to
me that emergent technologies are huge
change drivers can be huge change
drivers it also seemed to me that the
greatest change that emergent
technologies bring can very easily be
unanticipated change change that that
the inventors and developers and
marketers of an emergent technology
never dreamed of you know the people the
people who did pagers never thought they
had changed the drug dealing geography
of major American cities and caused and
caused huge swathes of payphones to be
ripped up by the roots had taken away
but they did the developers of the
internal combustion engine say no more
so we don't we don't know we don't know
we don't know what technology is due
until people get ahold of those
technologies and do with them and
then we have to legislate after try to
legislate after the fact so I think
we're always we're always behind the
curve we don't vote on what technologies
are going going to emerge thank you hi
this is for tall people so I wondered
what kinds of technologies or if
technology has influenced or changed the
way the way that you write or your
processes of writing and in what ways
and what are the things that you would
like technology to do for you in the
future for the writing wow I actually I
wonder that's a really good that's a
really good question but for my own
experience I mean I'm inclined to think
that once
once a technology becomes a part of my
life or in the case of your question a
part of my writing process I become
anthropologically incapable of
evaluating the difference between what
I've been doing and what I did for and I
think it's it's easier it's easier to
imagine a feature of fully realized
augmented reality than it is to imagine
what the world was like before
television or than it is to imagine what
the world was like before recorded music
and just as a thought experiment not now
but sometimes when you're alone and have
nothing better to do try to imagine what
the world was like before recorded music
it's it's an interesting thing it's an
interesting thing to try to do and if
you're anything like me I think you'll
find that you have a really difficult
time getting your head around the fact
that there ever was a time before
recorded music and what it what it would
have what it would have meant I think
that that that which uses word
processing myself for instance has a
hard time remembering what it was like
to write before word processing except I
can tell you that in some ways it was a
lot harder because I never learned to
type and I had to produce clean
manuscript copy in order to sell fiction
and my manuscripts were topographical
with correction goop and like we're and
i found i bought this tape that they use
on they used to use on restaurant menus
so they could use the same colored page
over and over and just tape the
breakfast thing
items on so I'm but I don't know what it
does I don't know what word processing
has done to my process and I'll probably
never find out because I'm unlikely to
go back to to the typewriter and the
correction group I can vid Emily
remember the world before broadcast
television but not enough of it to be
able to describe how different how
different it was the world the world
before ubiquitous smartphones completely
different what will people think even
now younger readers now reading fiction
written before the advent of cellular
telephony will be reading about an alien
world a tremendous near constant
solitude in which human beings here in
beings that had virtually no contact
with anyone I mean that's so strange and
yet we don't we don't think we don't
think about I remember I was in I was in
London once and it was right before cell
phones came to London and then yet come
that I knew up to Vancouver and I road I
wrote on the tube in in midwinter and
thought about thought fondly of the
enforced solitude of of life in London
and how you went on the tube and nobody
spoke to anybody you never made eye
contact and no one talked to anybody and
everyone was forced to be with with
themselves and how great that was I he
seemed like kind of magnificent weird to
me that London London work that way then
I had to go back like two months later
and it was still it was still winter and
I
the T beginner and everybody was talking
everybody on the platforms was talking
nobody was alone anymore like nobody
every day they got phones so quick maybe
because of that that solitude and it's
never been it's never been the same
since like it changes as the French
pirate said the city changes faster than
the human heart but as for technology I
would like just more transparent
interfacing please more try better
interfaces like something that I can't
screw up what I like thank you thank you
this more as a question in an
observation I i find myself re-reading
some of your older novels because i miss
feeling and remembering the imprint
ahead on me back in the 90s early 90s
when both the novel's came out and the
internet was starting to become you know
blossoming at that point and i reread
them because i missed the world that you
you're right about in the descriptions
in the and the phrasing the question is
when you write a novel a great novel
like a neuromancer or the count 0 those
those types of books in your past do you
ever you ever miss that world you ever
think back and you know have some sort
of nostalgia about what it was like to
imagine that place actually no once it's
a serious serious it's a serious
question it's
they're not you know there's scarcely
any there's really no way in which I
could claim that those those books are
in any way ah tabai autobiographical but
they were necessarily made up of the
stuff of my life however much the stuff
of my life doesn't resemble that those
those books what else did I have it was
my imagination working on the stuff of
my life and my my view my view of the
world so when were I to look at them
which I I don't do really unless there's
some business reason to to do it when I
look at them I have a no no no if
nostalgia snice nostalgia is not exactly
the right word but I have a sense of
what my life was like at the moment at
the moment I I wrote it but I can't feel
I don't feel a longing for the sprawl
say because well for one thing to me
it's like for everybody else anybody
else reads reads those books I think
it's like seeing seeing a chinese new
year dragon dancing down dancing done
Street the outsides got sequins and
guilt and bright red paint and green
swirly stuff and it's doing this
complicated dance and you can see the
legs the legs so that guys the guys
underneath but when I look at it I just
see the inside of the TRACON it's just
like paper mache with Chinese newspapers
and bamboo it's like I can't go into
that text without going inside it so
it's like I can't go on the Disneyland
ride because when I go there I go behind
the wall where it's all sweating
concrete and rat poop los Los nuts at
last nuts and bolts so it's kind of I'm
the nostalgia for my own fiction is sort
of never opened for me thank you that is
our last question thank you so much for
coming
