okay welcome everyone thank you so much
for coming today we are delighted to
introduce to you Joseph regal who is an
assistant professor in communication at
Northeastern and a local who just lives
right around the corner so it's great to
have you here with us he is also a
faculty associate at Berkman and has
written a previous book on Wikipedia but
that's not what he's going to be talking
about today today he's sharing his new
work which is called geek knowing from
faq to feminism 101 please welcome
Joseph hello everyone so these are web
slides so if you'd like to follow along
online or follow some of the references
afterward you can just go to regal that
word / talk and I want to begin by
talking how I got here because i'm
actually in kind of reflects that I'm
even studying this topic and so I will
give you a little tour a history of my
path so I began thinking about these
issues related to geek feminism via this
wonderful group of people wiki checks
and actually I had been working on
wikipedia and I think around 2006a there
was a proposal in the creation of a
email list at the wikimedia foundation
that would be for women wikipedia
contributors and i was studying open
what i call open content communities at
the time because up until then a lot of
people had been looking at free software
and free culture and open source but a
lot of the discussion at that time was
really focusing on licenses and I
thought can we actually think about
communities and groups in the context of
openness and what does it mean for a
community to be open and what are the
challenges of that and so I had a
chapter in my Wikipedia book about
openness and I actually talked about
this because for the most part you know
ten years ago just explaining that
Wikipedia could work was kind of novel
but I was also coming to appreciate that
there's certain aspects that Wikipedia
that don't work so well and that
includes the
they call the gender gap the fact that
they're so female Wikipedia contributors
so this group was set up as a female
friendly oriented space in the tradition
of a lot of other female friendly spaces
like Linux chicks and almost every free
culture project has something like this
what was different here was that this
was an exclusively female on space so
this was not open to men or allies and
that in that regard and it was fairly
controversial and caused a lot of
contention within the community and I
was sympathetic to the idea then I
thought of women felt they needed that
space they should have it and eventually
the debates about it went back and forth
and it was moved away from the wikimedia
foundation servers was hosted elsewhere
and that kind of solved these big
philosophical debates the community was
having and there are people like
Sunstein who talks about unglazed or
Nancy Fraser in the context of public
spheres Theory talks about subaltern
counter publics who are typically a
minority needs to go and have a space
where they can throw Marshall their
sources and support one another so
that's when I began thinking about these
questions of feminism gender &amp;amp; open
communities and so one of the first
things I did when I was thinking about
this i thought well in the wikipedia
context are there any consequences of
the gender gap so I in a colleague did a
comparative analysis of biographies
appearing in Britannica and Wikipedia to
see if there was much skew not
surprisingly Wikipedia when you just
look at absolute numbers does really
well because it is so big but the one
novel thing we found is Wikipedia
dominates Britannica much more so when
it comes to male biographies and female
biographies it does both because wiki p
is just so huge but it does much more so
with respect to men and other people
have found more sort of conclusive
findings for instance even informal
analyses looking at things like the main
page in which which female biographies
are linked to from the main page and
even a most recently a couple of months
ago Wikipedia faces conundrum of it has
category pages like American novelists
and when these pages get too large
somehow you have to divide them up and
someone
not meaning to be problematic said why
don't we you know cut off the the female
American novelist as a separate sub
category in doing so it makes the kind
of implied presumption will that
American novelists are men and then we
have this little sub category for women
and its really kind of an interesting
problem if you're in a lake
librarianship and taxonomy and stuff
like that but wikipedia has some
problems there I think and it's not that
the community doesn't know about it but
it's an ongoing topic of conversation so
then I asked myself why why do free
culture communities which are otherwise
are very much fond of why do they have
this particular problem and I came to
the conclusion that the things that I
most like about free culture its
openness its geekiness its freedom are
actually problematic with respect to
women's participation in these
communities first geek identities can be
fairly narrow stereotypical and
alienating to very diverse groups of
people including men but especially so
two women open communities are
especially susceptible to difficult
people I don't know if you've heard of
the business after ism the no asshole
rule and so people are now being
cognizant of the fact that I asshole can
really wreck your business or your group
or your community and open communities
you can say have their share of assholes
and it's kind of hard to get rid of them
so how do you deal with that and then
thirdly because these communities are
open and based and use a lot of freedom
rhetoric they can rationalize and
justify any imbalances in contribution
with respect to their diversity and
participation so if there's only one a
woman contributing to like a free
culture group and there's 20 guys they
can say well the presence of this woman
shows that we're open and welcoming to
women and she might have different
thoughts I imagine and lots of other
women could then pushed away and then so
I began thinking okay I've identified
the problem what can we do about this
and I noted this really interesting
phenomenon called geek feminism which
I'll talk more about I thought oh this
is really interesting so I wanted to
spend some more time when geek feminism
and so I'm doing that in a couple little
ways one
this work will geek knowing I'm kind of
wondering where to place it because it
doesn't really fit in many places but
nonetheless I think it's a pretty
interesting topic this question of geek
fake geek girls has come up so again
this question of identity and this
existed you can find papers in the 80s
about punks and posers and stuff like
this but I think this is a really
interesting conversation about what does
it take to be an authentic geek
particularly when it comes to questions
of gender and then questions of misogyny
and sexism online my the book I'm
working on out comment likers haters and
manipulators in the age of web I have a
chapter on that but let's focus for
today on this question a geek knowing
I'm going to talk a little bit about
some definitions and then I'm going to
get into some particular terms and
quotations that I find interesting in
this community Susan how I go about it
in the book I just thought it made for
more interesting presentation so in
terms of definition what do I mean by
geek knowing by that i mean there's a
particular sensibility predilection and
culture that touches on these particular
things and the one is there's a reliance
or we're not a reliance there's a
tendency to self document among geeks
and i would include my food myself i
have my little wiki where I document
everything I contribute occasionally to
Wikipedia I like putting my code on get
source github and i'll talk more about
this and give you some examples but this
just seems to be something that geeks
like to do they like the document what
they're doing what they have found the
problems they've encountered how they
fixed it and then they'd like to share
that with other people but they only
sort of go so far if someone goes to the
trouble of writing some documentation
about they had a problem with a Wi-Fi
card and here's how they'd fixed it they
expect you to go and read the
documentation they wrote and have some
degree of self-reliance and then finally
Gibbs has this term cyber language that
she uses the characterized geek
discourse as being very innovative lots
of knowledge isms and puns and humor
that very much characterizes the
conversation and discourse of these
communities so I think all this
contributes to what i mean by geek
knowing and within that i think there's
a
ethic and that is like any community
that you know through acculturation and
culture Asian socialization expects
newcomers to familiarize themselves with
the norms and the knowledge of the
community but it seems especially
pronounced among geeks and so again
touching on a couple of those previous
bullet points extent community members
expect people to familiarize themselves
with that which has already been
documented and this is further reflected
in the community and their lexicon by
way of stature so for instance you can
be an alpha geek or a newbie or things
like that I'm going to talk more about
that as well but that's basically what
I'm talking about it's not all that
novel with respect the geeks but i think
his novel is how explicit and manifest
it is now geek feminism what do I mean
by this there's sort of two sides of a
coin there's the theoretical side and
Mary bushels wrote a paper in 2002 where
she was studying some things that were
happening among early geek feminist so
the term hadn't been used yet and she
tried to identify this burgeoning
identity as distinct from liberal
postmodern and radical feminism as a
type of feminism where women are
claiming their geekiness but still are
sympathetic to typical feminist ideals
of equal participation and other sort of
notions in terms yes okay I'm just okay
just tell me how you understand me so
based on the literature I would define
geek as people who are very enthusiastic
about things and it arises out of a heat
hacker and online culture but the word
has now expanded so for instance you can
be a reef geek which means you're really
into aquariums and so I think it's
useful to appreciate that it's not just
limited to the online comic cosplays
sort of fan culture communities from
which it arose but that is the context
very often which I'm speaking
so the Praxis I think began with Alex
good Bailey's essay or posting on
slashdot in which there was a discussion
of our their female geeks and again we
might take for granite now that there
are female geeks and there's been some
writing on it but a slashdot back in
1998 there was a post he said are there
female geeks and scud posted and said
yes we exist we're fairly quiet we don't
get a lot of attention I think for some
purposes they don't want the attention
at least back then and even now that was
followed out by another essay then with
the establishment of the wiki and the
blog and so now if you google geek
feminism you can actually find a body of
people and wiki's and blogs and
conversations then I'll fall under this
banner so what I'm going to do is I was
both trying to get my head around this
notion of geek feminism and this
obligation to know and when I was
thinking about this they kind of helped
one another in terms of my thinking
about this and so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to mention a couple of
terms and give you quotations about
words in discourse within these relative
communities and consider how they
overlap or they don't overlap and
hopefully this will shed light both on
the construction of the geek feminism
identity with respect to this ethic of
an obligation to know and also just to
understand this obligation to know from
a geek perspective in general so the
first thing I want to talk about is the
overlap between all these communities
and this is something you've probably
all heard of which is the fact a
frequently asked question this arose in
the geek space particularly does anyone
ever use the Usenet people around that
long right so the Usenet was a pre web
means of this course people would
exchange messages on usenet newsgroups
and a lot of servers only had limited
capacity to store messages so you might
only have like two weeks or a month
worth a message in a particular news
group and people would come online and
ask questions that have been
before and it got tiresome and so they
created these facts that would be posted
to the newsgroup every week or every two
weeks and that way you could say go read
the FAQ we've discussed this before and
that's been around for a long time it's
spread quite widely on the web so it's
not just geeks that talk about faq
anymore and as an example of that here's
the original sort of news group rec
models Rockets faq and you can see it
was just simple text and for instance
the question what exactly is a model
rocket versus a high-power rocket this
document is multi-part quite extensive
and it was useful for all those newbies
who were coming a line would have these
sort of remedial questions similarly one
of my favorite resources is the finally
a feminism 101 blog interestingly it's
using blog software but it's still very
much serves as a FAQ so here we can see
the what is feminism fact and this works
by way of blog postings that are updated
and it takes on these particular
feminist questions and then she cites
lots of other feminist blogs with
answers and further discussion so it's
quite a nice resource and the geek
feminism wiki itself also has a fact and
so this notion of fact is quite
pervasive now and it serves this purpose
of documenting what we've already sort
discussed and what we already know and
as a way to satisfy this obligation to
go and educate yourself first before you
interact with the community too much the
second lap overlap I want to talk about
is that between the geek space and the
geek feminism space and I'm happy to
take questions as we go and again I'm
going to return to this notion of
documentation so here I'm quoting Kim
bruning was a very prolific Wikipedian
in 2008 and I think this very much
exemplifies this geek tendency to win a
document so much so that he writes if we
do not document we cannot learn from our
history and our
doomed to repeat it it is impossible for
me to understand a world where
documentation does not exist and I think
I kind of share this sense like if I go
into an organization I'm like where's
the documentation I'm not that good with
the implicit tacit knowledge and social
networks I like everything to be very
manifest and clear that's just the way I
am and so I think this is very much
sheer shared with the geek feminists so
for example here we have again Alex good
Bailey and these two quotations you know
never intersected these people I don't
think know one another but i found this
again exemplified this notion of winning
the document stuff so scud said that her
main talked her tell her main tactic was
to document things and this grows out of
her tendency when learning something new
to write documentation to help cement
the idea in her own mind and then share
it and hopefully have it be helpful to
other people so she started the geek
feminism wiki just as a personal project
as she was struggling to sort of come to
terms with her geekiness and also the
feminist concepts that she was learning
both geeks traditional geeks old school
geeks or male geeks and geek feminists
like to use this term rtfm or at least
do use this term rtfm so in the
traditional hacker context rtfm is the
idea that again there is something out
someone's done some work to educate you
and you need to go educate it yourself
so the expansion of this in the nicer
terms is read the fine manual and the
cruder and more authentic it's read the
 manual and here yellow coleman
anthropologists of hackers has this
really nice definition of the notion of
rtfm in our book she says rtfm is a
comedic those Stern form of social
discipline it pushes other hackers to
learning code for themselves as a well
affirms that effort has been put into
documentation and so again we see this
balance of the work has been done to
document something but you also have to
pull yourself up by your bootstraps to
some extent and learn before you bother
us too much now here's an instance of
rtfm being used in the geek feminist
context this was based on a blog posting
from brianna laufer and she wrote the
rtfm is pretty much the geek way of
seeing you have a responsibility to
educate yourself I like to think the
bright pink takes the edge off the
abruptness of the implied mullet message
and she printed up these cards and on
the back of the card is URLs to the geek
feminism wiki and blog I don't know if
it really looks pink here but it is pink
and I'm going to touch on this again a
little bit later but the idea at least
from a woman's point of view that the
edge has to be taken off a little bit i
think is kind of interesting though
normal geeks will often have
conversations about to what extent is
this obligation to know a little too
fighty and rough around the edges and is
it potentially alienating to newcomers
in the community also both traditional
geeks and now geek feminist have
inherited this idea of trolls and what a
nuisance trolls can be some of the
really important early work that Susan
herring did with respect to gender and
online community communities and
communication was about trolls and
basically a troll is a person that says
some things annoying or disruptive that
then causes the conversation and the
Congress conversions to become
distracted and the conversation to
become not at all useful and in the geek
feminism context they have this
interesting variation whether talk about
a concern troll and these this is a
particular type of TRO in this
particular context who seems to present
themselves as an ally or wanting the
help or wanting to understand you just
need to do a little bit more work to
convince them and geek feminists have
found this kind of trolling frustrating
because much like other troll bait
you're kind of pulled into want to
engage with this person substantively
but they never sort of give any ground
and just asked to keep asking the same
stupid things
so again the notion of troll exists in
these two spaces now I want to talk
about a couple of terms related to geek
knowing that pretty much have remained
within the stereotypical traditional
geek space and we don't find it in the
feminist and geek feminist spaces and
those really have to do with status so
for example as I mentioned earlier when
you look at a document like Eric Ramon's
jargon file or what became the hacker
dictionary this was supposed to be the
dictionary that described all these
funny instances of cyber language the
geeks and hackers used to talk about
their practices in their community and
it is not uncommon for geeks to talk
about Oh so-and-so is the alpha geek and
there are other terms the wizard and all
these sort of terms about to what extent
you actually know something and other
people recognize your knowing similarly
you know alpha geek is at the top the
newbie is at the bottom so this is
someone that doesn't even have the basic
remedial knowledge so again well
interestingly you won't find geek
feminists saying i'ma alpha geek
feminist in fact when it comes to status
there's some other issues that are much
more sort of nuanced and complicated for
instance imposter syndrome which I'll
talk about but I have never seen an
instance of someone saying I'm a
FEMINIST newbie or I'm a FEMINIST alpha
geek or something like that this seems
to be the domain of the traditional sort
of approach similarly with respect and
knowing the lexicon has a particular set
of words that describe the extent to
which you know so clue is that minimal
level of knowledge that you have to have
to be considered a sensible post newbie
member of a community and you can see
this in the definition of a clue stick
in the in the jargon file and the
definition there says the notional stick
with which one wax an aggressively
clueless person has anyone ever heard
this notion of Klu Klu clueless clue be
it's kind of the traditional take is
kind of a stereotypically gendered in
that I've seen other people talk about
kloos clue sticks particularly in the
feminist context geek feminist context
where it's a stick that you hand to
someone so they know that they need to
educate themselves versus the
traditional sort of take which is you
aggressively bash someone over the head
so they get their clue once you have
that level of clue there's another level
that geeks typically recognize with
respect to knowing and that's to groc
and that's based on science fiction by
highland stranger in a strange land was
this Martian term supposedly and this is
the show that you really deeply know
something and again to be a groc and to
say that to be a geek and to say that
you grok something that was quite a
clean it meant that you really
understood something the code whatever
it is you're working on a very deep
level but again I well I don't see many
instances of geek feminist saying they
really grok something in the feminist
context so now I'm going to talk about
the overlap of geek feminism and
feminism so a a concept in feminism that
is now frequently discussed in the geek
feminist context is this notion of
imposter syndrome and the phenomenon
there is that very often women will
report that well read it imposter
syndrome describes a situation where
someone feels like an imposter or fraud
because they think that their
accomplishments are nowhere near as good
as those people around them so for
example there's a group associated with
geek feminism called the ADA initiative
that's working to get more women
involved in open culture and they run
conferences called a de Kamp's and I've
been the one and the one in DC a couple
years ago and at their conferences the
impostor syndrome sections of the
unconference azure by far the most
popular and so I think this is quite
interestingly different from the
typically male geek space where you're
bragging about being silverback alpha
geek and in the feminist space a very
much more mod
the sort of complicated notion of the
status to which you know in your
competency in that particular community
another really big concept and you saw
it on the finally feminism 101 blog is
in feminist discourse there's no manual
and there's no source so they don't say
rtfm but they talk about 101 knowledge
and basically in feminist discourse this
is the really remedial basic knowledge
that you need to go educate yourself
about so you don't become a nuisance to
extent community members and for those
people I remember looking into this and
I ever found anything particularly good
for those people that this I understand
that this used to be like the first
course in a particular series so like
biology 101 was the first introductory
course I couldn't I wanted to find like
the first instance of that but I
couldn't but here we have a feminist
blocker talking about I could probably
make that a little bit smaller and
sometimes those of us with conditions
that intersect with our ability to do
this work end up burnt-out frustrated or
we lose our patients there is thankfully
a solution to this problem those people
who say or comment that they really want
to learn must take on the responsibility
for their own learning so again in a
different community we're seeing a
different approach to this question of
how do you do deal with people
approaching your community and asking
potentially disruptive questions in a
way that you do that is you document
your feminism 101 knowledge and you ask
people to then go and educate themselves
similarly a Brianna laugher and the geek
feminist space she writes that it's
really nice for people to have this 101
knowledge for the people that are
existing in the community I don't know
if anyone has tooled around with Python
I tend to like that language myself but
when Python first came on the scene as a
programming language it was
controversial because code blocks
weren't delimited by curly braces
they're indented so they use white space
and that was like this big thing that
people argued about for a
long time and laufer is saying here you
know once you've been developing in
Python you don't want to have a
conversation about white space anymore
it's done you've dealt with it get on
with it you want to have more
interesting and substantive conversation
I think this is what a lot of feminists
you're saying as well the feminists 101
stuff is good learn up on it and then
you can have more meaningful
conversations with us this relates back
to the notion of trolling but I've
noticed in feminists and geek feminist
communities they use this word quite a
lot and that's the notion of D railing
and the idea there is that but people
can come and ask disruptive questions or
make disruptive propositions that are
very much within the scope of 101 type
knowledge and then what happens is the
community goes off and has this
digressive argument and potential flame
war and the really interesting
substantive conversation that you might
be having in your second or third year
fourth year college course ends up going
back to that remedial 101 type knowledge
which is frustrating for communities and
this is from a railing for dummies it's
an ironic sort of instruction guide of
how to be a jerk in these particular
communities and it says you know by
insisting that you can only learn if
they are if they right then and there
sacrifice for the hours of time going
over the same ground they have so often
in the past that's how you can derail
particular communities okay so now I
want to talk about geek feminism and
some of the lexicon they have related to
knowing that really is fairly novel to
them you don't see these terms spoken of
in either the feminist or the geek
communities alone when is the unicorn
law there's two unicorn type things that
people tend to discuss in popular online
culture one is what unicorn chaser
that's when you see something horrible
in the comments you need something funny
and fresh and not as depressing so you
follow some horrible story up with a
unicorn chaser or rainbow chaser in this
instance the unicorn law is in a
tradition of geek laws we're geeks like
the sort of
the armchair sociologists and
anthropologists and posit laws about
their social interactions and
communities and this one follows a
tradition Godwin's law which is as an 11
line conversation continues people are
going to end up calling one another not
see or Hitler inevitably because it's
just what happens and so this says
similar sort of thing the longer you are
a woman and open source community the
probability of you being asked to speak
about being a woman in the open source
community approaches 1 and this is
interesting in light of status because
in some way this shows that women's
expertise and knowledge can be
recognized but it's recognized merely by
their virtue of being a woman and a geek
so it's not quite at that same level of
sort of alfalfa geekness it's not an
appreciation of the same level of
knowledge and it's also a burden because
you know some women don't want to talk
about this when i look at the discourse
among geek feminists very often doing
the 101 educating is seen as a second
shift type of job they'd rather be
coding and doing their geeking out and
not having to do all this sort of stuff
and having to give the unicorn talk as
they speak up yes
the since I get is that a woman in open
source is of her own accord talking
about being a woman at open source but I
think I just heard the opposite that
she's being asked to talk about being a
woman what did you say first so the
distinction of whether I as a woman an
open source and choosing to talk about
that or I'm being asked to talk this is
you're being asked because in a sense
they are tokens and they will be asked
and some women will be willing to do so
and are even happy to do so but for a
lot of women they've already done it and
they don't want to do it again where
it's an extra obligation being placed
upon them that can have a number of
problems associated with it including
that the dumb become a target for
possible harassment or that they then
then see me exceptional when they really
just want to seem like just one of the
geeks another interesting angle on this
and this is the geek feminism wiki is
that some of these harsher excerpt
ations remember I talked to rtfm and the
pinkness and stuff like that but the
geek feminism wiki jointly points out
that the meaning of the exhortation to
read the manual is gendered men
are able to tell someone to rtfm without
ever accused of being of pml both having
PMS so again this is sort of the
traditional if you abide by the
masculine norm you're kind of a bitch
but if then if you don't you're not
going to be noticed and walked all over
so what I've done is try to argue that
you know there's this theoretical notion
called the obligation to know and it
helps communities serve as a defense the
simple simple ignorance and purposeful
disruption and that the intersection of
geekdom and feminism highlights the
obligation to know ethic and I think
further contributes to the development
of this idea of a geek feminism and
demonstrates a geek feminism sort of
identity and this is my sort of
conclusion with respect to where I think
these terms from the discourse fall
within these Venn diagrams
that's it yes Kate couple comments or
questions about documentation and power
so documentation that one-on-one stuff i
think is really interesting especially
in the context of like feminism and
geeks who are sort of non mainstream of
hegemonic identities are welcome to
disagree with certain circumstances but
when you're documenting your you're
claiming authority to state the truth so
I feel like that's largely about power
and also to establish Authority so you
were saying that the geek feminist
didn't didn't talk about status but I
feel like they kind of are inferred
status thing by sending people to the
101 it's sort of like well I'm not going
to call you Anu but I'm going to tell
you the manual in a really nice
way so it's it's really interesting i
think that may be looking at the ways
that maybe women are doing the same
things that men do but maybe in a more
subtle like more traditionally gendered
way because of the way that society
encourages women to interact with each
other and with everybody else yeah yeah
that's a good point and I agree that
both communities share the ethic my
point was just that you know I don't see
women walking around saying I'm such an
alpha feminist but maybe they aren't
saying it but maybe been performing it
ok yeah and I think you are kind of
right because in this in the fake geek
girl kind of issue there have been
really interesting and sometimes
unfortunate discussions about policing
and some women who have been active site
technology conferences have been kind of
pushed on by people policing feminists
feminism and these issues to sort of
come up also with respect to the power
that's interesting i didn't give
not enough is again maybe it's because
my own personality but a lot of the
documentation I see at least these the
people who quoted it really is a sort of
personal practice it's almost like a
best practice like this is what has
worked for me but you're right there is
a lot of documentation says this is the
way it must be done and there are
definitely power dynamics that are
encoded in what you're documenting it's
like there is a right way to go about
this and you're going to read the manual
and if you don't agree with me then
you're not worth communities very like
boundary yeah you just go back to the
previous slide how interested in the
asterisk yeah feminist space I would
like to take Kate point further and
suggest it's possible to construe a lot
of the babies when describing is not
feminist at all however they may be
labeled because I'm shocked at this
description of women who are trying to
not make it easier they have elite
knowledge they have erected the
knowledge that it was painfully earned
and they don't want to have to share it
and they want to keep all those other
folk out and goodness me victim go and
do their own go through their own
process before they ever come near and
bother us and all that distancing
doesn't seem to me to have anything
feminist about it at all and I may now
get trouble but the whole model of
knowledge knowing as lift as experienced
as collective as earned through the
process of living together as something
that feminists might attain through a
process of consciousness raising when
you never say have you read the manual
before you come to the
consciousness-raising group because life
is the manual and yes you read it so
that the whole process of feminist
knowing doesn't seem to me to relate to
acquiring elite exclusive knowledge that
it is a nuisance it is never a nuisance
for a feminist to talk to someone who
hasn't done amazon whatever they say to
my feminist very broadly there are many
different kinds of
feminist knowings the theory of
knowledge and ways of knowing yes I
appreciate that there could be many
arguments but but this is I I think Kate
I'm sorry I think this is a fairly
strong vision of knowledge for whom it
is a nuisance for those who'd yes and
useless for those who know to deal the
basic don't that I just not heard that
in any other discussion of bonus money
where it's usually that is the challenge
is to try to find ways of being more
inclusive and recognizing other forms of
knowledge the person had gone from isn't
one of much she knows something else and
normally a feminist conversation is
about finding a way to bring that into
the space rather than treating them are
simply lacking so I think part of the
issue there might be that the feminist
knowing and lexicon really serves two
purposes the one purpose is to educate
friendly potential feminists and allies
and to share those experiences and they
learn from the newcomers to the
community the other thing that they're
doing though is they're trying to repeal
the masculinists or the men's rights
activists or just the boneheads and
stuff like that so it's serving maybe
two different purposes and there are a
lot of instances of people saying go do
your 101 and then i will talk talk to
you okay fair enough and the asterisk
was when i started thinking about this i
was interested in could i find other
examples and again everyone that talks
about socialization and culture ization
I was just interested there might be
other ideas out here because I'm coming
to feminism geek feminism myself there
might be other sort of words related to
this idea of having to educate yourself
I just haven't found it and I'm kind of
interested so I'm trying to understand
I'm trying to understand what about what
you're saying is about geeks in about a
geek feminism and about feminism as
opposed to being about internet language
say right and I'm thinking about the
soap opera using that group that i wrote
about where newbie was absolutely a word
that was being so here was a space where
they weren't going we're feminist geeks
but they were women early in the
Internet's diffusion creating a
newsgroup that was organized largely on
women's terms and where the men were
expected to adapt to female styles of
communication in order to fit in and you
know newbie was very much a phrase that
wasn't I rtfm wasn't we didn't have
mansplaining at the time but you know I
think I mentioned that when in the draft
no saw me I just try to figure out like
to me your description of newbie I don't
I I don't it's you know are you saying
feminists don't talk about newbies
because certainly feminists talking
about newbies are you saying feminists
don't talk about newbies within the
particular context of a particular group
that you've identified as being a geek
feminist group yes more the latter
really like to know is what are what are
those circles what goes within each of
those circles how are you defining the
boundaries of their circles because
geeky women who are talking about open
source don't fit into any of them is
that what I'm can I just talk on to that
cuz I'm have a similar question which is
like I don't understand why there are
three circles like I'm not originally I
had two circles diagram a struggle for
me a period but basically these are the
words the community that communities use
you i guess i just don't understand why
feminism i think a lot of this would be
if you weren't making gestures towards
feminism Rick broadly and we're just
sort of trying to separate like to me it
seems like that a middle spot em circle
of geek feminism should just be pointing
to the space shared by geek culture and
feminist ideology so you think there
should be a geek and a feminism that's
how I started but then it wasn't working
for me and I
I appreciate the critique of the ven
it's not in the paper and I'm intrigued
by people's challenging of it because i
was still organizing it you know to a
day ago like know this really belongs
here and had many circles I should have
that's not a different question um I
think it relates to ten Nancy's research
very early on insects looking at women
online in groups like the soap opera
groups and the difference that you might
detect now in what you're turning to the
big feminist groups and for me I'm
wondering where the level of social
attack fits you how we understand a
community that's that's under attack
because what is clear in something a lot
of the recent studies in last few years
is the reader which these communities
are receiving huge amounts of abuse
online we could look to the criado-perez
case the recently occurred on Twitter
which you got Jane Austen on the
10-pound bag over there are many other
cases where communities where women are
engaging and sort of geek related topics
I just found a huge amounts of abusive
fire constantly need a sarkeesian a jury
Richards like the case is really great
it's good point and I feel like this
talking about peak feminism without
talking about that I lied some of those
kinds of power differentials that have
caused some of this need to sort of put
a rope around what what they're doing
and what they're talking about and why
101 and terms like mansplaining exist so
when they come from this position of
being under attack so could you try to
write for me where you think that kind
of hostility is shaping some of those
lines or whether you think that's even
relevant to how we need to understand
what's happening with people oh I think
you're right and her and I think some of
this also relates to the second shift
pneus of a geek feminism because on one
hand a lot of women are trying to say
there is a positive joyful fun way of
being geeky and also being feminist and
we're not just angry meanies or
something like that
but on the other side they are under
attack as you say and it is an
interesting question to say is geek
feminism a sort of positive
manifestation de novo or is it simply a
response to sexist harassment and how
you answer that i think would sort of
define how you end up conceiving of the
geek feminism identity within the
discourse i see both sort of arguments
being made friends since Kathy Sierra
was a woman who was a significantly
harassed online and she would say things
like make your code beautiful and she
would blog about how to be a
technologist and and when she was
attacked by a series of blogs and she
ended up having things photoshop and you
know came under really serious attack
and this personally she has just started
posting on a line again she has a new
blog but she was attacked for being sort
of womanly in her geekiness by mail
geeks and I think that is really
problematic and is a big part of a lot
of this lexicon because it is kind of
defensive but I think other people are
trying to say we don't want to just
define ourselves in opposition to the
hate that we get but there's like you
know pie you know the little circuit
boards and all kind of cool things that
like a nit bombing and things like that
which I I think that's a the other sort
of topic but ways that women can claim
geekiness and geek identity that simply
aren't a defensive mechanism against
sexism and masculinism but to say that
this is geeky too and it's just that the
previous articulations of geekiness were
gendered and why shouldn't knitting or
knit bombing and stuff like that be
appreciated as just as geeky as anything
else there you're really defining
geekiness in a very techy kind of a way
whereas earlier in response to Sonja's
question you talked about reef geeks and
if we think about fandom as the ultimate
form of
Kiki knowing that's long been an
overwhelmingly female dominated space
where hierarchy is absolutely at play
and so I guess now I'm getting tripped
up on the feminism piece here if geeky
women geeking out together and being
really into hierarchies of knowledge and
yeah well I've got you know episode 3 in
its original wrapper from Japan or what
not and therefore I've got a greater
claim that it that just doesn't fit into
this circle is this scheme of circles so
I feel like you're not actually talking
about Deacon has brought a sense you
seem to be talking about really some
very concrete communities your
contrasting and very concrete
communities and I guess maybe I'm
pushing back against the
generalizability of the language of eat
candy feminism and feminism when it
seems to me like you're really talking
about some really delimited specific
trajectories of discourse amount of
particular groups of people mmm I think
that's a fair point I'm certainly sort
of biased if you will in the communities
I tend to follow which is free culture
open source that sort of thing I would
be interested in examples of like for
instance in fandom where someone is
there an equivalent to saying you're an
alpha geek like I'm sure these these
postures and these gestures are me but
is there a word designating the fact
called collector scum I don't know if
anybody Alexis come by yes for the
people who are the ones who go to like
the record fares to find like the really
rare vinyl and stuff like that oh I'm
collector scum like they are taking
pride in the fact that they are more
demanding and more obsessive than
anybody else and then they refer to
themselves in that disparaging way
yeah that also relates to something else
someone thin about this sense gets it
gets it that you know what you might
like Justin but I'm a true believer and
I can't wait so I think there's like
sorry Thomas quickly stood her up to
that the geek girl group that started in
the mid 90s that was huge and started in
Australia liver became sort of
internationally well-known it was about
owning this term geek girl a very
particular way and branding thinks as
kind of geek girls faces and it was very
positive and it didn't have and a lot of
these terms are very as we say very
defensive and i think that's that's very
telling like I feel like there's a
historiographical not yet if you looked
at the communities that called
themselves Pete girls in the 90s and
then look at which I'm not sure which
communities in particular you're you're
identifying as geek families but say you
might look at some of some areas of say
Jezebel and say there's a geek feminists
and I think you will see that there is
actually a real difference in the kinds
of water patrolling and effectiveness
that is a response to a very particular
kind of attack this is what this is why
i think that's that's a relevant part of
this story because i think that that
these terms are actually telling us
something that you haven't necessarily
brought out so lunch which is why why
these are so offensive and why that
language is being asked to do so much
this language is being asked to try and
create spaces of safety or spaces where
i can't i can't defend myself again go
read what i want and there's something
behind this that tells a slightly
different story historic i mean if we
prefer if we go back to nancy Fraser at
start and the argument about why women
and I used to why women like to start
points want to go and create a separate
kind of space because they feel
positively excluded from the mainstream
space and some of the spaces that the
talking that might have been quite
comfortably or have more women in them
like the soap fans maids or when you
first defined geeks as anyone who has a
passionate enthusiasm for something I
was thinking of people who are willing
to quilting
or baking or nothing to do with tech
because some said it wasn't so those are
spaces which may be more women dominated
and may have their own kind of language
and facilitate your own expertise or
they may or may not be hierarchical and
so forth they don't engender this kind
of hostility and antipolis and the
reason is that they're not claiming
power out there in the world they're
happily baking or quilting or discussing
soap operas or whatever it is that
they're doing so it point must be that
these groups are claiming power out
there in as worth the big boys world and
the reason that they're claiming
feminism is not as I suggested that
they're being inclusive up to two new
women coming in but they are trying to
fight for equality where that power is
not being given to them that's what kate
is asking say something about the
dynamics how this group then fights in
relation to the geeks who make you
sometimes described as men but letting
mail or not feminist or patriarchal or
whatever so what's the nature of that
fight but it generates such hostility
but they feel themselves on under
attacking way that a group of women
quilting now it's a great point
so I mean yeah how they out that holiday
what are they fighting for what's there
yeah I i think the comments are right
that there is a claim being made upon a
space that was traditionally the boys
locker room or the program or sort of
space and it's contentious and hence a
lot of these this language is being used
for defensive purposes beyond just
socialization within a otherwise woman
oriented a woman focused community I
think you're right and the one thing I
was thinking about for instance when the
community kind of turned upon itself was
the notion of intersection ilysm and
feminism and it's that you know just
being a say white female feminist has a
certain amount of privilege associated
with it and so you see some internal
policing that if you're not also being
equally open to other sort of subalterns
or minorities or social justice issues
you will then be challenged on the fact
that you're not really appreciating
intersectionality and in the paper I
have this quote from a woman who kind of
came under attack by some geek feminists
saying well you need to do this you need
to do this you need to do this you need
to do this and she said I kind of you
know I got involved in this issue at a
particular conference and I have a job
and I'm busy and I'm not sexist in the
way that you're painting me I'm not
racist in the way that you're paying me
I want to do the right thing but I'm
busy and I can't read all this theory
that you're asking me to read you
mentioned at one point you were talking
about one of your purchase
you were saying that she was coming and
maybe one of the authors and you were
saying she was coming to terms with her
penis I thought that was really
interesting as if it's sort of like it
was a label that was being pushed upon
her as opposed to a label that she was
claiming for herself because I feel like
for a lot of these at least the women
that you're talking about like there's
definitely some serious flag planting
like I am geek I am feminist I am proud
this is my identity so I was wondering
what you meant when you were saying that
she was coming to terms with her
geekiness as if like she had previously
not had a certain level of knowledge or
had not engaged thats deeply and kind of
i know i was wondering she could talk
about about that my sense is that this
formation of geek feminism many of the
women have always been geeky they've
known they're geeky but they had not yet
planted the flag to use your words and
so the the decision to say I'm going to
plant the flag now and know that you're
going to get probably hassled is a
difficult issue and how you're going to
have to then defend that identity is
knitting included in that definition or
does it mean you have to like contribute
to the Linux kernel like you're going to
deal with a lot of crap but so it is the
you know and active sort of thing that
you have to do and you have to make
decisions about and you may be will back
away from a scud who like began all of
this she's kind of abandoned the open
source world and she's she's gone
somewhere else because he just said it's
been too much and in a sense and didn't
want to spend all your life fighting
these battles necessarily yes
these these particular groups are sort
of planting the flag planting a flag as
feminists they then keep them and they
have some substantive issues that they
want to raise with their fellow geeks
but I was but it also seems to me they
could have other issues as feminists but
not necessarily that have anything to do
with geeks so sort of broader
protections for women who work or
something like that could be an issue
that's not necessarily about eat but
sort of broader so so when they are
planting their flag as feminists and as
geeks what are the issues that and
that's something I think you asked
before but I was just curious even
within the space of issues how many of
those issues are specifically related to
things and how many of the issues they
are interested in our sort of about the
broader harder word of the men's issues
and I don't know if that was clear
I'm not sure if I understand standard
crush like could you give me an example
or an instance like childcare yeah okay
china tea in the world ms could be an
issue that is not necessarily about
needs so so but sometime so you could be
a geek feminist because you are for
child care in the workplace and you know
typically that geeks wouldn't be in
favor of it so you have to take a stand
and plant your flag and say no i am a
geek but i'm also feminist and as a
consequence i favored child care in the
workplace so i was just curious if these
groups have what would be the
distribution of so are they specifically
educating as geeks within the particular
eat context or are they also planting a
flag so I think they I think would be
safe to say that they typically are
concerned with a number of broader
women's issues and social justice issues
and concerns but the geek feminist sort
of intersection really is about the
intersection of these two particular
things and the and that at least that's
what I'm focusing on the ability to
claim geekiness
oopsie let their dog and so that would
be an issue that is sort of within geek
culture and also something that you have
a stand on as a geek feminist and abroad
or should we say child care in the
workplace and so what you are saying
their issues are more specifically sort
of within the culture in the communities
am following they tend to be driven by
particular specific issues and so for
instance the ability to participate a
technical conferences without seeing
pornography on the screen which just
lots of instances of that that's like a
major issue so for instance for the ADA
initiative one of their main focuses has
been having conference code of conduct
policies against harassment against
inappropriate sexual content and so I
suppose you might say it's sort of
tactical like that's kind of unique to
their perspective they want to go to
conferences and not be harassed this
larger issue of say child care in the
workplace I think it's sympathetic but
it's not where they're choosing to spend
their efforts because it doesn't fall
within that intersection of being able
to contribute as a technologist thinking
about their problem 24-7 and they work
around the clock and they don't know
what time it is but maybe you know
someone needs to be picked up from
childcare so there must be points at
which the kind of geek ideology flings
with actually parent issues rather
women's issues but it conflicts with
real life in particular ways that might
be of interest to keep feminists hmm
unnoticed mine
I need to draw this to a close but I
missing good we are at time so if we
could just thank joseph for the paper
