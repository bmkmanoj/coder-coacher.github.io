hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
it's I'm car mean I'm part of ms our
special projects it's my honor to
introduce Adam kolinsky anne-marie
Switzer as part of ms ours visiting
speaker series if if you don't know
anything about the book give you just a
couple little highlights it looks like
looking from the picture here we're
going to get the Thanksgiving story
which we a little bit of background of
how people can go from from being
cooperative to competitive I really like
how the book draws and economics
neuroscience psychology and animal
science really kind of interesting
diversity of knowledge that it draws
from I one of the things I got out of
reading it was in the case looking at
when it might be best to go last in the
case of the Olympics I hope we hear more
about that how it might could
potentially benefit you and perhaps
they'll tell us about the the e trick
which was something that I learned
reading about this the books got
incredibly good reviews so cited in the
New York Times The Wall Street Journal
Financial Times New Yorker National
Public Radio the incredibly high honor
of the only book I know that it has the
highest recommendation from both the
economist and from Oprah
and just a couple of words Adam kolinsky
professor business chair at Columbia
University he was named one of the
world's 50 best be school professors by
poets and quants which is a real
citation I had to go look that up and
then Marie Schweitzer is the professor
of operations informations and decisions
at the Wharton School at UPenn so my
pleasure not and true honor to welcome
Maurice and Adam to Microsoft thank you
thank you thank you for the kind
introduction and thanks for having us I
want to start off with a story about
Thanksgiving after lunch so I hope it's
not making you too hungry but I want to
think about Thanksgiving an incredible
cooperative sentiment that Thanksgiving
evokes it's a holiday so that's supposed
to be about cooperation celebrating
family togetherness and yet at the same
time we often see thanks having followed
by something that can be quite quite
different from the cooperation that we
celebrate and here I'm sort of thing
about this juxtaposition where we have
the co-operative feelings about that
Thanksgiving meal and then we often see
hordes of shoppers uh basically
clamoring for better deals and in 2008
in in white marsh New York there was
actually a tragic event that happened
where a crowd had amassed outside of a
Walmart and somebody put up a sign that
read blitz line starts here and the
group that assembled was so unruly the
the local staff there had called the
police the police had come out they
weren't able to control the crowds and
they started chanting tear the doors
down tear the doors down and they ended
up streaming into the store they
streamed into the store and the employee
is trying to control the crowd formed a
human chain the doors literally came off
the hinges in this store and sadly dumar
this this one employee who had just
hours before celebrated thanksgiving
with his sister ended up getting
trampled to death so I want to think
about what it what it means to shift
between cooperation and competition the
central theme in our book is about
cooperation and competition and I think
about how it doesn't happen just once
but it happens all the time so here from
The Huffington Post this is a 2013
holiday spirit shooting stabbings and
brawls now of course we think about
something different when you think about
holiday spirit more broadly I so want to
think about the the guiding principles
that really tip us between cooperation
competition and back now we think about
cooperation competition it happens in
all of our relationships so we think
about the sort of i think some of the
most intense cooperation will ever have
between us and our spouse in in say for
example raising a child collaborating
across the board but there's some
moments of competition we might have
experienced you know who's going to get
up at five in the morning who's gonna go
change diapers and so on so we go back
and forth uh and it happens not just
with our spouses it happens with our
siblings so we think about brotherly
love but the same time we also think
about sibling rivalry were collaborating
in many important respects we're also
competing so as children we compete for
parental attention and other scarce
resources and it happens for twins it
happens right in the womb as we're
competing for physical resources right
from the start so we have if for some of
us it's actually before we're born we
start the the cooperation and
competition dance and of course at work
we collaborate to achieve outcomes we
work together collaborate on projects
and if we mess up that collaboration
these people badly wrong for the same
time we also balance that collaboration
with competition where we compete for
recognition promotion raises with the
same people were often collaborating
with so that is I want to suggest that
we're collaborating
and competing and we're both friends and
foes and so there's some balance we need
to strike to get it right so here's a
central theme of our whole book is that
we're cooperating and competing all the
time with the same people at home at
work and out even with our friends there
are three guiding principle so we want
to build on these three principles the
first principle of scarcity so there's
scarce resources it could be time it
could be money could be attention I will
talk about us the scarce resource of
water in a second and at walmart this is
one of the things that transformed that
cooperative holiday spirit into a very
competitive one so we can think about
scarcity is one of the key principles
here the Grevy's zebras the great
Grevy's zebras form different
relationships as a function of water in
their environment so when there's
plentiful water they have the stable
collective groups but when water is
scarce they have much more temporary
relationships and their social dynamics
are dramatically influenced by how
abundant or or scarce resources are in
their environment and it's true for all
of us that is the the the abundance or
scarcity of something will shift our
relationships and this is one trigger
that can shift us back and forth between
cooperation and competition our second
principle is how social we are were
effectively hardwired in our brains the
object of our brains is hardwired for
social interaction we need to be in
touch with other people and even for
those of us that are kind of loners we
still crave some social interactions in
fact the most intense form of punishment
is solitary confinement with solitary
confinement it actually begins to damage
our brain within just a couple of days
people in solitary confinement begin to
experience Lusa nations spasms of anger
they become unfit for social interaction
which they also deeply crave so on a
suggest that were hardwired for social
interactions as we navigate these social
interactions we need a balanced
cooperation
and competition the third key principle
is dynamic instability through the
editorial process we were counseled out
of the word stochasticity which I
particularly like but I think the the
broad idea is that there's something
unstable about our environment on things
change so so like for the Grevy's zebras
the water isn't always abundant it's not
always scarce it goes back and forth or
the availability of low-priced items we
have these sales that that trigger
instability and the instability as we go
back and forth can shift us within this
cooperation competition dance so just a
sort you know suggest a lot of things
that are stochastic or dynamic in our in
our world so we think about this dynamic
situation is not just with things that
are happening but also with new
information so as new information
emerges we can learn new things that can
push us to cooperate or we might learn
new information like the salary of
somebody else in the cubicle next to us
and that could shift us toward
competition or it could be a Facebook
post it could be something that shifts
us back and forth in cooperation and
competition I want to think about some
of the dramatic examples we go through a
lot of them but I think to me the most
optimistic story about the shift from
competition to cooperation happened on
an international scale if we go back to
World War two some of the most intense
fighting ever was between United States
in Japan the United States had
firebombed 67 Japanese cities and that
was before the nuclear explosions and
the u.s. dropped not one but two nuclear
bombs on Japan now what was amazing is
how intense that conflict was how
ferocious that fighting was and yet the
shift to cooperation has been
unbelievable if you survey people
throughout the United throughout the
world and you ask them what their
attitudes are of the United States
you'll get a lot of varied responses and
they're many there many countries out
there where the US isn't quite as
popular
perhaps could be but one country that's
incredibly pro us is Japan in fact a
recent survey eighty percent of Japanese
people had favorable impressions of the
United States and that's pretty high um
and here's what happened the shift from
competition cooperation started right
after the war is gel Douglas MacArthur
he came in and he inserted rules for
Americans in Japan Americans it was
illegal to strike any Japanese person it
was even illegal for Americans to eat
any Japanese food food is very scarce in
Japan and the Americans could only eat
American ray shins he and then on top of
that this shift toward rebuilding the
Japanese economy became a cornerstone of
that pivot from cooperation from
competition to cooperation and here in
1960 assigning this this cooperation
pact and that and that transition has
been a really incredible one and I think
has a lot of lessons for us to think
about in how we look at foes throughout
the world and certainly in our own
relationships and how they can be
transformed into friends okay so we have
this interplay of these three principles
scarcity sociability and dynamic
instability we think of those themes
throughout our book but we go through in
each of the chapters to tackle some
specific constructs and all and I'll
talk about one of them at the enemies
chapter we'll also talk about finding
the right balance so the right balance
between cooperating who have to
cooperate to get things done we also
have to compete in some in some respects
and if you find the right balance if we
hold things in balance we can get the
boast so the best outcomes so the best
of both worlds and that's what we try to
find and in each chapter we talk about
finding the right balance at the end so
here's the first contract I want to
think about um and here's this idea that
is uh if I were to ask you questions
like should you remodel your kitchen do
you drive a nice car do you make
a good amount of money are my kids doing
well it's almost impossible for us to
answer those questions in the abstract
and instead our mind races toward
comparisons that is we constantly
compare our situation with those of
others around us and so people are
constantly checking Facebook did I have
a good vacation well I thought my
vacation was pretty good and I see
everybody else's photos and well look
better so least there's something that
might be better out there um and yeah so
you know it's hard to you know deeply
dive into social science without
referring to Borat ah here's my neighbor
I get a window from a glass he must get
a winner from a glass I get a step he
must get a step I got a clock radio
you're on afford great success all right
so what's happening here uh you know
what is it about this drive to compare
and here he's gaining some pleasure from
a comparison with somebody less
fortunate here think about here's Larry
burden a magic Larry Bird said the first
thing I would do every morning was look
at the box go to see what magic did I
didn't care about anything else now hear
this comparison that is they're both
competing who's the best basketball
player ever they were playing against
each other sort of the same time they
deeply cared about how each other was
doing and this can be incredibly
motivating so comparisons can make us
miserable they can motivate us and they
can do some other interesting things
also on here the unc tarheels the Duke
Blue Devils on both incredibly
accomplished basketball teams they are
rivals rivalry is a special type of
competition where the psychological
stakes get raised we care more about
those outcomes than about other
competitive interactions separate from
the economic outcome so there's
something special about about this
rivalry
um and I talked about you know here 1992
Duke Wins the NC double-a championship
and your later UNC wins it now sort of
think about was it take to win a
championship a lot of talent um it takes
a lot of ingredients but one of the key
ingredients is incredible motivation and
this social comparison this comparison
is driving and motivating people to work
really hard and it happened not just
once but it happened twice where you see
this sort of one after the other
incredibly motivating contrasts so these
comparisons can motivate us in
incredible ways and across a lot of
examples and a lot of social science we
see comparisons increasing motivation
boosting performance it's one way for us
to really get motivated it's true for
long-distance runners it's true for four
people forming in school and so on um oh
and I also suggest it's even hard wired
that is we're hardwired so deeply and
here we'll drawn on one of the yeah yes
yeah it was drawn on a on a cellular
looks at ketchup and monkeys catchment
monkeys are very clever monkeys they're
the kind they used to do this for the
music grinders and you'll see this
experiment that Franz the wall did
looking at catchment monkeys and how
they care about these comparisons you
take it with new monkeys would never
done the task is thinking that maybe
they would have a stronger reaction and
that turned out to be right the one on
the left is a monkey who gets cucumber
the one on the right is the one who gets
grapes the one who gets cucumber note
that the first piece of cucumber is
perfectly fine the first PC eats then
see she's the other one getting grape
and you will see what happens so she
gives a rock to us that's the task and
we give her a piece of cucumber and she
eats it the other one needs to give a
rock to us and that's what she does
and she gets a grape it's each of the
other one sees that she gives a rock to
verse now gets again cucumber
she tests a rock now against the wall
she needs to give it to us and she gets
cucumber again so this is basically the
wall street protesting yeah so so sort
of a thing about you know here I'm
suggest it's it's this hard wired for us
that is we compare our outcomes with
other people and objectively we might be
doing fine so that is it's like the
cucumber that's fine and then we see
somebody else getting that grape a grape
is better than a cucumber uh and now
we're no longer satisfied with our
cucumber and I think that that's suggest
it's so hard wired we see this happening
a lot of different contexts anything
about gravity payments as they moved up
salaries to 70,000 for everybody what
does that do not just the people whose
salaries got increased the people who
had been there for a long time and we we
know from Scott Crabtree who experienced
this very thing that is he'd worked for
years his salary had increased they
hired a new employee that new employee
was coming into salary very close to his
ah and work that he found meaningful
enjoyable work that he loved became
totally upset demotivated and was so
frustrating at quitting that company so
here he talks about any know works a
different company as the chief happiness
officer so so we care about these
comparisons they make us change the way
we think about our own outcomes and and
sometimes it's not just for us it's not
just sort of within our own minds it's
the way other people are dealing with us
too so here this is Rhonda uh she took
classes to develop her skills she was
identified by senior leadership as
somebody who had great potential and and
she ended up taking some time off from
work through classes to to be trained to
take on more responsibilities can you
think of it as a manager we might look
for promising talent my try to groom
people for promotion to take on more
responsibility this is exactly what
happened
and this is kinda thing corporations
should be doing as managers as
colleagues we should be identifying
people that should be groomed for
greater responsibilities and greater
rewards here's the problem is that this
isn't just affecting Ron it's affecting
the people around her and so it began to
happen is that as Rhonda was going and
taking these other classes she was
missing some of the things that were
happening and the other people that she
was working with started to exclude her
from lunches from parties from out of
work events and also started to
undermine her performance at work they
stopped passing along messages to her
they undermined her ability to succeed
at work because they resented the
special privilege that she was getting
so we have people that uh that are
comparing themselves to us and one of
the key ideas I want to suggest is that
people will tell you things like I'm so
happy for you or you really deserved it
or it looks like you had such a great
vacation or let me see your kitchen
remodel I they'll tell you things that
oh this is so great but we are all
driven to make comparisons and sometimes
those comparisons manifest themselves in
a way that that can transform friends
into foes so here she got socially
ostracized the same thing happens at the
corporate level when Virgin emerged is a
real competitor with our british airways
british airways engaged in some dirty
tricks undermining virgin they started
calling customers a virgin telling
customers their flight have been
canceled what it hadn't been canceled I
started spending expecting rumors about
the CEO Branson um they started doing
things because of this comparison and
and work that Adam galinsky others have
done have shown us how comparisons in
intense ways can actually really
motivate a lot of unethical behavior to
let me share 11 other sort of story
about how things can go badly wrong with
with
pearson's um and a lot of you will have
a lot of different experiences with with
with comparisons cross-culturally these
comparisons can be really intense this
is a Russian parable related to
comparisons a man finds a lamp rubs it
and of course a genie appears and the
new says you can have anything you want
the one condition is that your neighbor
gets double we think back to the borod
example how bad that would be now so now
the man is pacing back and forth he's
rubbing his hands he's thinking he's
thinking and he finally says I I know
what I want I want you to poke out one
of my eyes um so here uh right so like
you know why would we want that and I
was talking to a Russian seems like well
yeah you have to understand and Russia
your neighbor lives right next to you it
sort of on top of you my god it doesn't
make it better uh-uh it's so deeply
disquieting but I think it underscores
this idea of how how primal how
instinctive this comparison process is
and I want to suggest we can use these
comparisons for good and then also drive
us to be perfectly miserable so so in
the bad comparisons increased resentment
and spite but we have to find this
balance between motivation to be
powerfully motivating and resentment um
and there's a way to find that balance
where we don't overdo it and i'll i'll
conclude by by thinking about sibling
differentiation we're siblings often do
this almost instinctively we're siblings
as they're growing up there is this
constant point of comparison and twins
are the most intense comparisons that is
there's always a ready comparison how
well is your sibling doing compared to
how well you're doing and siblings
naturally differentiate themselves so
one sibling might be a really good
athlete another one either finds a
different sport or might find something
different altogether so they go into
drama or become the better still
and they end up differentiating
themselves and for twins this can be a
very powerful process because that
comparison is so aversive now here's the
irony uh there are some great twin
studies and if you look at twins who
have been separated at birth so twins
who went up for adoption raised in
totally different environments different
families and I'll show you an example
the second of one they're raised in
different religions totally different
places totally different atmospheres and
yet they sometimes emerge as more
similar than twins raised together right
so you think twins raised together they
should be more similar after all they
not only share the same genetic makeup
but also the same environment but
sometimes that social comparison can
drive them to be very different and when
they're raised you know separately they
could pursue whatever their life
passions were and here's a these these
these two twins or reared apart they
ended up they both own bodybuilding gems
they're both totally fitness freaks and
and when they saw each other they said
oh my god we are so similar and they
pursued almost identical path so so you
can see this differentiation when people
raise together and sometimes you see
things that are more similar when they
raised apart alright so that's the
social comparison piece on a turn it
over to Adam particularly so I'm going
to talk about a couple other topics from
the book and so the first one doesn't
want to tell you a little story about
iris Robinson she was a rising star in
the Democrat unisys in Ireland she owned
three homes in the united states and
ireland and london and at some point
during her rise the power she started
having affair with this 19 year old man
and seated him 50,000 pounds to build a
wonderful little cafe it turns out she
was also double claiming expenses and
employing family members and eventually
she was expelled in disgrace now to show
that it's not just women and engagements
behavior this is story of Mark Hurd his
time at hewlett-packard he started at
one of the lowest levels as a junior
sales analyst rose all the way up to CEO
he also pursued many women who are
younger than himself he also took them
out on lavish dinners and on rides with
expense that to HP and he was also fired
and disgraced and so trying to
understand this behavior of iris
Robinson I'm in mark hurd and what
combines them together I think it really
comes down to one word which is power
and so I can tell you a little about
some of the research that I've done in
maurices than others done over the last
couple decades really looking at the
psychological consequences of power and
understand what that is I want to take
us back two generations ago to a famous
biblical figure Samson he had hair that
made him invincible and what power does
is it makes you feel psychologically
invincible it makes you feel that you
can do anything now one of the things
that I pioneered over the years is the
idea that power is not just a structural
variable it's not just about controlling
amount of resources or being in a
certain position of authority that it's
a really a psychological state and that
we can activate that psychological state
outside of the structural forms of power
and just to give you an example this is
one of my former students Gillian koo
she'd given a job talk at Harvard
Business School and it hadn't gone well
at all it really was a disaster and her
confidence was shaken and then she went
to give a job talk at London Business
School and usually when you go there you
do a 90-minute talk you get inundated
with questions by faculty throughout the
whole thing they're really trying to
tear you down to test whether you have
what it takes to be a professor now they
also give you a little bit of time
before your talk to settle in and get
ready and so what Jillian decided to do
is she tried to do a little experiment
for herself which I had sort of
pioneered many years ago and what she
did is she and I'll show you this in a
second when she did is she said could I
prime my brain to think more powerfully
and so she write down and she she tried
to call an incident her life when she
herself felt powerful and she just wrote
out an essay about this and then she
went an interview and she was in
complete command of the entire room she
answered questions with poise she was
able to counter argue any sort of claim
that was trying to undermine the
validity of our arguments
and she got the job she now has 10 year
london business school and she was very
successful no after Jillian's
experienced enough all these other
studies we wanted to test whether this
is actually true phenomena we could
actually replicate in a real world
context so he went with some French
business school students who were
studying trying to get into into a
business school and they were given
opportunity to mock interviews and the
judges are told you no pick about half
the people that you think would deserve
to get in versus the half that don't
they didn't know this was an experiment
they didn't know any was being primed
but we took some of those people and we
told them I think about a time when they
had high power and some we told to think
about time when they lacked hour when
someone else had power over them and
then they went into these interviews and
they were evaluated by three judges i'm
going to show you this data first of all
is the control condition that didn't
think about anything they were true to
what the judges are supposed to do there
about fifty percent probability of
getting selected look what happened when
people thought about time when they lack
power it almost took away their
invincibility and made them vincible
they plummeted down to below thirty
percent of acceptance now let's look
what happened the people that simply
thought at a time when they had power
and we can see it went up all the way to
almost seventy percent so simply
thinking about time when they hit power
was enough to make them more confident
power increases confidence and optimism
and that's one of the good that's the
good in power but let's do a little
experiment now what I want you to do is
I want you to all hold up your hand just
like this dominant hand and I want you
to draw a capital letter e on your
forehead as quickly as possible draw a
capital letter e on your forehead as
quickly as possible now it turns out
that you can draw this e in one of two
ways now here's the correct way this is
what we call an other focus d or the
correct way it looks like an e to a
person the only reason to drawn in your
forehead is so it looks like you need
another person now some of you might
have drawn that you like this this is a
self focus now why am i showing you this
because an experiment we did back in two
thousand so many years ago we brought
people in the lab and we said you know
some of the people you're in the
high-power condition you control
important resources you're going to be
in charge we told some people you are
the subordinate position
you're going to be taken direction so
now someone else controls your resources
and they're going to decide what how
much you get and then before they did an
activity we asked them all to draw Ali
Annie on their forehead privately we
found is that very few the low-power
people drew this self-focused e but look
what happened in the high power
condition and went up three times the
level now excited another little
experiment did when we were we Maurice
and I went around 24 publishing houses
one day and we and we did a howl pitches
about her book and we went to Random
House and we went with the the group
including sort of the head of the whole
division as well as some sort of more
senior editors and junior editors and we
asked them to do draw the sea and lo and
behold the most senior member of the
team the most senior members the team
drew the so focus d and the junior
associates and editors drew the other
focusing I think that's what helped us
actually get the book deal was actually
getting to see this in in real action
but this is one of the problems which is
that power reduces perspective taking so
we have the good in power it's
invigorating confidence optimism
Samson's hair of invincibility in the
pad which it makes this a little so
focused so we need to find the right
balance how do we get that confidence
without getting the cell focus how do we
get confidence and other focus and to
get there I just want to give you a
little metaphor of a car how do we get
from point A to point B how do we get
from Seattle to redmond for example or
we have to get through lots of traffic
of course but to get there we need gas
we need acceleration we need to speed
down the highway but if we don't have a
steering wheel we crash into things
along the way and so power is basically
a psychological accelerator but
perspective-taking is a psychological
steering role and we have to combine
these together and to give you an
example of this I want to tell you a
little story about Gail and this is when
we're in power we have to remember how
our behavior impacts other people we
have to take their perspective now tell
a little story about Gail Gail was a
doctoral student when I was an assistant
professor Kellogg and I saw Gail one
morning and said hey Gail can you come
by my office afternoon I really need to
talk to you about something come by
about three she
to my office just like this she's like
what's up I was like if something so
trivial I can't even remember it was and
after our conversation she looked at me
and she said never do that to me again I
was like do what and she said never tell
me you need to talk to me you scared the
hell out of me all I've been doing the
whole day is rooming about is he mad at
me and I being punished I do something
wrong don't do that now I thought Gail
was kind of hysterical a little neurotic
and stuff like that and then the next
day the chair of my department a person
that would one day vote on my tenure
some emails at hey Adam can you come by
my office I need to talk to you later
today and then I walked into her office
is like hey oh my god what's going on
what did I do and again it was something
trivial and so what that's a great
example or demonstration that we need to
understand how our behavior impacts
other people so here's just one little
solution for all of you if you need to
talk to someone who has less power than
you at work either do one of three
things either tell them it's not a big
deal tell them exactly what it is and
get it over with or if it is a big deal
at least tell them that it's a big deal
and so they can become prepared for that
and so one of the things that we need to
do in power is power dimas' we rise of
empower our perspective a humility goes
down and we need to actively counteract
that now one thing about power high and
low power is that creates hierarchical
differences and so last thing that
Maurice and I want to tell you about is
when hierarchy wins and when it kills
now some of you may know at the very
beginning of their of their existence
google said we're engineers we don't
need any stinkin managers like we can
manage ourselves there's a total
disaster some of you may know that
Zappos recently has gone towards
holacracy whether trying to eliminate
management now typically in any given
year Zappos has two percent of their
work for script on a single day in April
fourteen percent of their workforce quit
over Halak recei so what did Google find
what is Zappo's starting to find is that
when we don't have some form of
hierarchy Leah chaos confusion and even
people leaving the organization now to
understand this I want to ask you a
question would you rather play a game
with your boss or your best friend now
most of you would say I'd rather play
game with my best friend they're my best
friend right I love playing games with
them but let me tell you a lot a little
game that people in the Netherlands
created you have a choice to make with a
partner you have two options option a
over here gives you eight lottery
tickets and your boss for lottery
tickets option B over here gives your
boss aight lottery ticket or your
partner a lottery tickets and you for
lottery tickets now here's the one key
thing about this game is you both have
to pick the same option or you get
nothing now when your boss it's really
easy you think my boss deserves eight
lottery tickets and I should get the
four and your boss says I deserve this
and so you coordinate your behavior and
you both win now imagine playing the
game with your best friend now you might
think i'm going to be generous i'm going
to give my best friend aight lottery
tickets but they think i'm going to be
generous and they decide to give you
eight lottery tickets and then you both
are different points and you both get
nothing what do you think I bet they're
going to be generous so I'm going to be
selfish but they think the same thing
and then they're selfish and then you
both get nothing so what you can see
here is something really really
important and powerful which is that
hierarchy allows us to coordinate our
behavior because it creates some
patterns of deference and this is one of
the curses of co-leadership often in
Cote leadership is a good idea
complementary skills but co-leadership
creates problems and patterns of
deference and it makes it very difficult
for people lead and so one of the
projects that we did is we looked at
every fashion house in the world that
had shown in Milan Paris London and New
York and we had independent journalists
and buyers we didn't actually have them
actually a French magazine had them and
we found is that in these cases fashion
houses that were led by two code of your
co-creative directors had lower
creativity so basically co-leadership
killed creativity in these fashion
houses now let me give you sort of
another way to think about this as
talent we think more talent is always
better right we want the most talented
people
however when those talented people have
to coordinate their behavior it can be
problematic so this was the Miami Heat
they join the forces but even on the day
when they announced that three the best
players are coming together it was very
clear that there is no hierarchy Wayne's
house LeBrons Kingdom bashas pit
couldn't be all three and they were so
bad in close games they were 29th out of
30 teams in their first year together
they couldn't coordinate the get
behavior bill simmons when his famous
sports writer said until they figure out
a pecking order there won't be any order
and they won't be successful now what
happened with Miami Heat Wade hurt his
knee became forty percent of Dwyane Wade
and they solved that dueling banjos
problem but we decided to analyze could
we actually find this effect in the NBA
so this is what we did we took ten years
of NBA data we coded for how much talent
each team had and we looked at how were
they did from the winning percentage and
what you can see here is exactly what
you might think is that as the number of
top talented players increased the
format's went up but only up to a point
at a certain point actually started to
have a negative overall effect on
behavior so hierarchy helps with
coordination and hierarchy helps with
patterns of deference and eventually
produces better performance now two
things I want to say about this the
first is the too much talent effect
doesn't occur when we don't need
interdependence so we analyze the same
data with baseball and all we found was
a positive linear effect always going
forward baseball teams more talent was
always better so we can see that the
second thing is even though hierarchy
helps with coordination cooperation
there's a problem it often suppresses
low-power voices so let me give you sort
of one example this a study that we did
that we published last year some
colleagues of mine is we analyzed every
expedition that's ever gone at the
Himalayas in the history of the
Himalayas and what we found is that if
they came from a country that was more
hierarchical
they were more likely to have people die
on the mountain because low power people
didn't feel comfortable speaking up and
expressing their perspective another
case where this happens tragically is in
surgery research has shown that doctors
often skip important checks list that
can lead to infection during surgery
which you can get into the main line and
have catastrophic effects and oftentimes
the nurses didn't feel comfortable
speaking up even when they notice that a
checklist had been skipped and so
hierarchy can produce disasters because
it prevents low-power people from
speaking up so we need to find the right
balance how do we get the benefits of
hierarchy coordination without the
silence of low power how do we get
coordination with all voices being heard
so I'm going to give you sort of three
examples of this what did Johns Hopkins
do to reduce the rate of infections of
surgery they said we're actually going
to give the less powerful people on the
team some authority so they did as they
said you know actually going to put
nurses in charge of the checklist and
that will empower them to contrast that
another example the producer of the
shield noticed in the story pitch
meetings that the women didn't really
speak up very much and he went to them
and said I'm gonna be a good guy let me
go tell them you should feel comfortable
speaking up and he did that and then
they laughed in his face they said watch
what happens when we do speak up and he
observed and he noticed that when the
woman spoke up they end up getting
interrupted pretty quickly people kind
of take their ideas and go with them so
would he what Gregg decided to do was he
created a new rule no one can interrupt
any wondering story pitching and he
discovered two things that were great
about this role the first thing was the
women spoke up more or more engaged and
more involved the second thing is that
improved everybody's ideas because as
soon as people knew they have the time
and space to communicate they express
themselves more ticularly and they led
to better ideas the final example which
is I think also really crucial is
getting information privately right if
I'm in the room and I'm a low-power
person I'm not going to feel as
comfortable speaking up if I have to do
it in front of more powerful people but
if I can express
I perspective anonymously and privately
I'm going to feel more comfortable and
my colleague at Kellogg is created
actually an app called the candor app
which allows people to express their
viewpoints privately and so here again
you can see we need to find the right
balance so our here's the big takeaway
of the book the big takeaway good book
is that every relationship is
characterized by tension between
cooperation and competition we're
constantly oscillating back and forth
and so we need to find the right balance
but here's the really important thing
just knowledge of that is incredibly
powerful aware the fact that there is
this tension allows us to navigate that
tension more effectively now Doug
mentioned to just a couple other topics
of the book and I'll just say two things
really briefly and then we're happy to
you know spend some time answering
questions the first thing is that we
talk a lot about in the book about how
do we get people to trust us what are
some of the things that we can do to
give people trust us at the same time
what are the things that we can do to
detect deception of other people so we
don't get exploited and then finally
sometimes we're going to miss step we're
all going to miss step how do we put the
pieces back together through apologies
and maurices and the world's expert on
apologies and this chapter eight it's
really amazing that teaches you about
how to apologize when to apologize and
how to apologize more effectively the
final thing which Doug brought up is we
also talked about when to start your
engines when do you want to go on
competitive interactions do you want to
be the first one interviewed or the last
one interviewed do you want to make the
first offer or do you want to receive
the first offer and we answer all of
these things want to be first on the
ballot or lower on a ballot and we
answer when to go and how to go in all
types of competitive interactions
whether it's a job interview whether
it's a political ballot whether it's the
Olympics or American Idol whether it's a
negotiation and so we hope that you've
enjoyed this here's some contact
information more recent are happy to
answer any questions you got and bring
on both as friends and foes ask whatever
it whatever you want so thank you so
much
we're very very clear it was so clear
there's no question is back there yeah
there's a how the 60 part how much of
your book is the academic analysis of
your quesadillas versus the house apart
I think well two things I'll say about
it first of all is that I mean the book
is very much simultaneously a
combination of deep analysis into the
social science literature and some case
studies but every chapter ends with this
section called finding the right balance
which has very clear guidelines for how
to be more successful so how to
apologize for example or how to make the
first offer as another example or how to
find the right balance between you know
nicknames and slurs for examples how do
we deal with names effectively how do we
what are the ways that we can develop
trust quickly but not get exploited and
so it's it's got very rich entertaining
case studies but they're all geared
towards giving you certain practical
feedback for how to be more successful
and I think that you know the best
compliment that we ever got it was the
editor of the Atlantic who described her
book as combines the best of malcolm
gladwell for economics with the best of
better business books right so it's
really sort of that that intersection of
those so and on a few had yeah yeah I'm
telling you the second ago Trump or talk
about gene haha so the second girlfriend
is the guy says I won't forget the wife
would be sexual where you know we're
beautiful drive me to a limit of my
sexual abilities no that's good yeah
thats expelling the kidney version also
writing a book is incredibly difficult I
mean I've written a thesis and I find it
but working on your own is difficult how
did you put cooperate and writing this
book why did you choose to cooperate or
not and wanna be just the right through
them separate books sharing your own
your separately um well I we're talking
a bit in the end acknowledgments the
quick stories I was I was at a
conference
so I gotten tenure and I ran to Adam and
answer or what he gonna do as though I'm
gonna write a book I described me he's
like right about I describe my book idea
and he said oh that's that's stupid
don't write that book uh let's write a
book together it'll be better the first
rise like uh a little bit obnoxious oh
and then I thought I'm like you know
what he's right and it's absolutely true
of this book guys but this book is way
better than what I would have done and
it it's it's a denser book that is
there's there's a lot more material in
here it's a richer book I'm delighted by
it it reflects a collaboration it was
hard it was hard work but I think we
both poured ourselves into this book and
it it really reflects the best of what
we both can do so it's it was it was a
difficult tension but I think it it
ended up being uh and let me just say
I'll just give you two quick ways of
thinking about that too you know I
brought up co-leadership up there right
you know and like the benefits we want
is really complementarity and one of the
things that you know Maurice and I both
do research in sort of the broad similar
areas but we also do different topics so
I didn't do any work on trust or on
deception or on apologies or on
comparisons or very little in comparison
gym barista that but I done work on
power and social hierarchy first offers
and negotiation and so then we were able
to combine that but then even within
chapters we were able to bring in some
different perspectives so like on the
comparison chapter I knew about this
research really well for example that
talked about some negotiation stuff
about you know how how you want to think
about negotiations to get yourself
motivated but how they can leave you
disappointed afterwards or why it is
that some people actually or have to
leave why many people have happier lies
when they actually graduate in a
recession because I don't have so many
job comparisons to compare to they're
just happy to get the one they got and
so I was able that but then i wrote my
specialty was a little bit on names
andrea appropriations but then maurice
had all this great knowledge about like
where there were doctor came from and
why doctors medical doctors stole it
from
years but then how are trying to steal
it back you know by calling themselves
doctors and so even within the chapters
that one of us led we were constantly
adding stuff to it and so it was just a
lot of disparate knowledge about that
what one just sort of final quick thing
I'll say is that Maurice is a better
writer than I am I'm for this sort of
popular press audience I mean I actually
acknowledge that in my acknowledgments
to him at the end of the book and then
Maurice went and wrote acknowledgments
that were better written than by
acknowledging so therefore proving the
point so it's a sort of good good
example that there's a hand up over here
yeah so very often went projects succeed
not everybody gets credit for it so
based on the research that you might
have done or you've observed anecdotal
what can people do to ensure that up
beyond the team success the individual
success also gets shower gets the
visibility yeah I mean I think it's
that's one of those in here intentions
finding the right balance between you
want people to recognize your
accomplishments but we get punished if
we self promote and so trying to find
this this right balance ma I think you
know there are a couple things that I
think are really important one thing the
literature shows really well is if
Maurice wants to self-promote and have
people know about his accomplishments
when Maurice wants to do is get me to do
that for him and so one of the best
things that you can do is if you if
you're like want other people to know
and you have a team member who you trust
and who cares about you if they can't
out your accomplishment you're going to
get so much more credit than if you
taunt your accomplishment yourself so
one of the things that you can all do is
one of those little solutions is I can
get other people and actually one of the
women who's done that that research is
Christina Fong who's at the University
of Washington right down the road and I
think that's one of my favorite examples
of research that's been successful don't
you have any thoughts yeah which of you
two is the better author ah well Adams
the best that's right uh yeah this was a
bit really did this book really it took
us many years to write in it it really
integrates our knowledge and we filled
in pieces for something more competitive
yeah well I think that you know you have
to recognize yourself a longer trip
ahead of us we used to take a little bit
more time today than I than I did so it
will so there's always that little bit
of competition about that um vitally one
last thing about comparisons that sort
of funny as i was telling we had a book
launch party in the editor as their the
publisher of the agent and i was saying
that you know we had the best editor
that you could ever imagine and then my
roommate from college was like she's the
only editor you ever had you actually
don't know she's any good or not right
and so you know even that sense but she
was the best editing we could have had
but but it's like even that sense it's
hard to know yeah there is handled yeah
so you talked about the borrow dynamic
among peers like you you I feel you tend
to compare oh but people who are like at
your level of Somali your age your
neighbor or same level in the company
how does it work across different levels
like Howard like a boss what like what
will be the power dynamic in a boss and
like the person who reports like how do
you because because once a like when
you're moving up a hierarchy you are
actually gaining power and you might be
in power over someone who is higher than
you are then how does that all work come
to oh I'll talk to the comparison idea
we compare ourselves with people who are
similar in self relevant domains domains
we care about and I and those are the
most intense comparisons when people
have outperformed us by just a little
bit and there's similar so the person
the cubicle next to us our neighbor our
brother in law our sibling so somebody
who's similar and it's a domain that we
really value so if we're a long distance
runner in somebody has a good running
time we care about it but if somebody
wins a baking competition we might be
just happy for them and when the
performance is somewhere in the vicinity
of you know I could have done that those
are the most intense comparisons when
somebody is as up from us by a lot then
we can be
we could be filled with admiration I
couldn't have seen myself do that or
that's a domain that's so different from
me there we can be much more happy but
but but there are power dynamics and so
this is where you see maurices expertise
in comparisons my expertise in power
because I think that one of the things
we do talk about in the book is
phenomenally gets talked a lot about in
the popular literature which is
something called the queen bee
phenomenon and this has been empirically
validated on where they showed that um
we can you can say it's women but it's
really any person who is a rare species
in a high status group so that often is
sort of you know the solo woman in the
executive team and they become
particularly punishing towards other
women who might be rivals to their
throne and so there you can see sort of
one of those examples where that happens
it's not at something unique to women's
just unique to there's no one else like
me here I like being special and I like
being part of this high status group I
don't want anyone to invade my territory
and so that's an example where someone
here is comparing the people below them
and travaille an event them another
thing that happens so in an organization
all the time is two people join
organization their peers their peers
their peers even as they rise up and
then one of them moves up one notch
higher and that gets back to maurices
point about that's really painful but
it's also problematic because it's like
I don't know how to interact with this
person now they were my friend they're
my peer and now they're my boss are they
still my friend or they now my boss and
do I have to treat them differently and
so people really suffer and struggle
with those types of relationships on
Maurice and I are writing a piece right
now about why makes us uncomfortable
when our friends asked us to help them
get a job at our work you know well
there's lots of reasons why that happens
right if they're our friends they come
and work with us it might ruin our
friendship or they might outperform us
and it going to be really painful or
they might suck and make us look bad
because we recommended them and so then
you can see this so maybe this is better
off you know what they're actually are
no positions and my organizations and
don't pass on the resume and so it makes
a little bit more complicated yeah sort
of disc
tent with a comparison to ever turn into
schadenfreude what What's Up Sid over
yeah so Shawn fries this sort of
delicious construct where we take
pleasure in somebody else's downfall and
you can think of you know when Martha
Stewart got sent to prison the
incredible media coverage about you know
how did she look in pinstripes and you
know what is she baking with the prison
sort of cranberries like uh we're just
enjoying this it was sorta licious
enjoyment if somebody else's misfortune
um and their shot schadenfreude it's an
incredibly common phenomenon and we do
this with people that we feel some Envy
toward and it's it's again those
ingredients that is people that we've
been looking up to or people that have
made us feel somehow inadequate so
Martha Stewart is this incredible figure
but she's folding napkins betters her
thanksgiving dinner always looks better
you know everything looks so organized
and we see somebody fall um who we
looked up to we often find ourselves
enjoying that and you see this with
gossip for example so we will sort of
gossip about that person who we thought
always was a little bit sort of better
in some other way we find out they're
not and we take pleasure in it and I
think there's two other things that
about shutting Florida first is shot in
for it it tends to be a little
asymmetric so it's the slightly less
status or lower less powerful person
that feels more shot in Florida towards
that so one of the the famous days they
did that they looked at a German and
Dutch fans during the World Cup and
Germany was pretty happy when the Dutch
lost especially if they had already lost
so you get much more delight if I'm no
longer in it like but the Dutch got
particular joy when the Germans lost
when they had been knocked out so and I
grew up in Chapel North Carolina and I
grew up to hate Duke with all my heart
and soul and many people in Chapel Hill
fell away but Duke is kind of like yeah
Chapel Hill we don't like them but they
don't have the same vitriol and shot in
Florida that that uh that Chapel help
people if he mentioned the 2010 change
chip if Gordon Hayward from Butler hit
that half-court shop it may have been
the greatest moment of my life if that
is and then just one final thing and
then I see two hands up over here the
other thing is how do we prevent
schadenfreude and there's oh it's how we
treat people we have power is really one
of the ways that we can prevent Shawn
forta if we can be that better
perspective taker and treat people with
a level respect when we fall people are
they going to be there to help us rather
than to take the light in our in our
Father resentment is yeah right if you
can if you can manage that resentment
you're going to be much better off
there's a hand here and then went back
there yeah yes I did you have something
about time this one is from on high oh
whoa online yeah instant have any
thoughts on how to get balances and
different dimensions become part of your
natural tendency to do it to me that
balance hard hard wired yeah can you be
a question yeah so this question at
least as I am misinterpreting it is you
know how do we basically get this
balance hardwired so so there's this
balance where we can compete too much
cooperate too much we can look at
comparisons that sort of drive us to be
miserable or can motivate us how do we
find that balance I think the first key
step is to really recognize this idea
that is we like to naturally classify
people and things around us so we
classify people as interrupts engineers
or marketing people at a very young age
we classify people as girls and boys
we're constantly categorizing our world
and what we're suggesting is it's sort
of a challenge of that we're not friends
or foes we're both and to recognize that
the people around us that we're
interacting with the people on our team
the people at home we're friends and
foes and we've got to make sure that we
get credibly some sort of share credit
and that we make sure we get credit we
need to make sure that we're making
comparisons in a way that helped us and
don't always hurt us and I think that
awareness can put us on the right path
but it's a constant challenge I also
think you know it's how do you find the
right balance it requires I guess a
process of somewhat
not constant but somewhat common
reflection just ask yourself you know in
my relationship with Maurice you know do
we have right balance in my relationship
with my wife do I have the right balance
and asking ourselves that question and
having that reflection and even you know
take something like the best public
speaker in the world or the best
baseball hitter the best golf golfer
they all have coaches right so even the
things that they do really well they
still need some help and I think we all
need help in that reflection helps us so
one of the things that Maurice does when
he teaches negotiation he does everyone
to write a reflection of every
negotiation and then halfway through he
has them ask themselves that question am
I imbalance in my negotiation am I
always getting good outcomes but then
hurting other people along the way am I
always getting bad outcomes because I'm
being too nice am i finding that right
balance between those two forces and I i
think his like task is a great one just
an opportunity to reflect yeah you
mentioned power index our index when you
talk about the doctors or yep as you've
done your research and you blew it
echoes across cultures and you know
depending on the country there's like
different powering mixes any trends any
examples of where it's easier to
cooperate and compete at the same time
and others where it's not well I mean
hierarchy is very complicated right
because hierarchy has this benefit of
creating patterns of difference at quake
cooperation and so it actually turns out
i mentioned countries are horumarka
hierarchical had more people died in the
mountain they also had more people
succeed on the mountain so it's it's a
complex balance between these forces I
mean I think they're generally is a
drive in the world towards trying to
find ways to have collective
intelligence and the ways to get to
collective intelligence to make sure
that everyone's perspective even those
with less power or able to be integrated
and one of the ways we see this in in
the military is military and the Special
Forces have much less hierarchy than in
the normal other areas of the military
because they have to deal with complex
decisions that have to made very quickly
they need to be able to integrate
everyone's perspective even those that
wouldn't have the most power and so I
think there's a trend towards that we
want to get the benefit of hierarchy but
without the downsides and so trying to
find ways to do that avenues to do that
is
successful candor app is another example
of that so one more yeah one more
question is it a good one ask about the
zappos they say there's no hierarchy I
think in reality it's likely to happen
that people or more of a bully to make
them yeah put himself in charge so end
up silly the hierarchy but the wrong
people in charge right and what is
better what horrors worst and that maybe
some other rice what do you think that
it's like this or different yeah this is
very very quickly one thing I've learned
from adamant throughout history and
every human collective there's always
hierarchy so even we think that there's
no hierarchy we naturally find ourselves
in some in some hierarchy so through
every human collective has it so whether
we call it a whole lokra see or not
there is a hierarchy and I think your
points exactly right that is we could
end up with the wrong people driving
decisions if we're not careful and I
think the final thing which recent are
actually working on a project about is
the idea that you know we think rules
are constricting but when you don't have
any rules you get the bullies dominate
and you have an outcome that that is
predictable and so what rules do is they
give equal opportunity for people to
compete without having just the bully
sort of dominate and so I think exactly
your point is really important thank you
guys so much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
