information about their local
environments down from generation to
generation but it seems increasingly
likely that young farmers are going to
see circumstances that our parents and
grandparents didn't necessarily see
we were asked as USDA to look at the
vulnerability of the food supply to
climate change
which meant we could start mining all of
the data that we have and when we
started thinking about mining data and
being able to have somebody in the
private sector work with us Microsoft
was there Microsoft in the USDA are
rolling out an Innovation Challenge
which is really a call to action for
developers around the world to start
digging into some of the key data sets
that the USDA's been collecting over the
past hundred years on crop production
practices financial outcomes
demographics and remote sensing products
of the health of crops around the
country the Innovation Challenge I think
is just one of those exciting outcomes
of this whole climate data initiative
and that is creating public private
partners like Microsoft to actually
create and do something new and
different and to make these datasets
available to the larger public
using data and information and
transferring knowledge between people
who aren't necessarily co-located close
together
gives us an opportunity to improve our
practices based on their understanding
that we might not otherwise have had
access to solutions that answer some of
the key questions that the USDA has
about how to ensure the resiliency of
America's food supply now that's what I
think as your services brings us it's a
way to connect the dots across all of
these different different sources
having a healthy farm economy everybody
bringing all of those different kinds of
data together is going to be difficult
it's going to be a challenge and that's
why we're asking people around the world
to help the USDA solve this
