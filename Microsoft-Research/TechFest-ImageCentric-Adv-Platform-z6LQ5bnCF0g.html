next to Matt Scott and matt is gonna
talk to us about image centric
advertisement platform correct yes it is
okay just a quick short little name can
we call it something sexual during sex
here um busy ads okay what's a busy add
talk to me busy at is visual ads so ads
that are activated from visual content
so for example I can take a picture of a
magazine or a billboard and I can get
advertisements based on content within
that image so an example would be say
taking a picture of nike shoes or an
Olympic logo and you can get gets a
coupons if you take a picture of it you
just stroll through your normal day in
life and take your camera phone and snap
pictures of you know 2d image or 2d
surfaces now but eventually anything
right what's the benefit there obviously
you mentioned the coupons yeah so you
can actually just get more information
connect the visual world I'm sorry the
physical world to the virtual world so
in the in the physical world in the in
the real world there's only so much you
can get you can just look at it and
maybe you can mark something down marker
down a URL but here you can actually
connect say on your phone connect to the
website and get more information and
it's very useful for advertisers to
because then they can be I can be more
accurate to track their campaign so if
they just have ads all over the subway
they it's not really directly correlated
to sales so if users take pictures of it
with their phone they can track the
performance of their advertisements
directly just the same as ads work on
the web today so you can track clicks
and stuff like that I know this is sort
of in its early stages but would you
have to recruit advertisers like North
German and nike and Macy does everyone
need to pay for this like how are the
hour those people garnered it would be
the same system as ads are today on the
web so so if I want to bid on keywords
online I would just go to a website a
platform image as a verte
platform which we have right now and
instead of bidding on keywords text you
would bid on the images themselves so
you can upload the images and that would
get into our system and then users can
search for let's take a look at a try it
show me impress me Wow me alright so
I've got here a billboard I took from
China actually I work in Beijing
Microsoft Research 8 Microsoft Research
Asia and so this is a billboard and it
contains some logos so you've got sequel
server here and office logo here and the
entire thing is itself a look big
Microsoft ad big Microsoft ed but the
cool thing is I'm going to actually take
a picture of it and I because these
logos are inside of it ads will show up
for those for those product and imagine
this can work / mms take an mms shot and
just send it to a server but for the
demo I'm just actually doing it over
Bluetooth the transport doesn't really
matter so I'll just go ahead and you can
see so we're going for the sequel server
one yeah so actually i'll get sequel
server more in this picture
sequel server sequel server in office
you can imagine this to be a bit this
again this is early stage but you can
imagine this to be more sophisticated
with you know again coupons and whatnot
being delivered to the phone when I see
get to the point where you can take
pictures of everything in the world
absolutely that's that's more of the
direction like the image recognition
technology itself right now is still
evolving but right now we're pretty good
again with 2d surfaces 3d objects a
little bit more of in the future thank
you very much and what's the URL the
people can go and sort of keep tabs on
what you're doing um well right now it's
not it's not in public URL but
eventually you can you can find it just
check out research that microsoft com
and you know we'll post something there
when we're ready and how about
shortening down that name gonna work on
that ya threw out for image centric
