thank you Kenji for your introduction
and good afternoon my name is Jung Lu
from South Korea Seoul National
University and I'm ecologist and my
partner is multi Humphrey he's from
University of Virginia he was supposed
to be here but he left earlier for the
emergency and in this presentation I
talked about how to use fat climate and
modest as your system to accelerate
visualization and data analysis of
terrestrial carbon and water fluxes let
me start to it thank to my collaborators
this is teamwork this is not my own work
this is a team work first mirin and wen
Ming and Dennis coordinated this project
and a series of basic science folks
helped a lot Kenji Stargate satya bill
facility to enter v3 and my student at
SNU su-yong and my the kind of mentor in
science the cattery bunion he was a
former pro kyun microsoft research let
meet reduce from a previous three of
modest edger because this talk is the
integration of the touch climb and Body
Snatcher so let me start with what is
modest as you
before to do that i will briefly explain
what i am studying i'm the ecologist and
i'm studying the water water and carbon
fluxes in the touristy ecosystems too
many the two major variables in my
research study is etm TPP it is
evapotranspiration it is the sum of
evaporation and transpiration and
between them the transpiration accounts
for eighty to ninety percent of global
UT so it is the dominant component in
ett and gbps gross primary productivity
it is the psalm of tracer photosynthesis
and the co2 n h2 gas exchanges in
smaller it is a tiny pour in the back
side of the leaves but once it is
integrated over leaf canopy forest and
global then it forms in many determines
the climate system roughly seventy
percent of land press land precipitation
returns to the atmosphere through our
adapt transpiration there are two red
square shoes yep red skirt shows land
presentation and global scale hundred
thirteen and the evaporation is roughly
773 so those roughly seventy percent why
chicopee is so important so this is
recently I piece is a f5 report on
annual scale the gross primary
productivity is 13 times greater than
any release of anthropogenic co2
released the atmosphere when we know the
global warming is being accelerated the
cause of the greenhouse gases released
by the human and but that amount is
roughly 10,000 per year when global
scale that global land ecosystems absorb
128 23 petal and carbon leaders all
but the problem is there is lots of
uncertainty the range is from 113 370
the range of uncertainty is much bigger
than the co2 released by the human so
there are two types of ecosystem models
one is the diagnosis model the other is
pronounced model do you pervs I believe
he is the expert in the prognosis muddle
and I think he will talk about the pub
prognostic model in his talk soon
wellness model is to use for predict the
future and it typically has a course
patcher and temporal reservations like
100 kilometer and temporal resolution is
monthly and I will focus on diagnosed
but in this presentation diagnostic
model is needed to the sender past
typically it has it requires very high
spatial and temporal resolution input
data from cellulite and like one curator
and daily graduation so to predict the
future we should on the center past that
is the first step to understand the
global climate system stand how to do
how to apply to Dinah's model in global
scale the only way is to leave the
sensing data IP lip and one of them is
bogus it is on board terra and aqus
terra lies in NASA and Terra Terra was
launched it in two thousand and our call
was launched in 2002 and the modus has
three disciplines one is land and the
others like atmosphere and the other is
ocean in this presentation I am using
the land and emma sphere product and it
produces 285 gigabyte all day for
satellite and the sum of Terra aqua
gives 570 gigabyte per day that means if
we integrate over the 10 years then it
is roughly two petabytes so this is big
data it is the data intensive science
so the motivation of about this as your
project it'll scope it goes back to two
thousand eight when I was a PhD student
at Berkeley at the time I wrote the
proposer to NASA and the title was
improving global trust your estimates of
adapt transpiration under climate change
with the scenery's of Modi's Roxanna and
nickel physical models fortunately that
proposal was accepted but at the time I
had no idea about how much it computer
resources could be needed to achieve
that goal I was very naive at the tire
just wrote the proposal and it was
accepted then but in reality it was very
ambitious proposal but my thesis advisor
is he's very respectable in intense
advisor tennis ball hockey he's the
field guy he has enough money but the
money goes for the field instrument
maintaining the site and purchasing new
sensors and in the office i was just i
had one pc that is the only resource
that I could use at the time then how
could use just single pc for the global
user sensing study and unfortunately
penge walls could not make here today
but at the time i visited pangong he was
one of my thesis advisor separately i
showed my proposal to him and I
explained this is my proposal and pang
told me that you should know computer
farewell to achieve your goal
in the end I developed a kind of coupled
equation model it is breathing or
systems you later it couples a mistake
ready to transfer and cannot be ready to
transfer photosynthesis transpiration
leaf and it's balanced and sort of
operation it is diagnosed model but it
it is process oriented by physical model
and how to run this mother in global
scale there are several barriers the
first video is data size at the time
those two thousand eight the tape I
download a petabyte the terabyte from
NASA ftp to attitude you might think a
terabyte is not a big this year because
the external hard drive is now four to
five terabyte when thousand eight that
was huge it was I could not handle in my
pc and we launched we double date
terabyte but 940 terabyte we would
across the cloud computing system the
next barrier was the data download Alex
and Tony hey already mentioned Tim great
but i think his his remark was excellent
he he envisioned that rate of data size
increase is much faster than rate of
internet speed increase we ended up
taking 55 days to download the data from
nasa ftp to the agile system just two
months just download if we could use the
fedex then it will take just one day but
NASA did not allow we just downloaded
through internet to the cloud and the
third barrier is the harmonizing the
heterogeneous data structures in modest
the modest line poverty is the left side
it is not standardized the sinusoidal
position is already the pixel location
is creative terminus so it is very easy
to use but modest atmospheric product is
it is a swath format it is latitude and
longitude so too
co-located these two products is needed
to greet the reproduction process after
Labor tube with this emissary product it
takes lots of time and the last barrier
was the data processing to complete
global one year ET and TPP we learned
that 9000 superiors it took nine
thousand hours and that is 375 days thus
completing one year data takes one year
with one cpu let us impossible to do my
PhD course so we used 250 version was
instant attitude and it took only less
than two days so I think the power of
the address system is it is highly
flexible highly depending on the demand
we can increase the torture the size of
the virtual machines and yes using up to
250 virtual machines it was very he make
a quickly happen all my products in 2009
we made a team with this agile as I
mentioned the Catherine ban England in
Microsoft Research she organized one
team and in LVL 2 tab and Keith and in
universal version yet the Martin each
year let's see he is a excellent and
fantastic registering at time and I
think he entered microsoft research we
made a team and we had a regular
conference call every week and really
pissed at Berkeley in 2009 a we work
together three month and we had a lot of
work at the time the basic idea is I
obsess the web porter and you cast
something and everything happens in the
cloud data collection from NASA active
sir NASA apt observer to the agile and
the repositioning cloud and data
analysis in the cloud and I got the
result through the emails it is highly
interdisciplinary project and also we
made of
very good outcomes the red crow is the
country of science conference paper with
journal papers and the black color is
white your science papers and of course
you share the co-authorship and we
contributed together let us I it was
very exciting opportunity that's one
example data processing Porter it is web
interface one can select ear days and
type of satellite location of the
highest and selected to instance of
instance number the number of virtual
machines and you can and leave my email
then every result will be delivered to
my email address and I unloaded the
compiled exe files to the agile and then
I could monitor the status of the
processing almost in the real time here
the processing is 28 seceded is 2000
failed the three and it was very useful
to what is happening in the cloud so in
the end I use it to my single pc but i
obsessed through the address system then
I created this global maps of GBP and et
but you mean I should noted that naps
are created in my home pc i downloaded
all Wizards from the ma the add you to
my TCM natal maps okay so that is the
night the next stamp what can be done
that i can you to further using the
address system that is the integrating
fetch climate and motifs as your system
what is fetch climate how many people do
you hear about the pets climb I think
there was a tutorial by the too you
pervs this thurs Tuesday right I think
you or Kenji should know much better
than myself for about 50 climate but to
my understanding the fetch climate is
that integrates the mapping the
visualization tool and the data analysis
tool so that is very powerful so why is
it needed first thing is blogging the
proverb says seeing one time is better
than this 300 times when we look at the
text files teleological information but
we want to show what the day that tells
us what the data is looks like we have
no idea but by making the map we can do
better sense of the data and we can do
better science why you need it the
second iteration is painful if I do in
my PC i'm using matlab to make 10 map
first select region and sell it
available select a time determine pixel
resolution convert the sinusoidal to
latitude and longitude using the
reposition process and convert the top
type integer time to fit data into one
to 100 110 128 scale and send mapping
parameters blah blah and repeat it is
painful and also the limits of the size
and metrics in the manner it does not
support very big size of the metrics so
even if I have the one commuter
resolution data to make the global map I
resize the data by thanking Witter so
I'm losing my information
the visualizing big data remains a great
challenge is to invert the scientist
first complexities in that position you
TM TM sinusoidal latitude and longitude
tell that a position is not easy to use
and also depending on the questions and
hypotheses we need different temporal
and spatial resolutions hourly daily
monthly URI work one kilter thank you
Peter 100 curator and also we can we
could use different statistical
properties I'd like means television
were students or ketosis so I think we
really need to integrate this mapping
tool like the pin lab or google map and
data analysis tool I think the one good
example is data cube system I think the
data cube system was developed by the
Jean Grey and his colleagues in mid 90s
and the heterogeneous data is formed
into a cube and depending on depending
on the request the cube is rotated and
the output is delivered it is very smart
system and I learned that that climate
is doing that so the idea in this
project is in conventional approach the
data was downloaded to the local PC and
using some soft your life in bat lab we
analyzed in my pc and if i try to share
the wizard the research community then
send email but in this project we aim to
do everything in the cloud data is
downloaded to download it to address
system and moody schedule system is
processing all the data and fetch
climate instance is located into into
the address system and also some soap
visualizing the data and if needed then
we can easily share the output to the
research community
so in this project as a pilot study we
rent movies as root system for the
global end in 2012 and modest data
downloaded from NASA ftp server to the
agile and we completed GP p.m. ET in a
job andrey project to equidistance
little projection with nessa TF data
format that is indeed it in patch
climate and look at that club instance
to as you and visualize gpp ET and saw
relation okay i hope okay unfortunate
with the veggie climb system is too it
looks it is not working so i will show
this screenshot this is the first
example of using fetch climate instance
for third parties s nu theta look at
here the ETA if I on all the different
variables that the list of variables up
here here and if I selected this click
that variable then this man happens and
I think this is neat this very it is
wonderful this map shows the applying
the lower and upper limit in the case
evapotranspiration in this region and
this blue line is the seasonal variation
of evaporation in this specific pixel so
by moving the mouse this blind changes
and here is month if I move
january-february march through December
if I move this button then the maps
change with the seasons in fordham
working I can zoom in and zoom out it is
another example in south korea
and okay this is interface of the face
climate if we go to what then here is
that the data unloaded in the fetch
climate instance for the specific
request here TT evapotranspiration unit
and the location of the tiles and also
we can select when individual ears
averages over the years average over the
chunks and days then hours if data has
very high temperatures and then you can
select higher temporal resolution maps
and we're here we can define the
boundary of the oops two min and to mark
looks working but the data is not happen
appearing here and the number of the
cells determined us pixel resolution so
because I have the one computer
resolution map so we can zoom in and we
can increase the we can see more data
and if we click fetch them the fetch
climate is making the new the map
interface
okay the demo I was trying to use shows
the time but it looks not working so I
was kept okay to summoning conclusions
the Fed climate enables us to map one's
own data one's own data in the Aegean
and the data download processing and
visualization can be done in the agile
and global one year results are in the
edges but the tax climate is unable to
map the old data so we just subset like
Korea and the mexico and but yeah the
best climbing team is working very hard
it is still in progress project okay
thank you very much
okay thank you you know so just while
we're setting up a few honest a here
liew is going to come and set up so what
we're doing that if we got some
questions from for young rell for his
his great talk have a question for you
yeah so do you think with the modis
actual this this this idea of using the
cloud for environmental science so lots
of other kind of people in your lab
who'd be interested in using this or
other collaborators see things is this
way of using the cloud for environmental
science but I think for example I i
found one talk yesterday by i think the
chinese academy of sciences they I think
they used a kind of persimmon of
platform of the bodies as your system
your study I was very excited the system
is used by other groups and I think if
the platform could be shared i think and
what people could use I believe that's
great that's great we're going to have
some more time for questions at the end
so please think think about those
questions email me with the questions
but thank you getting around say thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
