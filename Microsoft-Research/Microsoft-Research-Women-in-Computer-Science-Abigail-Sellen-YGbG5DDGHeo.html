called socio digital systems and we are
a multidisciplinary group so we have
computer scientists in the group but we
also have designers and social
scientists and so my background is in
psychology and human factors engineering
so I'm not a kind of conventional
computer scientists I think the best
thing about the job is that you it's a
job in which it's a good thing to be
curious about things and if you have a
lot of curiosity about the things that
you study you have the freedom to do
that and you have the freedom to pursue
the things that you are most interested
in so so I started off in psychology and
I did I was always interested in
mathematics and engineering as well I
was sort of interested in how we model
human behavior mathematically and
because of that when I did my PhD I
started looking at issues to do with how
you understand human behavior and the
relationship of people to techno
technology
after doing my PhD has been a bit of
time an apple computer and now I moved
on to work in another industrial
research lab with Xerox and after that I
went to hewlett-packard and after that I
went to Microsoft so I've gone to now a
number of different big IT companies
always working in research I think it's
a try and work somewhere where you have
a lot of fun because he spent a lot of
your time in your working life and you
should enjoy what you do when I might
for my first book that was a proud
moment I think I'm always proud when I
see one of the PhD students that I've
helped to supervise or somebody that
I've helped mentor you know get a great
job or get great recognition so all of
those things and I guess whenever we
write a paper that we feel is pushing
the boundaries of the field there were
lots of things that I thought I wanted
to do but the problem was that in high
school for example I liked doing fine
art I liked maths I liked English I like
sciences and so I couldn't narrow any of
it down so I worried that I wouldn't be
able to find a job that or a career for
myself we're all of those things could
come into play and I think what's
interesting about computer science and I
wouldn't have thought this way back then
is there is there can be a huge creative
element in that
so don't rule it out because you just
think it's full of geeks there's so much
more going on I mean computers are
everywhere in every aspect of our lives
so you have a chance to actually make it
a difference to to people's lives and
don't rule it out because you think that
you know you're not good with numbers or
not good at programming or it's it's
yeah it's too geeky don't rule it out
for that because you'd be really
ignoring all of the other really
interesting stuff that goes on in
computer science</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
