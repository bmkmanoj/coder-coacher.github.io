design from sweden with new may
personalized nutrition on that note
hello my name is Liana and together with
me to here today is young ray Johanna
and Android and we're representing in
your institute of design from Sweden
today we're going to talk about
something that's very important to all
of us and that's food one of the biggest
challenges in today's society is helping
people understanding the connection
between lifestyle-related diseases and
what they eat or rather what they don't
eat because when such a significant
number of people can say that they think
is easier to figure out how to do their
taxes than figuring out how to eat
healthily we have a problem so one fact
is that those information printed on the
food packages is quite cryptic o
foremost of customs and people do not
stand it and what it means to their
bodies
so getting feedback for how food way it
affects us is quite logging and
especially in contrast to others back to
your life such as a if we touch
something hot we were instantly jump
back in pen and also quantified self is
a big trend today but all data provided
by tracking devices it's very hard for
us to understand and also left this user
feeling lost so the challenge becomes
that how should we bridge the gap
between daily meals and its long-term
effects to our bodies so how can we
address those issues during this project
we became very passionate about
translating nutrition into actions
because if with the informations about
Graham's milligrams calories we don't
really know does it mean to our body but
if we tell you that you're a little bit
low on potassium and that might be the
reason you're feeling tired and you can
easily fix it with bananas we are much
more motivated to take actions one of
the core goals that we had in this
project was to try to combine the
knowledge and the competence of the
pharmaceutical companies together with
nutrition specialist and place it in the
hands of the end user and in their very
own home in this way the end user can
have more control and character
consciousness about their own nutrition
one of our end users were pregnant women
we found during war our research that a
lot of women find themselves in an
overload of information both prior
during and after pregnancy in a lot of
dietary restrictions they were often
told what not to eat rather than what to
eat we also spoke to nutrition
specialist about how people develop
habits in the in them what they eat
and we found that people decide what to
eat based on their taste the preference
is food so we asked ourselves how can we
create a system where we maintain or
allow people to eat the things that they
like but at the same time keeping
nutritious and healthy with this in mind
we created new meme and I invite you to
watch our concept video food we all love
it and we won't need it but
understanding what to wait in order to
get the nutrients that you need can be
hard
and sometimes in life you might find
yourself in a situation where what you
eat makes the greatest difference what
if there could be someone who could help
you with this task
someone who could always be there to
keep an eye on you
someone who let you know what your body
needs
this is why we created Mimi your
companion in creating your very own
personalized nutrition nuit learns what
you like to eat and what you don't she
gives you tips on what to eat based on
your own preferences yummy I don't feel
across that's fine what about tortilla
with roasted vegetables sounds perfect
okay you start with cutting up to
Tomatoes half a cake over and
sometimes a very diet is not enough to
give you all the nutrients you need
don't worry new meats got you covered so
create new tree drops to supplement your
diet
you we can offer you support wherever
you are and you know I'll go away
Pretty's could if this Creek near the
new to drop sunny no problem Freda
through touching the new tree patch she
can let you know how well your body is
doing you me and you are 18 and together
you explore what food and nutrition
means to you
so what makes me unique new me takes
care of you from the very beginning
Johan and Frieda you must drink the
video went to a website and answered a
couple of simple questions and that help
them assess which kind of set that we
can provide will fit their lifestyle you
me will ship to their doorstep along
with instructions nutri is a flexible
system that adjusts to the user in your
hands case in consists from notary patch
which analyzes his blood values and new
tree up which he might go to to get
in-depth information freedom it's some
more support so besides mantra pageantry
up she is also using new tree maker
which 3d prints her know three jobs
neutral jobs provide some extra
supplements for people who need support
at the time in three days case it's
because of her pregnancy nutri part is a
layer of second skin which provides
users with overview how they are doing
we provide feedback a tactile feedback
which is based on the metaphor of human
skin if we are not eating healthfully it
might become rough or we can get a rush
so where the cui and AI come into this
if we look at the current systems and
applications on the market today they
require high levels of user
participation always nagging us asking
us to input data and it's quite
intrusive however with cyn AI we're now
presented with the opportunity for these
systems to learn and take advantage of
who we are and adapt their functions
accordingly with new me we became very
interested in making using cui na i to
make the system non-intrusive to serve
that chief goes into the background of
our daily lives and adapts according to
the users needs but how does this look
and how does it work well you remember
johan from the video he also uses new me
and she's noticed that he's a bit low in
potassium he's also complained that is a
bit tired and she's also aware of the
type of food that he's been eating so
she realizes that a simple solution to
this could be
some bananas but how does she
communicate this to your arm well she
does this in the form of goals and
recipes she informs your hand that if he
eats five bananas this week this will
increase his potassium and would
probably alleviate his fatigue she then
recommends the number of recipes she
knows that he loves pancakes knew these
and Mosley and recommends a number of
recipes which allows him to integrate in
a banana into his weekly eating habits
if he likes these suggestions she'll add
it to a shopping list but this is not
enough we also need to have feedback if
users are going to change the eating
habits they need to understand how it is
affecting their body noomi does this
through to touch points as your honor
mentioned the tactile patch will give
users an overview of how they're going
but if they want a more in-depth
analysis they simply go into the
application application anyone can get
an overview of this blood work and the
long-term trends in doing so noomi
creates a feedback loop which motivates
uses to make a better lifestyle
decisions and educates them in
understanding what nutrition means to
them thank you so much for listening
thank you man Lisa would you like to
start you don't have to a great project
beautiful presentation really rich space
to explore and you took on so much in
some ways I don't even know where to
begin because it you the scope of what
you created was so large and maybe the
problem kind of warrants that I don't
know I mean I was really taken by I
think from the even before the video
this idea that you could get instant
feedback about something about how food
would affect you and those icons and
actually build confidence into there was
something you know that I feel like
there's
so many moments to explore and again I
appreciate the sort of the breadth of
what you created but I also i think
there were moments that you know it's
smaller moments that could have been
kind of drilled into in more depth to
but overall I mean we all need something
like this the I guess that the
conversation if we're talking about that
seemed to jump around to different many
different forms so I'm also curious how
to reconcile that I mean in the end it
comes back to you know my body and the
how the food affects me but that yep so
that maybe that's one struggle of just
how to integrate the many components of
the experience but overall you know
incredible and I hope something like
this is possible in the near future site
two questions and you can choose to do
one or the other of both but the the one
is I'd like to know what your picture
process about the research you did so
that you can separate what's foreseeable
just through engineering as opposed to
some basics maquina magic happens here
solution so what in the foundations for
the chemistry that the printing and all
these other things so that's an
interesting thing that would help take
it from science fiction to do something
that's actually a plausible aspiration
and the second would be how to put this
can you imagine a scaling down because
the people could afford the superb
athlete who at least need more nutrition
they probably have an access and so
there's other parts of the world for
nutrition we actually is even more
drastically problems in kennett scale to
that do have never thought talked about
that part and talk about research
furnace so we did explore that aspect
and
we tried not to base it on magic but
rather things which are researched right
now 3d printing peels it's feasible now
creating them in the maker printer is
also feasible not in the size we present
but experiments like that are taking
place in Great Britain right now so all
the components we used will be feasible
in the future also the patch now the US
Army is developing a patch that does
exactly that and actually also
administers the vitamins supplementation
transdermally in regards to the second
question we were looking at like what
our target was who we wanted to kind of
I guess yeah did for the system to apply
to and in the context in which we
created we actually did about over five
weeks of ethnographic research and we'll
base the new meal so we were targeting
at the general population in terms of
scaling down I mean that is something
that I would have loved to explore
however with the resources and time it's
not possible to cover such a bread but
as it's for sure or something that could
be applied in some manner foam again
congratulations on a great presentation
um I found one of the things that I
thought was actually kind of brilliant
about your presentation is this
identification of the problem of
healthful eating healthfully but being a
feedback problem of there being a gap
between immediacy of action and sort of
long-term of the fact you know I think a
lot of products can be defined by the
feedback they give whether that's the
buzz of a button or an image that
flashes on the screen and that thinking
about food is a feedback problem with I
was a really great insight one thing
that I thought though is that the
project could have benefited from
becoming less rather than more right
that by scaling back recommendations and
by scaling back touch points you almost
clarify the fact of trying to give that
feedback where is that the feedback is
too ubiquitous it ends up becoming sort
of a wall of information that becomes
hard to act on so that was just one
question I had was a little bit echoing
on Lisa's point that kind of the
vastness of the system which I think was
really well considered insofar as you
thought about what kind of feedback loop
would create a virtuous cycle I thought
that you could actually make each
individual leg on that stool actually a
little bit smaller so that the product
would be a little bit clearly to more
clearly defined a little bit i think
when year after year I've done this a
few times it's always effortlessly good
how video how the video quality and the
storytelling has improved over the years
by the way so it's like if it's it's got
to be that we're all getting better at
it but like the video was actually like
almost commercial quality you had like
actual acting going on in there like
moments of drama and emotion and and
it's it's always worth pointing out how
difficult that stuff is and how you know
just the design of this device looks
quite advanced the the idea of the patch
with this roughness is a little twist on
the design idea that is giving you
feedback is it like a rash I mean
there's some some real moments of joy
and kind of nice kind of creative ideas
in there and I just want to commend you
on both the presentation the video and
the sort of executional high level
thinking so hold on thank you thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
