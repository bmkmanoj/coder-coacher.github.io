you
in everyone and welcome back so Justin
odor thank you very much for enjoying a
long day yesterday apparently it was the
hottest day in the UK since 1976 you
will have noticed said they are
conditioning partially failed I think
I'm still cooler than outside but yeah
thanks to all of you also put in stage
for the coat on contest a really proud
event because how have you attended and
there were messages send in my team
world why to kind of give the high
schools etc so you will hear more
tonight about who won and how poets oh
it went like in this data very much like
to introduce my colleague natasha mealey
training and when I Tasha heads our
integrated systems group and she will
tell us a little bit more hot holy
searching me oh great thank you very
much Scarlett I can't tell you how
delighted them to be here but you you
are the perfect audience from my
perspective I'm using a particular topic
here is called real-time bidding and
user surveillance to talk about the
bigger issue and about advertisements
and user surveillance we all sort them
know i will show you how you use
computer science techniques to
investigate that issue a bit more but
you will see my Maya really agenda is to
talk today about this really
interconnectedness between technology
practices business models and social
implications so the topic you had picked
it really is to make you aware that
while you are studying for your PhD you
have to think about yourself as future
leaders you will be the innovators
you'll be running companies you'll be
asked to participate in policy
discussions and after all you will have
families and kids and you'll be thinking
about what the social impacts of
technology is for yourself and for them
in this particular talk I always start
with the examples of how certain things
can creep into our lives how the
technology starts in introducing new
practices and then what new practices
kind of take root guess what happens
then then the businesses come in and say
okay this is very interesting obviously
this is creating value the value
obviously leads to
money and then money then leads to
further innovation so is this healthy
cycle of innovation practices and
technologies that come in and I will now
show you another connection to this how
the innovation often is driven by data
and you will hear a lot about Big Data a
lot about machine learning a lot about
all sorts of techniques would improve
our life in the future I just wanted to
make sure sure that you're aware that
data driven in veneration is everywhere
and you have to be very careful how that
innovation is being used so starting
from our practice I live in the United
States for a while and I remember on
Sundays you get newspaper and then you
open the newspaper and then what happens
on the floor spills this whole huge pile
of two points and and so this is the
practice you can entertain yourself cut
these coupons and then go shopping and
then you get some discount and yeah so
it was good at least this couponing in
fact is part of a very important
ecosystem in which the retailer's
promote their products and then drive a
user habits and they and drive the sales
what is interesting with these coupons
the coupons were actually part of what
we call convergence so when I have a
coupon I I go and buy something so the
ultimate goal is achieved I actually
bought the product so these coupons at
the time where seen and still in use I
use really as a it's a very very good
and effective way to make people buy
things yeah but let's just understand a
little bit what is involved so I'm a
consumer I cut the coupon I go to a
retailer and buy but then this coupon
needs to be cleared in a way somehow it
has to go back to the manufacturer of
the product so if i bought the soap i
have bought it in Tesco well it has to
go back to the manufacturer and these
are the intermediate stages where they
sort of and in the coupons that the the
proof of and the proof of purchase in
fact need to be processed and it's done
in retail and clean houses and then
manufacturing clearing houses just to
give you some idea how big that
businesses
and this is all data because i'm showing
you practice that was predominant within
past 10 years however now is being
replaced by new practices so if you just
look at the two thousand manufacturing
firms you will see that they produced a
mass amount of coupons over 300 billion
coupons that actually printed and only
about what one percent of that in fact
gets redeemed so you know you look at
the effectiveness ratio of creating
coupons and then making people buy buy
things the question then was so can you
improve this method and what is the
problem with this method why how do you
want to improve this method I mean if
you look at the amount of money that is
being exchanged the monument has been
printed in coupon it is really very
large as you can see at the top of the
pyramids of manufacturers prepare to
give away discounts just to drive them
and just to drive their business and
sales so we're talking lots of money
here at the matter the figure that you
see here is a 317 billion there's a
discount you can imagine what is the
actual return if you can actually sell
everything you decide to discount so
this is the practice and this is the
ecosystem and I just want to show you
now how this sort of practice have been
digitized if you wish so the same
practice but I sorta the same need if
you wish for retailers to reach and sort
of direct people to purchasing what is
happening the different medium and it is
in the medium that's called Internet is
the web the web became a new sort of
real estate it's a it's a new place so
you can post these advertisements and
then people may be able to act on them
the issue here is that when I go said to
New York Times I don't quite expect that
I would find coupons there but yes in
the new york times that i bought it is
like Larry Cooper's insert it in and in
the newspapers so we're there now but
there are these little advertisement
that you see
and if you look analyze a page a little
bit then you see that actually a number
of different parties involved and when
you're down on you the page of New York
Times and they they also to contribute
the content that's being put there so
there must be some sort of relationship
between New York Times and the providers
of the ads and so this presentation here
will be about understanding that
ecosystem the practice was the one that
we know and it previously it was done in
a different form has been now moved into
digital and versi now how this has
changed i will show you know a little
demonstration system that was built for
firefox and just show you how much of
this involvement of other parties in the
web page is but i would just want to
emphasize here that it's not just in the
internet browser this is happening
everywhere is happening in mobile and
also to dedicated applications so not
just browsers an application but any
other app that you use on your desktop
or on on a mobile so if i go to adjust
this search value of x and so this is a
new york times official site so when i'm
down only the new york times official
site the page is loaded and at that time
all the advertisements are being now
brought in and what you just saw coming
from the top of the screen are all the
cookies or a cookies that are now
installed on my computer each bar
corresponds to a different domain so
different third party so all these third
parties at the moment that interested in
me i am looking at the new york times
and they are in cooperation the new york
times bringing in the content to me some
of the content is visible and some is
not visible so if i click for example on
this bar here the green one is new york
times that one shows me 45 cookies from
New York Times they load it on my
computer
all others are third parties so for
example here is a double click double
click put only two cookies the only
problem is a double cook put the same
two cookies on other 160 sites that i
have visited it's not just double-click
than many others one that is quite
prominent is a rubicon project for
example but any of these I let me just
show you another one this is Microsoft
one msn msn put 15 cookies but also msn
has put same cookies on 45 other domains
the thing is that msn cookies sorry
other domains also to have the same
msn.com extension which means that in
this case the third party that involved
are the partners or msn to bring in the
content if i go back to double click it
slightly different so double click put
the same cookie on number of different
sites in Europe times and save a wired
independent and so on now the New York
Times and independent a very unlikely to
be in a cooperative mode and so so
basically what is saying that the
cookies then the domain involved they
reflect different relationship between
the first party and the third party now
i will show you we implement with
basically deploy this prototype and gave
it a bug 13-14 people because we were
interested to understand how this
network or people of third parties
interact and see what is the exposure of
individuals just like ourselves to these
third parties as we browse the web so i
have here a graph which is created using
a tool kit that microsoft search
actually and created and then released
is called node XL you can download not
excel if you want to play with your own
cookies it's very simple you basically
you can snip the HTTP traffic you can
look at the communication between and
when you land on the site you just look
at what which size were referred to and
then look at these pairs and then you
can put the person to North excel and
and then you will get a graph the graph
shows you the which side refers to which
other side when you're loading the page
so in this graph the green dots are the
websites that the person visited over a
period of seven days in fact I filter
out most of the sites you can be in not
Excel you can determine which ones are
more important notes by looking at in
links and earthlings okay so if I for
example click on one of these sites here
like a how when you do your searches you
often end up on eHow sorry just let me
just say my mouse is not working
properly so say if i go to force for
example as soon as the land on forbes
you get all these third parties involved
and the links from from the green dot is
referring to this voodoo these are the
third parties now among these third
parties i put two different colors there
are red ones and purple ones they say
have slightly different in links and
outland profiles so if i click on a
double quick double click has a lot of
in links coming from the websites who
will subscribe 2 i'll double-click but
also has out links to other red and
purple sites so that means that the debt
node in particular serves as a broker
between the websites and we you know
users we are trotting on the web we are
landing on these websites the green ones
and then the information then flows to
double click and then posed to others
the other type of note the proper one is
that it's slightly different these are
all in links coming from green sites the
purple one this particular one is called
google analytics because it provides
analytics / site so every site see these
sites actually subscribes to analytics
because they want to understand what's
happening on their websites so so
information then goes only one way now
in this this case the problem is that
both the double click and google
analytics they belong to the same entity
and they all this is the same company Go
Go so in a way what you
at the moment is tracking across and
tracking within websites this is not the
this basically just for one person and
it doesn't completely give us the full I
did the complete idea how strong this
network is so we have done couple of
other studies that I'll show you but I
want you to keep this picture in mind
this is you and me and everybody else
who is using the web and there are ways
you can kind of reduce these links and
kind of clear them up for for a while
but then I'll show you to a couple of
studies how quickly you get back into
the network so back to the presentation
just want to show you how the ecosystem
looks like so this is this is what's
happening at the moment when you are
looking at the web page that's
essentially a place now the people are
bidding for they want to bid for spaces
there to put the advertisements and so
then you have this a typical demand and
supply I'm a supply i have a website
website and i'm prepared to give people
space at the put put the advertising
song and then then the days of course
there's demand suppose you are IBM or
you are and I don't know Toyota or
somebody and you have this new product
and you want to advertise of course you
can advertise on your own site but why
would you which you can also advertise
everywhere else on the web so that's why
that is brokers brokers essentials say
well we will be centralized this you
don't have to have advertised only on
your site we will coordinate that and
then you can advertise everywhere but
then to be effective in this then they
start promoting real-time tracking of
individuals because they want to make
sure that that verte Iseman is relevant
and of course the people who are putting
advertisements they want to understand
the context some in some context may be
completely inappropriate so for your ad
so there's a sort of there's a good
reason why this brokers in fact want to
do a good job the thing is we are the
casualty so we we basically get tracked
every second and i'll show you now
this is a this is a graphic goes from my
colleagues at UCL they basically and
schwann and he's advisee jung yong wang
de they wanted to understand how quickly
this sort of cycle happens and
everything has to happen within 100
milliseconds so one you are loading the
page information about you is being sent
the bidding happens and the page is
loaded with all the ads and I say this
is absolutely fantastic I mean this is
the technological marvel 21st century if
you can do this and you can go beyond
the moon it's really if you think how
many millions of people are using the
infrastructure and how many people are
bidding is just fantastic that it can be
achieved yeah and it def clever machine
learning models in there so so it's not
just to go it is really quite
sophisticated system so let me now show
you a couple of studies that we have
done to understand a little bit more the
ecosystem and the would it what it means
for us when we use certain services
online so we all use search so we did a
little bit of an analyzing exposure to
cookies through search again the
objective is just to understand the
ecosystem so here two pages one is being
one google you have a search query and
you get told your 10 top 10 results so
suppose you're just going down and
checking the results so this is exactly
what you've done we tracked if you're
going down these results who is now
watching who is not being involved in
your experience although you don't know
it yeah so we've done an experiment with
hundreds of queries and those are
borrowed from another computer science
competition organized by kdd sometimes
ago we're all very concerned about how
to guess people's intent or how do you
classify queries so are the travel
queries are they you know information
gathering queries of what are they so we
had a researchers actually label these
queries and then we use categorization
of these queries to category smokers but
for this purpose we re reuse experience
just to understand whether if you're
searching when you are shopping or
you're looking for news whether you have
the same exposure to cookies okay so
that was one of the ideas in the design
so we ran the experimentation b66 660
queries and they are sort of dividing
these categories and decided to fire
these queries against to search engines
being in Google and we've done it in
four different markets all
english-speaking markets and just to see
what any of these factors make a
difference and India nalysis just like
you saw with a node Excel this is also
another graph of not Excel the we
plotted what they call the connected
component the largest connected
component in the network just to see how
this website and the trackers are
connected and this is this is what they
get it's really it's a jumbo it's as
extra extremely tightly connected
network if it is it out a little bit you
know / forces with some kind of
clustering algorithms this is what you
get so yes there are some some sort of
sub clusters in this connected component
but their loss of cross-linking is you
can see in the grey these are the links
from one quadrant or another just
showing that while there is a stronger
affinity of some websites to subscribe
to some of the third parties there is
still very very strong interlinking
among all of them so here the actually
explained that the red ones are the
trackers the black ones are the the
websites and in the purple are also a
third parties involved in the process we
there is not much difference this is
this particular one is for google in
Indian market this is the google in US
market so you don't get much difference
in fact if you look at the structure of
the website of the kinetic amo
across all these markets here is what
you get the most important figures are
on the bottom we are wondering how many
nodes and how many links are in fact in
this connected component and you can see
when it comes to nodes very high up in
ninety to ninety three percent so some
of them there are some of the outlines
that are not in the connected component
but if you look at them the edges most
of the edges are there so that means
whoever is outside the connected
component doesn't really count they're
not not very well connected to that this
yeah yeah so so this is how it is you
imagine now the internet this is the web
this is what we experience when we mean
and look around things and on top of it
is this network and you saw the
connected component of them on top of it
is a network bidding on us so
essentially we are being looked at we
have information is in real contract and
then based on that the act and then
serves as the content if you want to I
mean the main argument is that this is
all for your benefit on my benefit
because we get the better advertising
okay so so now if we did mindset if you
want to make sure that you have very
good advertisements the question is how
can you make sure that all these
trackers are on your back quickly
because they will never give you better
advertisements and and here are some
graphs essentially we looked at how many
clicks do we need to make in order to be
tracked by the track the third parties
with certain a probability so here on
the bottom are the number of clicks and
here is the probability that for example
you'll be tracked by Google Analytics or
double click or this is this is
basically the graph that tells you if
you want to be trained by all 10 top 10
advertisers sorry third party
advertisers what the curve would look
like it basically it is about if you do
20 clicks within the context uub have a
UV track with ninety percent probability
by all 10 and the 31 32 clicks uin yeah
so
so in a way there's not much it doesn't
take much to be part of that Network
okay a slight on a different topic
related the same sort of phenomenon it
is about understanding what are the
other implications so so we now
understand there is a network of
information and on top of it there is a
network of advertisements and trackers
but then how do we act annoying or
knowing that this is happening I mean
it's a common practice it's very common
practice for us to share your l's you
send me an email is very likely that
there will be one of you RL in my email
and then what happens if that that
happens on in a medium like Twitter so
I'm happy a heavy of the 10,000
followers now I'm sharing a URL yeah so
now 10,000 followers are going to get
that URL and 10,000 followers will get
all these trackers on their backs in a
second yeah so so in a way because of
this structure that we have seen net
networks of information and then on top
is the network of trackers whatever you
do you will be exposing yourself or
other people doesn't matter with service
users and if you're interested just a
little study here we looked at the
tweets related to topics and you know
this and following individuals and just
to understand a little bit how this
social mediums expose people to tracking
we've looked at the only the those
tweeters that trees that they have URLs
in it so that we could look at observe
the who are the trackers and here is
what we normally find which are the
domains that are normally it reads a lot
in our sample these are YouTube
primarily what was interesting one the
interesting one was the tumblr because
the temporary almost like a collection
of pages where each individual can have
a little website the sites and what
happens is people would put content on
the on those sites so therefore
looks really bad because it has about
246 trackers just just by based on the
tweets that we looked at these are the
number of tractors that we found / URLs
that are being treated a lot about I'm
showing you now for a particular hashtag
for the politics how the social graph
looks like so in this case no so
slightly different nodes are individuals
so each node is an individual and the
size of the the node depends on how many
followers the person has but the color
depends on how active people are so how
often they retweet so the red ones are
really active people and then if I dis
out a little bit this is this component
here this is how it looks if you just
clustering so you can see there's some
people retweet more among each other and
these are the people just the links
among these people are only if they the
tweets retweeted or tweeted something
that has a URL in it so you can now see
that these people keep contaminating
each other so this circle here are
likely to retreat among themselves and
they were right likely to probably share
and you know the same trackers here
someone will be some more statistics
nothing new here it's just showing that
the same same companies are involved in
tracking and the likelihood that you
will be exposed is very very high okay
I'd like to skip now to a one other
aspect we did try to understand who are
these trackers and how are they what are
their functions because at the beginning
I showed you the third parties can be
essentially content providers that come
in together to assemble page for myself
so i would like to kind of tease out
among these third parties who I'm
dealing with what are the functions and
how can I recognize them yeah so this is
a different graph in which we just look
at the trackers and their relationships
among them is
the graph is obtained by looking at 20
sites you see the black dots here are
websites those 20 sites were found very
frequent in a search pages so you may
see a how is almost present ever
everywhere wherever you go type in
something they will tell you how to fix
your car how to fix the light bulb so II
how is it that the site that often
appears in search results and then
family function is to bring in the
trackers into your world they have lots
of advertisements and they have lots of
people looking at you at that time so
among the trackers again are at the ones
the red ones here are the ones that we
have seen those are the brokers ok so
the brokers are the one that the connect
the ecosystem the green ones here are
the website the site actually deliver
the content so ad servers but the blue
ones up for my perspective most
problematic ones so the blue ones are
the domains that we do experience we
actually go to because we know the
domain the red ones I don't I never
heard of TT before I start looking at
this because I never go to the website
of double click ok so it's out of my
experience and out of my desire to
connect with but others are there the
blue ones are there so if you go to
Facebook or equal to 2 linkedin or you
go to Twitter these companies in fact
provide a service yet the little signs
the tweet sign or the X and the links in
sign those are the trackers and you see
them now everywhere so in a way there
are this new sort of visible networks
coming in but we don't we were not told
that in fact those little lose icons
that appear on almost every page now in
fact are the means for tracking our
activities and you can also argue about
what this is all anonymous or why would
I care in most instances they may just
tag me the cookie basically is like a
badge they the tag me and they follow me
they may not know who I am they may
create an identity no ID or me in their
system and and and then uses somehow but
if you have companies who do know where
who we are
and it's very easy then for everything
that you do on the web becomes attached
to you so it's not anonymous anymore so
it just happened to be logged onto
Twitter or logged onto facebook when
you're doing search you should know that
your whole search this history now is in
their hands he said that sounds at some
point ever advice not to use Google as a
search engine because Google would track
what searches to a place in that
department so they could kind of see
what her political decisions for some of
our topics are ya dangerous yeah please
yeah you can get the google microsoft
see the decisions if you using will be
but my message yeah sure it's not again
I need also say that that Microsoft any
of the other expenses like I don't get
the burger if you're using the how can I
say to RTC all your google search
history so what I basically says when
you are when you have the cookie on your
computer and in this case say for
example is the the facebook or if you
just go to a page and and you might be
Facebook user but at that point you're
not logged in so they would not know
they we just know that from what how do
whichever way they identify your machine
that you have been there just like any
other anonymous cookie however if you
start now if you're logged in that they
would know that it was you it was you
example you just sent the moon how can
you go to a third party website and they
see all your seriously even if you're
logged in so what I mean by success is
your browsing history sorry so the
browsing history is attached to the
okay that is on the page so any page
that actually has that cookie on it and
it becomes part of your browsing history
so not the third party so what the
Scarlet was talking about it's very
different google also has other means it
has a toolbar which actually transmits
everything and has double click involved
in the advertising it is it everybody
almost so so so so essentially that
company can stitch up things across and
within plus all your improvement with
stretch through to total bore toolbar
that particular company has a fantastic
reach okay but you have similar think
combination of these different things
for other companies like yahoo and
others I understand the part of that
movie can stitch up everything and track
all your browsing and search and
everything all history but I'm talking
about a third party how how can I say
you what our inertia is sometimes when
you log into a fair party that has a key
component this third-party abc.com
anything web web site can have access to
your search or browsing history is that
this wasn't that's not a statement not
so yeah yeah maybe I can show you actual
now the mechanism how this work so so we
can then in your mind you can see what
sort of traffic happens yeah okay
so let me just show you I mean in the
next stage really i just wanted to
discuss with you well this started and
why i started and why we end up with
this way because you will be involved in
designing new technologies and whenever
the new technologies comes in you have
to think about the usage of it and what
happens is you have organizations
standard organizations that are looking
at this and i just want to show you in
particular about 20 years ago i saw the
first document from 1996 and actually in
the middle of the one from 2000 where
people were really thinking hard about
how the communication with the web will
happen what did the protocols and how
how we can enable the use of the web but
at the same time be aware of the user
issues so in particular with the
hypertext Transfer Protocol there was an
issue that you could not sustain the
stake you would not know users actions
in a sequential user actions because the
server that you're communicating with
had no means of knowing what you were
doing on your client side so in order to
enable what we call sessions so that we
can now do things like in e-commerce
having a shopping basket or something
like this we have to have a mechanism
that would communicate between the
client and the server what the user is
doing and that was that was the reason
why the cookies were put in place yeah
so the cookies essentially is
communication a small text files that
are be or text messages that are being
transferred between on a user agent on
the on the user side so user agent has a
representation like through a browser
and then on the side other side you have
a web server and the communication
between them in fact is the one passing
messages okay and so let me just show
you an example suppose you log in on
this site so users identifies so you can
type in your password and login and then
the server
basically puts the message puts a
transfer as a message cookie puts on her
on my machine now I'm John Smith so John
Smith received a little cookie saying
how he is Johnson its registered so now
I John Smith I'm now browsing the site
and I did some action okay and so now
the server knows what action it is so
I'm looking for a rocket launcher one so
I rocket launcher one on this website
ecommerce website okay and then the
server puts a cookie on my computer a
message that is actually record that
information and I said my next step is I
continue using the site Sam I want a
shipment of the the launcher to my home
and then a therapist back information
about okay i use fedex so so what
happens is now in my cash web cache i do
have all these cookies to assault it as
thought which shows what i have been
doing and with the website the the issue
then is if you provide the sort of
mechanisms and what control should you
be giving to people to users and how
should this potential risk to previously
be mediated so this is a document if
you're interested you can go online you
can find it for two thousand there was
an earlier one from 1996 and this is
being revised you can find a lot more
later one from 2011 okay i just wanted
to see the people really and you have to
put yourself in their shoes because you
you will be the one doing similar things
in the future it may not be about HTTP
protocol but it may be something about I
don't know agents that now are appearing
in the Siri and Microsoft Cortana okay
so there is plenty to think about how
what are the what should be the
standards to enable the communication
between these services in this
particular case people were aware that
the digits possibility for intrusion to
people's privacy and what sort of things
should be allowed but in this particular
case where they left on the define is
what should be the interface through
which it should be exposed so they
really argue hard for certain things for
example they wanted to and enable the
ain't agents of the browser to disable
cookies or to determine the weather
session is in progress or not in
progress anymore because you can have
cookies at the procession and so on but
most of the cookies are set to expire in
2025 so so either way yes there are
provisions there so they can unlimited
the duration but is nobody's checking
then guess what so so this is basically
what's happening there have been number
of provisions to think about but the
interface has not been specified and
lots of this has gone under not
completely unnoticed by end users so
that people did not react and couldn't
even voice their opinion and i'll just
show you now the interfaces that are
available so this is typical when you
find in a browser at least when i was
checking last so I'm picking the tool
say Internet Explorer Firefox but chrome
is the same so the interfaces are really
obscure for end users they may not have
much meaning and I'm that's kind of one
credit a Firefox just look at the the IE
say ie has this scale and you have a
scale for the privacy now you can ask
yourself what does that mean to you can
you what is the privacy and how do you
scale it all Kelly tap a scale it down
and the insurer is a little bit of
confusing interfaces because sometimes
you think okay I am going to bump up my
my privacy scale all the way to the top
and this is what happened to me I did
that and then I click on the advanced
features just to find out what what else
I can do and then I realized that
whatever I have done but if I didn't
didn't didn't check any of the options
that I thought would be checked it so so
for me it was really confusing I didn't
know what I've done I didn't know who is
controlling what so of course this
interface may have been done for people
are setting up machines
administrators so the end users don't
have to touch anything but at the moment
definitely under specifying the
interface the way people should be
informed is not it's not a way to go
because the implications of your
decisions that the lower level are
moving up the stack and so do your
experience with the of the decision the
technologist may may not be completely
it sort of unawareness so basically what
has happened I should also say what I
showed you today is the connection
between a particular need that exists in
in the real world so retails that
retailers are always going to find some
way to reach the customers so that's
definitely there the there are other
reasons why people may want to look at
the people's histories and the cookies
are really tip of the iceberg isn't
really nothing I can just tell you it is
one of the most explicit and you can you
can track you can identify there are
other ways that somebody can track me
just looking at the configuration of
what is in my cash so instead of having
a particular cookie to identify me
whatever I do with the fingerprinting of
my computer or my cash or whatever is
very very strong where I've it identify
me but one important thing here is that
it was one important thing here is that
with cookie tracking if you're studying
say security and privacy you almost have
something what's called a coordinated
privacy attack so in order for this to
function you've got two websites and you
have third parties and you have
fantastic infrastructure to do the
bidding and deliver your content and so
on what is more disturbing it our
possibilities for independent privacy
attacks where anybody can spy when
anybody else and recently we have done
some work and I've seen some posters so
some of you are looking at cache timing
attacks for example in the browser where
there is a particular specifications of
how you can interact with the cash
browser
and just like a cookie was managed
similarly the access to the cash was
managed but again what happens in
practice you cannot control it is in the
nature of the beast whatever technology
you develop and you will see that when
you develop your own prototypes you
development for a particular purpose and
you give them to people and you watch
what they do and then you get humbled
immediately because the creative power
individuals is fantastic you know are we
humans are just fantastic we're going to
repurpose anything for anything else so
so you can never anticipate which way it
is are going to go and in many instances
you will be delighted because it's the
discovery of some new opportunity and in
other instances you will be agonizing
how could they have done that okay so
unfortunately I know in in in kind of
this presentation I just want to show
you a lot of us here work on lower
levels we love work on the architectures
with work on protocols we work on
algorithms we do some fantastic stuff to
innovate but if you don't go all the way
up or a team up with other people who
are looking at the higher levels so up
the stack and in this case is the user
interface and it's a user experience and
user interaction then it is really
really hard to anticipate the impact of
your technology technology itself it may
not is benign it is the use of it so a
peg I can leave any message for you it
is really to team up among yourselves so
if you're working on the same networking
make sure you talk to somebody in HCI
make sure also to talk somebody in the
middle way because I only asked all
together we'll be able to conceive what
what's that what's happening and there's
nobody else who can address the issues
in this particular case of cookies
nobody else but ask computer scientists
because others don't know and I bet you
among you there will there will be
people who have not known about this and
so even we who are in the profession do
not know and so there's obviously not
nobody to speak up for in this case for
the for the users and for the citizens
because at the moment
the we are heading towards the
technocratic society where people who
have fingers on their keyboards will be
determining what sort of new practices
and technologies come in okay thank you
by the way we don't have a mind to what
extent do you think that the few the
shape that directs and the internet is
outgoing is shaped by by like these ad
tracking companies because they seem to
be like the a lot of the activity or
like a lot of recent advances or I say
advances but like a lot of the recent
development is basically been towards
sucking up more of your data and serving
it to like these big companies that we
have you've never heard about for
instance and you see that's the way the
intent is now going like we're just
going to give up more and more like our
first in our personal data in exchange
for like shiny objects essentially well
I'm actually very optimistic I think the
same principle that the goddess of this
position will get us out of that
position because in the end it is all
about demand and people have were not
aware of this people don't know about
this people could not voice and because
they could not void the satisfaction
that was absolutely nobody else will
come into the market and serve that
other demand yeah so if people say no we
are where I want and I want a different
solution then there will be somebody to
step in and bring it in and but at the
moment because it wasn't it's not even
voiced you don't have the fundamental
part for the next move in the market the
fundamental my part is the demand and
the privacy has to be seen as a value
once they're seen as a value then
somebody will pay for it at the moment
we are being told that we don't value
privacy that's the main argument and the
sad part is they will actually call on
you and say you don't care about privacy
and I have some teenagers at home and I
can tell you they do care about privacy
it is slightly different so if my
daughter is on facebook she doesn't care
the facebook knows that she's done
something but she does care whether her
mom knows okay so she doesn't want mom
on facebook so in a way so what I'm
saying is the the previously control and
demand for is there okay nobody can tell
me doesn't exist the lesion end is that
it has not been understood fully where
we are now so the first stage is to
inform people then they will start the
voice in the opinion somewhat some of
these voices are going to go towards a
policy yeah we already seen this and
some are going to go towards business
and I feel so I'm completely optimistic
things change very quickly once there is
demand things move in here free guys
this because I might be then yeah okay
so things might not go back to normal
and more but if you using a blog where
you're going to tour how do these crab
stop by uh so like are you still being
ended up you know tribe so even if you
using ad block essentially it takes one
painted third party to expose you to
everybody else right so are you really
safe if you're opting out of cookies and
you know filtering ads or in the end
there's no way to opt out even if you're
using tor you know maybe you get
fingered bit at some point and then so
what's your so at the moment you're
right basically you are walking down the
street and you're trying to protect try
to shield yourself you know you're
trying to hide from some people down the
street but when you're done walking down
the street you're walking down the
streets okay so everyone guess that's
clear and I keep telling my kids look
you're walking down the streets of the
internet and you're half naked watch it
so you have to be that you have to be
because it is no protection at the
moment so some people who are clever
that can cover themselves they've put
invisibility cloak for a while but you
have still on the streets and there will
be another one another way or lurking at
you question only is whether there is
some other way is to provide the value
to you so whatever you're doing on the
streets they may be done at home it may
be there is a different different
paradigm in which you can have your knee
satisfied so yes what at this moment
because we are all walking down the
streets and we don't have any private
corners well we are learning all these
tricks and
there will be different ways people are
helping us do the private browsing or ad
blockers and so on that's fine they will
have certain effectiveness but if you
voice our opinion that we want something
else then people are going to start
building the private homes that they
start building the private corners where
you can go and you will not have to
worry about this but without us asking
is not going to happen in private
browsing for example has been designed
for particular purposes primarily to
clear your machine so nobody know if
somebody comes to a machine and wants to
see what you've done they won't know but
the service will have still no okay
another thing is if you're in a private
browsing session you can still be
tracked because it is session-based and
then session is gone it yeah so so
anyways whatever has been done has been
done to cover certain scenarios and
certain demands every question regarding
the network Ross um did you have a
specific reason to take in degree now
degree centrality is your measure enough
for example between us and Rosie if you
talk about brokers or I Perfector when
it comes to that they catch the big fish
yeah in fact the the notes we're using
the betweenness centrality I didn't
mention this thank you for asking so
yeah so the essential thing is how do
you create the links and the links were
referral so who refers home and if you
do want to study this you can probably
study other aspects of an a and network
we we have done some studies of
understanding the efficiency of this
network it is a small world network
basically it's very shallow so the
information propagates very quickly so
there are the properties of the draft
that you can look at it's not very
complicated graphically we could see it
because you have very dominant nodes we
have seen that if you remove some of the
dominant notes I like double click or
rubicon project or then that it becomes
less effective so yes it's true that
this mobile networks that they had among
the trackers could be sort of this
stop it a little bit if you stop some of
these major notes I can tell me more
about the beating what kind of
information shared during the beating so
I don't have that precise information
actually my colleagues at UCL and they
have done much more work on this I am
actually my my guess is that there is
not again just few economics it's not if
I'm a broker is not in my interest to
share too much after all this is my
unique position I so uh so maybe that
your information does not go very far
and a the essence of this is not to know
where you live it's not know necessarily
your name or anything it's it's about
knowing that you have just looked at the
pc world and then you went to easyjet
and then after that you're going to go
to Amazon because that's what they want
they want to know your trade do your
path so that they can bring in the ads
from the previous sites guessing your
intent and the price of it display will
very much depend on how often you
visited at easyjet site or how where are
you how where are you in the stage when
you're going to Amazon so is it the
first visit third visitor fifth visit
and so based on so maybe isn't this
logic they're trying to model what's
likelihood that you're going to buy now
because ultimately that's the
convergence the converters that happened
with coupons needs to be sort of mimic
mimic in this well also say that if this
demand high enough then other ideas will
come up to Jamaica's in that way so one
option will probably be that you have to
spend some money to keep your self
private it's okay i'm opting out of all
this cooking thing for five dollars a
day and then I'm not being tracked yeah
I mean if I'm honest here yeah what's
the price later that you put to them so
there are people who are trying to
identify what will be the cost of
privacy so actually we had very good
colleague is Orin pry Bush was here on
our team now he is not with Google I
think
so so he was in fact measuring what sort
of things you with what discount would
you take to buying chocolates and
offering in return telephone number or
so you can you can go at that level you
can start sort of hypothesizing and
measuring and then based on that you can
design your particular service yeah yeah
so definitely but if you ask yourself
you're already paying for the internet
access so you in a way if you want to
understand where in the value chain you
will intervene and get more money from
people well you might do it with a very
beginning when you're doing we're
deciding who your interpreter is going
to be so it may be there there can i
collect the money and then after that
you clean you said I don't want any I
just want to work with those providers
who are going to block everything or you
can do it at the application level so
there is the whole chain that will
change</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
