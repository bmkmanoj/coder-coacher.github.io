you
so next let me invite professor ye to
come to stage professor who is a
professor and director assist of the
state key lab of an information
engineering in surveying mapping and
remote sensing at the Ohio University
and he's going to give a talk on geo
spatial service web sharing geospatial
information rather than data so
professor thank you
hi Santa dr. the title of this session
is about smart sensors and City OS so
from my understanding City OS is a kind
of yeah operation system for smart
cities and this mass city is a very hot
topic right now in China so in a
traditional operating system manager did
and the Sharon did is a very important
part but in the smart city did is not
the only information that we should
manage and should i be shared so my talk
topic is we should share more than did
I will come from I will start on to user
cases and then proposed the concept of
of geospatial services web and then I
will demonstrate a prototype of just
because of his web and give brief
conclusions so my lab is surveying
mapping and in most sensing so all the
information archos official i'm not
quite or have a very clear concept of
smart city but from our understanding
smart city should have have huge
information about a city including 3d
batch models underground structures and
in tow trucks just visual informations
so franchise special two men we think we
need picketed for efficient
decision-making environment for smart
city so sir it can be citywide or
neighborhood or individual or national
global context and in at all temporal
skills from annually monthly daily and
real-time so sir smartest city is a kind
of next step of teachers city we think
smart city has three characters the
first is smart city should manage and
real-time data streaming from all kind
of smart sensors so second applications
face their own widely shared and
information resources so we have so many
so bigoted every
presence units or governmental actors
say use a sheer sedated for a smarter
for smarter decision society is a
feedback loop from response to monetary
and the data acquisition should be
formed for this kind of evolution so
this is attacked architecture we think
about smart city and there are four
colonel technologies from salap
perception through sensors to ub
critters connection and performance high
performance computing or a cloud
computing for decision-making and also
for after computing says intelligent
services so in this user case we need to
share a lot of computing resources but
fragile spatial two men we think we need
to share online and interoperable
interoperability of the information
resources including three levels so
first is dead France dynamic 88 applause
dedicated to dynamic data stream a
quieter from Leo time sensor web the
second is information for wellness of
all normal or abnormal situations in a
city and as a third level is knowledge
for integrated decision making so
currently sir Clark building is a very
very suitable or promising computing
infrastructure for geospatial
two men in a small city operation or
research si si is a first user space I
introduced sasaeng the use case is
geospatial information science
traditionally geospatial information
Sam's research is based on local machine
we collected it by ourselves we use the
data play develop algorithms by
ourselves and we develop as a model but
at the sauce at this moment geospatial
data becomes big and a pig so we
encounter a lot of problems of
processing it and carry information and
create model so you just be sure you
find information science we encounter a
lot of challenges including data sources
data processing for example for data
processing can we use commercial
software or with open source we use
existing algorithm or own developer air
Carson how to compare with other as
existing algorithms and where we can
find some other people's implementation
and we also need an Alec model and for
this model we need a lot of expert
knowledge but when we are graduate
students or we are doing research
sometimes to create to create such
criminal model is not so easy so
challenges become especially very
critical in geospatial to men this
challenge comes from features of heat
hero Genuity in geospatial to man for
example we
various data formats different
coordinate systems different kind of
date models and a lot of foolish simatic
a semantic asst so interoperability
becomes very very important enjoy
information science doing research or
for teaching so these three questions
arises from our daily research the first
is is it possible to share data directly
and online instead of downloading
transformation or manually transfer the
second is it possible to share
processing algorithms directly and
online to get processing results and as
a result is usually kind of information
and SSL is is it possible to integrated
distributed processing algorithm
delicately and online to form a
Geoscience model tomorrow is a kind of
knowledge and shares is model analysis
of this model so in just visual science
actually we have get a lot of efforts
for example ogc has published as a web
service framework for service gem to
create a model to exactly model model
and in just visual tomorrow we have also
a lot of standards of specifications for
sharing just vegetate and this has
become even applications for example map
award or USGS one-stop data service
system they have published a set it
through data service specifications and
like these companies or organizations
say also also provide the services of
geoprocessing air columns but
the problem is here for the first
question in just measured room and it is
now easy to share data directly and
online but to share processing
algorithms Jericho and online almost
major but still not widely applied for
the third question to directly an online
share geoscience model is still not a
major yet and melee own research stage
so so what we do is try to in the third
question can we have our environment or
official tool to share directly and
online models for all researchers or
students so say cam today on the same
line to share their knowledge so we
propose a concept called Josephus web to
umbrella such kind of activities or
architecture so we propose disease
concept in some of our papers
and what is the geospatial surface web
it is kind of web to connect all kind of
resources including debt processing
algorithms and knowledge as well as
those people who use these data
information and knowledge yeah and first
of all Joe special service whether
extenders a data from static data to
dynamic real-time data it's tend to the
service from Elle column itself to a
fish line station form so that everyone
can easily services here is the
architecture of the web we propose so in
the registry center we should at least
have a mechanism to register sensor
resources data resources processing
resources information resources and
knowledge resources so users can sluices
architectures is a system to use to
share his resources and to use services
so please log this idea we develop a
prototype called chi-square to amber to
demonstrate Joseph is whether to share
beyond and moods and data including
alkyl isms geoprocessing models and
sensor data
yeah here's a few more minutes he is
interface to use to share acetate to use
the share the data his interface visual
interface to create a model and you can
correct me exactly the model of our
platform and the dirac my visualizer
result sluice a platform of square and
we have deployed a system or windows as
you and windows as you give us
sufficient support to make asus idiom
run smoothly we also have a video but
for time limited you can access our
website for more information about our
prototype brief conclusion many
applications need a share of joy
information but not own ated also take
also algorithms and models and cloud
computing can support cisco novel system
okay here's that and long</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
