you
so good evening thank you for coming and
I to the torque of this afternoon so
it's an honor for me to introduce a
Francesca answer to is a wonderful name
first name francese with me and it's
professor the University of Padua which
is one of the oldest university in the
world it's the one in which you got a
layer by layer was professor so in a way
you are connected directly to Khalil
Galilei you can say magnet is an expert
a group of abstract interpretation and
this work was is mainly in a domain
tyrannous interpretation refining
abstract domains and the notion of
completeness which he used together with
Roberto and a paper by by the coos own
tempo interpretation to prove that state
based model checking is inherently
incomplete and today is going to talk us
how to simplify abstractions Thank you
Thank You Francisco so I will give a
talk on what we call correctness kernel
of abstraction of apps interpretation
and this is a joint work some of some
years ago together with Robert and there
will be some links with the presentation
give barber two days ago so first what
is an abstraction of fine so we already
have seen in the Turk by Roberto some
example of our fine mint so it's a user
in static analysis in verification and
for example the sigur para diagnose or
the counter example guided obstruction
refinement is an example an instance of
an obstruction refinements what is what
are the basic principles of doing
abstraction of finest so we need to
identify when and how to define some
abstraction for example an absurd Amina
and then what is the goal of refining is
to remove some false alarm or some
spirit races in in modern abha model
checking on the other end what is the
abstraction simplification is
the other way around so it's less known
there are less example one example if i
remember well we have seen in the
representation by roberto the principles
here is that we need to identify when
how to simplify an abstraction and the
goal instead that at least in my view is
to keep the same approximate behavior of
the mo of the abstract model so let's
look at an example in up some of the
checking so we have a finite state model
so we have States we have transition
between state and this gives rise to a
concrete model k this gravel at for
example what is an abstraction here it's
a state abstraction so some states are
blurred in an abstract data and so we
actually handle a partition of the state
space and what is the after model so we
need to define what is a transition
between after States and so we have the
existential transition between set up
state between blocks of the partition so
this is the after so what is the problem
of having an abstract model the problem
is that we have a spurious butter so for
example the blue one is a NF that part
which is poolesville because there is no
real concrete path that can be
abstracted in that absurd part so so
what is simplification here
simplification consists at least one way
of simplifying this abstraction this
state partition is merging blocks so
joining blocks together so here we have
a simplified abner model so where the
the upper block has been joined with the
lower block two three and four five so
now we have a new block
here again we have the spurious obsessed
part as before the situation is depicted
here and here the observation is that on
the simplified model we have a knotts
pooda spot so a real lobster pot let's
say and I I could i call these not
spruce up after Pat example let's say
because a counterexample actually can be
also called up counter example can be
viewed as a spurious upset pad and and
on the source model so sub tram model
let's say a a we have two corresponding
absurd paths that are not spruce so this
is the first one and this is the second
one okay the observation here is that
the simplification of a a prime preserve
the same examples so what does it mean
that if I have a spurious part in the
simplified model in apron then we are
able to find a corresponding part in the
source of the model a such that the
abstraction of that of that absurd
patent spurious and the abstraction of
data of the part in a is the spurious of
that patent in April we can read this
property also in the following way so
for any abstract pot pie prime in the
simplified after model if we have this
property so any abstraction of a part in
a any party in a with that that that is
abstracted in in PI prime is not
spurious then y prime is not pleased so
that's the property that
can be read as the fact that a prime the
simplification apply maintains the same
example of a alpha simply is the the way
of so for example here here this path
and this path are both attracted to the
same part because because when we map
this block in the corresponding block
because this is a simplification so this
block can be simplified so can be
abstracted to a corresponding block in a
primer then we have a corresponding path
and the path is the same either so the
abstraction of diese is this one yeah
okay so a further example of
simplification we join these two blocks
so and so six and seven becomes the
unique blocker here again we have the
preservation of examples so let's look
at an example where we do not preserve
example if we try to merge these two
blocks so in a single block so then we
lose this property why because here we
introduce this buffer so we have a self
loop into this this block and this is
police of course and we do not have a
corresponding spurious part in the
source absurd model a and so this is an
example of the simplification which is
not good it's a simplification that does
not keep the same example of the source
absurd model okay so here we have the
spurious absurd pad this block that
stays there forever while here we do not
have a corresponding absurd part because
when we we move from one from this block
to this one we cannot stay there or
going back to one so the goal here is to
give a good definition of this let's say
informal notion so try to distill the
model the formal model for easily
angered this kind of simplification
these are the good simplification in a
in this approach let's look at an
example in more general apps
interpretation so let us consider an
integer variable it has considered as a
function as operation at the plus one
operation so we we perform a x + 1 x
plus plus
let us consider a camp a couple of
trivial let's say toy toy up abstraction
so sign for example sign like
abstractions so here we have the
property of being negative or zero
positive or zero or zero and then a
simplification of these abstraction just
the property of being positive or zero
so of course this is a simplification of
this is this a good simplification
abstraction simplification of this one
with respect this property let's see so
the observation is the following that if
we consider how to how the increment
operation the increment by 1 operation
is modeled in the abstraction a 1 the
the behavior is the following so when we
have 0 then the only the only thing that
we can say is that the the output is
abstract by positive or 0 negative of 0
is abstracted to the top because we have
the possibility of jumping from 0 to 1
while the minus 1 is minus 2 goes to
minus 1 and minus 1 goes to 0 and so
they only say the only thing that we can
say is top a positive of course is
positive y tapas top on the other hand
for a 2 of course we have a positive or
0 is positive or 0 top top but
observation here the observation here is
that this too absurd function actually
encode the same function what does it
mean it means that when we project this
to amsa function in the concrete domain
so we see these two absurd function as
concrete function and we interpret this
absurd function as concrete faction then
then they boil down to the same function
for example for example if we take the
the zero element view view add as a
concrete element then we abstract this
element in a 2 as as positive or zero
plus plus is positive or zero and then
we go to the concrete so we concretize
this element then we get the positive or
zero element and that's
and okay what is observation here the
salvation is that this behavior in a one
can be safely omitted because the same
behavior can be retrieved from the
behavior in a 2 which is simulated by
the absurd function on positive or zero
so in a sense in a sense these two
elements 0 and the nigga negative of 0
are not relevant for the approximation
of the increment operation in a 1 it's
okay sorry I'm not relevant yes look
look for example why since because you
this because the less than or equal to 0
do yeah I could yeah yeah Robert lessons
like look a further example if you take
this this set of negative of zero
elements then in a one in a young you
abstract this set of course in negative
or zero then you do the plus plus you
get X less than or equal to 1 and so the
only the only thing that you can say is
top on the other end the same behavior
isn't you need to and so in a two you
jump directly to top top of stays in top
and so the result is the same okay so so
here again the objective the goal is to
give a model in order to identify the
fact that a 2 is a good simplification
of a 1 with respect to the increment
operation so this problem so this goal
is achieved through a formalization in
absent reputation so in general Abner
pretation the ingredient and our
ingredients are always the same so
approximation is formalized through
partial orders we have a concrete domain
where the partial order means relative
approximation we have an abstraction
which is formalized true Galba
connection for example we have an alpha
we have a gamma concrete objeto so the
consequence of the gala connection
approach is that concrete object have
best correct for summation and and here
is the the point any concrete faction as
a best court approximation in some after
the main because the absolute main is
formalized through a gala connection and
then the best cod approximation is
denoted this is important for the rest
of the talk through this notation so f a
means the best way approximating the
behavior f in the attraction
so so now we assume to have an
abstraction a an abstraction be the
corresponding of a connection we have a
concrete cementing function f on the
concrete domain and then we define this
relation we say that the abstraction in
a and abstraction in B are in some sense
equivalent when when the following
equality holds what is this equality so
here we have the abstract the best color
the abstraction of F here here we have
the best core abstraction of F&amp;amp;B and
here we project this to function in
alien be in the concrete so here we put
the Alpha here the gamma in a here the
gamma the Halfin be here the gonna be so
these are these two guys are two
concrete function and we require the
Equality Beast between these two
concrete functions and we say that a and
B are the same for approximating the
function f when this equality holds okay
so this is the central concept of this
approach so look the question now is the
following we define the correctness
colonel of the abstraction a for the
function f as the most absurd domain
let's call it be such that this
equivalence holds so the so the point is
that here we we define be as the most
absurd omein and so the idea is that we
throw away as much as information is
possible from a preserving the same the
same behavior the same approximate
behavior
for the function f and of course B is an
abstraction of a of course and the point
is trying to answer the question first
if this domain exists and second how to
compute how to characterize this system
can you hear me you'll be primed
comparable given our case of
obstructions yes yes yes yes honey and
the infinite menu you pick up the most
abstract when they know anymore so it
exists it's one cannot be too different
we did exist the moment exit sauce okay
basically it was a question because of
here actually why not when I write most
of the domain actually more technically
means that we have a lab at least upper
bound in the lattice of all distractions
and this is the case of the concrete
domain is a complete lettuce yes
which is show your your example with
also undertaking because it's
yesterday's post the city-owned or maybe
it's enough to consider a house incipio
if the concrete domain is superior
okay so technically the question is
solving this problem and the solution is
not discussing details here but just I
give the result so the result is that
when the function f more precisely the
function f when we consider it we're
first abstractor hits in put in a is
continuous continuous means Scott
continues so it preserves least upper
bounds of chains then this correctness
colonel actually exists and we are also
able to give a characterization that
characterization is quite interesting
because so what are the elements of a
which are really necessary for
approximating the be a BF the the
function f so so this result says that
we need to consider all the point of a
which are images of the best cod
approximation of a plus plus for any of
them so for any Y which is in the image
of FA we need to consider here is
written max but viewed for monday as
least upper bound for the most upset so
we need to consider the most abstract
element in a the the day abstract the
most absurd X in a such data such that
the best core approximation on X
provides why provides wine so we
consider the image and then for any
element of the image the greatest so the
most abstract of the element whose
output is that image and so any other
element in a which is not in these so
technically is the max instead of the
least upper bound which is not here can
be throw away
technically the proof of this result is
not easy and relies on the completeness
of ops interpretation and you can see
this factor in the policies that this
function is continuously which is the
policies that also Roberto mention at
the two days ago if i remember well
because technically technically this
relies on some a complete shell so the
night maximum he has image of our
function epic because the visitor is
also firmly since you say okay as they
care fighting everything I can go on F
and then I think it might brings me to F
yeah I mean who do is nothing yes again
like one why you need to continue to
Victor and I'm getting cozy that f of
the maximum spoon and written my list
okay he's why again if and only if F is
continuous because this is cokely's got
the polity is the notion continue so see
that object matzo blah hmm when you
apply after that you can that you can I
use it ok so mean so can all if you're
thinking I see observe that the proof is
not triggered because you need to prove
first that this domain is the main is
good in the sense that the approximation
of the function f over this domain is
the same and second and that's the
hardest part you need to prove that this
is the most abstract and manga this
class of domains and since the proof of
course is a kind of universal proof for
all domains this is the the list of this
domain we need some tools in order to
prove this and the to the quite
surprising let's say that we were able
to find this the tool is that this
problem can be reduced can be reduce it
to problem completeness in obscure
protection that's it
so let's look that this result actually
works so let's go back to the example so
here we have a and we want to prove that
these two elements app that elements are
not useful for approximating the
increment operation so so what is the
image the image is just the collection
of the guys here so the top and the
positive or zero then for any guy here
so for top we need to consider the
greatest of the element in a such that
the image of the abstract increment is
the top what is the greatest there are
two of them please do this one and this
one and the greatest is here and so this
can be throw away for the positive of
zero then we have to because 0 plus plus
is positive or 0 and the same is for
positive on 0 0 is below this one it so
can we throw away we just keep the
greatest more in general at the max
actually is not guaranteed that there is
one so the least upper bound but if
there are more than one we take the max
the maximal ones and so in this case the
Cardinal the correctness colonel
actually is a 2 is a 2 and so the model
actually seems to work after model
checking so let us apply this result in
up some of the check so we have the
concrete model we have so how to cast
upstream model checking as absent
application so the usual trick is to
view the state partition as an
abstraction how to view this as an
abstraction so is an abstraction of set
of states so when we have a set of
states we cover this set of states
through the blocks of that partition and
this is an abstraction it's quite easy
what is here the opp
that the operation of course is the set
of transitioning in the model so what is
the best current approximation of this
operation in for this abstraction is is
of course so the absa transition and
abstraction is the transition which is
called the existential abstraction of
the transition so a block B goes to a
block see when there is some X in peace
and Y Z such that there is a transition
from X to Y more technically more
technically here the concrete faction
are the predecessor functional successor
function on sets of state partition is
an abstraction of set of states and so
here the question is what is the
correctness kernel of the partition P
view it as an abstraction of this
concrete domain for these two concrete
function predecessor and successor so
here again the example that we have seen
at the beginning so here we have these
two blocks that are merged in a unique
block here the blue one and the green
one six and seven are joined in a unique
block six and seven so is this the
correct and kernel of this yes yes
because the result here is that in the
correctness kernel and the cotton
scanner here actually does exist because
the predecessor and successor function
are continuous of course are additive
and so anything that from technical
point of view actually works smooth and
so here the characterization is that in
the correct nakedness of the partition P
for the predecessor and the successor
two blocks are merged together when
these holes and so this says that b1 and
b2 have exactly the same predecessor
abstract
sex and the same abstract successful and
so look this one in this one what is the
set of after predecessor one what is
here one here six seven six seven and so
that's the same the point here is that
the property of the correctness kernel
for an absent model for an after Kripke
structure actually satisfy the original
goal that I mentioned at the beginning
so correct nakedness do not add the
spurious pot so when we have a spurious
part in the correctness colonel then
actually there exists a spurious part in
the original domain such that such that
a correspondence to do spatzle such that
the abstraction of that correspondence
police party is disposed part in the
spliff occasion we call these particular
correctness we call example guide
abstraction simplification for the
reason that I mention it before because
here we simplify abstraction and instead
of being guided by counter example
actually we are guided let's say we are
guided by example so example mean not
produce absurd pot so why is this useful
so we found an application that seems
interesting so in siga in the sigil loop
a counterexample guide abstraction
refinement
the three basic steps to follow to
follow are the following so first the
model checker provides as an answer an
absurd but that is a counter example so
we have a trace of blocks of the
partition of the model then then the the
sigil loop determines if this absurd
part is Buddhist or not is a false alarm
or not if that absurd part is furious
then the methodology according to the
methodology we need to identify the
block which is the reason the cause of
the spurious ness of this absurd part
and then when we have identified that
block BK let's call it BK then we need
to refine that block so we need to split
that block in order to separate the
state that provo could spurious pneus of
that absurd part so the methodology
actually called the state's inside that
block became the call bad state that the
end states and there is a method for
splitting for separating bed and the
dead state so let's look an example so
here we have a spurious absurd part 1
this block 6 of course this producer
this is called the dead end state this
is BK so this block is the reason why
this part is pollution this is called
the dead end state because it is reached
from the initial block but we cannot
move from that that state and this is
called the bad state because it is the
state that that provides the transition
which is the fake transition why this
state is a call an irrelevant state
because actually is there in the block
is not the reason of the
foolishness of the absurd part so so
segura so actually the real problem is
to find the list way of refining that
block but this problem cannot be solved
in an efficient way actually it is NPR
and so the reason Arista the wrist
extend states are separated from bed and
relevant state so in relevance theta
join it together with bad state but this
strategy DISA listings which is the
standard realistic in see us actually in
some cases in some cases does not work
well what does it mean so here if we put
the relevant state for together with a
bad state free so the situation is the
following so from this from this model
we refine to this model here again we
have an after party which is bullish so
look to this block of 346 so we have an
after part and here again we have a
foolishness free is the bed for is the
data so we refine again so we separate
cluster development and the backstage
just need to separate the backstage let
me relevant could be either
hey sue yes for can be jointed together
with three on five shooting figure to be
Polly yeah this is the standard you
reach the cops ago it's not true
always go to the
but the back is this clip the state to
distinguish
to big crowds from experience
so you split the 34 state
now the point is that Dave Allen estate
for the purchase work for the fight
is to do
i'm justing traditional CBR takes the
thing bought I'm just looking for
because it looks like there's a spurious
path because you can go from two to
three four three four six
so I'm going to do that is go back to
465 you only get three
but the question is good because y 4 is
jointed to free because you can stand we
try to join 4 with 5 so the solution is
here that phanom is the following then
we are done then we are done because
here we do not have any more and it's
pool use of subpart and so actually this
is the point I want to avoid this
situation because here we need a further
step of refinement while here we stop at
least a surface in these pictures which
are permanently just examples a good
slider usually creating abstract States
we have us transitions like
like all the edges but once you group
four and five it's nice because all the
edges out of 45 goodness
yeah like a bus transition must go to
say
maybe it's related so let's look at the
solution so why why we are able so how
we are able to distinguish these
refinement strategies from this
refinement strategy so the problem is
that some time at least some time these
arista come refinements which are not
effective let's see so the observation a
year here is that the state for can be
viewed as a dead relevant state so
instead of viewing for as a generic
relevant state actually is dead
irrelevant in what sense the sense that
we can join for 25 and and this does not
affect the set of paths of upset but
that go through five why because if we
do the pred if we consider the
predecessor of five is to the successor
of 5 is 7 but if we join 5 with four the
set of predecessor a successor the same
that's the observation and so also I
think that it's a reasonable to join 54
with five for this reason so so when
this happens so when we are able to to
find that the some relevant state
actually is more than irrelevant so is
dead irrelevant then the reasonable
strategy is joining that set of dead
relevant states with the dead state
state state what offer
because it still goes on but then it
usually is like you go into an alley and
there's no way out of the way you came
why you call it that in that end because
here the abstract
the abstract part is this block block a
six and so for the apps at packed the
this block this block and six so this
trans issue is not considered as far as
it goes yes this is no context in
particular instructor
so so the the new let's say refinement
strategy is if you find that the any
relevant state is a data element in this
session and I will make more precise
this definition then you can join that
relevant state with that stance and
these the benefit of this that you do
not introduce new spoon spots so what is
more precisely a data relevant state
state which is irrelevant is dead
irrelevant when you join with dead and
the predecessor and successor does not
change and so the predecessor of dead
with s and the predecessor with dead
without as are the same and the same for
the success of course there is a dual
notion of bad relevant state we're here
we consider the bad state instead of
dead end state and of course still there
are some state that are not the
development neither by the relevant and
this is the case or or they are both bad
ended irrelevant so these states are
called fully realm or really relevant
let's say really and so here this is
dead end irrelevant and so is jointed
here and so here we do not add spoon
spots and so we are done we are done to
conclude so this can be viewed as a
contribution in looking for some
usefulness of simplifying abstraction
and both in static analysis model check
so in general in the generic framework
herbs herbs interpretation and as a
future work I see two interesting point
first
to investigate more in detail the
relationship between the integration of
this strategy in the sigil loop and to
find a new context where the ideas of
this approach can be useful in some
sense the questions
I am a crazy question
through your talked and talked about the
absolute compilation forget it somehow
in Russia valuation for sensitive take a
function f and then we specialize with
respect to domains to get cheaper demise
amount somehow related to this
population partial valuation
I don't know but I think that this can
fall in this item okay could be a
context different from the tool that I
consider here where this can be relating
some some way thank you
free the room okay okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
