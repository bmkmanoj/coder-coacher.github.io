services the services that fall into the
categories of compute and storage are
generally of most interest to
researchers a wide variety of computing
resources are available within windows
azure with options such as websites
virtual machines databases as a service
and hadoop as a service even in this
video we'll take a more detailed tour of
Windows Azure features and the services
it provides for developers and
researchers in particular we will look
at as your ability to host virtual
machines automatically provision popular
website frameworks and build robust
cloud services the first Azure service
we'll talk about is its virtual machine
hosting if you're familiar with
traditional hosting this is probably the
feature that feels most familiar and
consistent with what other hosting
providers provide you can stand up a
virtual machine with either Windows or
Linux and then you can connect via
remote desktop or SSH you can run any
workload just as if it were a physical
machine that someone had to install in a
rack somewhere these virtual machines
enable you to be admin on the box
they're durable meaning that if you
reboot the virtual machine it is still
there with all of your changes and data
that you stored on the disk if you want
to run sequel you can if you want to
install a no sequel server you can do
that too if you want to run SharePoint
you can do that virtual machines provide
ultimate flexibility to do whatever you
want to do on the computer it also
enables you to do what we call virtual
private networking with virtual private
networking you can deploy virtual
machines in the cloud and group them
together so they're part of their own
private network you can then connect
them back to your corporate network if
you have one and establish a VPN secure
tunnel to link your machines running in
your own corporate environment or your
own research lab to the virtual machines
in the cloud making them feel like
they're part of one large connected
network so there's lots of flexibility
in the compute side as well as in the
networking side when you mount a drive
on a virtual machine it is triply
replicated if one goes bad as you're
automatically creates a replica from
your virtual machines perspective it
never knows that an issue actually
occurred the mechanism for implementing
this is much deeper than we have time to
go into in this video but it is all
dependent on Azure storage services
another thing that is nice about the
Windows Azure storage solution is that
we have support for continuous geo
replication what this means is that
whenever you save something in the
storage system in the background asher
will automatically replicate that data
to another data center as your
guarantees that these data centers are
several hundred miles apart so that in
the case of a natural disaster or a
complete data center failure you can
still be ensured that a copy of your
data exists somewhere else you don't
have to configure this or anything it's
automatically enabled by default you can
turn it off if there are policy reasons
why you wouldn't want your data moving
to a different place but the end result
is that you can deliver more robust
solutions with even greater integrity
all automatically because it sits on top
of Azure storage subsystem the second
Azure service we'll talk about is the
azure website service one simple way to
get started on Azure is to create a
website to communicate your findings and
collaborate with other researchers later
you can expand your usage by adding
other services as applicable to your
objectives although journals still have
a place in the scientific community for
peer review many researchers are sharing
the work publicly on the internet using
blogs or content management systems to
stimulate more discussion or to share
their data if you already have an
existing website or web application you
can easily move it into Windows Azure
Windows Azure websites is a managed
service that you can use to run websites
and web api's it enables you to quickly
stand up web applications and sites on
the Internet
furthermore the underlying environment
and operating system is managed for you
this not only is very convenient it's
actually more secure because the Azure
security team can identify potential
vulnerabilities and fix them much more
rapidly than if you had to constantly
monitoring security mailing lists all
the time all you need to do is just say
that you want a website provide the
domain name copying the content and
Azure does the rest you don't have to
worry about or think about spinning up
virtual machines configuring servers or
infrastructure you can simply focus on
building and deploying web-based
applications you can literally deploy it
in seconds as your websites are
multi-language you can build websites
using asp.net nodejs PHP or Python there
Balti platform
you can use any tool or any operating
system to build these sites including
Windows OS 10 and many flavors of Linux
you can also use a variety of
technologies to deploy your website what
is nice about Azure websites is that not
only does it enable you to get going
very quickly but it also allows you to
get going for free the pricing for as
your website's starts a free perpetually
free and then you can scale up as you
need more capability you can scale up as
your website's by using reserved
instances for higher performance and
isolation and you can scale out as your
website becomes more successful and you
have increased load I've talked about
virtual machines and we've talked about
websites so now let's look at cloud
services cloud services is another model
we support for building scalable
applications it enables a broader set of
workloads and Windows Azure websites
while providing a more automated
management than Windows Azure virtual
machines these applications are
extremely scalable automatically just by
the nature of how you build them with
cloud services they can support one to
hundreds or even thousands of course
they support not only web-based
deployments but also multi tier
architectures where you might have a
combination of front ends middle tiers
as well as virtual machines running as
part of the overall application Windows
Azure cloud services also supports
automated application management so it
is really easy to deploy scale out
isolate and recover from any kind of
hardware failure additionally there's
support for automatic updates of the
operating system so what is a cloud
service at a high level and Azure cloud
service consists of code that implements
various kinds of service roles which
fall into one of two categories the web
role and the worker role web roles are
front facing web servers that respond to
inbound HTTP requests worker roles are
virtual machines that manage computation
and data to support the needs of the
application these roles communicate by
using a robust messaging queue when you
build an application factored into this
kind of model azor can scale these up
and down as traffic and compute demands
change we will look at cloud services in
more detail in our Azure cloud services
video in addition to the compute
services for deploying and running your
code
windows azure also provides a number of
application building blocks these are
managed services that we run that
provide a lot of value so you can avoid
standing up the infrastructure for
common capabilities you can always stand
up virtual machines and put anything you
want in them but in a lot of cases
you'll find that we have built in
services that deliver or are delivered
by partners what's cool is that you can
use any of these services with a virtual
machine with a website or with the cloud
service so you have flexibility in how
you consume them all of these services
can also be used from multiple
programming languages we now have as
part of our developer Center on Windows
Azure comm support from multiple
different programming languages
including dotnet node Java and PHP one
of the new languages that we're now
enabling is Python with a complete SDK
and its own def Center for each of these
we provide libraries that you can
consume that call in to the REST API s
that we expose for the building block
services you can always call the REST
API yourself directly all of the
libraries are hosted on github under an
Apache 2 license so you can both see the
source and contribute back to the source
the as your execution models we've
looked at are quite different for
researcher or scientists building an
application it can be difficult to
decide which is appropriate for their
use case we'll now take a look at some
example use cases and what works well
for each in general you can think of a
hierarchy that lets you choose along a
slider between control and convenience
virtual machines give you the most
control and are the most general
approach running whatever existing code
you may already have however they also
require the most configuration and
management for scaling websites are very
easy and lightweight to set up but
they're generally only appropriate if
your application needs fall within the
capabilities of one of the existing web
frameworks or content management systems
that already supported by a j''r cloud
services strike a balance between
capability scale and convenience but
require a bit more work to set up and a
simple website using an existing web
framework all three let you build
scalable reliable applications in the
cloud virtual machines are true
infrastructure as a service
for instance if you need persistent
Linux virtual machines running on some
powerful hardware you can also build
Linux clusters this way or you can
extend your own infrastructure into the
cloud these are full-fledged machines
running on the internet and you can do
whatever you want to with them another
great use case is for disaster recovery
if something happens to your existing
machines you can spin up a virtual
machine in Azure and be up and running
again very quickly many times a simple
website is really all you need whether
it's a wordpress blog or a private photo
gallery that you fully control as your
web sites is a fast way to get these set
up there are many existing application
frameworks already available Joomla
Drupal WordPress and the like and these
are literally just seconds to spin up
it's interesting to note that there are
entire companies out there whose
business model is to help you configure
and host these kinds of software whereas
on Azure it's just a feature that is a
few mouse clicks away Azure cloud
services may seem like a fairly
sophisticated application architecture
for research scientists but the
capability that it provides is very
useful for a large number of common
scientific workflows there are many
kinds of large data processing tasks or
on-demand computation tasks that
scientists encounter which can be made
much more scalable by effective use of
cloud services we'll look at more
detailed examples of these in the Azure
cloud services video there are other
patterns that you may encounter in your
research virtual machines as a work
environment in the cloud allows you to
work on the same machine from the lab
the office or at home with many airline
carriers now offering in-flight Wi-Fi
you can even log in and monitor your
jobs and perform analysis from a small
laptop while you're a 30,000 feet
even if you're always working from a
single place being able to have a second
workstation grinding away on a large
Python R or MATLAB job can be very
useful with Azure not only can you just
get a machine whenever you want and only
pay for how many hours or minutes it's
turned on you can actually allocate
perhaps a more powerful machine that you
normally have access to with much more
RAM and disk if you're happy with the
workstation you have BMS can still serve
as a great testing environment you can
run multiple test datasets in parallel
or run older versions of your code on a
different machine than your primary
workstation you can use the azure
storage service to share your data in
the cloud well there are many file
sharing services out there if you really
need to share multi gigabyte data sets
there's nothing that is as cheap and as
effective as directly using a cloud
provider like Azure in fact many of the
file sharing services themselves are
backed by cloud providers by using Azure
in a more sophisticated way via
persistent queues and tables you can
scale embarrassingly parallel workloads
in a very cost-effective manner you can
even turn your parallel computation
workflow into a web service that other
people can leverage finally Asscher is a
great way to publish reproducible
simulations in the cloud others who want
to evaluate your models or investigate
your data may do so and you only pay for
the compute cycles that are actually
used this would be very expensive or
unwieldy to attempt without using cloud
because you would need to go and buy new
physical machines as more people try to
run your software in summary windows
azure provides a comprehensive set of
services that you can use selectively to
build applications there is a globally
distributed robust and highly available
network of data centers you can take
advantage of this great hardware and
only pay for what you use there's no
need to buy a large amount of computers
that have to sit around idle nor is
there need to not run some job or
investigate some data set because you
can't afford to buy that many physical
computers there are many different ways
to use Azure and you can choose what
level of flexibility and configurability
you like lastly there are a number of
well configured powerful computing
services that comprise a very flexible
and scalable framework you can use
whichever of these you need to power
your scientific workloads thanks for
watching this video I hope you've
learned more about
some of the core components and services
that make up Windows Azure as well as
gained an understanding of some of the
great ways that Azure can help
researchers and scientists be more
productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
