hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
thank you for coming my name is Amy
graves and I'm delighted to welcome
Sheila Keene and Doug stone to the
Microsoft Research visiting speaker
series receiving feedback sits at the
junction of two conflicting human
desires we want to learn and grow and we
want to be accepted just as we are
Sheila and Doug's book thanks for the
feedback addresses this tension head-on
offering a framework to help us take on
advice assessments and criticism with
curiosity and grace Doug and Sheila are
co-authors of the New York Times best
business bestseller difficult
conversations which has actually gone
galactic as it's now on the
International Space Station and they are
principals at triad consulting they've
been teaching negotiation skills at
Harvard Law School for twenty years
please join me in giving me them a very
warm welcome thank you very much so I'm
Sheila this is Doug just so you can keep
us straight and yes we learned recently
that the book has been downloaded on the
space station which was surprising to me
but actually as I think about it it kind
of makes sense right like if you're out
on a spacewalk you really want to be
getting along with the guy who's gonna
let you back in right
you can't like get away from each other
and so as Amy mentioned 15 years ago
difficult conversations came out and it
has now been translated into 25
languages and we are often surprised by
the way people are using it that we just
didn't imagine in addition to astronauts
business schools managers law school etc
family therapists I recently learned
that there's a woman who uses it to
teach Argentinian tango apparently she
explained Argentinian tango as opposed
to the melodramatic kind in the movies
our gen Tinian tango is very subtle does
anyone here dance Argentinian tango
tango is this true no
she lied to me so what she says and
maybe you can give us a demonstration
later what she says is that couples come
to her to learn it together and by the
end of the first lesson they are
fighting right like you're not
signalling clearly enough no you are not
listening as always and so she sends
them home after the first lesson with
this book okay so it's really
interesting the ways people are using it
now when you have a book that does well
here's what happens they want you to do
another one and ideally they want it to
be as close as possible to the one you
already did because then the people who
like this book will buy the next book so
you know they were floating ideas like
you know you could do difficult
conversations at work and you could do
difficult conversations at home and you
know there's a whole lot of difficult
conversations for chefs
difficult conversations on the patio you
know it's like never-ending and we
decided not to do that partly selfishly
just because we felt like well it'll
just be the same book that's not
actually very interesting and we want to
learn something new now the problem with
this strategy is that you have to wait
till you learn something new and so it's
been 15 years of thinking well so what
is it that we're learning and eventually
what started to occur to us is that we
were noticing patterns that were so
obvious that we kind of weren't noticing
them so we're we spent the last 15 years
going around the world working with
organizations of all kinds across
industries of course in the for-profit
corporate sector but also nonprofits
community groups families NGOs etc even
in ethnic conflict and the first thing
we always do when we start working with
a new group is ask them so what are your
most difficult conversations because the
work we do together should be focused on
what you are actually facing so that
it's relevant and realistic and feedback
comes up a lot to put a finer point on
it feedback is on that list 100% of the
time it doesn't matter what continent
we're on it doesn't matter who we're
working with or why they brought us in
all
it comes up as while giving honest
feedback is hard because the receiver
you know you go on a limb to really be
honest with them they get defensive they
argue with you they really don't take it
in even if they say they do nothing
really changes you damage the
relationship or maybe they really do
take it to heart and now they're really
demotivated so you know that just didn't
work I'm not sure it was worth it quick
on the heels of that somebody names yeah
but what about receiving feedback it's
unfair it's off-base your boss doesn't
really understand what you do anyway
right and by the way it was so poorly
delivered as to be pathetic like by text
are you joking um and so what we started
to notice was that it didn't matter what
organization you were in everybody feels
that their feedback conversations don't
really work and which is why of course
the feedback performance system changes
every couple years in many places right
because we it must be the system is
broke so we'll fix the system and then
when we fix the system one more time
then we conclude well maybe it's the
people who are broke right so let's fix
the people and the typical approach is
to teach givers how to give right so get
all the managers together and teach them
to be more skillful at giving feedback
and encourage them to be more persistent
in giving feedback
now let me be totally clear everybody
benefits when managers are more skilled
and are better at communication but it's
still a push model of learning right I'm
gonna decide what you need to learn and
I'm gonna push you to learn it and if
there's any resistance at all pushing
harder or more persistently or even more
skillfully rarely results in real
learning and so it occurred to us that
maybe we've got this whole thing
backwards actually because at the end of
the day it doesn't really matter how
much power or authority or even skill
the givers got it's the receiver who's
in charge
it's the receiver who decides what
they're gonna let in what sense they're
gonna make of it and whether and how
they're gonna check they're gonna choose
to change um so how come we're not
actually trying to create pull and learn
all of us how to receive feedback more
skillfully and turn even that off hand
unfair criticism into something that
might be valuable to us
because I think often we wait around for
the perfect giver to come along and
those givers and and talented skilled
mentors who we trust and we admire and
all of their coaching comes preapproved
treasure those but they're rare right
mostly our lives are populated by
everybody else who doesn't have time to
give us the time that we need whose
advice is maybe off-base and certainly a
little bit cutting or it's so indirect
you can't quite figure out where you
stand with them and so this book is
really taking a look at well what's so
hard about receiving and how do we take
charge of our own learning so you can
accelerate your own learning and
actually learn from anybody so it
doesn't hinge on the skill or what you
think about your giver now by the way
one of the reasons that this is so
important it has to do with work because
the research shows that people who seek
out negative feedback and in the
literature what they mean by that is
they're not just fishing for compliments
they're looking for what they can
improve people who seek out negative
feedback at work adapt more quickly to
new roles they report higher
satisfaction and they get higher
performance reviews so it's not just
that it benefits your learning it also
changes how people see you it's no less
important in our personal lives you guys
have a friend and researcher here in
Seattle John Gottman who studies
marriage and one of the things that John
has discovered is that the spouses
willingness to take coaching and
influence from their partner is a key
predictor of a happy stable marriage now
keep in mind that has to be true when
your spouse is chronic complaints about
you you think of that less as feedback
and more as them being annoying right
but paying attention to that is
important for the relationship and of
course it you know if you want to
influence how your kids deal with
setback how they react to a bad grade or
a bad call in the baseball game
that's gonna be determined more by them
watching you and how you handle the
offhand criticism from your
mother-in-law right or the
disappointing result at work then all
the lectures combined so that's really
where we started to take a look at all
right well what's out there almost
nothing how is it that we can get better
at it and I think the place that started
is why is it so hard
and Amy alluded to this in her
introduction because what we found is
that feedback actually sits at the
junction of two core human needs human
beings are wired for learning if you
look at the happiness research getting
better at something seeking mastery
growing and learning is a key piece of
what makes us satisfied in life it's why
we take up hobbies in retirement
it's why we're addicted to those games
because getting a better score is really
satisfying it is by the way why
otherwise normal human beings stick with
the game of golf because the occasional
good round gives you the illusion that
you're actually getting better okay um
problem is of course we've got another
really core human need that runs right
alongside that which is we really want
to be respected and accepted just the
way that we are now and the fact of
feedback often suggests that how you are
now isn't quite a okay which is
sometimes why the people closest to us
their criticisms can be even more
threatening than someone that we don't
know and sometimes that means a stranger
can tell us something that our spouse
has been trying to tell us for years but
it's so threatening there that we can't
hear it when we can hear it from another
source let's take a look at that
challenge alternative so let's dive into
your challenges take a moment and
reflect on a couple questions I'd like
you to think about a time in your life
when you received some feedback that you
did not take and once you've identified
that ask yourself C as specific as you
can be why was it that I didn't take
that feedback and we'll give you a
couple minutes for this you can turn to
your neighbor and sort of bounce
thoughts off real quick we'll come back
together in two minutes okay let's come
back together
so let's let's get a sense for this why
did you not take the feedback but just
raise your hand real quick and draw out
some thoughts yeah you want you wanted
to keep doing what you were doing right
it made you happy yeah I think that fit
we can just cancel the rest of the
workshop that captures everything we
need to know yeah you trust them they're
there what their motivations their
expertise motivation good some folks in
the back of a nursing has until I
pointed toward you yes so they they
didn't help you understand it and maybe
that also created a sense of like well
they're not sharing details maybe there
are no details a little bit suspicion
around weather is really right yeah they
didn't under the feedback giver may not
have understood the situation certainly
not in the way that you did and so it
makes you wonder well does this feedback
then makes sense if they don't know the
context there's a couple hands up here
yeah I didn't realize I was giving the
feedback until afterwards and the person
getting feedback being a spouse was too
close and then had to point it out in a
different situation with someone else
gave me the feedback I told you and this
is happens so many times that he just
felt that he's over in like every kind
of so this is us your spouse and your
spouse gives you feedback I just it
doesn't register someone else gives you
feedback and that really registers with
you and with your spouse nice they're
wondering why others over here
yeah say it again attachment to your own
conception of what's good for you yeah
so the feedbacks often subjective and
you might have a different view of of
what makes sense or what you want yeah
so following the feedback is risky for
you they want you to be the one that
takes the risk and you notice that that
it could have a downside let let's take
one more yeah so people give you
different feedback do it this way
someone else does it do it this way and
it could be the opposite you're good at
this
no you're not good at this so who are
you supposed to believe and then if you
talk to each of them and tell them that
someone gave you the opposite feedback
they're like oh that's okay that person
is ridiculous you should believe me and
they're both saying that of course yeah
so we've gotten a lot of interesting
reasons why we don't take feedback and
it would be easy for Sheila and me to
stand up here and say you know what
you've all got your reasons but you know
feedback is good for you you know it
helps you learn so just just get over
those reasons just put them aside take
the feedback you know you should write
that would be convenient simple it would
mean the book was you know two or three
sentences long so but that's not our
advice because in fact your reasons the
reasons that you've just shared are
pretty compelling right so if we're
gonna get better at receiving feedback
we have to step one is really getting
better at understanding our reactions
and then being able to sort of sort
through them in an intelligent way it
turns out you you might think that
there's a trillion reasons why we don't
take feedback turns out as Phil and I
have been teaching this material we've
seen lots and lots of but you can put
them into categories
very useful in terms of your own sort of
mastering your own reactions so we we
would say there's three categories three
reasons that we tend to have a negative
reaction to feedback or discard it and
the first category is what we call truth
triggers or the challenge to see the
feedback and this has to do with the
substance of the feedback we're
listening to the feedback and we're
asking ourselves a question as we're
listening and that question is is this
feedback right or wrong this is it good
or bad is it helpful is it not helpful
and when we decide that it's not helpful
or bad or wrong we reject the feedback
now as far as that goes that makes a ton
of sense right raise your hand if you
think you should be taking stupid wrong
unfair feedback as a general matter
probably you feel that you shouldn't be
right so that's a reasonable question to
have you know if you you you show up to
work one day and someone says okay Mike
so you know I was disappointed in your
performance at that meeting I thought
you were really gonna speak more and
sort of stick up for the project and
you're thinking okay hey I wasn't at
that meeting be be my name is not Mike
so this this isn't really maybe feedback
that is gonna apply to me that lunch so
yeah you don't have to take feedback
that's wrong
so the challenge with this category is
that too often we reject the feedback we
disqualify it we set it aside before
we've even really understood it and
we'll I'll say more about that in a
moment what sort of what that means and
why that happens a second challenge here
is that we're very willing to set
feedback aside because something about
it was wrong so my name is Doug Stone my
middle name is Charles my middle initial
is C so if the feedback said Douglas B
stone I could be like whoa you know
that's not me that's a that's totally
different so we could find some little
thing wrong with it and then we say well
the feedbacks wrong so I'm not going to
take
but it may be even if even if 90% the
feedback is actually off target or
misguided in some way that last golden
10% might be something enormously
valuable to you so we do what's in this
in this context we do what's called
wrong
spotting we've got that radar of like
what's what's wrong and then also other
side so we'll talk more about this in a
moment second category relationship
triggers the challenge of we so all
feedback exists in a in a relationship
in a context of the giver and receiver
and we have a relationship with the
person giving us a feedback it might be
our identical twin sibling who we've
been related to for seventy years might
be the person at the stoplight you know
very brief relationship but there's some
kind of relationship there and in this
challenge
often the who the who the person giving
you the feedback can serve overwhelm the
what the actual feedback itself so the
challenges here are as some of you
pointed out maybe we don't trust the
motivations of the person giving us the
feedback or maybe we don't trust the
expertise of the person giving us the
feedback that you know they don't they
have no particular knowledge about this
topic and yet here they are giving us
feedback a second category in this this
challenge of we is when we feel in some
way poorly treated by the person giving
us feedback so a classic example is if
we feel underappreciated it's really
hard to take feedback from someone who
is actively under appreciating you in
the same moment that they're giving you
a feedback so if you take over for a
colleague for a few days who's out sick
and they then come back a few days later
and you've been working really hard to
do your job and their job and they come
back and they say well you know the
project that I was working on right
before I left you still haven't finished
it and you're thinking okay so actually
you're right technically I haven't
finished it but that's the first thing
you say to me after I was taking over
your job because you were sick so what
happens is we focus on you know how how
could they possibly have raised that
instead of thanking me which is an
important topic obviously but it's also
a different topic than how did you do in
your role of substituting for them so
with the challenge of we what we do is
we we sort of switch topics and we
substitute our new topic which is you
don't appreciate me or your mistreating
me in some way for the original topic
which is you were actually this
conversation started by you giving me
feedback but we're not talking about
that anymore because I don't like the
way I feel treated so this can be very
complicated and cause us to set aside
feedback that actually might be
important to discuss Third identity
triggers or the challenge of being me or
in all of your cases the challenge of
being all of you so we all we we each go
through life with a sense of who we are
an identity that matters to us and and
we so we know you know you might be
someone who takes pride in being fair or
compassionate or hard-working or smart
or funny or creative whatever it is for
you you have a set of things that you
know about yourself and the challenge
comes when you get feedback and you see
it coming toward you and you realize oh
this piece of feedback has the potential
to threaten how I see myself or sort of
Who I am in the world or my sense of
well-being in the world is potentially
being threatened notice that's not a
comment on whether the feedback is good
bad useful fair unfair it's just a
comment on your reaction to it how you
feel but when we feel threatened in
important ways we get overwhelmed and
then we can't engage in the feedback
interestingly neuroscientists and some
of you probably are know more about this
than we do have been studying you know
the brain as they do and they found that
people vary widely just in terms of
their wiring and sensitivity to how they
respond to
kinds of stimulation certain kinds of
negative feedback for example and that
we very up to three thousand percent in
terms of sort of how wide we swing
emotionally and our recovery time so
just as a quick check-in so some people
are very sensitive some people are
insensitive actually that's probably not
the best word did you comment on this
learning I'm suddenly having deja vu uh
so yeah so insensitive isn't developers
even keel yeah well I'll use even killed
but uh calling you and calling the
insensitive ones insensitive isn't
bothering you guys because you're
because you really are incensed it how
many would say you're on the sensitive
side of the spectrum in terms of you
have a big emotional reaction to
receiving feedback
how many would say you're on the
even-keeled side yeah so you know sort
of 50/50 somewhere but and some of us
are kind of in the middle now two things
about that one is it's really useful to
know your own tendencies both in terms
of these triggers and how sensitive you
are a second aspect of that is that you
all are giving each other feedback so
sometimes it's too sensitive people
giving each other feedback and sometimes
we're sensitive and insensitive and
there's every kind of combination and we
tend to assume other people are kind of
wired the way we are and we tend to give
feedback based on how we think we would
receive it and that this can create all
kinds of havoc and mismatches in terms
of someone being very direct or blunt
and having it badly received or someone
being sort of indirect and trying to be
friendly and having it not not received
at all so these these three challenges
or triggers this is step one in terms of
receiving feedback well which is knowing
your own reactions and as Sheila
mentioned receiving feedback well
doesn't mean that you take the feedback
it might mean that but we would define
it as it means your understanding the
feedback you're engaging well in the
conversation
the feedback and then whether you take
it or not
you're making an informed decision about
that rather than simply not taking it or
even taking it for reasons that don't
make sense
just a couple further thoughts on this
digging in on the challenge to see I'm
going to put up a sentence here that is
feedback and it's feedback that we have
all either gotten given or wanted to
give but not given and I want to just
have I want to do a quick brainstorming
session with all of us about what are
some possible meanings that could that
this sentence could Canute so I don't
like the way those pants look on you
what might someone mean if they said
this to us
you're fat what were you gonna say the
pit so one is you're fat by the way
notice that you're fat
is it has nothing to do with pants this
this word here pants it has nothing to
do with that feedback but yours does the
pants are too tight or too loose so it's
the relationship between the pants and
the person what else might it mean those
are ugly pants so that really is about
the pants what else yeah say it again
yeah yeah all those words I could have
just said I'm in a bad mood I don't like
saying something mean to you
other other meanings yeah
the person cares about me what says I
care more than I don't like this
basically
you could write Valentine's Day cards no
but there but but there's a potential
aspect of that right there saying I I
want you to look good I don't want
people to to make fun of you or whatever
right so this is this is absolutely
right so was there one last one
choose a different a different style so
it's that it's a whole category of pants
right potentially so yeah so this is
interestingly this it's a kind of a
silly example but this is the way this
is the way feedback tends to be given
and received in the world it it we use
words like this and each one of these
words has some meaning and we all would
say yeah I know I know all those words
but it's actually very vague and subject
to a huge insanely huge range of
possible meanings these are a few that
similar to the ones you've suggested so
I don't like this the particular so this
one's very specific those pants are
actually they look fine these kinds of
pants right the type of pants this is
about not this is not so much about the
pants as the person this is more this is
more of this isn't even about the way
the person this isn't about the way they
look this is about their judgment their
ability to function as an adult in the
world so getting a little more intense
now it's not even about the other person
now it's about it's about our whole
relationship in the world together us
and then this is the tragic one
so it could be a way of easing into
something you know very serious so the
the pattern here so now we all know you
know what to say or not say about pants
but if you have other you have other
feedback situations we need to step back
and understand the bigger pattern so the
pattern here is that the comment about
the pants is what we would call a label
it's just very general words that don't
have any particular specific meaning and
so for example you know at work we often
hear things like be more assertive or
take your take your your skills to the
next level or bring more energy or be
more proactive and those are all words
that have meanings but it's not really
that clear what they might actually mean
we were doing a radio interview the
other day and the host we were talking
about labels and the host said yeah you
know I got some feedback a little while
ago that I should be I should have a
edgier persona on the radio and the host
was saying you know I was trying to
figure out whether that would work and I
had to do that and maybe I should like
you swear words or yell at people or
talk about sex or he was just unsure and
he was feeling very uncomfortable about
it because he didn't really want to
change his persona he went back to the
producer and said you know I'm not sure
I want to take this feedback but what
did you mean by when you said edgy and
the producer said you should be more
sort of emotionally open and vulnerable
and the guy was like well that's
actually worth exploring and there's no
there's no it's not about a right
interpretation or a wrong interpretation
it's that we tend to either reject or
accept feedback based on the label
whatever it is we think that label means
so the the way out of this is to two
things first spot the labels and we'll
give you the homework assignment two
next time you give or even receive
feedback notice whether it's really is
their real substance to it or is it a
pretty vague label once you spot the
label ask two questions
where is the feedback coming from and
where's it going - the feedback has a
past and a future where it's coming from
you're asking what what stimulated this
feedback what did you observe what are
you worried about what were you thinking
about you know what did you what did you
see in terms of what I was doing or what
others have done that made you want to
give me feedback so it's about the past
and then so if I was going to take this
feedback looking to the future what
would I do differently specifically what
would I do differently how would I know
if I was doing it the way you wanted me
to do it how would I know if I was going
too far or not far enough so you're
trying to sort of sketch out a picture
of what it would look like going forward
um so so far we've been dipping into a
little bit the challenge to see and the
challenge is to see includes both to see
what the giver means what is it that
they're trying to comment on it also
includes by the way the challenge of
seeing yourself because we all have
blind spots what I mean actually I don't
have blind spots because I would know if
I did but I know that you guys have
blind spots okay
um so there's a chapter that looks at
things that typically fall in blind
spots
um one of them interestingly is not just
facial expression and body language but
tone of voice there's a little part of
your brain it's called the STS that's
right over your ear on each side and
it's dedicated to listening to other
people speak it decodes the meaning of
language and especially the emotional
tone in the language when you yourself
speak that part of your brain turns off
this is why when you hear your voice on
a recording you are horrified yes okay
we think we've listened to ourselves
every day of our lives but in fact our
voice is the one that we don't actually
listen to the same way we listen to
everybody else and when it comes at us
through the speaker it suddenly gets
routed through that part of your brain
for the first time in a long time
so particularly feedback about you know
your tone is just a little bit too
aggressive or whatever is really hard to
understand and it's why people say like
I'm not yelling what are you talking
about right because you don't actually
listen to yourself your focus on what
you mean so so far we talked about the
challenge to see by the way when you
write a book like this you have to
figure out in what or
do we tell this story see we me is what
we finally settled on so you'll see that
when you look at the book we considered
we see me which you know has resonance
for trying to see yourself the only one
that we knew was really not going to
work was see me we that was something we
really needed to stay away from all
right so let's talk a little bit about
the challenge of we and the part of this
I want to just raise is that sometimes
the feedback is actually coming from the
relationship itself between you and the
giver and what they are saying is
there's a problem between us there's
friction in this relationship and
therefore you need to change now we know
that that's not true that they are the
problem of course and so the easiest way
to illustrate this is with an example a
few years ago I got a call from CEO who
said I need you to come in and work with
my team I've got eight senior vice
presidents they can't stand each other
they don't talk to each other they can't
make decisions together they all come to
me to complain about each other so I
need you to fix them okay so I said well
you probably gonna need to be involved
but let me talk to each of the eight so
I do individual interviews with each of
the eight to find out what they think is
going on and what I learn on this team
which is common on teams that are having
trouble is that you've got a couple of
primary conflicts between individuals
that everybody else is reacting to and
trying to work around and on this
particular team one of those primary
conflicts was between a guy I'm gonna
call Sam and a guy I'll call Pete now
Sam is one of these like nofilter guys
like whatever comes into his head he
just says to you
in fact when I called him the first time
he answered the phone not by saying
hello he answered by saying you're seven
minutes late I said hi Sam that's true
let's use our last 23 minutes well shall
we
and he said well look this is just a
total waste of time the CEO is making us
come to this two-day thing with you but
the problem here is that these guys on
this team and especially Pete can't
handle conflict if I got a problem with
you I'll tell you we'll argue it out
we'll settle it we'll go out for a beer
afterwards it's no big deal that's the
way it should be but you're not going to
change their personalities especially
not Pete's personality and that's why
the
is a waste of time and he hung up few
days later I get a hold of Pete Pete
tells me right up front Sheila I hate
conflict in fact CEOs making us come to
this two-day thing with you I am just
hoping to have my heart attack in the
first hour like is going to kill me one
way or another the only question is how
much suffering will be involved so I'd
hate to have it in the last hour I'm now
to make this even more fun
Sam runs operations which used to be
Pete's job Pete left operations and took
over international partly because it's
the growth engine for the organization
but also he had admits to me so he can
be out of the country most of the time
and not deal with Sam so there's a
problem between operations in
international you know every few days I
you tell me who starts the conversation
you betcha so Sam calls Pete what
happens yeah he doesn't answer from
Pete's pointy new caller ID is the best
invention ever okay so he lets it go to
voicemail what does Sam do next he sends
in he leaves him a message and he sends
an email uh
does Pete respond no of course not just
seeing Sam's name in his inbox like
sense his anxieties skyrocketing and by
the way Pete is busy doing other things
right so he's in a meeting any things
I'll deal with this later I don't even
want to open it so he lets us see it
then you know Sam texts Pete ignores it
Sam then typically would go to Pete's
right-hand guy like I'm looking for Pete
the right-hand guy texts Pete Sam's
looking for you Pete texts back I know
right and then eventually sam goes to
the CEO by the way about four minutes
has elapsed
now who are you more sympathetic to how
many people are more sympathetic to Sam
because by being this unresponsive it's
just unprofessional
you're more sympathetic to Sam how many
things are more sympathetic to P like
Sam's is your life if it means there are
a lot of Sam's at Microsoft are you drum
them out right and all avoid each other
are they both contributing to this yeah
so this is what we would describe as a
self-reinforcing relationship system
right they each have feedback for each
other by the way about what you need
what's wrong with you and why you need
to change but in fact each of them has a
coping strategy emotionally for dealing
in this relationship and that coping
strategy is actually making the problem
worse meaning the more Sam pursues the
more Pete avoids and the more Pete
avoids the more aggressively Sam pursues
and the more Pete flees so their coping
strategy is actually creating exactly
the behavior they hate in the other
person excuse me can this change we're
not going to change their personalities
and one of the things about feedback is
that particular when you're frustrated
with someone it grows from here's a
here's a behavioral change you can make
too you know you need to go get a
personality transplant right and I'm
googling all of your mental illnesses so
um we finally would you say yes exactly
the place the place where this actually
finally got some traction was on the
afternoon of the first day and we kicked
the CEO out it was the senior vice
presidents and it was a moment where Sam
looks at Pete and he goes Pete I just
don't understand why when I tell you
you're full of you think I'm
attacking you
so of course this is exactly what Pete
hey excuse my language by the way so
Pete is like silent and then another
member of the team said like okay Sam I
know that that wouldn't feel like an
attack to you that's like an invitation
to a healthy conversation but for Pete
actually it's hard and by the way some
couple of others of us it's not our
favorite thing about you either and so
we started to draw this and they started
to see the ways in which their own
behavior was actually reinforcing and it
was part of their relationship system so
what we did is we just reversed these
arrows so we had Pete coach Sam so Pete
if Sam wants a response from you what
should he do tell him how to get one
tell him one thing he can do and Pete
said oh that's easy
don't call me okay when you call me you
already know what the problem is you
already have your preferred solution I
have to answer the phone cold and get
this barrage of arguments for what you
think should happen and why my team has
screwed it up and I don't even know what
the issue is yet and I hate being
unprepared for something like that
really stresses me out
instead send me an email in the email
tell me what's the problem
if you have a preferred solution just
tell me what it is and in particular by
the way tell me when do we have to
figure it out because everything's a
crisis with you right and so I can't
take it seriously and I got to juggle
everything on my plate too
Sampson all right I can do that they
said all right Sam coach Pete if he
wants you to back off what should you do
and Sam said well it's not that hard
just tell me you got it
part of my anxiety is I can't tell if
I'm getting through to you I'm an
Operations guy I got a problem to solve
so I can't tell whether I actually have
your attention and when you just tell me
you got it tell me when we're gonna talk
then I put it on my calendar we're gonna
talk to her say morning I can relax
um did this change yeah for a while okay
so so let's be really clear about one of
the challenges of receiving feedback
which is often you're persuaded I that
coaching is good coaching I do think
that I would improve this is something I
fully intend to do
but actual change isn't easy and so
although they both took the coaching
that the other gave them they also
needed to agree that they would help
each other and not use falling off the
wagon as more evidence that you're
impossible but instead nudged each other
with a little bit of humor like hey you
forgot to let me know if you got it
you've got to tell me about when we need
to decide and also their teams and their
colleagues agreed to help because
changing a relationship system actually
takes some work right and sometimes so
slowly over 12 or 18 months it got
better when you try to understand a
relationship system what's going on here
that's producing so much frustration and
feedback between us one of the ways that
we suggest to do it is to take three
steps back the first step back looks at
what are the intersections in how I am
versus how you are that's creating some
of the friction we're just different and
this is one of the reasons by the way
that the people you find challenging to
work with are actually sometimes
MVP's for you your most valuable players
because the people you like and who like
you and you work easily with they
sometimes don't see your edges right
because you just fall into an easy
rhythm together the people you have some
friction with they do see your edges
right probably cuz they're so good at
provoking them so they actually have
valuable insight and a different
perspective on you under stress so that
they sometimes can be really helpful so
looking at what is it that is different
between us that's causing some of the
problem step back one more step to say
okay is there something about the roles
that we play that creates conflict right
my job is to pester you to get something
done but in your role this thing is not
actually that important so it keeps
falling down your to-do list
so I keep saying that you're being
irresponsible or unresponsive but part
of it is simply that it's built into the
role that it's more important for me
than it is for you or your role as
you're overwhelmed right because you're
sitting in a role that is a bottleneck
let's say so how much of it is
structural and then finally the bigger
picture are there other players are
there processes is there physical
environment that
contribute to the challenge that if
we're gonna change this we would have to
also address those things just as an
example between Sam and Pete one of the
physical environment challenges is that
you know sometimes Pete was not getting
back to Sam not because he was ignoring
him but because he was sleeping he has
many time zones away right and so Sam is
anxious about why am I not hearing back
from him well you know you got to think
ahead from their point of view where are
they or why is it taking so long before
we run totally out of time I want to
just touch on the challenge of being me
um so what we did was we looked at
differences in sensitivity to feedback
and we looked at three different
variables the first is what we call
baseline in the literature this is
sometimes called setpoint that all of us
have sort of a level of happiness or
satisfaction in life that in the absence
of other events we gravitate back to
this comes from the studies of lottery
winners a year after winning the lottery
they're about as happy or unhappy as
they were before people who go to jail a
year later they're about as happy or
unhappy as they were before okay some
people live life that like if it's a
scale of 1 to 10 they're like an 8 and a
half or a 9 like these people are like
irrationally cheerful all the time other
people live life at like a two or a two
and a half now the reason why this
matters visa vie feedback is
particularly if you have a low setpoint
or baseline positive feedback can
sometimes be muffled for you the volume
is kind of turned down it's harder for
you to hear it um the second variable is
what we call swing so when you get
positive or negative feedback how wide
do you swing positive or negative some
people the same piece of feedback will
come to two team members one of them is
devastated the other is like yeah it's
gonna be a busy day tomorrow right we'll
get it fixed then of course the person
who's even keel will say the fence a
person like yeah you're so thin-skinned
like you cannot take it so personally
like and heap another piece of feedback
on top of it that you're not handling
the feedback very well which is always
really fun for the sensitive person um
the third variable then is what we call
sustain or recovery how long do you
sustain positive feeling
or how long does it take you to recover
from negative feeling um how many people
would say if you get a piece of positive
feedback in email but matters to you you
know that positive feeling would
actually stick with you all day maybe
even leak into the rest of the week how
many people like it's gone by the time
you open the next email yeah okay
so by the way positive sustain and
negative recovery are completely
independent of each other
you could have long sustained and short
recovery you get a short sustained and
long recovery which is a particularly
tough profile but understanding your own
reactions can help you understand how to
manage those reactions it can also keep
you from falling into or help you
recover from the distortions that come
with big negative swing so if you are
really upset by a piece of feedback you
can fall into what we call the Google
bias there being byes the Bing bias we
are now can I have those books back
please we need to change the Bing by the
Bing bias is actually a better name
right
it's a literate 'iv so it's as if like
you get one little piece of feedback
like the user interface on this isn't
quite right or whatever it would be and
that causes you to actually mentally
search everything that is wrong with me
and you get 1.2 million hits right of
all of your past mistakes and
disappointments and bad judgments um
you've got sponsored links from your
father and your ex you know and the
reason we call it a bias is that your
results are based on your search term as
you guys well no you are not pinging is
that now word pinging okay you know
things I'm handling relatively well then
you would get 5.2 million hits and you
would have a more balanced perspective
on yourself okay falling into this bias
affects your sense of the past your
present in your future and so a piece of
there's a chapter in the book about how
do you dismantle the distortion so the
feedback doesn't become super-sized and
you can see it an actual size in a place
that you can also see is there anything
that I can learn
mess I'll turn it over to Duggan that's
let's just let's take questions okay
we'll open up the questions yes yeah
that grow up consciously reduce function
so the the literature that we looked at
these are very rough numbers but the the
neuro scientists and psychology people
have said that about 50% of how we
respond and who we are in the world is
based on our wiring that's kind of the
way we showed up in the world about 10%
is based on our circumstances like you
know where we live in who we live near
and who we're married to or not and
about 40% is based on the way we're
telling the story of of our life and
what's happening to us
so the the place where we have real
leverage you know you can you can with
neuroplasticity you can maybe adjust
your wiring a little bit with exercise
meditation whatever but the place where
we have the most leverage is how we're
telling that story and so our
recommendation is that's that's the
place to go if you're trying to have a
different way of reacting or if you feel
like you're too sensitive
you you know you it's hard to sort of
change your physiology but you can you
can change the yeah well that's about
yourself oh what's that about your my
experience yeah so when so I tend to be
on the sensitive side very sensitive
people Larry
Sheila is on the more even-keeled side
so in that sense we're a good team
writing the book because we had one of
each extreme but you know it's looking
forward to the thinking about so I'm
sensitive I struggle with negative
feedback it takes me a long time to
recover and I go pretty low sometimes
some thinking well this is a great book
to write and I'll come out the other
side and
in forward to how it turns out writing
the book reading it etc so now when I
get negative challenging feedback I
still feel really crappy so that's the
bad news there's nothing that makes bad
news good news or negative feedback
positive feedback the good news is that
I feel lousy but I feel less lousy and
for a shorter period of time so it's not
like a it's not like a you know a huge
transition where I'm at I have a
different physiology I just have the
same physiology but I've learned ways of
telling the story ways of interacting
specific tools that actually make a huge
difference to me and my life and once
the stress and anxiety or upset of
getting feedback starts to go down then
you can participate in the upside of the
feedback at the learning and also a show
saying the relationship side of it is
huge because if you're really sensitive
to feedback it's very easy to kind of
wall people off and say well you know
it's going to be too painful now that's
a big impact on you it also has a big
impact on people you're close to because
they can't then interact with you in
certain ways there's no outlet for them
to talk to you about relationship issues
so you know it ends up having quite a
big impact positive impact on my life
and I think as you age sometimes that
happens naturally because you have more
perspective on how important is this but
I don't actually think it happens
naturally for everybody and that I think
actually working at it means you get
better at it much faster which is what
we were looking for is how do you work
at it and get better faster yeah it's a
great question yeah
different groups of money olds over
Generation X Christmas know we haven't
looked at that and I don't know of
anybody whose will he had that specific
question people are looking at how our
Millennials in the workplace different
generations in the workplace but I don't
know if anybody is looking at well does
that change over time I think that's a
great next book like the different
generations are they different from each
other yeah yeah maybe so so we'll offer
one thought on that which is we use the
word feedback to actually mean three
really vastly different things so if
we're really gonna be crisp about our
definitions part of is we have to
understand that feedback really means
three different things it's appreciation
I see you I get you you matter when
people say I wish I got more feedback
sometimes they just mean I wish somebody
noticed that I work here right
the second is coaching helps you get
better at something the third is
evaluation which is judgment assessment
here's where you stand here's your
rating or ranking and that tells you
what you can expect that's the loudest
emotionally and so it can drown out
coaching or appreciation and so I think
Millennials the popular wisdom is that
they're more likely to have gotten lots
and lots of appreciation and positive
evaluation for what they do in life and
a lot of attention because parenting is
more attentive
apparently generationally than it used
to be so that then when they come in the
workplace they expect that to continue
and then also it's really easy for all
of us to interpret coaching as
evaluation like if you're telling me
something I should be doing better it
must mean I'm not doing okay and by the
way I think it's particularly
challenging for high achievers do you
guys know who this is mckaela mckaela mo
Ronnie and and disappointing ourselves
as high achievers can sometimes be the
most damning and I think that that's
something that we often share that's the
best fix on this the best effects on any
difference whether it's Millennials or
you know World War two veterans or
whoever's working together any way that
they're different is to not only give
and receive feedback but
to make explicit and have any
transparent conversation about our
preferences and styles and just the way
we each are we often act like well we
just we're supposed to try to guess and
we do our best and we're a thoughtful
and considerate but often we just guess
wrong it's much easier just to talk
about it and say you know what are your
expectations here's my expectations
here are my tendencies here's what I'm
good at when I give feedback here's what
I tend to be not so good at when I give
feedback and just have that conversation
well offer one more thought and I want
to be respectful of your time but we'll
stick around to answer questions and
chat with anybody who wants to chat the
last thing that we'll leave you with is
is how you ask matters so there's no one
right way to give feedback which is why
only teaching people how to give it
stuff because the receivers are all
different and it's a collaborative
venture but there there are a couple of
don'ts for asking for feedback one don't
is don't ask hey do you have any
feedback for me nobody knows how to
answer that question right like what do
you what do you use on your performance
on your personality on your pants I
don't understand what do you want and
how honest am I supposed to be it's not
clear um instead what we suggest is ask
for one thing so say hey what's one
thing I'm doing or I'm failing to do
that you think is getting in the way or
where I'm getting in my own way
what's one thing I could change that
would really make a difference for the
team you are much more likely to get
something concrete and specific it
lowers the stakes for both of you and
it's clear that you actually assume
there is one thing so you can be honest
right and if you actually take one thing
you can actually take charge and
accelerate your learning and elicit
coaching as well as probably
appreciation you're in and you're out
and you don't have to wait for the
performance management system which is
really geared mostly for evaluation and
when it's used for coaching so as the
coaching gets drowned out so that you
can actually take charge of your own
learning um thank you so much for
joining us and please stick around we're
happy to answer questions if you like us
on Facebook you'll get updates and then
on our website here we're going to be
posting
in the next month or two a team guide so
that you can actually with your team
read pieces of the book and then sit
down and talk about it talk about your
wiring what gets in the way of learning
what's helpful to you talk about your
blind spots etc talk about how you want
to accelerate your learning together as
a team good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
