information about their local
environment down from generation to
generation
but it seems increasingly likely that
young farmers are going to see
circumstances that our parents and
grandparents didn't necessarily see
we were asked as USDA to look at the
vulnerability of the food supply to
climate change
which meant we could start mining all of
the data that we have and when we
started thinking about mining data and
being able to have somebody in the
private sector work with us Microsoft
was there Microsoft in the USDA are
rolling out an Innovation Challenge
which is really a call to action for
developers around the world to start
digging into some of the key data sets
that USC has been collecting over the
past hundred years on crop production
practices financial outcomes
demographics and remote sensing products
of the health of crops around the
country the innovation challenge I think
it's just one of those exciting outcomes
of this whole climate data initiative
and that is creating public private
partners like Microsoft to actually
create and do something new and
different and to make these data sets
available to the larger public
using data and information and
transferring knowledge between people
who aren't necessarily co-located close
together gives us an opportunity to
improve our practices based on their
understanding that we might not
otherwise have had access to solutions
that answer some of the key questions
that the USDA has about how to ensure
the resiliency of America's food supply
that's what I think as your services
brings us it's a way to connect the dots
across all of these different different
sources having a healthy farm economy
benefits everybody bringing all of those
different kinds of data together is
going to be difficult it's going to be a
challenge and that's why we're asking
people around the world to help the USDA
solve this
