you
hi everyone my name is Oliver hampson
and I'm at university of california
irvine in the informatics department i'm
going to be talking today about
transgender experiences with online
harassment and in my research I look at
self presentation and disclosure on
social media sites during identity
transitions and specifically in the
context of gender transition and through
my research I've understood that people
really reinvent themselves in relation
to others and navigating disclosure and
the social relationships with your
network can be as big a part of
transition as the personal changes but
when people disclose personal changes
personal aspects of their life on social
media sites this opens them up to online
harassment and so the context here is
gender transition and I've been doing
research with the transgender population
and because of the context of my
research people often ask me what can
social media sites do to make
experiences better for trans people and
I just want to give a little trigger
warning that some of the people's
experiences that I'm going to talk about
are going to be somewhat disturbing so I
did a large online survey in 2014 of
trans people about their experiences
changing gender on Facebook and one of
the questions was regarding trans
identity and how frequently people were
a target of harassment discrimination or
violence and this is these are the
results here and you can see that
seventeen percent of the participants in
this study either very frequently
frequently or occasionally were a target
of harassment discrimination or violence
particularly related to their trans
identity and so just compared a little
bit to a physical world context of trans
people in schools in K through 12
schools about seventy eight percent of
them have reported harassment so it is
you know we can say there is somewhat
less harassment online than in places
like schools public restrooms etc but we
often talk about the Internet as
a safe space for identity
experimentation and that can be the case
but often particularly in real name
environments like Facebook identity
experimentation can actually open people
up to harassment so I want to talk about
and this is focused mainly on Facebook
so the types of harassment that trans
people face on Facebook rape and death
threats hate crimes and discrimination
in the physical world after disclosing
trans identity online hate speech and
name-calling which often is not
recognized as hate speech on Facebook in
comments on news articles unsolicited
sexual photos and messages and this is
mostly received by trans women instead
of trans men content being flagged or
removed for being inappropriate when
really it just dealt with trans issues
people's names being flagged or their
accounts being suspended for for being
fake offensive and ignorant reactions
from family and from people's extended
Network being mocked or not taken
seriously and finally inappropriate
question questions and who is this
harassment coming from so it's coming
from strangers from different hate
groups that will form Facebook groups
that are specifically targeting trans
people family and friends extended
Network a group of radical feminists who
are trans exclusionary sometimes even in
support groups with other trans people
who will claim that some people are not
trans enough and finally some of the
Facebook policies actually up in people
up for harassment so there's a few
different themes that I came across and
I'm just going to read you some quotes
from the participants in my study so one
of the things is that there really are
implications for what we call real life
and what we mean by that is just the
physical world as opposed to two online
so one person said I've taken steps to
make sure my social profile will not
intersect
with my real life in almost all
circumstances and another person said
I've been the victim of a hate crime
where they cut the word tranny into my
arm shortly after announcing on facebook
that I intend to start my transition
soon so this harassment actually as some
of the other people were talking about
to it really comes into the physical
world in terms of actual physical
violence in some cases another thing
that people talked about a lot was the
fact that trans identities intersect
with other stigmatized identity such as
if someone is trans and also a woman
also a person of color also a person
with mental illness etc and in these
cases they'll face harassment both
because they're trans and also because
of that other marginalized identity and
one thing that I heard time and time
again is that women get more harassment
so when participants said girls get more
harassment than guys online that's just
a fact another person said I experience
sexism as a woman more than transphobic
or trans misogynistic discrimination and
so as a result of fear of harassment
many people actually choose not to
disclose their trans identity on
facebook this is a quote from someone
who said I made it so that there was no
timeline story when I changed my gender
on Facebook I've taken steps to ensure
that it is hard to detect the change the
harassment might be bigger if Facebook
did not let me limit who could see my
gender so some people will either not
disclose their trans identity or take
steps to have only limited disclosure to
certain people that they feel safe with
so what has to change in this situation
I want to read a few quotes i think
really demonstrate what really needs to
change here one person said the more i
participate in trans and feminist
discussions the greater the chance of
becoming a target online so you're
saying that this actually affects
people's you know free speech ability to
have discussions online and another
person said it was bad enough that I
felt like my only option was to lead
Facebook entirely or else to use a new
stealth account for all the benefits
that come with social networking
it still wasn't worth the emotional
damage of the constant harassment so one
thing that I want to highlight that I
think could change here so this is a
part of Facebook's policy regarding
their real name rules so I want to
highlight here the use of the word
authentic here it says you know Facebook
is a community where people share and
interact using their authentic names and
this is really highlighted in opposition
to the word fake here and people on
Facebook can actually be reported as
being a fake account by anybody and so
this can be actually a tool for
harassment and I think that a lot of
times policies like this where Facebook
is saying in a sense that trans people
are not authentic if they're not using a
particular name that can be verified by
Facebook this gives other people the
license to say that certain people are
in authentic or fake and that gives
people license to harass there are other
things that I think could be policy
improvements here such as allowing
incremental disclosures so a lot of
times your profile picture can only be
one photo that's seen by your entire
network but if somebody is out only to
certain parts of their network they
can't have a different profile picture
being shown two different people also
allowing multiple accounts facebook
currently only allows people to have one
account and that can be really difficult
during times of gender transition so
I've talked a little bit about policies
and site affordances but I certainly
don't have all the answers here and I
think a lot of people in this room might
be able to help us answer this question
of how can we reduce online harassment
of trans people and so my part in this
is I've been listening to people's
experiences of being trans on social
media I've been writing about and
publishing about this and I've been
trying to get it in the hands of the
right people so I've been talking to
people that work at Facebook and they
really are interested in helping and I
will hopefully talk to other social
network sites but I think bringing these
experiences of trans people and the
harassment that they face online to the
people in this
room I think this is a really good start
and trying to answer this challenging
question thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
