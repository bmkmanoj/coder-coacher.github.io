pleasure for me to introduce my dear
colleague and also one of my cultures
for this event dr. Evelyn Villegas
Eberling is the director of artificial
intelligence outreach at Microsoft
Research evelyn's ways in redmond in the
u.s. in her current role evelyn is
building initiatives which focus on
information scenes as an enabler of
innovation working in partnership with
universities and government agencies
worldwide in particular she's creating
programs around computational
intelligence research to drive open
innovation and agile experimentation be
a cloud-based services and also projects
to advance this state of the art in
artificial intelligence and there are
driven research including knowledge
representation machine learning and
reasoning under uncertainty at the scale
let's give availing warm welcome thank
you very much
thank you very much Jaime thank you you
the audience to be here I'm very aware
this is the last talk and even more
aware that the clouds are leaving as we
speak so I'm very impressed that you're
still here with us so I try to keep it
short and sweet but because I want to
leave time for questions and of course
I'd be around for lunch too so I hope
that by now after these two days of
talks around a I you start getting a
good sense of the type of efforts and
approaches that we have at Microsoft and
Microsoft Research AI is really changing
along with big data the lives of every
one of us but also society as a whole
and so it's no wonder that actually
there is a lot of momentum right now in
the field of AI not just on the research
in the research arena but also in
industry startups in fact some market
research is showing that as soon as will
be able to deploy at scale a lot of the
say I services it's going to be a market
as big if not bigger that the market of
the internet economy today so I'm sure
you are very aware of like so much
activity going on in AI and I thought
what I do today I'm going to look little
bit at two different ages of a young
then I want to come back to what the
Microsoft perspective on AI and finally
because I am in the outreach
organization I want to talk about ways
to engage what's our model for community
engagement and I mentioned one project
which has not been part to any of the
talks during this summit
which is really dear to to my heart
because it focuses on really embracing
reproducibility because we're doing a
lot of research services software
publishing papers but how can we make it
so that other people come and don't have
to reinvent the wheel and is really
about accelerating the path of
innovation and then also talk about how
we can go from a model of competitions
we've heard actually during the some of
the sessions this morning as part of the
academic services there are some
challenges going on challenges as in
competitions and sometimes it's really
good to look at building some
competitions to help advance the state
of the art in areas of interest to the
community but specifically also when we
start talking about AI which is really
broad with people with different
expertise and now they need to come
together if you remember the talk by dan
burisch on physical situated AI so how
can we build some platforms where people
can now start collaborating and that's
by the way a community effort so with
that let me start with the ages of
artificial intelligence and I'm to start
with the going to start with a question
to the audience so who can tell me when
the concept of a thinking machine
appeared who started talking what's kind
of the first embodiment of thinking
machine McCarthy that's a good one go
for earlier earlier earlier ok so
actually I really like that one and I'm
going to call it the mystical age 2500
BC and then I'm going to go each year
until today so hopefully
so I really like this example if you
look at so actually there is an article
which is a brief history that's a brief
history by the way of AI and they
mentioned that one of the first
embodiment of the sinking machine is
real harm a keys and it's a statue to
bust the stat which sits I think in
Cairo to they have not seen it and
fortunately yet but what it was it so
this statue has actually an opening and
then priests were able to go without
people in the audience knowing that
there was actually somebody and then
basically a real marcos played the
oracle I you could ask a question and
then before like wow this machine is
talking to me so when now I'm going to
jump because I think you we won't have
the patience to go year by year and i'm
going to call it the Romantic Age of AI
in the 50s and that's when you started
talking I getting closer to us so the
Romantic Age the why I call it like that
so that's when AI was said to be solved
and specifically in machine translation
so after translating a few sentences a
few words some researchers said yeah in
23 years we can translate everything of
course now we can we Skype translator
but he didn't take two or three years we
still need a few more languages to add
so that's the Romantic Age and then
added stages like wow we can do anything
and the money really came from
government agencies to see well okay go
solve it and everybody very optimistic
in fact too optimistic and then in the
80s that was kind of the age of reason
the psyche no AI is difficult actually
not only it was difficult but from
funding point of view towards dead so it
was very difficult actually to do some
research and when when you go to
conferences like triple AI
sky people who were working in the 80s
on some of the supposed to remember very
dearly and painfully what's happened
from the funding point of view and I
think now we're going to jump a few more
years and now i think we are i got what
i call the psychedelic 8ai is back big
time and this is of course do you
important if not mainly because of the
advent of big data and unleashing the
power b date and some advances in
machine learning and all the
technologies that you've been hearing
about during the summit i want to point
out a few examples which have been
popularized so if you look at the first
one deep blue vs Kasparov just match it
so that was in WoW actually a machine
can beat a human right like playing
chess there is another example more
recent on jeopardy which is these are by
the way titles from press articles on
jabra deeds month versus this machine
and that's the example of Watson with it
so joe purdy the game in the US where
people need to answer questions and then
they gain some prizes and so here they
were actually the top players were
playing against watson and guess who won
the machine and then there is another
example even more recently of alpha go
who defeated the goat champion in the
first match from korea and that from the
Alpha go deep mind and you can see how
destroyed the person is here the
champion so this is in terms of some
technologies and the way showing like
how they can compete with humans and now
if you look there have been also many
books that I'm not going to show here in
the last couple of years talking about
AI is going to well basically kill us an
email
Xander and movies I don't know who has
seen movies like ex machina people have
seen in my bag okay so no spoiler alert
he just I'm not going to say what
happens but there are many of these
movies where those robots are okay you
have to watch it and of course what's
not to like with our dear terminator
terminator right i mean lovely like you
can really become friendly and so what's
interesting when we look at a search and
what people are searching for so I did
sir just yesterday a couple of search
engines and at the top is an artificial
intelligence with eliminate jobs with
same not to show what that was Miss I
don't know with kids are as all we never
happen we take over the world and others
are changing Mandy replaced by machines
we take over with keen as or so people
are still worried right having said that
is much better I can tell you that a few
months ago with killers all was the top
one everywhere now there is hope right
so so now let me tell you what's the
Microsoft perspective and I hope you all
ready when I when I'm going to say that
you already have had a chance to
experience it as part of the talks
during the sessions so the approach from
Microsoft is about augmenting human
abilities and experiences so it's really
collaboration with all with all these
technologies that are being developed
those services is how can they be used
to help augment human abilities and
experiences and here just put the
example of connect because it's actually
an example which
is which happened at the same time as
the earlier example I was talking about
in terms of challenges and this one was
really an enabler I mean mind you that
was developed for gaming right and Rico
mention the Kinect in his keynote but
actually thanks to the SDK people have
been using eating like amazing ways from
in hospitals to helping people with
disabilities oh really extraordinary and
the other aspect is really looking at
humans and machines as teams is really
about collaboration and in a way where
there is some complementarity and some
trustworthiness and here i want to
remind you of another example which was
bought by i think a couple of our
speakers if not more which use the Skype
translator to communicate to have people
communicate people who speak different
natural languages ok so again the
Microsoft perspective approach that
you've seen in during these two days is
really about this collaboration and not
at all about getting you know one
against each other or but really about
how together we can create technologies
to help humanity as a whole and society
as a whole all right now I'm going to
switch to I'm sure something you want to
know about is how do we engage so here's
a picture just to remind to remind you
that how important academia is in the
ecosystem for Microsoft and industry in
general ready so when we look at the way
we engage with the community first of
all it's really this virtual cycle right
it's an exchange of ideas like here's
what's happening in events like this one
is also technology services many of the
speakers then have talked about some of
the services that you can use or provide
feedback on them to see what can be
useful
to you and then I want to mention just a
few specific programs we have intern
programs we have postdocs visiting
professors we have engagement programs
as workshops events workshops that are
or conferences hosted by Microsoft but
also we go where you go to two other
conferences where we can meet you the
researchers can also have conversations
with you and sometimes we also call okay
events there so it's really all about
collaboration there is a specific page
on the research of microsoft com where
gifts gives you idea and actually
tangible services and programs where you
can start to engage with us this is life
well when I mean by lab i should say
refreshed like for instance you can see
here i just took the page from yesterday
and you can see that we have the summit
which is there highlighted and we have
some other projects and opportunities
are there there when we have some
requests for proposals that's where you
will find them there are some programs
and for instance I'd only this one is
showing let me see yes for instance we
have under the programs open source for
academics Judith bishop gave a talk
yesterday about that and all the tools
and that can be used so go to this page
just to see what's available and the
ways in which you can engage okay so
it's a very rich content again it's
refreshed so you can see what microsoft
research outreach what are the programs
which are available to you alright so
now in the remaining of the talk here i
want to talk about a specific example so
another tool and platform that we are
making available to you
which is part of the list of the open
source project that Judith talked about
yesterday and this is about embracing
reproducibility in a really really true
way so what are the issues so the main
issues Israeli reinventing the way right
it's like duplication of effort it's the
lack of reducibility that we want to
address they are often the lack of
comparable baselines and then I talked
in the end about all these challenges
when challenges has competitions which
are organized like to help advance the
state or the art and sometimes they are
designed in a way which is really about
instant gratification and here i put the
cookies the american cookies but i guess
i could have customized that to another
nice sweet here but basically is like
how can we leverage and learn from those
challenges and not just winning the
prize so the research process goes like
in a data-driven word that's what I'm
talking about here you are looking for
data you clean it you convert formats we
made the author sometimes how you can
use an your data you compile the code or
in the other way actually find code
compile email etc implement track
versions and and you start again so
that's not good and when we talk about
the lack of comparisons actually the
comparisons often they are not done on
all the data sets right I mean it's just
like a question of bandwidth sometimes
or sometimes the data set hasn't been
created yet right so usually because
we're talking about fans so somebody is
going to apply the research there are
going on to some data set and here's the
accuracy
if that's a metric being used and the
previous method that was the accuracy on
this data set and maybe do it on the
second data set but what happens with
the other ones right and the comparisons
is really difficult to control them too
so for instance here saying okay my
method I have 90 here's my accuracy and
I use this type of approach and here's
the regularization I approach and I'd
use a 10-fold cross-validation but now
if I look at the previous method i can
say here's the accuracy but as you can
see the rest is different and that's not
even talking about the bugs which are in
the system right so how can we address
part of that like how can we make sure
for instance for the exhaustive
comparisons that if there is a new data
sent coming up that the system actually
can start running those algorithms and
see does it work well for this type of
data set or not and that's exactly what
we've been trying to do looking at how
can we reduce the preparation time
enable reproducibility enable common
measures and then finally move from
competitions to competitions and the
project I'm talking about is kadala so
this is an open-source platform which is
developed with the external community
here are the people these are the
community leads on this effort there are
two facets to it is one's really
focusing on making paper truly
executable and then as an incentive to
bring some data and some code also doing
some challenges and then I'll show you
what we've learned about those
challenges and how we're trying to
evolve them as competitions so the main
principles of coda lab are the
modularity and that fits actually very
very well AI right when we talk about
the expertise that are needed to solve
some problems and some scenarios so you
really need
our community people have different
expertise so can they just continue to
focus on their expertise but also
contribute your expertise to the bigger
picture when we're trying to solve a I
problems so one is about modularity
that's how the system was designed the
other one is about imitable immutability
which is really about we going to write
one so that's the whole idea of
provenance and making sure we can track
or that this is very much inspired by
the ideal version controlling and github
the whole project is in detail by the
way and then the last one last but not
least it's good for machines but we are
humans and we still need to be able to
understand what's been done and that's
the idea of literacy and here it's a
concept which has been coming from the
work which happened with the ipython
notebook and those type of efforts and
so it's really about embedding the code
but also the description what you're
doing so put a lot that's where you can
find the data the code the description
and then other people can go and read a
paper in an executable form of course
you can also have your PDF etc and then
the platform can be extended so there
are it's on github so people of course
can contribute there is a client side
you can download cuddle up there is also
it's also on the cloud because if we
want to take advantage of all the
research which is opinion when I say we
I mean the researcher community the
research community so then it has to be
shared but there are also times where
people don't want to share for instance
something we found out it's like when
people one are working on some paper but
don't want to make it public yet so
there is a notion of unlimited we're
working on so that when it's ready can
be share
the community and then the community can
work on it all right so I would invite
you to have a look at it try it kodala
has been endorsed by some of the
conference's in natural language
processing so the next ACL the
association for computational
linguistics is asking actually the
researchers to publish their the final
copy their camera ready to make to make
it available in encode a lot and just
try it out and by the way so this seats
the cloud version seats on azure and if
you need some resources for some of your
papers we do have conveniently a program
which has been mentioned like the azure
for research programs can be used
coupled with a collab all right now let
me switch gears from competitions to
competitions I mentioned earlier that
competitions can be used as a way to
help advance science as a way to
incentivize people to work in a certain
area to solve some problems so they are
very powerful what we found in the
context of a I when we need people to
work together is that sometimes
competitions are not necessarily don't
have necessarily the right design so
competitions usually are competitive by
design and the competitions are not
recent so I didn't find an example from
the antiquity I'm so sad about that but
the first one I could find like a few
centuries ago is the longitude prize so
that's the first competitions that I
know but and there are different types
of competition this is of course not
exhaustive these are just some ports of
challenges am you may have heard about
right the darpa grand challenge
or the network challenge another DARPA
challenge and these are really
competitive by design which means
somebody wins and other lose a good
aspect actually it's not an all- it's
actually there is a lot of positivity a
positive aspects to competitions for
instance that you can bring research
mature research to industry via open
innovation and here are some examples
probably a lot of people here know about
the net its recommendation so Netflix
you can rent movies and and here the
that was the one I think to the 1
million dollar price which was about
like figuring out algorithms so that you
can provide the best recommendation like
if i watch this movie which other movies
should be recommended to me there is the
example of the gold corp challenge so
it's not just in the digital world the
Gold Corp Chinese an interesting one
this is in Canada in mining field and
the CEO so actually the gold corp was
getting almost bankrupt at the time and
the new CEO came in and and she looked
at what was happening here what was
happening is that they knew there was
many fields minds of cold and so and the
value of millions and millions maybe
billions of dollars the problem is that
I didn't know where they were those
fields right and so it's difficult to
make money if you cannot actually go and
extract it and so the CEO said okay we
just going to open up the data set to
the world and he found some resistance
what data but that's you know that
you're going to start telling people
where some of the foods we know about
our and but he was the CEO and he said
we open in the data and she gave
anything the price was also one min
indoors country remember exactly but
actually that was soap
powerful because we I think about a
thousand people participated like a
hundred teams and they found many minds
like which were you know compared to the
1 million dollar prize they're really
actually didn't go bankrupt they
actually they're still alive as far as i
know so so there are very good things
about competitions and another aspect is
about upskilling in industry i think
that's a theme with her to during the
conference which is as the technology
changes and how can we help with
technologies to train the next
generation of people that's of course as
professors in university that's your job
right that's what you do in university
but in industry how do we do that right
people when they join industry they're
supposed to be trained of course there
are programs to train people that there
is nothing that we heard it from claudia
tara there is nothing like really trying
to solve a problem and working with
someone to solve it rather than the
training going to a class who is very
powerful to learn by examples that's
exactly what's happening in industry and
at microsoft also DSM hackathon and a
country member who mentioned do one of
those speakers mentioned that we do
hackathon that Microsoft to one week
where we actually are using some new
technologies and trying to come up with
something so that's very powerful but
there are also include a lab done if you
change i'm just showing a couple of them
here one in the computer vision side
which is using microsoft coco some other
speakers talked about it the this is a
challenge which is still open which is
using kadala the leaderboard and i'm not
doing the detail of the platform itself
but what i want to i lie to or the other
one ought to amend which is closing she
has been a one-year challenge or over i
guess one year and with multiple face
very complex in a sense and what we've
learned from those challenge is not just
those two but is that
although a lot is happening at the same
time we are missing so many
opportunities to get some of those
results to be leveraged or improved on
by others and so again competition
instant gratification and ability to
leverage and so the idea we've been
working on is how can we really
accelerate the part of innovation by
enabling true in multidisciplinary
interdisciplinary research and with
collaboration which happens organically
so it's not about you have to
collaborate but it happens naturally
because it makes sense to work together
to solve a problem and so and that's the
idea of competition actually comes from
the business world just to give you an
idea of an intuition for that it's when
people come together because actually
they are not in competition but they
have mutual interest and the first
example of that is the Lincoln Highway
Association so some people were needed
to to bring I don't know products etc
from one side of the country to to the
to the other side so some people were
building cars i think this one i can't
remember the exact company maybe for one
of those companies in the US but they
needed to bring and develop like having
more people drag cars and trucks and all
that but there was no road right so how
do you so they have to partner with
people who actually are in the business
of tar cement concrete and all that and
so these are those top type of
partnership which are collaborations and
everybody wins so this is really a
win-win I give the example of Michelin
I'm French as in case people are still
wondering with my American accent where
I come from and so Michelin they started
with the tires that the logo of mission
up there and tires are great and but
quite frankly people don't use tires
every other day it's very difficult to
get excited about yeah i'm going to go
buy my next tire and so they started
going into other businesses so such as
which is called the video task on are
like oh here they started with France
100k here you can now go and visit this
beautiful place on you know you're going
to use your tire of course they don't
say that but but that's kind of the idea
and then of course the mission I stole a
restaurant right i mean so i'll go
anywhere for those Michelin restaurant
and French people would so the more of
those guides very popular right so these
are those type of examples and so right
now we started a few competitions like
just starting to try to understand how
we can use kadala which already exists
and make it more collaborative and we
are actually right now working on the
speed interview competition and as you
can see it involves having like
different modalities and and work so we
working on with different people and you
bring in expertise in different areas
and I won't call on the details but some
of the design goals for the competition
really fits very well with what coup de
la was built for except for the
excitement that's not what is called X
item is how do you credit and reward
people right like what's the incentive
here for people to to collaborate and
actually not just collaborate God the
scenario helps them collaborate but also
to be acknowledged for the work they are
doing so there is some work going on
there and so as I mentioned these are
some of the challenges that the
community is working on and now because
I'm out of time are you ready for pizza
so this is a short video that we're
going to show and I wanted to finish
with the new area in our reach that we
starting to invest in at Microsoft of
course
this is super important like ethics
privacy and security and in outreach
we're starting to design some programs
if you have some ideas I would love to
hear from you because of course the more
powerful systems are the more
information flows in all directions how
can we make sure that this is done in a
way which is secure which is private and
which is ethical and so if you want to
play the video please and this pizza
palace guaranteed have in 30 minutes or
it's free this is Mary may I take your
order hi Mary yes I'd like to order mr.
Kelly yes thank you for calling against
her I share your national identification
number is 6 10 to 0 for 9 9 9 8 45 54
610 is that correct yes Thank You mr.
Kelly I see you live at 736 Montrose
corporate sure calling from your cell
phone are you at home I'm just leaving
work but I'm oh we can deliver to Bob's
auto supply that's at 175 Lincoln Avenue
yes no I'm on my way home how do you
know all this stuff we just got wired
into the system sir oh well I'd like to
order a couple of your double meat
special pizzas sure thing there'll be a
new 2000 charge for this sir what do you
mean sir the system shows me that your
medical records indicate that you have
high blood pressure and extremely high
cholesterol luckily we have a new
agreement with your national health care
provider that allows us to sell you
double meat pies as long as you agree to
waive all future claims of liability
what do you agree sir you can sign the
form when we deliver but there is a
charge for processing the total of sixty
seven dollars even sixty seven dollars
that includes the delivery surcharge of
fifteen dollars to cover the added risk
to our driver of traveling through an
orange zone I live in an orange zone now
you do looks like there was another
robbery on montrose yesterday hmm you
could say forty eight dollars if you
ordered our special sprout submarine
combo and picked it up yourself comes
with tofu fix those are very tasty sir
good value to what I want double meat
well I'm sure you can afford the sixty
seven dollars then you just bought those
tickets to Hawaii they weren't cheap a
oh but I see you checked out the budget
beach bum at the library last week hmm
up to you sir all right all right I'll
get the sprout subs good choice sir
gotta watch that way so you're hitting
the beach a 42 inches wow man i say tofu
and sprouts is like required that's how
much just between you and me there's a
three dollar off coupon in this month's
total Men's Fitness Magazine your wife
Betty subscribe to that right anyhow
clip that and it's 1999 even whoa looks
like you maxed out on all your credit
cards for in cash okay well thank you
dance company thank you so much so this
is unless you buy pizza that's not
happening so this is actually a video
that we use and that we have been using
in the semantic communities are actually
my background is the natural language
processing and in computational
semantics and so we've been using these
videos like when we do workshops are
just to remind ourselves you know ethics
privacy security they are not
second-class citizens here right we
really need to make sure we understand
what we're doing so that was wasn't done
for semantics reason or anything like
that but I it's it's a good way and the
fun way to just remind us as everybody
like when you start doing research and
specifically I think in in AI to make
sure that we understand the other
indications but that's what I understand
we don't have pizza for lunch oh you
should be we don't know any thing of you
know all you saw there alright so I'm
going to conclude it just as a reminder
the Microsoft perspective here is really
about augmenting human abilities and
experiences it's really working humans
and machines together as teams and
finally some of the resources are you
finished with that the talks will be all
available I think within a few days next
week to talk so forth
will be available the best is to go to
the Academy satin 2000 60s on the
website of the event pretty much this is
just a short cut open source projects
these are ready for you to embrace
academic services and here I'm
highlighting a few of them I mentioned
cuddle app CN TK we had keynote
yesterday on CN TK please go check it
out of course all the cognitive services
and then manville which katya presented
in this room earlier it's currently so
this is an AI experimentation platform
is very very interesting that's another
one very close to my heart and the with
potential and the future fantastic
project it's in private preview right
now it will be coming to github pretty
soon so check it out and just as a
reminder with the page i showed you on
how to collaborate with our riches
research on microsoft com collaboration
you can get it there and we are actually
built in a specific AI engaged
collection as part of outreach just to
target more like better like some of the
efforts forum for a young and with that
thank you very very much
thank you for such a great presentation
then we have a some very few minutes for
one or two questions please person
in this one question bank hello
Francisco can to take them on the right
so thank you very much for your kind
presentation so it is inspiring a thing
and gives provides the microsoft
research towards artificial intelligence
the question is about the point of view
of Microsoft with respect to challenges
that we still have in the AI field some
of which have imposed by the early
researchers on the 50 sins and the
sixties like Joe McCarthy will establish
the frame problem the frame problem so
how to tell them a change what changes
what doesn't change when there is an
external action within the world I mean
the machine is working out so this is a
difficult problem and however most of
the research that I have heard seen on
these days have to do with small
contributions to do something better on
a specific domains but the previous
presentation was about Jen artificial
general intelligence on which this
problem you know the frame problem I
think it's an important one to face so
could you comment on on this yeah yeah
sure so I think you may be the person
who was the question to cut your earlier
or not so yeah yeah yes exactly i
thought so i thought so so there was a
talk earlier on the malmo platform that
and katya presented this AI
experimentation platform and and so this
very question about how do we deal with
this this different approach that we
haven't heard like during these talks
and by the way I should mention that
what you've seen here is a good subset
of what's happening
soft is not everything represented but
your specific point i think you know i
would invite you as catchy i did earlier
like to maybe start investigating this
approach and looks to me like manville
may be a platform for you two to start
investigating with your students so that
that would be what i what i would
recommend okay
thank you for the talk and also for the
pizza example because I have this
problem we have this problem it's real
life you say your telephone number oh
you are such and such with this address
here in Brazil so and i have a question
concerning the ethics privacy security
what about the dependency of the the
humans dependent the on the on the
software is there also into
consideration because if you withdraw
something that we are currently using or
we are becoming accustomed to that then
we have to learn something different is
that in the in the scenario as well so
for man i can tell you that from an
outreach point of view we are not
looking at that specifically so i guess
is your question about are there studies
around the dependency AI services create
with humans is that the question and not
just ethics so if that's the question as
an icon so from an hourish point of view
we're not looking at that i'm sure some
of our researchers at microsoft research
some of them may be looking at that
because it is not just the I there is
also the augmented the intelligence
concept with you just mentioned and that
once you've met your intelligence with
some kind of ability if this is not
persistent so if you are not aware of
how long this will you will have to
adjust then sometimes you look for for a
start-up or software that you use to to
to use the service then tell you you
don't have that anymore you get
surprised yeah so you know so I cannot
talk for the all the road maps and
everything on my show but usually when I
mean the prod
the Microsoft products they are
maintained there or there is an exit
strategy right so that's on the product
side on the research side it's all about
learning and also sometimes learning
that we should stop doing something so
you know taking a dependency on the
research on the trends yes I mean it's
just you know these are some trade-offs
I mean on the research side of course we
can be more agile and experiment faster
and pick but so it's a trade-off depends
how you want to use the those API so
those services depend for one last
question where we can replace thank you
for your presentation every I I work
with the cognitive architectures okay
and I can see that different people and
different companies they have a
different meaning for the word cognitive
sometimes cognitive means just having a
sensor and actuation sometimes it's a
little bit different thing I like to
understand because you have presented to
us Microsoft has presented to us this
idea of cognitive services but cognitive
means just cognitive services or you
have a bigger vision or a bigger
understanding of what is the meaning of
or cognitive in this artificial
intelligence context I was almost going
to say a Rico come here but I'll answer
your question so I think you're right i
mean cognitive services what you've seen
there are some examples which are ready
to be used but we do have actually we do
have a team at microsoft research which
has been formed a few months ago which
is called the cognition team and r is
exactly i think embracing I mean having
a bigger view and trying to to drive
this vision of what cognate cognition
so so the short answer is I don't think
you should take the message that
Microsoft looks at cognition equals
cognitive services community services
are a powerful example that can be used
directly by researchers to come up with
some new experimentation and
applications but there is definitely a
big effort at Microsoft looking at
cognition much more broadly Thank You
