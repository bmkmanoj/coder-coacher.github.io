hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
so thank you all for coming it's a
project to be here and today we will be
talking about the status of women in
computing in Latin America and what we
can do to change the current scenario at
Microsoft Research we have various
initiatives about fostering the
participation of women in computing and
I work with rain Johnson she actually
needs our worldwide initiatives to
encourage women's participation in the
IT she partners with many organizations
like the National Center for Women in
Technology I aww Anita Borg Institute in
various programs to understand what the
status of women in technology is and to
encourage this participation and here in
Latin America I've been working for
since 2008 during the faculty summit we
organized a workshop and brought
together thought leaders to discuss what
the status is and what we can do to to
change it to drive action in addition to
that i work in projects with researchers
in brazil and climate change
biodiversity bioenergy and which
computing is a very component key
component to accelerate or enable the
research and just to contextualize and
in the u.s. in particular women is and
this is data from two thousand nine
women is fifty-eight percent of the
workforce but when you look at the
computing workforce women represents
only twenty-five percent of the total
workforce and when you look at the more
senior positions at the IT industry than
only eleven percent of the corporate
officer positions at fortune for 500
technology companies are held by women
and this is in the US so what we've been
trying to do is to
Stan what is the status in Latin America
because we feel very strongly that
gender diversity is very important and
and there are a variety of reasons I
could go and talk about why gender
diversity is important but I'm only
going to mention a few because we only
have so much time so gender balanced
teams are more experimental and more
efficient they produce more innovation
and there are several studies proving
this point there is a particular studies
study about patenting that reveals that
patents created by mixed gender teams
are the most highly cited the other
important point is that technology from
your cell areas of knowledge so when we
think about the way we communicate we
collaborate to get work done we learn we
entertain everything technology is a
great piece of it and it actually shapes
how we are doing those things so we are
shaping through technology we're shaping
how society is you know is beauty things
and we feel that it's really important
to have the best possible teams to
create this this technology pieces so we
can we can extend the possibilities we
can enable people to do even more and to
do better the other important point is
that just for the US market and I'm
saying that because I don't have data
for the rest of Latin America but just
for the US market in 2018 we expect to
have nearly 1.4 million new job openings
in IT and we have a pipeline issue in
general but if we don't address half the
talent pool this is going to become a
very serious issues so what's going on
in Latin America since 2008 we've been
working
with thought leaders across the region
to understand what is the status of
women in technology the first step we
did was trying to gather data to
understand what is the women
representation in the IT sector how is
the pipeline and in terms of undergrad
and grad programs in CS and so on and
that was a really challenging youtube
for variety of reasons if you consider a
single country some universities in the
roman forum they don't even have a field
for gender so it's virtually impossible
to get very precise data and when you
think about all the countries together
then the leashes that emerged are even
more even harder to consolidate but we
notice in the several meetings we held
that there was the same trend that we
observe it in the other geographies so
people report that 20 of 30 years ago
they had about forty percent at least of
Women in Technology and now they have
between twenty and ten percent we've
been collaborating with leading
organizations like the National Center
for Women in Technology to discuss best
practices and actions that work it in
other geographies as well and that we
felt that we need to understand what is
appropriate to each of the reasons and
for that and to bring more people into
the discussion and for that last year we
had a group of researchers submitting
pilot projects proposing actions to
address these issues in their in their
geographies and and today they are here
to discuss their pilot projects and
super zent what they proposed so we have
Lorena Gomez from tech Monterey from
Mexico we have Eduardo Freddy Nakamura
from federal university of amazonas in
Brazil and who's at the Betty remembers
from University of Lysander's in
Colombia and all you're going to talk to
you about the projects they proposed so
Lorena please
okay the good afternoon the project that
I'll submit was titled attract and keep
students in information technology
making IT phone and when we're thinking
about the number of female students in
our in our university it's about ten to
fifteen percent and also we found that
every time we have less and less
students in the computer science field
and one thing that we observe is that
drop out in girls is not common at
Monterey tech in particular the female
students were in the top of the ten
percent best students and we can also
hear the needs from the industry and
what they say is that they need more LT
professional doesn't matter the gender
so the projects will increase will try
to increase the number of the students
in computer science both male and female
and we we get more students we were
going to get more females and the other
point important point is that the
students get job offers before
graduation and that's also a problem for
our graduate programs because we want
encourage students to go and study a
master or a PhD but they will prefer go
on our money so that's also a problem
for us and well the idea here is we need
to attract a give students in
information technology in involved
genders and the project proposal had two
parts one is the workshops we propose
some different workshops running and
making video games we connect with
Windows Phone another was magic behind
the screen
and playing with data at the time at the
same time we were trying to do this
workshop we found that these students
and at Monterey Tech had one workshop
that is called mini robotics for kids so
we start observing what result they have
in this project the other part of the
project was to do a with a website or
social site where we have interviews
like a day in the life less of an
engineer IT consultant students
interviews with successful people both
men and women give the students
statistics like today each year the
sovereign alien being the best job and
webinars from successful IT people
especially women and we start with a
minus robotics for kids this is a
project that attracts a for students
that are 10 to 14 year old they have a
session for session during the semester
for our sessions 12 of them and what
they do is design a robot assembly a
rowboat code test and the at the end
they do the same about competition and
the important thing is here the
structure our students students who are
measuring computer science robotics or
electrical engineering and they don't
charge for this um four discourses and
they do these courses in the university
they have like service on the morning
saturdays afternoon fridays and also we
have the incubators at a tech demo today
where they go towards one element junior
high schools and they teach these
students and the final project is the
swimmer bod competition and what they do
during the whole semester they start
learning
to do the program's the logic of about
behind the the using of sensors and
reactions from the robots they designed
the build the objective is that they
have to to win the last day they give
them the box they are very hard at a
sign that they have to assemble the the
robot and they have they have time to to
review the code and test and at the
enter they have a fight and here we have
all the family members coming to the
competition and this is very important
because in this in Mexico parents and
have our own important role in the
decision that these students make
especially girls you know what they tell
you what do you want to study
engineering why don't you study
something more women related so here we
talk to the other moms and we explain to
through the parents the importance and
all the opportunities that the kids on
both boys and girls have in going into
these careers and here it's the end the
end of the competition are like a group
and they have the robots for fighting
and here it's they have all sort of as
more brothers and sisters are big
brothers and big sisters and they have a
lot of fun in this project and finally
they were like six different classrooms
and in each classroom they have one
group the who is the winner and they
went for the final in the final they
have to explain how they build a robot
why they built in that way and what they
learned and at the end they gave the
deal there was a winner for for all of
this some this are some numbers that the
this program at
thing is very successful in started in
two 2007 with only three structures and
12 the students and now they have 120
structures and about three hundred and
eighty students so as we see the numbers
we think this is really a big number of
the increasing of the students who are
interested in in this area so that's why
we want to do this also not only in
robotics but also in programming and
other areas in IT and well I I think I'm
missing one is light what I ask this
world it wasn't sure right but we have
about twenty percent and girls and
eighty percent boys and at the end we
ask them will you study something
related with IT and at the same and at
that time the answer was ninety percent
of the kids said they will study a
career in computer science or related
field and well we hope that is right so
we get these skits in four or five years
and what is the next step we are going
to continue working with the workshops
with the students and involving other
technologies like two screens monitors
we are going to continue to build a
social network site with these students
and we would like to hear also from you
what other ideas you have and also i
have here my email if you have any any
ideas you want to share with us thank
well good afternoon everyone and the
idea here so is to talk about this
proposal we have submitted to microsoft
research to try to bring basically to
bring awareness of this gender issue to
the north region of brazil so the truth
is that in our region we still do not
talk about that a lot so it's all new
for us and we don't have as we discuss
it with you Juliana we don't have enough
data to be assertive in which strategy
will be more effective and things like
that but what we have initially we could
reach some members of our technological
curses basically on computer science
computer engineer information systems
and what we have is for computer
engineering the entrance is about twelve
percent of the people that is getting to
the course are women and the dropout is
four percent for fourteen percent so
fourteen percent of the dropouts are
female computer science things are more
even we have sixteen percent of women
getting into the computer sighs and
sixteen percent of them of the dropouts
are female information systems is a
pretty new course we have in our
Institute and so we still have a few
data about that course but the entrance
level it's it's a little more
interesting its twenty percent of people
looking for that course are women but
they drop out level is still too high
thirty thirty six percent although in
percentage this is a high number well
still have only four women giving up the
course
so why should we we try to do why should
we engage in this gender issue well we
feel looked for the official census in
the north region of Brazil fifty percent
of the population or female so it's it's
very unbalanced we've looked for the
percentage of women in this society and
in computer science or computer related
fields we have only twelve to twenty
percent of women looking for those
careers for those courses and it's
something that it's very interesting
that it's more critical in our region
it's that we have a lot of local job
opportunities we have an injured
industrial park with about 600
enterprises moose event in the
electronics computing and also in
motorcycle fields but I in in all fields
there they all have jobs for computer
scientists for computer related
professions and we have half a million
jobs in that region because of the
industrial park only because of the
industrial park and three business
incubators and the truth is when we look
for their job distribution we don't have
the accurate numbers but what happens is
the high-profile jobs usually are for
mail usually are for men and some of
them are locals from from Manaus and
several of them from other states
several them are from other countries
for instance from Korea from Japan us
and what happens is that most of the low
profile jobs are occupied by females and
all of them from our region local ones
then so I think we should try to move
towards changing that reality and look
for a better balance what this strategy
we we are planning to to have well we as
I said before we need to have
better understanding of the issue in our
region so our history historical aspects
cultural economic or all day all of them
contribute that issuing are different
from other regions in Brazil what are we
planning to do is well we have two
objectives at this moment the first one
is to gather the information to
understand what what's our reality but
while we are doing that I I think we
should try to bring awareness at the
same time so let's bring the discussion
to our community to bring this awareness
to and then the way to do that we are
going to have some speaker series and
what we like to do is to bring not only
women but men also that are aware of
that situation especially from the
region and from the country too and one
thing that that that we it's very clear
for eyes is that women wanted to hear
about what is a what is the life of a
successful women in technology that
perception is different from the main
perception of successful I mean the man
when it gets into the university he
thinks that being successful it's being
rich we have a high profile job and when
he lives he laps the University it's the
same and when I talk to graduate
students female graduate students it's
very clear to me that's the success
successful woman profession it's the one
that has reached their balance between
the job and the family and the social
alive too and so it's a little different
I think we should bring that to our
discussion as well
so our objective to to to have this this
this general lengths landscape out our
region and the gender diversity and try
after we have this clear all clear at
least clear view of the landscape we are
going to try to change it while we're
doing that we will do the speaker series
as well so we plan to do some group meet
meetings every two months to assess the
project status and define the next steps
the speaker series we we are going to be
a reformat someone bring someone to talk
about the issue and in the end of the
year we plan to have a workshop that is
open to the local community academia in
industry to to bring this broader
discussion and I think we can have a
good success lab given that some leading
persons in the region are are women so I
think they will be engaged in this
discussion to what we expect to deliver
is to have this comprehensive report to
to provide the landscape of the gender
issue in the north region and have a
work plan that it's for a long-term
action how we tackle this issue how we
can improve and bring more balance to
the gender distribution in our region
and also to define what would be our
strategy to get financial support for
for that strategy
okay in waiting in Colombia the concern
are more or less the same and I think
what I will I will go faster we are in
the in Bogota the capital of Colombia
and our main concern is to to discover
and understand the reason why the
participation of woman is the
diminishing mmm the society need the
more balanced it and performance teams
in order to produce the design and
deployment of the system that will
change the society only for the context
bovet Isis almost 7 million people city
a and Colombia 46 million our
universities medium-sized top university
research oriented and this is the the
main trends that they want to show you
in general the the population of student
in computing related area in colombia
smaller less 45 50 thousand students and
you can see the the trends of male and
female participation in the Indus talk
of students if I can speak about and
they did the train
he say at the country level is a social
trend of diminishing the participation
of women and happily at the same time
the global amount of students are
growing slightly in the University of
Los Angeles is more dramatic maybe we
are they the leading institution in this
way but is my this is a statistical data
from 2002 now and is my memory 1990 we
had more or less forty-five percent of
women participation in the student in
general in undergraduate and graduate
student and right now in very system
systematic way we find that we arrived
two to twelve percent of office talk and
the fresh student are a little bit less
as eleven percent not the train we we
are very concerned we worked a lot but
the train is more or less the same our
action or not that is successful and for
this reason we are doing some more data
us service trying to understand the
approach in the mood of the kids of 12
14 years old as in Monterey in order to
to understand how to communicate this is
the very broad survey in one open day
that we have in
our engineering school and this is the
daiquiri preference for men with the
main questions and only I won't show
that the difference qualitative
difference between this this expression
of interest of of men and this more
variety of of the preference of woman
without all tight but but I think that
is a qualitative difference and the
general basis our prejudice allowed the
thinking of the kids and we find that
the our expectation was not good enough
and the opinion of the kids are
different that our prejudices professors
m and the main the main result is that
the young people don't know which is the
computing professional are doing in his
professional life or in the this action
in the society maybe the media maybe the
informatics teachers in the high schools
maybe we don't understand we are working
on it but many female is the the very
strong opinion about the lack of
information before to take the decision
for this reason for example the action
as motor race thickness is interesting a
for this reason we are doing a maybe
maybe we have no internet but we are
doing a contest among the students about
to call call for proposal to how to
communicate with the junk people in the
school
don't care the students of the
University of all the discipline a that
will propose us how to communicate with
the young people in more effective way
and this this this is they the contest
is launching try now this week and the
selection of winner will be done in
September 21 with some little cash
prizes but we are waiting for for a good
participation rate and a one of the main
incentive is to to to the commitment of
the institution to go ahead with the
project selected and one of the main
results of this partnership with with
Microsoft Research is the the
institutional commitment with this
initiative of women in computing the
with cash matching funds in order to go
ahead in this in this direction and we
are expecting to to have more commitment
in our alliance with the enterprise in
order to using the good sense of of
world the power of the communication of
the enterprise in the media to the
society the publicity and the general
presence in the media and the social
networks and so on the message in the in
the image of computing in the society we
have there there excuse me a very
interesting tool to go with more power
in the communication to the whole
society
I think that is oh thank you so um I'm
gonna open it up for questions in a
minute but before we do that I'd like to
hear from them is it working yeah I'd
like to ask a couple of questions so I
know as researchers you guys are super
busy managing research projects writing
papers having administrative roles at
your department and so on and yet you
took the time to apply to this call for
projects and you are carrying it out so
I'd like each of you to briefly describe
why is this important to you personally
do you want to start hosing
ah ok ok then my personal concern with
this subject is 10 years old when I was
in another responsibilities and I think
truly deeply that the this is not a
gender issue is a society user issue
because of the person ins and the
orientation of the computing projects in
the next generation need the the
participation of a woman and we should
and we maybe we must work in order to to
try to to arrive to this participation
is my personal position excellent lorina
well I apply because I already was doing
something in the in the area me as a
woman in computer science when I studied
we were many girls in my group and now I
see my students and I only have one or
two and I think there is a lot of
opportunities for both men and women and
I want me because I'm happy what i am
doing i said why don't people want to
come and do the same thing i'm i am
doing so I it is good for the country it
is good for them so that's why I say why
why don't you comment and study the same
area I mean it's got a good opportunity
there are many applications and so
that's why I i applied great advantage
well something that happens as I said in
my brief presentation is that we have so
many possible good jobs in the region
and we are we are not i mean the local
ones not only women but also meant we
are not occupying these positions and
especially women and as a professor as
an educator i like to think that i am an
educator to not only scientists and i
think that we have to match the what the
what we are the demands we have in the
in the market and what we can provide I
mean we must provide a good workforce
for the industry but most of all we also
need to give opportunity to our society
to have a good a good job to have a good
growing in there in the professional
careers so what we see is this very
embarrassed situation in I think that if
we try to discuss that when we put some
effort on that we can change at least
change a little and improve that
balancing in our region two great great
so we've been discussing for an ear now
back and forth about this topic and one
of the things that emerged over and over
is that it's a very challenging topic
right for everybody and and it's likely
that the impact of the project is going
to be limited to our local communities
into a small group of or even to our
local universities and you add we chose
to do that because we believe it is
important if you can say what is your
number one goal in two years or one or
two years from now if you reach at that
goal you feel your project will be
successful what would that be get
started Jose
okay a body the main goal is to reverse
the trend that I show you a not
necessarily have a top results but the
train is very very difficult and the
true goal is to have the commitment of
the industry to work together with the
economy is not a problem of the
university is the problem of the society
and the industry is very very important
stakeholders and we should and we may be
Mouse work together okay larina it's a
budget and budget and action
well I want to see in a few years if all
the kids that answered yes I'm going to
study something related with the
computer we are going to do following up
with these kids and one thing that I
want to mention is that this program is
for three they have three courses and
for robotics robotics one drop at X 2
and 3 and the students who finish the
three courses and now are the
instructors for the new generation so i
wanna i wanna see more students coming
on these on these free weekends they
have and doing something productive I'm
not playing around or doing other things
that we don't like them to do like drugs
and things like that so I would like to
to communicate with these kids and show
all the things that successful IT people
are doing so they have role models and
they can do something similar to that I
think there is a big opportunity for our
country to you to go in that direction
thank you it was for sure the long-term
objective of the long-term goal is to
change that that landscape we have in
the short term I think that our we are
more modest in the sense that what we
want is to bring the awareness what we
want just to bring the discussion to our
community and start very slowly but give
the first step to change that landscape
and when you say that it's because we
strongly believe that when we have this
balance that is gender balance both
genders are
take some benefit from that the truth is
when the environment is balanced we have
women we have a more not women friendly
but more human friendly environment when
I went to the University I in my
electrical engineering course we were 65
people only five of them where women so
i must say that it was not human
friendly i mean when you have only men
and only engineers in the same
environment it's not very pleasant a
place to take time so what what we want
is to really to bring this this
diversity in discussion and give the
first step towards changing this this
landscape and that's a very important
point and recently I was responding a
survey about the question was what is
the benefit that should be given to him
in in in this company to make it a
better place for women and I my response
was we need to give a benefit that is
good for families we need to make it a
better place for families so we can
change the culture otherwise it's not
going to be a good place for people in
general so I absolutely agree so if you
guys we have time for a few questions
from the audience so if you guys have
any questions Claudia do you have any
questions yes do
thank you now it's Julie ok so what
struck me in Eduardo's presentation was
the the difference between your data
about your studies in your region the
northern region and data from the
southeast and south of Brazil especially
in the state of sÃ£o Paulo where recent
studies show that we have almost zero
drop outs in information technology
courses and five to ten percent women as
it and you choose to be forty five
percent so if we have this much
difference in Brazil in different
regions in Brazil I suspect you'd have
the same thing in Mexico and Colombia
and Venezuela in all the other countries
so how can we approach this kind of a
problem with wood for instance with your
robotics experience apply to other areas
in in Mexico or do you think that this
would be a union of a universal
experiment so this is a mixed question a
question to all of you about regional
differences within a country and across
regions and the second specific for
robotics do you think you can I can
import it in in Brazil and Eduardo can
import it and he can import it can we
all import your your experiment to
attract more more kids too IT related
careers
don't wish to appear this this
experimenting in robotics I'd put it
because it started a long time ago and
it has good numbers we don't have the
numbers between boys and girls but I
know there are more boys and girls and
because robotics is more boy I think
however we see girls interested in that
and that what I think it like them is
that they can touch things they can see
things that they produce so moving this
into other areas like prolly video games
or you know now with the touch screen
and all these visualization things that
we can do with with the programs i think
will encourage more the kids to do
something you know not that they are
going only gonna do games or whatever
but we teach them the logic and with
that they can think field is not like
very hard that they can they can do it
they can you know we by doing a small
things we started to teach them the
logic because sometimes i say no i don't
study that it is very difficult it's not
for me i'm not good so we can change
that you you can do it you if you
understand it it like with Matt you know
if you don't like it you are gonna have
a problem with that all your life but if
you explained and if you and understand
the logic it will be very easy for you
so that's a identify oh I think yeah you
know it's a I think we can I don't know
if you have done something with wickets
at this at this age 12 13 years old but
we think that when you because we have
discourses this workshop forum for high
school students but but I time we are
ready to made a decision so it's it's
car so now it's you know you started the
earlier
age and also the thing is that because
they have computers they think they know
everything and they think that using
world is it's a computer science and
it's not like that is you know you have
to do to you have to write the programs
and you still have many things to learn
how's that do you want to take the other
part of the question and add water if
you have comments as well okay they I
think that the main goal of this meeting
is to share the first the concern and
second the possibilities to share our
experience for example in our flesh is
too late in our fresh student course we
we are doing some mobile computing
workshops that the students build a
mobile application that is very very
very fun for for for them and
audio-visual production with some tools
in an immersive way a very different
interaction experience and we are the
last year with did worship with the high
school students but high school students
is too late we we should die i am agree
we should focus it in 12 maybe 12 years
old is too late but life is hard because
the challenges is enormous maybe we
should articulate with the stem stem
efforts the science technology
engineering and mathematics enforcing
the in the basic and medium
education system that I think that we
have this kind of experience almost in
every country and we find some a common
activity that we can do we call because
the scale is enormous tits not only for
for our environment and our preferred
high school maybe we can the power to go
there but for the societies is a huge
Cuba challenge do you wanna commented
one yeah yeah I think it cloture one
thing that happens is that because
Brazil is so big so large what we have
actually is that our culture in the
north is a little different from the
south from the southeast and so on and I
think that there are some approaches
that that can work for instance this
workshop day I it's something that might
work even in our region because we are
given the opportunity to people to know
that that that specific field and see if
they like but what we have to do is to
respect that those cultural differences
so there are some strategies that would
be better for us and won't work for
foreign funds out by and so in vice
versa one thing that's very very clear
to me i don't know if it's universal if
it's brazil wise or only the north
region but it's that it's as usual gonna
talk we have to focus on the family
aspect i mean in the past in the past in
brazil at least the man had to do all
the job and all the money think and the
women women were responsible for raising
the kids and so on well i'm saying is
that i don't want to be that successful
guide because i love to spend time with
my kids
I want to share that responsibility with
my wife she has to be also successful in
her job so I can't spare spend more time
with my kids and I think that one thing
that we should focus on is trying to to
show man how good is to to partake in
family ensure women that we share those
responsibilities we are going through to
have a good time and just to comment as
well we've been doing this for about six
two thousand eight and we try to collect
data exactly with the goal to understand
what is the picture we have a snapshot
of how what is the status of women in
technology within the region and in each
country how its distributed so on and
that was proof that was super challenge
and you participated in this effort a
lot with me and and you've been doing
something really cool which is the with
workshop at the Brazilian Society
computing society conference which I
think build awareness but why we decided
last year and what that was one of the
reasons to invite as well is that we
need to start building awareness where
you know where people didn't start
talking about the topic yet because if
we bring awareness like maybe people are
going to take ownership and do something
like there is a great group of girls at
UNICAMP and they run the program
themselves they go like the girls from
the vanilla testoni electrical
engineering so they actually invited me
as a speaker they invited you as a
speaker and they invite a bunch of
people so they took ownership and they
do it themselves I feel that's more
scalable and that's more appropriate
because they they find what is
appropriate to their regions we've been
talking when when we invited MC wit to
many of our meetings to discuss best
practices like mentoring I feel strongly
about mentoring as a very powerful tool
but that's not part of our culture it's
not something that we typically do I
feel like it's important to address the
undergrad as much as it is important to
attract new talent because we lose to
and as much as we miss new talent to you
know to to come into to computing so
women leave the industry at twice the
rate as men that's a very big deal so I
think you know having this type you did
you I lost track because it distracted
me it's okay so anyways yeah it's just
controlling time for me on my behalf so
thank you so but I feel it sister I feel
like what is appropriate in each of the
locations and in each of the programs is
something that the people internally
have more the ability to the side then
we can do broadly with a recommendation
so that was it so as Claudia told me we
should wrap up thanks for keeping track
of the time and thank you all for coming
and and I hope you continue this
discussion in each of your region so
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
