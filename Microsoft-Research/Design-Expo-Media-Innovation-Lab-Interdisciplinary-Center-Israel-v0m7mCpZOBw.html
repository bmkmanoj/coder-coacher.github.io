you
stuff we have tilted a game device that
helps kids to improve physical and
balance issues and it is going to
presented by the media innovation lab
part of the interdisciplinary center
based in Israel okay hello welcome
everyone Shalom like we say in my
country this is a day my name is tally
we're from the media innovation lab in
Israel and we are part of a team of
computer science students interactive
communication and psychology and today
we'd like to talk to you to talk to you
about tilted but first let me introduce
you to offic he's my nephew he's six
years old and offer has balance
difficulty and we know that because last
year my sister noticed that he doesn't
quite play outdoors quite as much as his
friends and we noted and we know that
the recommended treatment we now know
the recommended treatment is a weekly
meeting with a professional physical
therapist one in six kids suffers from
balance difficulties in the United
States alone it comes up to over two
million children these kids usually meet
with a professional physical therapist
once a week but they're still lacking a
more frequent home based practice
opportunity so this is the void we
wanted to fill and this is why we
created tilt it tilt it is a physical
digital game platform in tenant to
motivate children to engage in balance
based games a tilted empowers a the
physical therapy process as well as the
children by adding fun thrill and in
dependency to the practice during our
process we met with a lot of experts and
a lot of physical therapist we learned a
lot from them regarding balance
difficulties and but it was really
important to us to work with children so
we've done a lot of use of testing
for our first prototype was a commercial
balance board that we put put together a
real quick music based game just to get
initial proof-of-concept after that we
developed a the excuse me after that we
develop the classic snake game on a
mobile phone the snake game is very
simple the user just controls the snake
in order to earn a get the dots and earn
points the phone goes inside a wobble
board the balance board we discussed
with physical therapists all along and
they told us that in order to work on
the child's balance his gaze should be
up and forward so the next step was to
raise the game in in front of the child
on a big screen so tilted is actually a
new input device a new game controller
and that is why we see tilt it is a new
platform for lots of various fun games
and in the future these games will come
as a set of apps for Smart TVs now I
want to show you a quick video we show
during a user testing with effect Ali's
sweetest nephew and I wanted you to pay
attention to the way off it controls the
snake and collect apples two end points
missing sound so pay attention to how he
moves his leg and his feet and the snake
react to his movements and that is how
he collects the dots and earns more
points so now let's talk about how to
use it works the main components of the
system are the familiar balance board
which includes a smartphone-based
accelerometer and the software game
application the sensor tracks and
transmits real-time board movements via
Wi-Fi to the computer the child stands
on the tilted and controls the game by
shifting balance as you can see in order
to protect the smartphone we built a
cover for the balance board which is
made out of layers of wood that we cut
in our laser cutter in our lab in Israel
just here you can see the pictures from
the process and one of the most
important things about you today is the
tilted is designed to capture meaningful
data a weekly output is emailed to both
parent and therapist this data enables
the therapist to personalize a weekly
therapy plan and allows the parent to
easily track his child's progress this
data is based on a few measurements the
first one is the total weekly practice
time the second one is the weekly
stability score and the last one is the
game performance for evaluation of game
performance we devised a new measurement
criteria called the tilted control score
this core factors both average weekly
game length and average weekly time
between apples which means the object
collecting intervals these two together
represent the child's control of the
game so when you have a higher weekly
tilted control score it means you have
better balance ability
and there's also an option to see more
detailed data and to see the child's
progress over time over the weeks as you
can see here with different measurements
we envision how the database generated
from tilty to users worldwide can yield
new knowledge for a better understanding
of the balance physical therapy
processes and we also think that this
new knowledge can contribute to the
diagnosis of f balance difficulties all
over the world and now for dessert we
want to show you a live demo here on the
stage of tilted I would like to invite
me to the stage is one of our developers
come eat them so a meat just turned on
the smartphone inside the balance board
and when stepped on it this is the you
just saw a short video and showing the
child how to step on it so it would be
safe and easy and now I don't know if
you can see but a meeting shifting her
her balance left right forward and
backwards in order to control the snake
eat eat the apples and more and earn
more points at that time we also measure
the time she's playing the length of the
game and we use all the information we
gather in order to create the data i do
just showed you looks fun right so we we
invite all of you to come and check it
out and try it on your own at the the
devil's in the demo fest and we're
really excited that you're all can play
and that's it thank you very much
awesome job thank you all right I like
to start us off for ok so the best in my
opinion the best presentation is the one
where you have the judges want to come
up and try it mom so I'm gonna walk up
and I just stand on it well yeah yeah my
car because it's that's the best so so
just put your right feet down all the
way until you feel safe and marine heels
everybody and then right here on earth
ok now you can shift right left whatever
way you want so I'm a mother with two
children mm-hmm and they don't have
balance issues but they love video games
and this all of a sudden was like aha
this is an input device to get them to
exercise and balance so I was thrilled
the mom and me was thrilled the mom and
me also questioned if this is an input
device have you thought about other
applications so for example the best I
could come up with was sitting there was
could I actually be like folding laundry
fine by directing this like is there
some kind I mean as an input device it's
fabulous and I could be getting my
exercise and getting housework done
which I hate to do but that's totally
off topic but I think there's as an
input device it's a very fascinating
interesting example it's really do need
it do you need a hand um I guess it
could be any device for for more
activities actually we haven't put much
thought into folding laundry but yeah
like you said it's a lot of fun you can
do a lot of stuff while doing it when we
were all having like meetings with the
five of us a usually one of us would
have stand on it just because it's so
fun and it's it keeps your legs busy
while you're talking it and it actually
can help you concentrate better yeah so
thank you anyone else it's yeah anyone
else ladies
so I've both been a patient on balance
boards before and I've worked with
occupational therapists using them
before so I always enjoy them and one of
the things that struck me about what you
did is it's it's a very nice design
because it doesn't have to involve
specialized Hardware I can just put my
own phone that on there and do it I
guess my question for you is about the
therapists you worked with and their
opinions we didn't hear much about that
I know from my own experience with
therapists that one of the things they
like to do or they have to do in working
with patients is improvised around the
patient's interests did you provide did
you get that feedback from your own
therapist and did you provide a way for
them to improvise the platform around
their patients interests yes so we met
with a few physical therapists and heard
their opinions we've actually been in a
physical therapy sessions with children
that have balance difficulties and we
noticed that the physical therapist has
a lot of different exercises with a lot
of different machinery and at first we
had a little dilemma which which machine
we want to choose so we see tilted as a
just a way to keep the child motivated
to play at home because you know kids
today play with their iPads and on their
computers and the xbox and they just
come home after school sit on their sits
on the couch play with something and
they're not staying very active and kids
that have balance difficulties prefer to
stay still and play something that
doesn't require much out of them so when
they play a physical game that also has
some mental intervention they're not
thinking about the physical activity and
also our vision is to have multiple
games from various fields you can have
let's say like a motorcycle or slide or
different games with different themes so
the therapist can tell the child okay
today you should play ten minutes on the
schema ski on the ski game then five
minutes on the spaceship and you know
just a so it
be appropriate to the child's you know
their interest does that answer that so
quickly because of time the first I love
the fact that you accelerated your
implementation by just putting together
existing resources with a minimum amount
of glue so you could focus on the real
problem and and so the and and and also
congratulations for bringing it so it
worked and having the courage to
demonstrate it so so because it makes it
makes it real something now the question
is you what I'm curious about if you
could talk just briefly you showed the
slides the daily reflecting were those
with those mock-ups or were those actual
screenshots and how far is your
implementation on that and have you you
don't have to have done this but have
you actually got enough data so far or
is it still too early and if it's too
early do you have plans to continue so
just give me a snapshot of where you are
on this because it has a future so the
data you saw is a basically a mock-up
we're still working to figure out
figuring out the algorithm of how to
really process all this data that we're
collecting and but we're sorry but we're
not so far away from it and and last the
word I'm sorry and we're not so far away
from it and basically you can there's
still work to be done and we have
children and using it and we're actually
our psychology student is going to do
his final paper for the for his to get
his degree on the tilted and he has to
do user testing with children so he's
going to spend the summer testing it
with children and by then I assume we're
going to have enough data to really
calculate and see an improvement or real
graphs thank you it's great that's got a
future that means the idea head lakes
thank you thank you for you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
