hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
any mortal words of Monty Python and now
for something completely different I am
sierra madre I'm from wha calm and yes I
am indeed a technology evangelist it
even says that on my business card and
i'm here to talk today about the future
of digital ink where are we going and
how are we going to get there but first
i have a couple of confessions yeah are
you not getting me first i have a couple
of confessions one is that I am a tech
geek I am NOT a researcher I'm not an
instructor and my background is in
specifically technology and in pins I am
thrilled to be here a twifty because I
remember when the announcement went out
for the very first whiff tea at Purdue
University back when it still only had
one tea and I so wanted to go and I had
absolutely no excuse to be there ain't
Phylly years later I now have an excuse
to be here and understand what your
experiences are and how we at whatcom
can help I am a long term devoted pen
enthusiast I am however despite working
at wacom not an artist and I say that
emphatically about the best i can do is
in fact a smiley face and here we will
show now go back will show the extent of
my artistic capability pen
there we go and there's more I can turn
this into a son there we go those of you
in elementary school teaching probably
recognize this quite well that's as far
as I go but thankfully that's not all
that a tablet pc can do I came to
tablets from a completely different
route not art I came because I had
repetitive stress injuries in my right
forearm from way too much mousing and I
had been through through physical
therapy two times in three years I knew
what the next step was and it involved a
knife I was not happy about that option
so I went looking and discovered the
very first tablet PCs and i discovered
the acer c110 this was about two
thousand three i got one in the off
chance it might help with my RSI but
what I didn't expect was to discover
creativity to discover a way to think
differently about everything that I was
doing during the course of the day I
worked at Intel I ran a hardware
validation lab this was not a an area
where I expected to have creative
thought but when I got that tablet my
hands suddenly I was thinking
differently over time that ended up
leading me to the motherland and now I
am a technology evangelist at welcome
and i'm at the motherland which has been
a fabulous opportunity for me we at walk
um believe that creativity is the future
of the world we believe that creativity
will change the world we create things
all day long every single day and we
the opportunity to be more creative
great art culture world's changing
thoughts and ideas new technologies new
business ideas these all come from human
creativity creativity is what makes us
human it it brings us alive it adds
richness to our lives it brings ideas
imagination beauty and at welcome we
believe in a world alive with creativity
that's our vision that is the corporate
founding vision a world alive with
creativity creativity in each of us
makes this world a better place it
allows us to freely explore and create
new ideas and express them in a way that
creates an enjoyable life now you may
notice in this two words that are
obviously missing pen and ink that's
because ink is not the only way to be
creative creativity doesn't just mean
ink or art or great painting remember my
smiley face creativity is in all of us
creativity is looking for new thoughts
and new ideas new ways of thinking we
look at creating the future of digital
ink and it's important to remember that
creativity is for everyone it's not just
for artists walk home has built a
business on digital creativity in
primarily an artistic space and one of
the things that we're really striving to
do is make sure that we understand that
creativity is for everyone art or
science math or music it's for everyone
and creativity should not be held back
by technical restrictions this is
something that we've heard many times
for many of the speakers here
particularly those who are talking about
mathematics and science instruction the
keyboard is not the ideal input device
for most things and unfortunately it's
become the input device that most people
use for most things we believe that
creativity needs freedom freedom of the
mind freedom of thought we've heard
studies here at Whitby particularly from
Pam Muller that show that notes that are
written with the pen are more effective
for learning the notes that are typed if
we want a world alive with creativity we
need to understand that the technical
limitations of keyboard and mouse are
holding us back we need ink ink helps us
to capture and share any kind of code
ink connects us whether you're capturing
handwriting music notation math
symbology or East Asian language
symbology like we heard yesterday and
Paul's talk ink is the medium of
expression ink makes thoughts permanent
we need a universal tool that breaks
through the boundaries we need digital
ink so what is the future of digital
link collaborative International
ubiquitous creative and walk on is
enabling this creative future through a
host of hardware technologies that most
of you are familiar with but also
software technologies particularly will
the Wacom ink layer language its ink for
the 21st century delivered through the
will platform now most of you have
probably not heard of will so I'm going
to be giving you a few examples and then
at the end you get to see a demo so
you'll actually get to see will ink in
action will is a cross-platform
Universal ink system
and I do mean cross-platform whether
you're running on iOS html5 android
doesn't matter all of those are
supported by will you can capture
thoughts and ideas create notes and
memos share and collaborate all of this
can happen regardless of the hardware
regardless of the OS regardless even of
the pin or finger touch technology you
can view and organize this will allows
you to seamlessly exchange that data
regardless of through cloud platform and
services the idea sharing and
collaboration becomes even more free
more independent people can really focus
on ideas and creativity without being
limited by how they share those ideas
with others around the world this
creative collaboration and idea
development takes place in a completely
new way in the digital world you can we
are looking to build a world of ink
users yes that includes Namibia
supporting your creativity anytime
anywhere regardless of your device so
looking a little bit more in depth
because I know there are some of you
because I've had conversations with you
some of you are software developers some
of you will actually be able to use will
directly in your applications to more
seamlessly and straightforward add ink
to any application so looking at what
ink what will is it allows pen feature
AP is that attached to the hardware and
it has ink processing api's that allow
you to talk to software so it is the
bridge between the two regardless of
which you need to communicate with what
your what your hardware is what your
software is try
to do will can enable that and this is
good for hardware researchers software
researchers and it's very simple to
implement implement and it allows the
diversity of input methods we are a
twifty which includes both pen and touch
so regardless of whether your input
method is a pen or a finger you need to
get the same sort of digital fidelity of
that ink input and this digital fidelity
is preserved through will will allows
you to actually capture that same
beautiful natural ink regardless of the
input method these key elements
Universal pen API which by the way I
want to actually I want to talk a little
bit about universal pen ATM because I've
talked to a number of you over the
course of the past couple of days about
pens actual pens which pins you like
which pins you don't like the universal
pen API in will allows you to actually
choose your pens and have a breadth of
opportunity for different types of pens
whether you like a heavy pen or a light
pen or a short pen or a long pen this is
there's the opportunity here for pens to
be developed that fit your needs we also
have an ink data format that allows the
ink to be shared from application to
application and then finally the ink
Engine SDK which allows the capturing
and visualization we have a very high
quality ink rendering engine that's a
part of will so the ink that is rendered
on screen looks and feels exactly like
yours i know many of you probably use
the signature test when you're trying
out a new tablet because there's a
certain amount of muscle memory that
happens when you sign your own name
and if it doesn't feel or look the way
you expect you know there's just
something a little off you may not know
what it is but you know there's
something not quite right there well
with with will it renders and looks
exactly the way you think it should will
also has benefits for the end-users the
ink sharing is something that people
really enjoy the opportunity to share
digital ink I mean as as you've seen in
several of the presentations
particularly around one note with
teachers and students being able to
share Inc back and forth that kind of
collaboration at an ink level is
something that should be able to happen
across platforms and across applications
it's smarting with personalization of
the data there's more than just co
ordinance and pressure we include
metadata in will that can allow you to
do things like understand the stroke
velocity understand which pen it is all
walk on pins include a pen ID by default
they always have you just never knew
about it in the past but now with ten
IDs you can actually tell who wrote that
particular stroke of ink what pen did it
come from so there's a wealth of
metadata that's actually collected and
available to you when you're developing
using the will SDK and then finally the
natural ink from the users perspective
this one's probably one of the most
important it's the conversion of that
ink data to what they see and what they
feel because if the ink is lagging
behind the pen it doesn't feel right if
the strokes just don't seem to match
what you're expecting if it looks all
jaggi that's not going to feel right and
it reduces adoption rates of digital pen
we've overcome that
again the natural ink feeling is feeling
like its regular ink pen writing on a
regular piece of paper and fundamentally
for a lot of people particularly if
you're talking to older people who are
more comfortable and more familiar with
writing with pen on paper having that
natural feeling actually helps to
overcome some of the mental objections
because it starts feeling more natural
it starts feeling more like well like
they're accustomed to and those feelings
are the kinds of things that get them
adopting new technology when you can
overcome those mental objections smooth
capturing the high performance data
smoothing ink data and then the natural
rendering which again gets back to the
people who really want it to look like
their handwriting I mean I have tried
I've really tried to write with a stylus
on an iPad and while I can do it it
never looks like my handwriting it never
feels like me ink and pen is a very
personal feeling it's a very almost
intimate feeling that you get with your
own association with your own
handwriting and we want people to
experience that we don't want there to
be any barriers technology barriers to
them feeling that digital ink is
providing them everything that they come
to expect from a pen on a piece of paper
and all of this is of course browser and
cloud ready now the back end of this is
also enabled by Wacom cloud which I
don't actually have a slide here on
welcome cloud but I do want to mention
it because we'll in the cloud work
together quite well now you are
perfectly free to develop and use your
own cloud solution you're also welcome
and free to use the wok own cloud
solution welcome cloud allows ink
sharing stream
straightforward seamlessly and allows
people to share Inc in a way that it
just feels like someone gave you a piece
of paper and accept it just showed up on
your screen instead so the Welcome cloud
is enabled back in the backend behind
will now that was a bit of technical
technology data on will specifically but
it all comes back to welcomes vision of
what we're doing with will we want will
to become a global standard and we want
people to enjoy Inc that's as natural as
handwriting on paper and if that happens
this could be the stationery store of
the future where you're going in and
you're choosing the digital pen not the
big pin off of the rack and you're
choosing the one that's the color and
weight and size and shape that you most
prefer heck maybe you have a whole
handful of pens because you have
different pens you want to use for
different applications this could be the
the stationery store of the future the
fundamentally will is a platform it's
not a product it's not just something
for waka and it's not something
exclusive to walk them it's not
proprietary will is a movement it's not
a project our intent is not owning we
want to share this technology it's open
for anyone to use and since people were
probably wondering it's open for you to
use freely and by that I do mean freely
we are starting this journey it's a long
term commitment and we're inviting
everyone to join us on this journey
because we think everyone can benefit
from it anyone can use and create ideas
that make this world a better place so
we're inviting you to join
that journey now I left the demo for the
end in part because I have to attach
another system to the projector so this
will take just one second because I want
you to be able to see what will can do
and see a collaboration demo that I have
set up I also need two volunteers who
know how to use a pen on a tablet is
there anyone in here that knows how to
use a pen on a tablet for those of you
have you have not been projecting at
some point during the course of this
event they have a truly remarkable
number of options okay now two
volunteers okay you get that one you get
this one yes and as you start writing
what you're going to see is that this is
a completely web-based collaborative
demo i have attached this system up here
which there we go i've attached this
system up here simply so that you can
see it projected both of them are
attached to the same application that is
enabled by will and it's running through
the walk on cloud server which is i
don't know somewhere in europe and this
is real-time instantaneous collaboration
now i'm sure based off the smiles on
some of your faces but you can see
immediate ideas for how something like
this could be useful
with real-time collaboration with the
ideas that will are supporting this is
just one way that will can enable people
to come together and share their
creativity there are many other ways
that we doubtless have not thought of
and that's why we're doing why we
created will why we want you to join us
on this journey because yes and it
doesn't support full pressure
sensitivity is as hero is discovering
here so all of the things that you
expect out of 10 all the things you
expect out of ink all of this is enabled
simply quickly easily think of the
opportunities for you in your
applications in your environments and if
you're not someone who is a software
developer but you have great ideas
please let me know because welcome sees
this as a partnership and we want to
make the world a more creative place
together we can do it
thank you very much Sarah and I guess
we'll start with the blue shirt I think
you hide random first time or just a
blank no they're seeing exactly what you
see here it's mirrored across all
devices so so what's the state of play
is this is this pretty for people to use
okay beta it is ready for people to use
it is available for download off of the
Welcome website if you go to will whoa
calm calm and yeah it's it's freely
available and it's available today so if
you have ideas on how to use it go to
the website get it downloaded yeah how
is the live time when they actually make
a stroke it appears it's real time I it
is imperceptible to human I obviously
everything's measurable with a machine
level but when someone's writing and
looking at it barring network glitches
obviously on it looks you see it
appearing there exactly as your as
you're writing it so it is a real-time
collaboration when using you you can
download it right now is that
downloading like an API set bacon your
app so the process on the process of
beginning to use will if you go to will
become calm there is an evaluation
agreement you have to sign but once
you've done that there is a download
bundle that includes the documentation
as well as the SDKs you can download it
for the three you know for iOS Android
html5 and so you can get whichever
platforms are appropriate for your
particular application
right now the the primary live
application that you can go look at is
walk-ons bamboo paper that one's live
that one uses will on the back end there
are other applications that are going to
be coming out but we don't pre-release
pre-announce other people's products
yeah his paper available on all
platforms are strictly the iOS um its
iOS Android and Windows yeah we do have
windows available as well yeah now i
will i will admit that the feature set
is not for bamboo paper is not the same
across all three OS is right now because
iOS and Android came along first yeah
yeah if you double tap it it clears the
screen yeah yes yeah and they're
discovering hear that because there
these two are using samsung devices that
are touch as well as pen enabled that
the same thing happens with the finger
that happens with the pen it is not the
same SDK and the other one is a legacy
SDK that works exclusively with welcome
products the new SDK is cross-platform
it's cross pen and touch technology so
it's far more adaptable than the older
SDK in terms of the upgrade path
honestly I don't know yeah I haven't had
that question before so I don't know the
answer
whatever whatever the there is nothing
in the SDK that limits that so you're
going to run into device limitations so
whatever the device allows you for input
so some devices how allow voltage over
others don't so that's going to be
dependent on the device that's a really
good we're some of the things that
vision educators or some things that you
would educate would use with well or
some things that you envision will would
be used from educators for me my ideas
because as I as I disclaimed at the very
beginning I am NOT a researcher and I'm
not an instructor so when I was thinking
about it it really came down to ideas
around collaboration and whether that
collaboration is instructor to student
student to instructor or if it's
instructor to instructor for people
trying to collaborate sharing ideas on
instructional technology or
instructional methods in the classroom
it really comes down to the idea of
sharing I mean I spend an awful lot of
time talking about creativity and the
idea that creativity is a large in large
part it's about great ideas and great
ideas are formed stronger better and
faster when we're working with other
people so when I look at this in the
education space it comes down to the
idea of collaborating Inc has been
traditionally a very solo kind of thing
I I write on a piece of paper in my
notebook and it's mine I'm a show you my
notebook but then I take it back again
and you don't have it anymore if
we have the idea of digital link and
being able to collaborate and share that
ink then it's allowing our ideas to go
further and allowing other two people to
build on those ideas I mean if you think
about a lot a lot of the demos and
things that we've talked about that walk
um has talked about in the past have
been in more of a business setting where
people you know in in an office and the
u.s. is are collaborating with an office
in Europe something like that but it
could be just as easily someone at a
university in Southern California
collaborating with instructors who are
in Namibia then doing that with digital
link without the restrictions that we
have right now around the keyboard and
around the different types of input
methods we have at this point depending
on the applications that are built that
ink can be transient for the lifespan of
that particular application on cycle or
it can be saved and shared and added to
later all of this is also one of the
things I didn't mention is because of
the metadata that comes along with the
ink and will there are also timestamps
on every it's not even pixels but every
instance basically of every point along
as you're drawing so you can actually go
back and replay the ink as you're going
along so if if this app supported it
which we didn't build it in for this
demo but I'd be able to go back and
replay everything that these two have
been drawing and writing now if you
combine that with the audio recording
for instance that can be very powerful
way to share new information without any
limitations
one thing I was thinking about with the
10 ID or something one of the things
that become a discussion at least in a
nominal sense is the teachers
annotations locking those from kids
erasing it uh-huh so that you know you
could walk with just so there's some way
to ID that yes and say sorry kids you
can't erase that would be really cool
and there is from the technology
standpoint what you're describing there
is perfectly capable you could have the
idea of the instructors pen or pens and
basically say no one can erase this ink
but they can erase their own ink or the
other students inks so there's there are
capabilities within the the applications
that will supports that would allow you
to do things like that you could do it
so that they can only erase their own
ink you could do it so they could erase
anybody Bank yours whatever and you
could make it so that you can erase
anyone's ink but they can't so all of
those capabilities are controllable
within the SDK other questions
no sadly no although it's been something
that we've certainly had a lot of
requests for so it's something we're
looking into at least because obviously
this is a very simple application we
actually created this for the consumer
electronics show in january and so it's
this is something that was for demo
purposes but when people see this
there's that aha moment and i'm sure
most of you have seen this where you're
talking to someone trying to explain the
benefits of pen digital pen and they're
staring at you blankly and then you
finally say something and they get that
aha that's why you use this thing and
one of the things we've discovered with
this collaboration demo is it gives
people the aha moment for digital ink
and for will so that's something that
it's very easy to understand for most
people any other questions I will be
here all through the evening on the
cruise as well and all day tomorrow so
if you have questions that come up at
some point feel free to find me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
