urban informatics with Microsoft Azure I
would like to turn today's event over to
Tim pan Tim you now have the floor Thank
You Stephanie good afternoon or good
morning or good evening to other part of
the world will come to the Microsoft
Asian webinar series my name is Tim pen
I'm the University Relations Director
for Microsoft Research asia-based in
Beijing today's topic is accelerating
urban informatics with Microsoft Asia
which concerns how to use cloud
computing to advance the research on
urban problems probably most of us are
aware of urban problems especially those
living in Beijing and Shanghai including
all the speakers today in April The
Economist that has a special report on
the cities that will change the world
which discusses the challenges and
opportunities of the faster growing
cities in China it appoints out that in
past 30 years Chinese urban population
has reason 500 million Gaza phenomenon
never seen in the human history and it's
not the end the Chinese city population
is still growing by 2030 1 billion
people over seventy percent of Chinese
will be living in cities so no matter
how fast the Chinese government
developed infrastructure is never enough
there's always traffic jam and overly
crowded public space growing urban
population also causes other
environmental problems such as air and
water pollution noise and over
consumption of energy however in Chinese
we like to say when there is a crisis
there's opportunity
if we manage urban problems will like
the economy success we will change the
world to example by 2020 we expect the
high-speed rail connecting all Chinese
cities with more than a half million
people that means around 1 billion
people will be connected by a network of
high-speed rail and we have never seen
that level of convenience in human
history along the thought we hope more
open problems can be solved and more
opportunities can be found so Microsoft
Research Asia collaborates with academia
working on various projects the purpose
is to accelerate urban informatics
research with the power of Microsoft
Azure starting from last year we have
requested for proposals addressing
critical urban challenges and receive
the many in the areas like urban
transportation noise pollution energy
consumption smart community or buildings
urban lifestyles and the social
happiness most of the project use cloud
to collect and or analyze the big data
of the big cities we hope a research
community can be fostered so the school
of urban sizes can continue and prosper
with a joint effort we hope our cities
will be more livable in years to come in
the meantime Microsoft Research is
running a program called Asia for
research which provides free cloud
resources to academia if a professor has
a research idea and wants to try cloud
computing he or she can go to the
website Asia for research com submitting
a free page proposal to the RP then
there is a chance to win a sizable cloud
resource for a year in addition to RP
you can also find a workshop in a
training evil
dear now in this webinar we have invited
to distinguish the speakers one is my
colleague but that you done he's a
leader researcher of microsoft research
in asia the talk he was shared with us
his advances of urban computing in
Microsoft Research Asia the second
speaker is professor yet min Joo hissing
associate professor from shanghai
jiaotong university he wants to share
with us his research project
crowdsourcing based urban noise mapping
with smartphones this project is a
winner of both urban informatics RP &amp;amp;
edger for research RP nowadays welcome
the first speaker fact that you turn e
you have the mic thank you for
introduction ok so I'm used for
Microsoft Azure are working on urban
computing as we know the rapid progress
of urbanization has modernized many
people's life but also generated an
all-out problem such as traffic
congestion energy consumption and
environmental pollution traveling these
challengers years ago seems nearly
impossible given the complex setting of
a city originally the ones is in sensing
technology and a large scale large
sphere in computing infrastructure has
generated a variety of big data from
social medium to travel floor from
geographic data to mineralogy data so if
is crackly the data can help us taro
these challenges we are facing in cities
motivated by this opportunity we came up
with a region on urban community which
connects urban sensing urban data
management urban data and addicts and
service providing into a loop for
continuous and unobtrusive improvement
on people's life CD operating system and
environment in short we're going to
tackle
challenger in big city by using big data
so in the forum slice I will show you
what kind of big data we are using in
urban computing the first one is a real
nail data so this map shows Beijing
register network well the red line
stands for the highway connecting
Beijing to other cities the blue circle
means the window of Beijing having the
data of consecutive years we can sense
how the city is expanding the second
data is the point of interest data how
each point of interest has a name
address a category and location
information so for example this map
shows the distribution of oil sitter and
parks in Beijing wear a yellow point
stands for a movie theater and blue
point means apart as we can say that
Hans of Harbin Beijing which means
business or a fun city so having the
data of consecutive years we can sense
how the business of city was growing or
is changing over years for instance the
number of movie theaters keeps on
increasing in past five years are rich
in 260 within the urban area so this
could implies more than what people
would like to watch a movie a movie
theater instead of buying DVD air
quality data which usually classified
into some category like good moderate
and a heresy it's very learning into
people's ears and this data is also
we're ready to meet your logic data such
as weather humidity temperature etc are
checking data is not kind of human
mobility in city as we know well people
have been to a place so this figure
shows the check-in data in Manhattan on
two categories why is entertainment
another nap
live sports so this is a citywide human
memory data last but not least is a GPS
trajectory data set generated by over
30,000 text gap in Beijing this is a
visualization of the three months data
well the lighter the denser the data
turns out not only traffic pattern on
your surface but also the citywide human
mobility Adam because we know well
people get on taxi and get off a taxi
using these data sets we have been able
a series of technical work from finding
the practically fastest paths based on
large-scale taxicab trajectories to
clean the pro Matic design in your
cities or network and to identify the
function regional city last year we have
three new results about large-scale
dynamic ride sharing among tax caps and
air quality and real-time gas
consumption sensing a city so i will
give you a sir example in my following
presentation the first one is about air
quality air pollution our global concern
especially in developing countries like
China many cities have viewed on the
ground air quality monitoring station to
inform their citizens here urban air
quality every hour however the number of
air quality modernization are quite
limited because Beauty such kind of
station is very expensive in terms of
marny land use and human resource
unfortunately air quality were roused by
location significantly and is highly
skewing city for example this is a map
of Beijing which I can't stands for one
air quality monitoring station the
number associated with each I can means
air calling the index the smaller the
better the bigger the worse Koreans were
good and
red means I'm heresy as we can see even
at same moment the air quality rating
from these stations could be very
different even if some of station are
very close to each other it's not
surprising to say this phenomena as air
quality is influenced by Marvel complex
factors such as traffic floor land-use
density of structure of buildings and
the fan great meteorology meteorology
the vector could be very different in
different place of city now the problem
is we don't really know the air quality
of a location without a monitor Asian
station so for example was the air
quality low overall carbon locations so
it's not a average number of the stage
of the radium from the existing stations
so what are we to hear it we're in for
real tab and fan korean air quality
information through our intensity using
two part of big data the first one is a
real-time and historic air quality data
from existing stations the second part
of five additional data source will
observe in city first one it could be a
meteorology data such as Windies sunny
or temperature humidity deck structure
traffic data human mobility that is the
number of people move into location
Olivia location you get given time slot
or point of entry data such as how many
parks the number of restaurant shopping
more batteries in your region and the
structure of real network such as number
of intersections traffic lights and some
highways using data mining and the
machine learning algorithm we can view a
network between the data we observed in
your location and the air quality of the
vacation so in the future given the data
of the location we can infer its air
quality so this is a whole range of data
we have and this is what we can improve
so having such kind of fan green air
quality data we can inform people's
decision-making
for example are when and where good
jogging and when to close a window it
could be very different from the average
number of tower city and also this is
stabbed towards at any file so what's
identify the root cause of air
pollutions before we identified over
cost because of revolutions we need to
know where is always polluted so this
system is built our personal free moment
that can ask crowd with clan where
clouds continues connecting data to
collect data and process data and to
serve users with real-time service and
user can access real-time information by
using either mobile client or a web
service so you can search for urban air
in Microsoft our App Store or access the
website through that URL is public
available so we have evaluated our
service are wasted data from 10 cities 3
whether the accuracy of our result we
intentionally remove one station from
existing map and we can infer the air
quality of the location using our
everything then we can measure the
accuracy of the prediction using the
reading from the former station
conscience so we do such kind of
evaluation for each station each hour
and say how statistically accurate our
algorithm is in past one year as a
result our everything means about eighty
percent accurate are in Beijing which is
much higher than existing matter using
by used by environmentalist so which is
only about sixty percent so that means
the big data has bring 20 person jump on
accuracy beyond the state of art so
that's a very big data you can refer to
my paper
publisher thekkady deal last year for
details of the research the next example
is about identifying the functional
regional city using two part of data
human mobility and the point of interest
data so this is the result so we
presenting you here it's a real resolve
Beijing the red region means educational
and science area of Beijing and black
area means at the ones commercial area
but I want to emphasize that the
function of the region it's not single
it has a region has a Markov functions
so the region sharing the similar color
really have the similar distribution
across different functions on the other
hand even the region was recognized as
an educational area it does not mean
every part of the region is serving
educational functions so we need to
further identify the kernel density
distribution of each kind of functional
region so this figure shows the kernel
density function of commercial area in
Beijing where the darker color is the
high probability this location could be
commercial area so for each kind of
function region we can build such kind
of kernel density distribution so white
need what do we need use to part of data
to pass over data it's very intuitive to
use point of each datum because if we
see there are none of university in
region this region could be educational
Ariel but you only using pon da Vinci
data is not enough because that is
static in the database let's take a look
example showing the figure of the bottom
of the slice there are two restaurants
are both recorded as a Chinese
restaurant in the p.o I database but
clearly they have different meanings one
could be billed in neighborhoods serving
local p7 local papers but neither one
could be built in commercial area or
tourist attractions so using human
mobility data we can't afraid
should be to him the POS or the same
category and also point of entry data
can depreciate the functional regions
itself let's take a look at this example
if we say the majority of people live in
a location in the morning and then come
back in the location to the location in
the evening then most likely this region
could be a residential area so that's
the reason why I need a comment about up
data um how we evaluate our service we
can compare the results generated by all
matter in two consecutive years and say
whether the change makes sense okay here
we can say region a was recognized as an
emerging area Lynch in Beijing which is
indicated by yellow but becomes but
became karimi which means on the
construction area in 2011 after started
we found this is the the tallest
building of the Aegean is truly under
construction in this area so this region
is truly under construction that means
our algorithm accurately a clear this
change in the city so another example is
region B which was recognized as a green
area of meat which means our park nature
and park but later later become a black
area which means commercial area so this
is actually the chamber street around
the olympic game this tree has been
revealed with hundreds of shops and
stores located here now is truly a
commercial area and they will also
compare our result i guess the land use
of beijing and this is 1g aerial which
was playing for residential area and you
are without the majority of praise i was
identified as an emerging residential
area which is correct i will also find
some proper area which means emerging
commercial area this is not bad but we
need to let our city planner knows so
they can have a better planning for the
future
in the third example we are going to
start the real time gas consumption your
city so let me ask you one question um
who can tell me how many litre of gas
has been consumed in past one hour in
Beijing I think nobody can answer this
question and then we don't even have to
data available um so how we achieve that
okay we use GPS equipped with tax cap as
a sensor to infer auto detect their
killing time in his gas station that
means that the time the spam for
reviewing their cars came and then based
on the reading ham we can infer the lens
of Q then we know how many weekers are
there being refilled assume each each
way course has been filled 40k 40 litre
gas then we can infer the gas
consumption of the entire gas station so
if we can do such kind of calculation
for each station so we can graphs grasp
the gas consumption of entire city and
pass one hour so what's this researcher
for I'm very simple application scenario
is gas station commendation based on in
terms of waiting time so usually we are
not we were looking for some gas station
with shortest q but the closest gas
station is no not really the quickest
one so i prefer travel 100 father then
we'll find a better one but more what
was more important is our research can
improve energy infrastructure of the
city for example if we see an area where
we always find a lot of people refueling
in their car and people have to wait for
very long period of time so probably we
need to consider a few additional
station around the state at this area on
the other side if we found some region
where guess that you're having overview
probably we can shut down some station
temporary or reduce the staff working
there and then we can also tell
government number people
who are refueling their car in gas
station at any hour for example in the
morning rush hour they're about 60,000
people are there in gas station Beijing
and the every rebuilding them is about
30 minutes in workday but when time goes
to a p.m. in the union that every
Willingham is about six minutes so I
usually choose this time to refill my
car um this figure shows the results we
have why I would emphasize we are not
infer to get something gas consumption
of test caps we are using gas test camp
as a sensor to infer the gas consumption
a kiss consumption of old lakers in the
city so we can compare the hill map of
the Torah's out figure b shows the time
spent by test caps and figured it shows
the temps member all recurs you can see
the difference and figure c shows the
heat map in terms of texas with it and
figure it shows the urban with amines
all week or so it is there are some
regions we found there are none of test
cap freedom in reaching a but in terms
of the total number of wickers here is
not not not not many so that's the value
of our research so let me summarize
what's urban commuting some tequila
message out wid ring is 3b that means
using big data to take big cities big
challenge all methodology is rehab that
is data management data mining inversion
learning and our results is a win-win
situation among people city an
environment so in even shorter code is
Rick BMW that's purple computing thank
you for your attention now for more
information you can search for urban
computing on on the internet and you can
get slide deck and paper you even the
data about the research thank you for
attention now I'm handing the talk to
Professor drew from John University
thank you to you
this is a gem into in the document of
computer science and engineering at the
Shanghai University I am in Shanghai
China let me try change slide so that is
a big one so my project is about
crowdsourcing basedir benoist mapping
with smartphones but this is outline of
my talk stop to our talk about the
motivation of the project second I will
talk about the design of our system
which we call it noise sense and next I
will discuss how we implement with the
surveys from Microsoft Asia and finally
I conclude my talk our project is a
deafening noise he the excessive sound
that may harm the activity or balance of
human life and in daily life noise
pollution is everywhere so the noise can
be caused by traffic on the road or
caused by machines in construction or
caused by loud music on streets and
long-term exposure noise pollution
millet who are emotional to
physiological and psychological effects
and they are they actually many harmful
effects for example are related related
diseases include hearing impairment
hypertension is chemical heart disease
and etc and a longer effects may result
in changes to immune system and birth
defects so it is a really important for
the public to know what is the noise
label and try to avoid long-term
exposure to noise pollution
he is how good know what is the noise
label at a given location is uncertain
time slots unfortunately it is really
limited they are limited ways for the
general public to know what is the noise
level at a given time have given
location so one available way is to
actually install measurement stations
and the people can read the noise label
are from the display but this method has
limited coverage and the general public
is difficult to to read to access the
North data each step was putting the
employed pollution is to develop a noise
mapping service so this picture on the
right are give one example so what is
the noise mapping service so essentially
we add one overlay on the map so the
this overlay gives the information at
the noise level at a given location at
the presence or at a time in the past so
by using this noise mapping service a
wise able to quarry the noise level at a
time and at any location this user may
interested in the goal of the project is
build a cloud setting based system for
large-scale fine grained urban noise
mapping I would like to emphasize this
project still ongoing and not finished
yet but the significance of driving
every so first of all by using this
noise mapping service the general public
is able to assess the exposure to noise
pollution and drop measures can be taken
to avoid londa exposure and a second the
authority or local government compared
to understand the situation of noise
pollution of a given state
and may reinforce of example laws when
it is necessary and finally urban
planners can take the noise pollution
into consideration when they are
planning urban areas next I will talk
about the design of our tipton annoyance
basically our assistant fires to
leverage the technique we call it a
crowdsourcing which is a very popular
approach now to try to make use of the
power of the cloud so the main idea of
our system is the following so by it
each smartphone can measure the noise
label at a given location with its
embedded microphone so by recruiting a
large number of individual smartphones
exactly the mean of crowdsourcing it is
possible to collect a large data set of
noise data in an urban area and about
collecting and processing the noise data
across smartphones we can provide the
noise mapping service to a given open
area then the general public can look at
the service and get the idea what is the
noise level of one particular location
at a camp or at a given x a slot for
example so our system architect is shown
in this picture we are we are using the
surveys from Microsoft Asia so basically
on the button we have a large number of
smartphones and each smartphone will
measure the data the noise data and
share the data with the cloud so on the
cloud side we we make use of several
services from Microsoft Asia we use Asia
storage to store the data Rhonda Rhonda
poems and we use our computing resources
like some of virtual machines to process
the data and also we use our cloud
service
22 get the data from the smart phones
and also we use Asia web web site
service to provide a noise mapping
service then users per example text our
clients can you there plotters to accept
to access the noise mapping service
smartphone users can use map on air to
access the noise Maggie service in
buildings are consistent they are
typical engines so first we have to
accommodate a large number of sensing
criminals so in our case that is asthma
ponds and the number of users are can be
large so again we have to accommodate a
large number of users and their requests
so second smartphones are not designed
for noise measurements and a measurement
made by us multiple may contain error so
in this case we have to our calibration
and finally smoking noodles are
reluctant to perform sensing tasks to
collect noise data for us so we have to
to provide incentive to the small
noodles first of all I talked about how
we calibrated ok so in this slide I
first show errors can be very large so
as you can see on the left a big picture
we show the measurements made by a
smartphone and also the true value which
is strong annoys level meter which is a
professional a meter so as you can see
there is a big gap between the two
curves and the error can be as large as
15 DBA ok on the right this curve is a
empirical CDF of the areas so as you can
see around forty percent of the errors
is larger than 15 DBA so that is a real
big
our approach or calibration is motivated
by one observation so we plot the sketch
plot of the data from the smart phones
and also the measurement run the
professional meter so x axis a
smartphone measurements y-axis is the
true value so as you can see there is a
clear linear relationship between the
two values so we can use example
reparation techniques to derive the
slope of the line and also we need to
derive the offset in order to calibrate
the measurement from the smart phones so
based on this operation with time we
design one intervention pre calibration
so here are emphasized that it is in the
baton free that means smartphone users
don't need to put any input in order to
do this our calibration so this approach
consists of two components wise no
debates the calibration and the second
crowdsourcing based the calibration so
first we introduce know the basic
collaboration so this is a actually
simple so by using these no debates
collaboration each node can
automatically find what is up what is
offset for this smartphone so the idea
is to find our common quiet base so
based on this space we can compute it
offset ok so after having this upset we
can calibrate all the measurements by
this by this smartphone and output is
correct it's close to the true value but
the major problem with this no debase
the calibration be that I it takes time
ok but the Layton's they can be large so
in order to address this issue we
propose another another component which
is a crowdsourcing base the calibration
so idea of this component such a simple
different forms different poems of the
same model they share similar offset
okay so after phone already get the
offset this object can be shared through
a clock for example so the idea is we
build a table or a napping what is
offset forgiven forgiven smartphone
model then a new smartphone with our
calibration if they can look up a wooded
offset for this model and then get the
object for this for this smartphone so
by doing so this calibration latency can
be significantly reduced next we talk
about how we provide incentive in
general as ma commuters are we lucked
ins to provide a sings in data to to the
system so the main reasons are the
following our first sensing noise data
consumes resources for example our
computing resources and energy and a
second by providing resources there's a
risk of privacy bridge so it is really
important to provide enough incentive to
the smartphone users in order to get a
large number of a large number of smoke
on the others to share their noise
measurements our idea is to provide our
intent to of example money or points and
we build a system which is based on
reverse auction model so we knew the
idea of auction so first of all the
platform will announce what is what is
the available things in task and the
smartphones can compete for these tasks
by providing a bit to the platform and
the problem will determine which are
winning asthma phones okay next
smartphones will collect the noise data
and share the data with the platform and
eventually the platform will I'll pay
the money and a based on this supreme
work we propose a truce for auction
magnuson in essence this mechanism
consists of two algorithms one is task
allocation algorithm to determine which
are winning as my phones and they will
provide the data and the second
algorithm is a novel payment scheme okay
so I'm not going to talk about the
details of this algorithm design if you
are interested you can refer to my
papers so one paper is in algebra impark
on this year and another one is in a
choco ye I cdcs again this year next
hour about how we implement this system
with the help of Windows Asia this
showed that inner framework of data flow
and processing so on the Left we have
the lower data from the smartphones and
on the class side we reviewed a data
receiver component to receive all the
raw data but the raw data may contain
errors so we need a filter to fill all
the errors and eventually these data
will store in the cloud storage and this
data will be processed in order to
derive a given a given noise label or
given location and for a given time slot
and the web service will display 000
give this noise label at a given
location at given time slot to the end
the others so this is what we say annoys
mapping service building on building on
our windows asian we actually use
several services of windows asia first
of all we use our cloud service
for data receiver and second part we use
a virtual machine to to build to deploy
our data processing algorithms and also
also we use our cloud storage from the
Asia to store the raw data and also we
use circle server a survey service runs
on windows asian to store the data to
show on the webs on the website and and
and also we're the web site service of
the windows asia to show the noise
mapping service and we build my own
efforts but using the smartphone app a
user can share the data with the cloud
and also the user is able to access the
noise mapping service so as you can see
in this slide they are poor pictures to
get to one show what is the noise label
at the current location of this Yoda and
the second page show the noise mapping
service so basically data map and on top
of map we add an overlay to show the
noise label at a given locations at
present and it is also able to show the
noise label at kinds of the past and
pick 23 show how many points you earn
and the last picture show how many
things in tasks you can compete pole in
this slide we show how Windows Windows
Microsoft Asia can help in noise data
collection from a large number of
smartphones so the major challenge here
is the number of smartphones
contributing data to the cloud can be
very large so the data receiver should
be scalable to be scalable so the
solution we are using is we make use of
cloud service which is a shrink shrink
Pole to the number of smartphones when
the number of summer poems is large
the cloud service will create more
instances to adjust these large number
of smartphones and the number of smoke
bombs are becomes smaller the number of
instances are decrease so it is a
scalable and the data plan to
smartphones will be stored in the cloud
storage across Asia it is called abroad
so which is a very convenient to use to
store to store to store the data unit
slide we discuss how the data is stored
in the cloud so basically there are two
kinds of two kinds of data we should
store on the cloud one data is raw data
London smartphones so we store this kind
of data in cloud storage using a using
the concept bra and the second type of
data is to show on the North mapping
service so this is a more frequently
shown or exist by by the others so this
data will be stored in circles server
again this is the service from Microsoft
Asia in this slide we show how we view
the web the web site and the web pages
for showing these annoys mapping service
so on the cloud side we make use of the
web the web site service on the
Microsoft Asia so again that the major
challenging is this service or this
website should be scalable to the number
of users so when the number of users is
a very large the web the web service you
create more instances to address or to
accommodate so large number of you this
and and for example are at night the
number of users become smaller we can
use smaller instances on the website and
on the client site we develop web pages
based on the API of beam maps okay
so that is how we can show an overlay on
top of the electronic online maps and
also we develop JavaScript to show to
show the noise level at a given location
okay really conclude my talk in
conclusion we leverage the power of
causality sensing with muffins to build
a noise mapping service and by this
service the general public can query the
noise level at any location at any time
and Windows Asia are really facilitate
largest scale urban computing by
providing closer cloud services website
virtual machines and storage and I have
to acknowledge that many age of features
and services are yet to explore in this
project thank you okay thank you so much
for attending were there any additional
any of the presenters have any closing
remarks okay I think we have another 12
minutes for Q&amp;amp;A so if you have any
question you can type into the dialog
box and there is a question for
professor too yes ok the question is
about the noise mapping service
apparently it looks like a mobile AP p
dr. be booking access and are due to
know the the most wrapping up maybe
Shanghai is that is the right yes she
and the question is is that online yet
ah because this project is still ongoing
and it is not available to the general
public yet but of example after half a
year I hope this service available to
anybody in the wall okay and then a
fellow up
question is the how to use the noise map
because we can see that the the noise
max shows the current nose condition mmm
but but how do you use that result I
mean your day today as a regular Yoda
there are several ways to access our
service so one simple way is to look at
what is a nice label and a given area at
the present okay but if you are
interested in the noise level for
example in the past three days or one
month you can use the history data
Explorer 8 exploration okay so basically
on our website they are several there
are several menus you can choose so by
for example by collecting the most
noises razor-thin annoys noisy places in
the in the campus then the web page will
show the locations okay do I answer the
question yes thank you very much okay
and there is another question for dr.
Sun the questions like this you have
highlighted three be big challenges in
big cities with big data however in the
era of big data is always a challenge to
find it data could you share experience
with us about how to find big any useful
data for research so thank you for the
question um our dealer actually comes
from Surrey parts first one is Microsoft
has its own data sets like porn of age
of data and rule never data so we have
been map service the second part of data
comes from public portals of garmin
website such as New York City has opened
their data source for doing research and
there are other cities even China share
some data source
we can also collaborate the sir part is
we can class um data through cooperation
collaboration base academia and garments
for example we are collaborating with
mep as Chinese Environmental Protection
ministry so they're Sheriff's with air
quality data of different cities to
enable our students oh that's an
experience that weight class data that
we collect data in this big data error
but it is true it's not easy to get data
and it's always most important thing to
clap data first okay thank you very much
and now there's another question for
professor to this question is is like
this you will you use crowdsourcing to
collect your notes and how how do you
ensure their privacy issue because you
are collecting information from their
mobile home you know this is a very good
and a very important question so privacy
is actually a very important a very
important issue here and I think it is
it is true for many similar projects
okay so your collect data plans my poems
so in our case each smartphone will
share its noise measurement along with
its location and a device ID right so in
this case location is a concern location
property is concerned so in order to
ensure privacy of users of smartphones
just know does not leak right so we must
use techniques to protect this privacy
but I have to say privacy I still a very
important is still very hot topic
research topic and many people still are
doing different techniques to protect
the privacy so go back to our
we can use several techniques for
example we can use encryption to make
sure the data translation between
smartphone and a cloud cloud can is say
and is a secure that means no other
people can read the data from the
smartphone so that is one and a second
in order to make sure the location
privacy is is ensured we can use for
example at a noise to the location okay
so no accurate location of the user is
released and also we can use example
anonymization to make sure that the ID
is protected okay so that is a few our
potential solutions but they are this is
a very important research in question
okay so many research efforts should be
made yes thank you okay good there's
another question coming for you it's a
shown question may be asking for sure
the answer does the data storage layer
use Hadoop eat the question for me yes I
think so because the data's all right
now it is hard to ya in our case in our
case we don't use Hadoop yet because
prisoner at the present the processing
applied to this data still quite simple
so we simply store the data and
periodically process the data and store
the result in the SQL Server but Hadoop
is certainly very useful when we apply
more processing requirements yeah that
is my mom and say okay thank you there's
another one for you he stared at the I
just read the question okay he asked a
why role data is sent from phone to the
data processor server doesn't it cause a
lot of data traffic for users oh I
the process on the phone yeah maybe that
is inaccurate working wording so
actually in our in our project we don't
send raw data actually we send a noise
level measured by this smartphone so the
data data traffic is actually very very
low okay so don't worry about this thank
you for these uh for the question okay
all right and there is an question
coming for it dr. Chung it says where
you release your full data of your urban
air relevant paper published in kdd 2013
on your website okay so we have already
released the air calling data of page in
each I hire to city in past one year but
regarding the other data sets such as
porn of inch data and their own network
data it's very sensitive but we're
considering our release the features
features extracted from the two data
sets so hopefully we could put the
features on our website but that's
enough for for your research yeah okay
okay there's a question for both our ask
it professor jewel first yes please I
don't I don't know if you have the
experience with the ec2 from amazon but
the question is can you compare asier
with ec2 from amazon do we have any
experience with it yeah thank you thank
you for the question but unfortunately
I've never been I've never used the ec2
yes okay so they may be in future I can
I can compare them hahaha he neither me
neither okay so we will just skip this
question okay and I because of time I
have one last question and then we'll
wrap up we hope to close at five o'clock
sharp I have a question for Pat the gin
we know we know that your air quality
project you can make
the places where actually there is no
quality air quality meters right so my
question is is it possible to forecast
the air quality like well ideally for
example like forecasting the weather you
know that get maybe two moro there will
be PM 2.5 to be how many yes thank you
for giving me this opportunity to
elaborate on our project so we are
actually working on air quality or
Christine that means we can predict the
air quality in future hours such as
what's air call in six hours later or
six hours 12 hours later the prediction
accuracy is not there right now I began
we are very promising to have it
serviced available in but then over this
a year that's very promising yeah yeah
it'll be very excited if we can know
what the PM 2.5 to be four next to next
week oh no that's where people excited
there'll be very difficult we are
predicting a work short future okay
short distance or future you know two
hours now tell our is you know as yeah
tour power it's possible yeah yeah that
would be very exciting okay uh because
of time we have to stop here but before
we close I want to make a little bit of
advertisement so again please go to Asia
for research com Asia for therefore is
1234 for Asia for research com you can
find a lot of more information there and
our upcoming deadline for the edge of
for research RP is in is on jun 15 so

research and look at into this program
and submit your proposal you may be able
to win a sizable as your resource for
your research and i want to thank
