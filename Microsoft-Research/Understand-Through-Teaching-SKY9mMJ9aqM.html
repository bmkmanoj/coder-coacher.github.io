in fact at first I'd say the first class
I thought was a disaster and the second
class they put me on a topic that well I
was not an expert in but the course was
was sort of baked it was already made so
I learned a lot by having to learn that
material was a computer architecture
class and about the same time I was
working on type systems for high-level
languages and he started to ask
questions about well hey couldn't we
apply these ideas for high-level
languages down to machine architecture
so that had a direct impact what I was
teaching what I was trying to understand
and how I might relate it to students
had a direct impact on the kind of
research that I that I wanted to pursue
the other thing is you don't really
understand something at all well until
you can explain it to somebody else if
you can't do it simply so that somebody
from outside the field can can jump in
and understand the material you don't
understand it you don't understand it at
all and it's not just teaching but
writing is the same way that if you if
you can't communicate your ideas then
you don't really understand them and
often when you're teaching your writing
is when you have the most important
discoveries the most important
simplifications or the most important
breakthroughs in in really understanding
the material as opposed to just cranking
through it or hacking so to speak</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
