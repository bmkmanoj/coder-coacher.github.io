digital systems group at microsoft
research in cambridge and i want to tell
you about our project called new
experiences in search when you think
about search engines the values you
might consider are things like speed and
efficiency but research including our
own has shown that much of web use is
quite routine it's literally is bound up
with the rhythms of everyday life but
we've been more interested in designing
about how you can support people in
spending time rather than saving time
online I want to show you a couple of
research projects in which we've been
thinking about how you can allow people
to follow long-term interests to evolve
slowly over time both of these draw on
the metaphor of planting a search seed
of interest and watching this grow in
this scenario the user has planted four
seeds that relate to jazz musicians
which is as something that he's
extremely interested in these grow
upwards when new content comes in and
then they fall slowly to the side as
that content grows older this allows the
user to stay aware of what's new with in
that space but in a very subtle non
intrusive way so you can see here that
the different colored stems relate to
different musicians the blue here is
Miles Davis and these snowflakes that
are slowly falling down in the
background relates to content that's
been tweeted about online so in this
version we've been exploring how we can
start to branch these search seeds so
we're Bing in this instance would offer
and suggestions for related searches
we've chosen to branch the stems to
broaden out the search space similarly
way it would suggest and different auto
completions when you start typing in
your search query we get branching so
with this version we're trying to
understand how you could plant an
initial seed but then have that branch
out within a search base so how might
this work in practice we envision that
you might plant a seed within a search
engine light thing and then have that
grow either within the browser
itself or perhaps on an active desktop
so that this could be something that you
could visit in your spare time as a
reminder of your interests so together
these concepts illustrate how search can
be something that's not only direct and
purposeful but there can be slow that's
it from the background and that unfold
slowly over time thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
