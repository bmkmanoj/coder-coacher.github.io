you
now we have team tracked i'll explore a
city with your hands and ears from
university of applied sciences spots
them in germany and they have physical
prototypes to share with you guys
hello hello hello hello can you hear me
yeah nice ok hello everyone we are
Patrick Cecile and Johannes from the
university of applied sciences in
Potsdam Germany and we are proud to
present our project tracked i'll so we
started with a simple question how do
blind and visually impaired people
explore city so we humans were very
visual creatures and when we think about
how blind or visually impaired person
would explore a city we think that
there's a lot they can't experience it a
lot that they're missing because where
they just can't use their eyes but we
didn't actually want to define visual
impairment as the deficit is something
that removes those affected from an
essential part of human experience
instead what we wanted to do was try and
see if there was something to be gained
for everyone from the way they
experienced the world so how can we
explore city without our eyes first
there are your immediate physical
surroundings just the space around you
so what's the floor like are you walking
on grass or just a pavement maybe is it
raining are you perhaps cold or
uncomfortable yeah then you start to
listen and maybe you can hear strangers
talking maybe there's a park across the
street and you can hear the birds in the
trees or maybe there's the street just
up the block and you can hear the cars
rushing past then there's your sense of
orientation and the knowledge you have
of your surroundings so do you know
where you're going do you know the name
of the street do you know that there's a
great coffee shop just to your right so
all these different states of feeling of
knowing of hearing of remembering please
make up our experience of the cityscape
but there are other people in city as
well and all of them they have their own
experiences their own stories and their
own memories and we wanted to make it
possible to share those with friends or
with just anyone really we wanted to
give you the means to explore or
discover an entire city in a new way to
connect with it to learn about it
perhaps even to fall in love with it
erectile is an electronically in
digitally augmented tactile map it makes
it possible to explore a city with your
hands and with your ears and Patrick
will not talk about the magic behind
correct I'll but um track tile is not
only an object it but there's a whole
service around it first thing you do as
you go to the website and select the
destination and the sites you want to
see for example burnin Berlin and
checkpoint charlie then you order your
customized map when it arrives you can
really get in touch with a cityscape by
feeling out streets buildings parks and
water through the different surface
structures we used but what makes
tracked i'll really different to other
tactile maps with track tire you can use
your ears to discover even more there
are three different audio layers on the
map which can be activated separately
the first one which is on every map
includes the basic informations about a
city like street names important
buildings and points of interest the
second layer is a community layer where
you can access different content shared
and created by other tech tile users
like helpful informations and reviews
but also sound recordings of the noises
of a city to really feel the atmosphere
but you can also create this content
yourself during your trip and this
content is included in the third layer
your personal one you can sync and store
these are recordings on to your map
which makes it easier to live your
memories to relive your memories and you
can also share them with the community
if you like so let's have a closer look
to track tile in real life now you will
hear the basic layer which helps you to
prepare your trip and understand a city
layout unter den linden pariser platz
brandenburger tor
the community layer gives you the
possibility to learn more from the blind
and visually impaired community
biergarten schließen krug great beer
garden in a beautiful park near the
river checkpoint charlie it was quite an
experience standing on the border of the
Berlin Wall you can use our fully
accessible app for sound recordings
during your trip and you would be
surprised however visually impaired
people can use smartphones
after your trip you can sink and store
your recordings to your map and use it
to relive and share your memories now it
is this year
now you've just seen our second
prototype and action but how did we get
there to evaluate if our concept would
could be realized we started prototyping
in an early stage this is a work in
progress picture of our first prototype
it is made of paper and as you can see
it's already electronically augmented
and functional and this is the finished
prototype it shows a map of downtown
Berlin we did a lot of testing with
different papers and their structures in
order to explore how to represent
streets and how to distinguish buildings
from them we experimented with Braille
but we decided against it in the end
because we don't want to exclude those
who cannot read it we also have all our
prototypes of us and we love it if you
try them out later in our booth in the
open showcase so we engaged with the
community and got in touch with a lot of
online users on Facebook groups and the
AFS insights about orientation and
navigation in the city and traveling
with visual impairments during our first
research phase we met Michael who's very
active in the blind community and who
likes to travel to new places he tested
our first prototype and later also the
others and gave us valuable feedback
about distances and sizes on the map
layout and ways to improve them he also
said that this map would help him to
prepare his next journey and that he
would understand the city street layout
and give him more autonomy in addition
to his cane also we met with the
mobility group of the blind and visually
impaired Association in Berlin and they
gave us qualified feedback about our
formal style and really important facts
about tech tile patterns and marks if
you want to learn more about our
research we have a really detailed
documentation of our website which is
strike tile co
so our research led us to our
development of the second prototype and
here we focus more on formal and
aesthetic properties like surface
structure and the overall look and feel
we CNC milled MDF and use different
patterns for the different kinds of
parks green spaces and waters and we
varied the sizes and widths of streets
during our research we felt that there
was a real demand for a portable version
and so we developed one we developed a
thread prototype which is foldable and
fits into your pocket so you can explore
a city while you are on the go
well you can try it out later in our
booth it was just working it's too
nervous apparently we just tried it back
there at work the best thing is to try
to out yourself it's a nervous map
thank you well just a second planet so
it was our goal to create more than a
tool it was our goal to create more than
a tool a beautiful and aesthetic perhaps
even a poetic object something that has
a quality for everyone whether the blind
visually impaired cited and we believe
that track tile is a beautiful way to
explore a city with your hands and with
your ears thank
Thank You Potsdam come see them at the
the booth today from six to eight so you
can use it we've seen it work now after
the judges comments who would like to
start hmm so thank you very much that
was very nice despite that moment that
we've all had absolutely kind of you
know always happens so I thought you
know one of the interesting things about
that presentation where there was sort
of like oh you know what about your
research and then you can't you know you
came in with a research and kind of
questions about well it's a little bit
clunky you know but have you moved on to
it being you know sort of foldable and
you know much like a general city map
and I thought that the way that you'd
thought through that process you can
obviously don't have much time to
present but it kind of showed a really
you know I really like to see that that
you'd really thought through lots of the
issues and explored them and prototyped
it and really kind of push that so I
think that was great um I mean I of
course still have lots of questions yeah
that's it and um you know and I bet you
have a website so maybe I should go over
and read it but kind of knowing that
there who can meet us later and I or see
it in the booth later so I mean I've it
was a really nice project um you know
the kind of that you'd also come out
both was a very sort of sort of
functional but also as aesthetic thing
which was really nice to see that you
kind of push both angles of that and
push something that you really try to
make usable by the community that you
are designing force and that's great ok
so i love this i mean i love this more
than i can put to words because it's
exactly what you might imagine that I
might love because especially the
community layer which which so I think
any time that you can take something
physical or something that's hard where
they can become the center point of the
connection for your community
you have an incredibly powerful platform
i'm sure i'm probably going to pitch you
your own idea here but but um you know I
think when you you know the cumulative
effect if you can get this into the
hands of the people that need it and the
community connection point so first you
start off navigating your city but
ultimately the community layer allows
those members to begin to connect and
that connection point brings like people
together and i can tell you beyond a
shadow of a doubt that when that occurs
in society it makes the world a better
place for the people that are
benefitting from it so you know i
commend you on this thing this is really
really exciting i'd love to talk to you
later about it but i don't know raving
reviews great feedback i don't know the
exact technological things with it this
is not my field so you guys know a lot
more than me but um you know assuming
that you can get this to a good price
point and into the hands of the
demographic it's very very very exciting
and I love the intention behind the
project this is just great likewise I am
very very a lot of a lot of desire for
one of these on my wall and connecting
me to a place you know that I love and
I'm sure many many people in the
audience would would be able to identify
with that idea of being sort of somehow
connected through some object a large
scale wall installation or something and
actually quite like the way you both are
helping the clearly disabled user and
going after that use case which is very
difficult and at the same time designing
excusing not to include Braille is a
quite bold choice in this project
particularly to make it more inclusive
of everybody right so this is something
that both visually impaired and non
visual impaired can can both enjoy I
think there is a question still around
the sort of is this for preparation
before you know learning the city or is
it for experiencing the city while I'm
you know whether you've got the mobile
version or is it for reflecting on the
city and
perhaps in conclusion there it's all
three and it's equally good at all all
aspects of that and which is even more
commendable because you would have
thought it would be specifically so
dialed into one of these and and I think
you've done a good job making it address
each of those kinds of scenarios so
congratulations great presentation to
visually
we don't have time for questions
questions later investors later at the
booth thank you guys each year microsoft
