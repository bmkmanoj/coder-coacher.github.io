when we think about the future of the
economy of the United States if we don't
have more computer science majors we're
in big trouble and if half of our
population the female half is not going
to major in computer science we're in
big trouble if we don't have women
participating and creating the solutions
to technical problems I can promise you
that the technical solutions will not be
as good we need to have diverse teams to
create the world's greatest innovations
we need to build the talent pipeline and
to do that requires us to excite young
women in middle school in high school to
the future of computer science
it's really important to have a strong
foundation at an earlier age with
computer science related tools like
simple programming or even things
disguised as games giving them
experiences to hands-on play with
technology and computer science to give
them passion it's that initial spark
that really keeps them engaged in the
field inspiring them to pursue careers
in science technology
another key ingredient to help keep
girls in the computer science track is
to help them be aware of opportunities
with great organizations like the Anita
Borg Institute and the National Center
for Women in Technology NC what does a
lot of work in Washington DC because
we're working very hard to make sure
that policymakers understand the
importance of girls and women's
participation in computing we're
mobilizing all kinds of ways in 20 years
we're going to see what women in vent
when they invent technology because
right now we really don't know what
women would invent if they're at the
technical design table we have an
executive team was really ready to take
the Anita Borg Institute to the next
level our signature program is the Grace
Hopper celebration of women in computing
this year we have 3,600 people
descending on Baltimore Maryland 1500 of
these are students and for them it's
often the first time it come to a
conference it can be life-changing
grace hopper is the most exciting event
ever pretty much because being in a
computer science department that's so
vibrant as the one of brown's is great
but there just aren't enough women in my
like 125 lecture there's like four girls
and you're here and this this all the
girls can have that feeling in one place
it's just so inspiring to see how many
girls have the same interests as me you
walk around knowing that every single
girl here has something amazing that
they've done it's really amazing how
many technologies are out there and how
many women from all nationalities are in
these fields I've been very fortunate to
have a lot of mentors throughout my
career and it's those mentors who have
helped shape me and I hope with that
knowledge I can be a good mentor to
other women that I work with on a daily
basis right now at Microsoft Research
i'm working with rain Johnson I think
it's really important that women early
in their careers just entering computer
science in college or even in high
school have a female mentor I get to see
how someone very similar to me someone
with the same energy with the same
passions how they live their life and it
lets me know what my future could be
like and having reign as the mentor lets
me see that I can be successful exactly
as the person I am
I have gone to Haiti twice now through
an organization that I partner with the
Stars Alliance we were able to start
teaching introductory computer science
and programming skills to a group of
young women who serve as mentors and
three of the schools in rural northern
Haiti you can bring in food and
solutions that will last a short term or
you can bring in solutions that enable
the people to really take control their
destiny one of the things that was
really important when i met katie is her
passion to make a difference in the
world we know one reason that we're
losing a lot of young women in computer
science is the lack of awareness that
computer science really does change the
world young women today want to make an
impact and that's why we also partner
with net hope neck out women's tech
connect is a global community of
practice and an a professional online
mentoring program to support women in
developing world to get into technology
we put them through a training in
technology that's relevant for their
particular community for their
particular country and then place them
in internships in nonprofits in those
local areas so that they can get actual
real-world experience and ninety percent
of the time those internships turn into
jobs computer science is a very creative
field it's a field where you do a lot of
problem solving and collaboration and
it's a field that is changing the world
it's helping make innovations in health
care in the environment all around us
young women need to know that computer
science is about people whether that
person is your end user of a product or
someone for your teaching or someone who
you're inspiring to really pick up the
reins become the next great technologist
computer science is about people not the
technology we will bridge the gap bridge
the gap bridge the gap to future
innovation together to future innovation
together together together through
diversity through diversity to diversity
and creativity each year microsoft
research helps hundreds of influential
speakers from around the world including
leading scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available alright I
actually didn't know that that little
book end at the end was gonna come up so
thank you for indulging us in that and
thank you for joining us this afternoon
at our session at our noontime session
on innovations and research in
attracting women to computing we have a
very esteemed panel of experts in that
subject and I'm delighted to be your
facilitator for the conversation my name
is Roy Zimmerman and I'm the director of
education and scholarly communication in
microsoft research connections here at
Microsoft Research in redmond and i
would like to introduce our panel and
then invite them to share a little bit
more information about themselves and
the work that they're doing to promote
women in computing first we have
Catherine McKinley immediately to my
left Catherine is a principal researcher
at Microsoft Research she likes to solve
programming language implementation
problems and make systems faster more
reliable secure and energy-efficient
Lucy Sanders is CEO and co-founder of
the National Center for Women and
information technology a consortium of
more than 300 corporations universities
and nonprofits working to increase the
participation of girls and women in
computing and information technology
Juliana Salas is microsoft research
connections senior research program
manager in brazil where she engages with
academics on projects that use
technology to enable and accelerate
knowledge in such areas as tropical
environments and their response to
climate change bioenergy and
biodiversity
next to Giuliana we have constant Stein
cooler who is an associate professor in
digital media at the University of
wisconsin-madison and co-directs the
games plus learning plus society center
or GLS her research is on cognition and
learning in commercial entertainment
games and game in games for impact and
rounding out our panel on the left there
is Tiffany Barnes who is an associate
professor of computer science at North
Carolina State University her research
focuses on serious games and artificial
intelligence and education particularly
how to develop games to teach computing
and how to use computing to improve
learning software so Katherine I will
hand the control module over to you can
I use it though forward all right I'm
Katherine McKinley part of the reason
I'm here today is because I'm the
co-chair of CRA w which is the computing
research association which is
encouraging computing research and the
committee for women to try to improve
diversity of women and we also work on
the divert general diversity of
underrepresented groups so society has
changed in a lot a lot in the past 20
years and as computer scientists most of
us in the audience are also part of
social change and social change takes a
long time all right but we see social
change around us all the time so the
most recent most recent Supreme Court
decisions had some social change in them
and so but social change takes time and
so you have to have sustained support of
diversity in order to see that pan out I
can't be here in front of you as senior
researcher in computer science an ACM
fellow and an i triple e fellow if
people didn't invest in me from high
school 22 now okay so one of the things
so I'm going to talk to you about the
top of the pipeline which has academics
you have the most influence on who you
invest in and how you invest them how
you choose your PhD students how
you encourage your students in your
class to persist and succeed that makes
a huge difference and you have to pick
diverse people because even if you're
diverse even if I'm a women women I
apparently have all the same biases as
everybody else and all the men and I'll
choose to call on the man more than the
woman alright so so so you have to make
a concentrated effort and self change
and support and so one of the things
that CR aw that we've done is try to
encourage graduate students in the first
second and third year of grad school
because we're focused on research we
need leaders in the field and this is a
critical juncture at which a lot of
women and underrepresented minorities
drop out and here we we're trying to
help them succeed and the ways we help
them succeed is we give them strategies
and information on navigating graduate
school we teach them how to go to a
conference and develop a social network
in their research area we give them
specific instructions on how to write a
paper why do right one and early
insights into what potential career
paths they could be having and we have a
lot of senior women come and give the
lectures sit at them with them at lunch
and then they learn about computing from
the inside out and they have good role
models all right so we've been running
this program for over ten years now
Microsoft and Google initially were the
primary supporters microsoft has
maintained its support over across this
whole period Google support has dropped
a little and we've gotten a lot of
funding from other sources more recently
but Google and Microsoft got this
program started with their funding
because they cared so here are the
numbers so when we started in 2004 181
women earned their PhD that year this
year the most recent year we have 358
and we can take some credit for that
because the numbers of women the
percentage of women getting undergrad
degrees in computer science although I
don't have this on my graph drop during
that period
now we have 500 applicants which if you
compare 500 with 358 we have more
applicants than there are PhDs so we
could be reaching almost everyone but we
don't have quite enough money this year
we had the most money ever we had three
hundred and two women that we were able
to bring so does it work though so we do
social intervention how do we measure if
it works you have to have a national
comparison group so this year the CRA W
and CDC help form SERP which is a
organization also under CRA which
evaluates the research pipeline by
surveying people in computing research
careers and in and who go to our
programs and then comparing the outcomes
between these two people and so it does
work so right now are met we just
started this measurement so one of the
things we're measuring not is if you got
your PhD although we're going to measure
that soon but right now we're measuring
just the intermediate outcomes you're at
the same stays and your PhD as all these
other people do you produce some of the
things that indicate you'll have success
later are you a first author of a
refereed publication 71 percent who went
to our our our workshop are and have one
of those and twenty-three percent of the
general grad student population has it
and we break these statistics down by my
institution so top ranked in PhD
granting and other ways and however you
slice it this comes out good so what
this tells us is social engineering and
computer science has a benefit you bring
a bunch of women together you tell them
they can succeed in computer science you
give them the instructions on how to
write a good paper that that the point
of doing research is to write about it
and get it out there and that works all
right but we can't stop there because we
have to have this diversity virtuous
cycle to diversity in
research you have to encourage the women
at your home institution there have to
be role models if we have MOOCs and we
have one person teaching the whole world
computer architecture that person should
be a woman or a minority because that
will influence more women to go in the
field so if you've ever been to an ice
rink and you see all all the the future
stars in ice shrinks they all look like
Michelle Kwan now because she inspired a
generation of young asian women to try
ice skating and that wasn't happening in
the u.s. before her so these people make
a huge difference so inspire your
students look at yourself know that
you're biased even if you're a woman and
give them the experience give them high
expectations and they're there because
they can succeed not because they were
earmarked so thank you for your
attention thanks Catherine just a note
about our format I've asked all of the
panelists to please speak fast as you
might have just noticed because we do
have an abbreviated timeframe and we
want to make sure that we have time for
questions and answers after each
presentation thanks Lucy yes is this on
ok good afternoon you're making me
hungry I'm sitting here watching you eat
I hope you're enjoying your lunch my
simple goal in the next five minutes
isn't to inspire all of you who are not
already participating with aspirations
in computing to participate it's a very
exciting grassroots viral growth kind of
a program that's aim is to increase
girls and women's participation in
computing and educational pipeline and
one of these days when we take over the
world beyond so let me tell you a little
bit about how the program works real
quick it starts with an award component
I'm over on the left side of the chart
it starts with an award component this
is at the national level as well as at
the local level and young women come to
a portal they apply for the award it's
not really a contest or anything they
apply based on demonstrated technical
capable
and leadership capabilities they are
judged by four independent judges all
identification of these young women have
moved from the application form and all
the judging is done online and have a
technology rubric and we assign numeric
score is and we draw the line and then
we decide who the semi-finalists are and
who the finalists are and the national
winners receive five hundred dollars and
a trip to a gala and a laptop and I'll
show you a picture in a moment they also
got surface this year so that was very
cool as well now this generates then a
cycle of recognition in the press
encouragement for the young women from
their communities as well as from their
adult stakeholders publicity we asked
the schools where they attend to to
issue publicity about receiving the
award and then you can start to see this
whole cycle work the buzz builds more
and more young women apply self-identify
as technologists come to the portal and
apply and the community gets larger but
the award component is really the Talent
Search it's really the Talent Search
it's just the beginning because the real
thing is to get them into an online
community get them peer networking with
each other right sometimes you know we
put contest in front of them like mobile
app development or something else and
they have a good time that way but they
form a community we also have about 275
universities as members of NC wet and
they're able to offer them in turn
umek's scholarships the corporation's
offer them internships ultimately jobs
so you see how it sort of works its kind
of wheat and then we keep track of them
all the way from high school through
college they're in this community so
that's how the program works we're
starting to see now members of this
community the aspirations participants
themselves are starting to do pay it
forward types of things by hosting
middle school opportunities in areas
where they live partnering with
universities and other organizations so
you can see that full pipeline starting
to take shape it's working as well on
like Katherine a few metrics for you
this year alone we recognize 1,000 young
women across the country so you can see
the growth we started this really in
about 2008 and what
oh no I get to talk a little longer good
I'm bragging ok and you can see the
diversity and that's of course because
we have removed the the identification
of the young women from the application
forms this is the best practice right so
you can see that the diversity is
terrific all 50 states represented lots
of volunteers serving as judges online
and we now know from that from the young
women going into college at eighty
percent persist in male dominant stem
professions and about sixty-three
percent in computing so really great
statistics here they are there's a young
one with the surface just in heaven and
I wanted to point out we have some of
our young women who are interning here
at Microsoft right here on the front row
you want to wave at everybody so you can
talk to them about their yay and I'm REE
farmer is the director for aspirations
and computing she's sitting next to them
and if you want any information about
the program you can talk to Ruth Lucy
can ask a quick question is there any
way to replicate that emotion on
everyone's face well I suspect that
Microsoft could hire her for commercial
or something you know I mean she does
seem to have that look about her ugly
and my husband not least I wanted to
sort of talk a little bit about the
innovation behind this program because
there is an innovation in how it scales
and so I just wanted to point that out
because even though this is a program
here you know mostly in the US it can it
can work in other countries as well so
NC wit provides the infrastructure we
provide the technology portal the
project management we put the call out
for the award programs so we sort of run
the basic infrastructure our member
organizations now up to about 450
provide the local clusters the local
events they plan them they host them
they also are the organizations that are
offering them scholarships and
internships and jobs we have the online
community where the young women
themselves and participate as leaders in
their community and do outreach and then
at the topmost level when you put it all
together we have a growing very
impressive talent pool for computer
science computing in the United States
and so the final thought here is
together we're doing this this isn't
just an see what it's all of us and then
that's what it's going to take to really
turn the corner on creating this kind of
a pipeline it's all of us working to get
at the organizational level across the
United States and and beyond and one of
our goals moving forward this year is to
connect all this to the wonderful
programs that Catherine just mentioned
the CR aw programs because we now have
participants that are you know really
becoming eligible for those kinds of
programs so you can start to see how
this bridge of the gap type of approach
for the full talent pipeline is starting
to come together thank you there's a
traffic jam here is it on can you hear
me kepta ok ok so I'm Giuliana Sally's
I'm going to share with you the efforts
we've been doing in Latin America to
attract and grow women in computing and
we've been working on that since 2008
and when we started we knew it was an
issue in the region but we didn't know
what the statistics were and our main
effort at the time was to gather enough
data to actually go and talk to people
because people were like is this really
an issue i don't know i'm not quite sure
so we wanted to get a meaningful set of
of statistics that could help us in
shaping the discussion with the
community and that turned out to be
quite challenging because first of all
when you think about having pipelining
statistics to the region as a whole
things change a lot from one country to
the other and even in one single country
there are severe differences and I
remember was reaching out for some
programs it was even hard to they didn't
even have a gender field into the
enrollment form so it's virtually
impossible to track you know the trans
in terms of pipeline and gender
participation in CS programs with this
reality so we worked a lot with thought
leaders from different countries trying
to collect collect some stats and we got
to the point that we knew
it's pretty much the same as in most
countries we have around ten percent of
women NIT and the number is declining so
that's pretty much why we got and then
we decided to move on to other actions
that could raise awareness about among a
broader group of people another thing
that was that motivated us to go this
direction is that many of the best
practices that we learn here from MC
weed and other partners are not
traditionally practiced in the culture
like mentoring programs and things like
that coaching so we wanted to to take
some of these approaches but it was hard
to get people involved without you know
fully full awareness about the gender
issues in the schools for example so we
try to have three different pilots to
test different approach and we had a
pilot in Mexico which was more like a
pipeline generic pipeline type of thing
so we had grad students talking to
trying to attract kids to CS programs we
had a program a pilot program in
Colombia and they were very interested
in the data gathering process they
wanted to get more qualitative data to
understand why women don't choose to
follow this career path and in Brazil we
try to to approach related to speaker
series and a series of workshops to to
involve a department in the north of the
country and that was interesting we had
some good results but we still can get
the bus in in each of the departments
that we were expecting it got some
visibility people were talking about
that but we felt we needed to get more
discussions in each of the communities
we're reaching so this year we had the
girls international hackathon organized
by rain which was an international event
and we had a brazilian girls group led
by professor hos eonni from federal
university of manaus amazonas so in the
very no
of the country that was very good
because typically most of the actions we
have are you know related to the
southeast because those are the folks
who are already doing some efforts there
so that was a good opportunity we got a
good group of girls they were very
motivated but we needed to do some
special design to involve and encourage
the girls to participate so just you
know presenting the the challenge to
them come in participating this
programming contest was not enough so we
partner together with Hasani and I and
folks from that could offer some
training about Windows Phone programming
and things like that and offered the
girls coaching communications coaching
presentation usability training
programming that actually was a very
good point to the girls because they
felt by the time they submitted their
app they felt they acquired new skills
not only you know they were confident
about what they improve out what they
put together but they felt they are
actually more more skilled they gained a
different perspective about things on
the other hand we felt that the main
issue to make this program successful is
the person you partner with and because
we are in the level in those in this
region that you know there is not much
awareness about gender balance you need
to find a partner people might be
passionate about it but you need to find
a partner that is willing to take the
time and put the effort in and making it
work and this is hard because you know
faculty are measured by how much they
publish how many classes they teach and
it's hard to find the time to commit and
hos eonni was a great partner so that
was key to the success of this
particular initiative and the outcomes
were great because we wanted to start
modestly so we had a small group of
girls they were quite skeptical about
their abilities and to deliver in the
beginning but as you know they were
working in this project they gained it
so much confidence they exposed
themselves to situations that initially
they wouldn't they they force it well
actually they were forced to come and
talk to people they got a tonne of
visibility and typically that's the type
of scenario they would avoid and that's
the type of thing we want them to make
it now they are making new choices they
want to try new things they want to
apply to internships so we can see the
results are amazing although it's a
small initiative we can see it got a
very good results to Daddy small group
and the good point is that it got a lot
of visibility in that particular
community that particular school so one
of the things that is happening now is
that other groups want to participate
and groups of guys the groups of boys
wants to come you know and participate
in the competition as well so that's the
type of thing we want to happen because
we want to change culture we want to get
both girls and boys involved in this
discussion so although it's still a
small initiative it's getting the type
of impact we are hoping which is you
know growing beyond a small group of
people and reaching a fool Department a
full school and people are talking about
that and being more interested about
this topic so this is basically what
we've been doing in and the initiative
here the goal for this year is to grow
from a small group to a couple of groups
and hopefully to involve to get some
mixed gender groups as well
participating in the competition this
year okay that's what I had
I'm shocked to hear that boys started to
show up at functions where there are
lots of girls around so good afternoon
my name is Constance time cooler and I'm
at University of wisconsin-madison and
we're working on some projects that
actually are going for a fairly young
demographic trying to grab kids girls
right as they enter middle school before
they hit puberty we have a team at our
studio i work in something called the
game joining in society lab where we
build and study games and their
cognitive learning and social impacts so
we've been working on games gameplay and
gains as a vehicle for other kinds of
skills and cognitive sort of
intellectual abilities for quite some
time but to start off one reason that
we've been thinking through this project
is that you know girls game and for many
years they were sort of the silent
players but if ninety-four percent
ninety-seven percent of the american
population between 12 and 17 game 99% of
boys game but ninety-four percent of
girls game it just turns out that girls
usually are playing a different kind of
game and in our work and our research
the last decade we've been showing how
games are in fact a really great sort of
gateway into other kinds of activities
particularly code in computer science if
you've spent long enough fanning out or
nerding out about particular game titles
you know fandom communities emerge that
are actually trying to hack retro
engineer or otherwise build mods
modifications etc around game type
titles so that was sort of where we
started from the last decade but we
started partnering with Microsoft around
Kodu which is basically a visual
interface for coding and creating games
trying to blur that line not just from
playing games but into creating them and
part of our role originally was to build
what we call studio k and this is a full
sort of online community type structured
and mentored interaction around co2 to
buoy up what kind of work kids and young
people are doing on kodu and as part of
that we started saying that it might be
time for us to think about not just
structuring that curriculum content but
thinking about particular way
which we can better engage girls it
turns out of course that those same
design strategies for better engaging
girls also turn out to be just making a
better online community period by the
way but when we looked at some of our
original results it turns out that if
you look at things like coding
complexity over time of young kids who
it originally starting off not espouse
any interest in code or computer science
whatsoever their coding complexity over
time dramatically increased and there
were no gender effects which is a good
thing to have a good thing to check
against so part of what we've been
focusing on the last six months we're
really in our infancy is trying to
create this space for girls around their
play spaces how do girls start to hack
into games and use that as a as an
interest driven form of getting into
computer science now that's a long long
and tall order if you look at things
like the new effort to create AP courses
around computer science this is the one
for basic computational literacy skills
still only sixteen percent of girls
actually are the demographic that's
taking that course so part of what we've
done is that ok well we can try to sort
of gin up interest or long along middle
school girls and making sure that we can
keep them engaged in something like
early computational literacy but the
next thing we're trying to tackle right
now is creating something like a MOOC
boy I hate that acronym massively online
open course if someone can come up with
a better acronym please let me know so
I've been working on one for video games
and learning based on a popular
undergraduate course we teach and so
right now we're trying to tackle is how
would we make one that's free that's an
AP prep course targeting specifically
women doing things like engaging female
faculty to teach those courses to be the
centerpiece of what it would mean to
teach an AP prep course online and so
that's sort of our next tackle so we're
thinking about where can we start to
work on problem or choke points in the
pipeline of getting in women into these
spaces
good afternoon thanks for coming to our
session I'm Tiffany Barnes I'm an
associate professor of computer science
at North Carolina State University and
I'm going to talk to you about the stars
alliance and it was a alliance formed
with funding from the National Science
Foundation in 2006 and we are funded 3
2016 and we have 42 universities and
colleges involved with us this past
school year and probably will have a few
more this coming year and what it
centers around is actually having
college students undergraduates and
graduate students getting engaged in
this problem of getting more people into
computing so our goal in our purpose is
to broaden participation and we have an
annual conference called the star
celebration which will be held in
Atlanta August 14 to 16 this year and we
will bring all of our students from
across these 42 institutions and anyone
else is invited to come as well to come
together learn about the
under-representation we have in computer
science for women and underrepresented
minorities and then we have a call to
action for them to do something about it
so student members in stars actually
undertake a student-led project where
they partner with regional organizations
like boys and girls clubs or local K
through 12 schools or nonprofits to do
projects that use their computing skills
to make the world a better place or to
bring more people into computing and so
this diagram you see up on your right is
sort of a picture of all the things that
we we do so basically the center of our
organization is the student who's in
university or college and they are
encouraged to develop their leadership
skills and to go out into the community
and do something to make a difference I
mean it may be on their college campus
so they're types of activities could
include tutoring on campus mentoring
other students in the
program doing tours for high school
students to visit their computer science
program where they may actually go out
to k-12 schools and do mentoring or
outreach projects like using co2 or
robotics or games to get students
interested and we have teared
participation all the way from K through
12 students all the way up through
faculty and industry and that conference
really instills in them the values of of
our program and of actually that
computing is a skill that is we're
privileged to have and that it's part of
our responsibility to give back with
that and that resonates with women and
with underrepresented minorities we've
also scaled some other practices
including mentoring pair programming or
pair learning research and research
experiences across the Alliance which
are also very very good so we've had a
total of over 1100 students in the stars
Alliance since 2006 and we've had 88
faculty involved from 49 different
schools the few that aren't continuing
are ones that decided that they were
going to continue doing stars but not
necessarily to send us reports that we
require every year or else there was one
school that didn't have a computing
department and our direction wasn't
appropriate for them so half of those
students are women so that is over 550
women have been in stars over forty five
percent African American and ten percent
Hispanic and these are orders of
magnitude higher than the number of
women we have in general computing
program so we are targeting these
underrepresented minorities but we do
have plenty of you know white men in our
programs to who are interested in making
a difference and these groups the
students choose what kind of projects
they like to do and what they have done
is many of them have chosen to do
outreach to K through 12 and they have
conducted outreach to over 46,000 K
through 12 students in these six years
and we're very excited about that and
the average number of contact hours is
about two and a half or three so each of
those people has spent a few hours with
people in computing who are interested
in getting them excited about it we've
developed leaders the faculty and the
students themselves are all
developing their leadership skills and
making decisions about how to make a
difference in computing and we've
actually added 27 new schools in our
partnerships since 2011 and we say that
stars has been institutionalized in 18
schools and what that means is that
those schools have adopted stars
practices into their their everyday
business so they have a student
organization or a class or requirements
that engage students in the stars
community and in and doing something to
give back I mean we have had seven
celebrations with over 1,700 attendees
and we're building a national compute
community of broadening participation in
computing leaders and we have almost 700
people in our online portal you're
welcome to join it we're also trying to
take our best practices and put them in
a digital library to share with everyone
and that's part of the broadening
participation portal online and we've
written papers about what we're doing
and just to give you an idea of what you
might be able to do even if you don't
join stars you're probably already doing
a lot of stars type activities at your
university most universities have some
kind of cohort of students that are a
fleet of TAS for some introductory
courses you probably have some kind of
mentoring program even if it's through
sort of a higher level in your college
or something but what we do is we put a
community around that and we empower the
students to make decisions about how
they'd like to make a difference in
computing and we encourage them to do
that together as a group so if you have
a program say where you have students
mentoring one another get them together
together call them stars and you know
ask them to think about you know how
they can get more people involved and
get people excited about computing
empowering them with that vision
actually makes a big difference for the
students and sort of treating them as a
community getting them to act together
and honoring them and recognizing their
achievements actually makes a big
difference and the celebration is one
big way that they see that there's a
community of people that are really
interested in this and they feel a part
of something larger and we've actually
seen that participation in stars has
improved computing efficacy
to perceive social relevance of
computing their commitment to computing
as a field and a career on their
identity as people who are in computing
and their GPA has all gone up and so you
may have thought that you know we're
getting the we're often getting the best
students in computing because those are
some of the best people to recruit more
people but also they're spending time
outside of class doing things that
aren't computing assignments so you
might expect that their GPA would go
down but it doesn't in fact and many of
them are now interested in graduate
school so I think I've said most of this
but we we actually actively supreme oat
all the institutions and stars to build
partnerships with regional organizations
like boys and girls clubs or others it
looks like amount of time but it's a
good thing I only have one more slide so
and we've done lots of different types
of outreach and different types of
collaboration with other organizations
and I'm very happy to talk to you about
that Thank you Thank You Tiffany and
everyone else so I would like to take a
moment before before we open up the
floor to questions just to acknowledge
rain Johnson who couldn't be here with
us today unfortunately but if she was
here she would be sitting right here and
I would be sitting out there somewhere
so we look forward to rain coming back
very soon so I was planning on asking
each of you very provocative and
engaging questions but because we're
down to about 10 minutes left I think
it'd be best if we open it up to the
group and ask you to ask the provocative
and engaging questions yeah right here
women in computer I felt there was a
really common theme and it was a common
theme of reaching out to individual
women encouraging them through trying to
help them create create a community and
using that community sort of reinforced
and grow so i wanted to i was just
recently measure for America a study
that from from social science research
council announced that women get paid 49
cents on the dollar in Silicon Valley
this is lower than the $77 cents on the
dollar than they get paid at the United
States follow and the reason I sort of
started thinking about this is that
that's a really significant structural
disincentive right what does it say so
now we will know this so I come work for
me you can get paid less than half or
any mail call without paying them never
be a little extreme there you know this
is despite the or Pay Act of 1963 in the
US and I sort of wonder like what did he
do about these really significant
structural in
how do how do we engage those because i
know i think they interact with your
efforts to encourage individual because
they sits out there in the ecosphere of
career choices so i sort of wondered
what do we do about these structural
disincentives how do we handle loads yep
that's a good question anybody want to
take it okay I can take it it's a it
sounds like a workforce question so I
think this I don't have an answer it's
not like we know exactly how we would
storm that okay barricade but but a
couple things kind of come to mind one
we are working now to our workforce
alliance and other groups in the
corporate sphere in startups as well to
to educate about best practices you know
try to put that data in front of people
and along with ideas about what they can
do about it with the hope that we're all
good spirited fair people and that once
people are made aware of some of this
but things can change okay now I don't
want to sound overly naive but but I
think there's maybe another hidden
conversation there I'm not sure cuz I
don't have all the data for this but
some of that is also what types of
technical jobs women occupy as compared
to the types of technical jobs in the
workforce that men occupied by and large
all right so a large number of technical
women report being in some of the lower
paid kinds of jobs and so part of what
we want to do is again put that issue up
in front of our corporate partners and
others and say think about this and also
in front of the women you know think
about this like where do you want to go
we want women inventing technology right
so so not a great answer to your
question maybe someone can expand on
that but but I feel like it's a very
rich question so Katherine go ahead
let's let's try and keep moving out I
when I spend a little in terms of
corporate mentality is profit driven the
arguments for diversity in your
workforce mean you make more money a
more diverse Salesforce sells more of
your products and so if you can make
these business arguments for diversity
people are much more motivated to hire
diversely and keep people happy
and part of that is reviewing their
salary so so several years ago at
Microsoft that that this was bought in
in the whole chain and now people are
monitoring it and when you monitor stuff
things start to change just like when
you write down when you put in your
checkbook every day you you change your
spending habits if you monitor it and so
so those kinds of cycles take time but i
think the like the NC wit stuff i cite
all the time now on why diversity
matters in your business and makes you a
better business and i think thats has to
be the ground start not just because we
feel good because more people are look
different it's because it helps your
business and your bottom line needs more
diverse workforce and so yes it's
discouraging for women now but i think
more and more companies realize this and
are trying to fix it so that helps and
then then go to a company like Microsoft
which monitors it and then you and then
you don't see such a big disparity thank
you so anyone else yes and I will ask
the questioners to try and be as concise
as you can so we can maximize the number
of questions we can get in in the same
thing to the respondents hi Barbara
gross Harvard I've watched and tracked
these issues for several decades now and
first I want to say thank you and how
fabulous all of your work is and I have
many questions but I'll focus on one
which is related to the issue of getting
more girls into AP courses which i think
is a critical space and the question is
you're all doing all of you who are
working with k12 are doing great
activities that are getting them really
excited I haven't looked at the AP exam
courses for a while but they don't do
that kind of activity so what about
getting some lobbying going to change
the AP courses and the AP exam so that
it would be better not only attract more
girls but attract different kinds of
guys yep Tiffany would you like to
respond yes I would like to respond to
that I should have put a slide about
this there is an effort called APCs
principles for a new advanced placement
exam and it is specifically designed to
attract a broader participation from
women
under represented minorities and it has
been in pilot since 2010 so it has had
an extraordinary group of cs educators
designing the exam and it is every
implementation of the course is full of
exciting and cool stuff including
everything from games and scratch to
Alice robots app inventor and if you're
interested in that check out CS
principles dot o RG and specifically my
project is the beauty and joy of
computing great another question yeah
here in the front yep give up my tongue
Liana clock chicky RC I was wondering if
you have any thoughts on computer
science with in STEM fields in the sense
that if you look at the numbers of
percentage of women undergraduates and
computer science across STEM fields were
almost the worst i think if not physics
physics has no undergraduates there are
statistically significant but other than
that you right other than physics we're
doing worse pretty much than anyone else
what makes us so much less attractive oh
well you know let me just there's a few
things with real briefly first of all I
think that right now in the United
States most of our young people don't
have access to any computer science of
any merit in their in their high schools
you know I think that it should be
requirement for young people to graduate
from high school I'd say all over the
world if I could be king or queen and
and they don't have access to it so they
don't know I mean they really don't know
and so a lot of the other STEM
disciplines they see in high school but
they don't see rigorous relevant
inclusive computer science in high
school there's no exposure really
basically at the end of the day and so
we need to we need to really fix that
and then I think there are other
cultural issues which we don't have time
to go into where when you are in an
underrepresented group and a majority
kind of a situation kind of odd dynamics
happen in classrooms and cultures that
really need to be brought to the
forefront so I just want to add if
you're not aware of the
initiatives that are going on in Great
Britain right now to have come well
informed computing starting from k k
through 12 and so just having computing
as part of the well-educated person to
train their workforce so so to drive an
initiative like that in the u.s. is much
harder because of our distributed
education system but we should be
motivated by competitive and falling
behind that these kinds of programs if
they work at all are going to be in
China and India before we know it and
we're going to be behind because we
haven't kept up with curriculum reform
so I think you can motivate people in a
number of different ways to do much
better and then the earlier people are
introduced to different fields the more
likely they are to choose them alright
well I think that's about all the time
we have today please offer our panelists
one last round of applause and thank you
all also for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
