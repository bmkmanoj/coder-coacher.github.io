sampling is a powerful statistical tool
it allows us to analyze portions of
large datasets rapidly when the rest of
the data is not available or is
computationally too expensive to review
confidence intervals are a common way to
show how certain we can be about any
value each confidence interval
summarizes a distribution as a single
bar showing where 95% of the values are
likely to fall unfortunately it can be
very difficult to carry out basic tasks
like comparing bars to each other in
this chart we are seeing estimates of
total sales for a store based on samples
for four different time periods how
likely is it that the 1993 bar has a
lower value than the 1995 bar this
problem is even more visible with
progressive sampling in which you look
at increasingly sized samples in this
paper we introduce tools that allow
users to quantify uncertainty for
specific tasks
the first task is comparing a bar to a
constant the user can interactively
choose a value the system Maps the
colors of the bars to the probability
that the bars value is greater than the
line dark red bars are definitely higher
dark blue bars are definitely lower and
white bars are ambiguous
we can also
which bars are within a range the user
now slits the position and size of the
range dark bars are most likely to be
within the range later bars are likely
to fall out of it we can compare one bar
to the others we select this bar which
is highlighted with the dotted line the
other bars are covered by a probability
that they are larger than the selected
bar
we can identify the minimum and maximum
values in the chart the pie charts show
the probability that each bar will be
the highest or lowest value in this case
we can be fairly certain that the purple
bar for 1995 is going to be the highest
the lowest bar is more ambiguous while
1992 is likely 1994 is also possible the
sort tool visualizes the ranks of
distributions in this chart we know the
highest bar will be 1995 1993 is likely
to be second by 1994 is a contender
we redundantly map color height and
width to certainty this visualization is
also useful for the top case scenario
when we might have hundreds or thousands
of values and only want to know what
items are likely to fall in the top ten
here we merge rows one two three to show
the odds of each item falling within the
top three
these visualizations were designed to
work in progressive scenarios - as we
read through a large file we can watch
the probabilities converge in any
visualization smooth animation allows
the user to track changes between values
you
the sort tool cushion that the shock of
changes in rank by showing how values
converge note the sudden shifts on the
left as more data comes in the rank list
changes suddenly in arrow tool
probabilities change smoothly instead
note that in both views over time the
high ranks converged before the lower
ones do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
