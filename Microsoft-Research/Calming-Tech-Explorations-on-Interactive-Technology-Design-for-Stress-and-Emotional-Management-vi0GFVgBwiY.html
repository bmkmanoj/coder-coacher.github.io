you
okay everybody welcome um it's my
pleasure to introduce pop up Eddie D
penalties sorry fit that uh here today
from Berkeley and Paul was gonna talk
about our favorite topic today his
research on calming and anti-stress
technology thank you thank you Mary well
hello everybody as Mary said I come from
Berkeley I'm going to spend test two
minutes spinning a little bit about my
own so that you know it doesn't sound
weird some of the things I've been doing
so I basically joined the school two
years ago after you know doing a lot of
research on my own in anxiety because of
a family member who actually has OCD
obsessive-compulsive disorder and
through him I discovered cognitive
behavioral therapy it goes after 10
years of cocktails of medications he was
making basically no progress and i was
able after my i did actually masters
before and after my my working in in
this company miami i was able to find
out a bilingual therapist because he
speaks only spanish so I took him to
Miami and in one month seventy-five
percent of his symptoms were reduced
what didn't happen in ten years so
that's what got me like very intrigued
wait a minute what is the cbt thing like
this only talking right there's nothing
else and doing things so I started
reading a research and I actually got
pretty interested in in this cold field
of CBT i started spending some of my own
money hiring some students in my home
country in ecuador i had to go back
there it was mandatory for me to go back
because of my Fulbright scholarship it's
a matter of fact I couldn't take a job
offer from Microsoft they'll Indian
offer and I they couldn't handle my visa
so I had to go back so I was working
there and and I pay I was paying and
basically spending a lot of money and
then you know after like four or five
years I was working then I went to
Brazil I'm doing this
teaching management and lots of other
different things like you know product
development I decided that I want to
quit everything and just do it right
there I'm doing research at night i'm
going to research during the day so i
quit my job the intel told me now you
can stay as a director for broadband and
all these things I told him no it's I'm
just quitting and I went to to Berkeley
whoo-hoo-hoo which has been my home for
the last two years so now I'm really
putting my interests in place so it's
been fascinating two years and so far
we've been doing comment egg and we've
been doing other stuff too because my
interest is a broad interest in mental
health however lately the focus has been
a little bit on on the stress because
seems like stress is looming as you know
one of the main reasons for an accessory
rating factor for almost everything in
mental health and a lot of problems also
on the physical health you know right
now obesity is affected by stress
cardiovascular problems are affected by
stress so stress is important but the
biggest issue that we have with the
stress is that people understand it
caregivers understand that's a problem
everybody now that's a problem but it's
just difficult to manage it's not as if
you tell people it just relax right like
that would be wonderful if people will
just relax that will be the end of it
but it's not that's why there's
cognitive behavioral therapy for you
know anxiety management and and all
these group sessions and you know that's
why we talk with people and we rant
about things and we vent or there's so
many ways to do it they should oh is
that you know contemporary you know a
stress management looks more like these
you know you don't manage it well like
when you're super stress and you go get
drunk and start hitting things and
kicking and fighting and yelling so the
promise you don't catch a stress early
on and you don't do much when it's
building up you know it's a stress
builds up over time so it will be great
if we could do something with technology
to actually understand stressor
it grows and we help manage it manage it
because you don't need to eliminate the
stress it stress is also useful for you
to actually do stuff right the way that
you get things done you confront some
challenge and then you get there anxious
and stress and that's good because gets
you moving and doing stuff to try to
solve the problem the issues when you
don't handle it well when you let it you
know overcome your your abilities to
actually cope with it and one thing that
this is not proven it's just my
perspective one thing like that you know
you but it's it's been you know written
in books like you know why zebras don't
don't get stressed from support skin in
stamford that basically you know animals
are very interesting they get also
stressed like zebras when they're being
hunt and they run then when they are
done we're running daily just relax
again they don't keep being stressed so
there are two two two two interesting
things there's that they actually use
stress usually but they don't remain
stress and second they do something with
stress when stress appears and I think
used to happen with us in as humans in
the past right we used to be see some
thread and then we either run or yell or
scream or kick or whatever and we but
what happened now that we have so many
stress that comes through a computer or
to a device it comes to you and you get
stressing what you do do you yell and
your office or like jump or run or no
you sit there you know molding you're
feeling worse so there is this very
important component physical component
that shouldn't be you know it's not only
mental that's the confusion that some
people have it now it's all know it's
all it's not only mental there's this
huge interaction with the autonomous
nervous system right you actually need
to get moving you need to blood to flow
you need to start breathing a different
rate to actually do something stress
however before I actually get into their
how while we're doing about stress I
just want to launch here a question
which i think is not completely answered
by the community who's doing a stress in
general its stress is not thoroughly or
uniformly define
even in in the in the DIA in the manual
for for for for mental disorders not
listed as a as a person issue right not
an issue is not listed as a depression
is an anxiety is not listed as a disease
so so what is it you know there's some
definitions from kohan Lazarus and
others who said you know it's the
ability that you have to cope or not
with some thread or some problem and
then it's committee but it's also you
know the environment environmental
components and the perception of what
the thread is you know it's like it's
one way to explain this is some people
say like oh no stress you always be you
know simple to define when you see a
trait i say yeah but what if i'm working
through mission the mission district in
san francisco if it's me I get stressed
but it's like Chuck Norris or somebody
who can fight he doesn't care it doesn't
get stressed right he can kick anybody
so it depends on what is the perception
that you have to deal with with the
problem too it's not only about
environment and what what do you think
you can do yeah so if it stress is not
thoroughly defined then what calmness
means to write so I think it's an open
question i'm not trying to you know
generate a lot of polemic discussion
here but i think it's fair to to ask
what kindness means you know some people
believe that calmness is about just like
sitting still and relax and doing
nothing well not necessarily you can
become a also be moving and doing a
staff you know or calmness about having
these relaxing thoughts not necessarily
you may actually be dealing with a
problem solving it but you could do it
in such a way that you're actually
coping it correctly so i think it's
interesting to see that stress
definitely has to do about trying to
confront and cope with with some problem
so comments you also be a way to help
you deal with this problem in a way that
actually doesn't hurt you that's the way
I see calmness once again this is open
for discussion but I wanted to bring it
up front way we see it so why are we
what are we kind of trying to do right
now
in Berkeley we have a team my advice or
drunken he has a team of students who've
been doing hardware software DSP and
machine learning and a lot of
interesting stuff and basically there's
some product that have been coming out
of it and we're putting everything
together to try to close the loop
because the way we see is Trezise die
it's not only about monitoring it and
knowing how it looks it has to a lot to
do how you deal with it so we're trying
to do from the monitoring part to the
intervention all these all these
components and of course the detection
part which so they're giridih me think
so starting with the first part which is
the biometric monitoring by the way feel
feel free to stop me at any point any of
you have any questions we don't have to
wait till dinner this is a ninth
iteration of a system that's been
developed over the last five six years
by by John Kennedy student reza nima you
can contact him there if you want to
he's actually a brilliant doing this
type of he's embedded all these things
in one little one square inch well with
more than square inch device that's very
portable and you can measure a lot of
interesting stuff and also all the right
metrics I guess all of them are
interested interesting you know there's
a lot of research that's been done
around electrodermal activity you know
research and MIT and affective computing
love with Ross Picard and all them but i
think her variability is one of the most
interesting ones right it's the the one
that's closely tied to the autonomous
nervous system part of stray the
physical part of stress for those who
are of you who are not to wear you know
don't know their tuna Missouri system
I'm not going to give a lecture Nava so
when I explained that basically the
autonomous nervous system is everything
all the nervous components that have
with that we don't have conscious
control right it's just working right
like digestion and breathing in the
heart
so we cannot stop the heart consciously
right so its autonomous and there is two
components the parasympathetic and
sympathetic components which basically
are due to elements of that system one
that works with arousal when you get
super excited you know it activates and
gets you your blunt pumped to your you
know limp so that you start running
faster and it gets you you know your
breathing faster so you can react better
and the the other one is more like you
know the relaxed movement movements of
digestion and another type of thing so
so basically those two are working there
and her ever abilities so far showing
pretty interesting correlations with
with with the alterations of these two
components and actually Reza's thesis is
akiza bio bio engineering student so
he's trying to see if he can actually
map those parasympathetic and
sympathetic variations through some of
these different delivered derivatives so
it's it's pretty interesting but so far
I mean higher variability basically
what's doing is giving us a small
peeping window I would say to towards
what's happening with our body in stress
so we have this thing and the way we're
basically uh you know this is a
parasympathetic and sympathetic systems
the way we basically analyze these is by
observing the variation of of these two
systems or the way that it should work
these two systems by measuring the
variations between I'm sorry it's
actually this one you know between the
hour intervals you know I I don't want
to get into a super detail of her every
religion Alice's if you don't want me to
because you know there's a lot it could
be a whole talk about this but basically
you know analyzing the variations
between the peak intervals and in hard
it's not hard right its heart rate
variability you have a question we talk
about stress
since if you took you know there is also
the time domain so there is a stress you
hear loud noise cochino stress which is
similar to what you were talking about
the zebras and there is a dress of you
giving the talk in front of an audience
which is a longer time period but
there's also the stress of you know I
have a job which is stressful so when
you're talking about these metrics or
these measurements what type of stress
do they capture yeah so we so far the
one that we'd be using to study is more
day a cute one acute the stress rather
than to the chronic one that looms over
time however it that's a very good
question because the way that we have
been trying to study acute stress is by
actually screening people with chronic
stress and the reason we're doing we've
done that is because for calibration
purposes you want to kind of measure you
know people who have kind of a similar
state of you know stress because if you
observe people who have some sort of
stress a chronic stress alteration let's
say an exciting disorder or nothing with
that let's say somebody died in the
family that type of stress can last for
months or if you have a divorce or
something like that that type of stress
can last for months so if you don't
control for that you will see that not
necessarily that the heart rate is
altered permanently but it actually
overshoots very quickly once you apply
the stressor the person who has chronic
stress it's immediately reaction and
goes to the roof and it's interesting
because also the coming part is also
they kind of like Felix supercon there
was what we basically control for for
for this you know long week well life
events you know I and mental health but
there was this guy was who was
borderline you know in the limiters
actually scaled that that's used to
filter to screen people for worse type
of studies he was borderline and I
remember when I was like doing the study
with him he was like when we apply the
stressor he went to like 10 of stress
the subjective stress and then when he
was in the county fair aha
like he was over shooting both on the
stress in Paris phase and also in the
coming fight because he's already very
you know the prince position first
Rizzoli so it's very important here the
question we have not been studying
chronic stress we have been studying
acute stress and with people who is
supposed to be inside normal parameters
of a behavior and cognition yeah so well
I mean you know this type of DSP things
have to happen to get to extract the
function and basically at the end at the
end you get the some sort of curve that
shows her variability and it basically
changes with with stimulus one of the
best stimulus to calibrate higher
variability that we have been using is
this orthostatic test which is basically
you ask the person to lay down and be
just come for a few minutes and then you
ask them to stand up super fast so used
Lina you stand up super fast how ready
immediately changes you get anxious very
anxious generate even though there's no
cognitive or perceptual it's just the
body being moved but that's what you
know people use and then people who do
cardiovascular analysis they try to
calibrate against this type of
orthostatic test so it's a calibration
test so this is one of the measures the
metrics that we're doing the other one
that's very interesting it's a speech
and it's very interesting in many ways
because it actually it's not invasive
the other one you actually have to wear
something your body I i I'm sorry then
when they're actually there was I thing
a little picture there the guy wearing
something yeah like these guys wearing
there's many ways that right now they're
the latest one actually is nada it's not
a chest strap is actually an ear clip
that we have you don't need the headband
anymore just near clip because you need
to have some sort of photo let
for the plethysmograph graphic and spo2
oxygenation of the blood that you can
derive from that actually car driver
ability so that your lobe actually
provides that or the finger the promise
when you're doing HCI stop you put
something a finger and then you get one
hand up and then you cannot do more
right so it's better to use the ear but
still you have to put something on
people either to chest strap or
something so that's why I'm sorry that
I'm jumping back and forth but that's
why speech is very interesting that this
is something that has been explored for
the last few years there actually there
is some studies in from Georgia Tech
being triggered is called interested and
then the student of John can how he's
actually working for ms are now so you
can ask him personally he's actually
lead or his name his name shall be it
should be somewhere it's his name here
oh I didn't pull his name I'll Cara give
you the his name later Kang Ho Chunk is
a student of he was a student of my lab
now his works at where's Palo Alto name
is our silicon valley Emma's are yes
he's there so he basically studied
speech and in a nutshell well we what we
can see from speech is that you you get
to very interesting company components
once the prosthetic component when you
get stress on her there's stressors you
know an Associated cognitive load and
that cognitive load basically gets you
to start speaking differently because
the processing that you the normal way
that you do processing starts changing
but it's very minor I'm it's not that
you necessarily feel you have to train
yourself to feel like psychologist
psychiat psychiatry's there per day can
detect sometimes these variations they
he actually work with psychology and
psychiatrists to try to understand what
i call the pressure speech or things
like that right which is basically in a
nutshell is basically people speaking
making bit longer process than normally
between words or sentences but
microseconds
Francis that basically indicated there's
that's a prasada component but the other
component is also very interesting which
is the glottis so when you get stressed
there is my mom muscular tension tension
and actually the tension in the neck is
it's popularly known to be a very good
sign of stress well that tension also
affects your your vocal tract miniscule
changes yes something else I'm sorry can
you go any when you get that kind of
frost when you hear somebody kind of
model fry alrighty is that the sign that
you're talking about are your it's too
fast to even tell no it's too fast to
even tell ya no it's not it's not a very
specific noise or anything it is too
fast it's it's something that you really
have to train yourself as I said some
psychiatry is actually detect some
variations in this page you know after
being 20 years of listening to the press
patients or answer anxious patients they
actually develop this ability to
understand the difference like a good
musician who understands any minor
variation well yeah it's kind of a
different that you have to have a good
base level say how this person speak
he's not stressed yeah take away this
common of an absolute difference that
you can feel no it's not it's not an
absolute difference I think you can
eventually reach up a better
approximation of an absolute difference
and that's some of the work that can
have been pursuing by the end there's
some personal element it's more like
personal he worked with I think 80
patients over the course of two years
and with two psychiatrists to gather the
data and try to explore this and he
actually got some sort of Jenner generic
tool but it applied to very specific
case which was depression in that case
and it was it had some good result but
that was word for that specific problem
if you want to generalize other types of
variations of how stress looks in
different people or how fear look
so far is not completely done but I
think it can be done it's just a matter
of keep getting more data and processing
information but the great thing is that
you know well the toolkit that he
developed it's called the Amman toolkit
and he basically got a best price best
price prefer know that but he basically
did all this type of components were
from very simple microphone there's no
special microphone so simple microphone
and at this point he actually got it
completely developed for the cell phone
so it works with a cell phone I he
basically got I think the result some
researcher here he basically got to
compare with positive and negative
emotional clips and study that was done
for another project before the opens my
project and also for stress versus
increase versus stress decrease and he
got actually better results and the
previous system this open smile system
which was done with a much more complex
system rather than a simple microphone
so so far so good I mean progress is
being made it's I think another
long-term voice could be a very good
tool to actually measure maybe arousal
and maybe some emotions not all of them
but some of them so this is a tool kit I
think he's actually putting them
available as an open source so if you
want to follow up with him you know just
got to work write an email to him like
pick up the phone is I'm sorry the other
thing that we're exploring from sensors
perspective is one that I'm very
interested and I'm actually working with
another student is they like let's
forget about any other sensor let's just
use what we have right let's just use
cameras and mouse and mice and keyboards
to this to detect stress why not
there's already some research that was
done in Scotland I think some people
where they can actually detect fear
through the keyboard and basically what
they're measuring is also the pauses
between the keystrokes keystrokes see
it's a normal keyboard weren't talking
about pressure in the keyboard or
pressure in the mouse we actually were
tempted to work with one of the mouse
that Microsoft has you know the pressure
my eyes will be interesting and we may
do it at some point but which one see we
can do it with normal mouse just can we
do it with normal mouse in the mouse
what we're trying to measure is
basically the cognitive load through
through your you know links limbs get
affected you know through through
cognitive loads and emotional component
so right now we're capturing all the
data we're in the process of getting all
the data actually do over the summer and
we hope to you know get results but we
initially we have seen some sensibility
in good mice though not in any mail you
have unit gaming mouse that level of
precision to actually get good data
normal mouse doesn't get you enough
information you need the very precise
DPI mouse but we're working on that the
next one that we want explore is the you
know the the accelerometry in the
smartphone there's actually some papers
on people studying handshakes which I
found find very interesting you know
handshake as a as a proxy for depression
and they actually discovered some
interesting correlations so i said well
i mean we keep you know handing their
the smartphone we should do something
with it so we're going to start also
working on that as soon as we're done
with the mouse that will be very cool
then you have complete you know
monitoring and you have to block nothing
you don't have to get people talking
because voice sounds interesting but you
have to get people to talk and that's
not a trivial problem that's actually a
very complicated problem we did some
research on how can we get people
talking it's not not simple
you can top wire the phone but that's
neta cabral you have an ethical issue
there this one might be easier huh it's
right with my phone yeah you don't need
to work right it's local in your phone
it should work fine yeah so that's why
he really wanted to get it into the
smartphone working well so this is kind
of what we have on the sensors part now
we're gonna I'm going to switch briefly
to the intervention part because as we
told you know it yeah we sends all these
things in it so what what do we do with
it so we have been exploring also
interventions you know some mobile
interventions we created a study that
was actually a small study that was
published in chi 2 years ago where we
applied several interventions we asked
our stress people up and all under IRB
no never yeah with permission with dress
people up and so that we actually I know
I have it here lemme see and I don't
have it here I'm sorry so we stress them
up with very simple tool we stressors
one is the the math there regressive
subtraction exercise and the other one
was the the Stroop color test yeah it's
simple yeah so we used troop and in this
regressive mad exercise it was funny
because everybody was telling me how
chill you applied math to CS or an
engineering student they know Matt so
well well that's why it's actually very
good very effective because once they
make a mistake they become so
self-conscious and instead they become
deeper stress rather than people who
don't care about math oh yeah yeah so
the regression is very very simple i
tell you like start subtracting 17 from
2013 and get 20 that's it so you start
2013 and then you two thousand one one
thousand nine hundred you start
subtracting not even see I'm straight I
cannot do it right now
you start subtracting down and
eventually you make a mistake always
there's people who is very very very
good and they actually don't but you
know they make a mistake we actually
added that time component we said it in
four seconds you don't give the answer
then we ask you to go back to the
beginning again yes test yeah because
you're not always even detecting that
you're making an error so you're looking
for speed so what did you do is oh no
this troop was a separate the I agree
yeah I get that I'm just wondering how
do you set to deliberately induced
stress oh it's true yeah you started
raising the speed of the color and yeah
so the Stroop test is basically the they
show you a word sorry I don't have these
lights I thought I they show you the
word with a color right but you have to
say the color that you see not the word
so right now is blue blue it's fine but
then when you I show you the word you
know blue blood red you have to say red
yeah how you know they're not enjoying
it yeah I mean some people actually
enjoyed it yeah we asked them at the end
some comments but not the majority this
is it matter if they're stressed
negatively or stress positively
presumably
that's how very that's actually a very
interesting question that's a very
interesting that they call the u.s.
stress and the what was the other one ah
destroy distressing you stress right the
positive and you are they different in
any way I think room only and may be the
biological compounds are very similar we
are not there yet which is have few
metrics right now one of them gets you
doing things the other one good I don't
know it's very debatable I mean like
they say that some of the greatest
painters and writers were like they had
OCD just kept riding they were sick and
they just kept riding fantastic style or
painting non-stop even the st. you know
for those who have like Catholic way I
used to be Catholic you know this just
there's all these things and you read
and they just kept within themselves
when they were obsessive-compulsive so
were they is it good that I know it's
how you interpret it too right yeah no
no we're so where we induced those does
stress stressors and we actually got a
curve I'll show you later and they
actually work these were the some of the
interventions one was the guided
breathing exercise the second were some
games and haptic feedback the guided
breathing was basically using a small
bracelet that we design and we asked
them to breathe when they think I braids
and stop breathing when it doesn't
vibrate so it was more happy we want
them to close their eyes and not to hear
anything just to feel through the skin
and get them breathing very interesting
very interesting because some people
were really relaxed and some people will
extremely anxious at the end the ones
who were relaxed most of them I didn't
do a thorough analysis I should have by
then we're singers sports people people
who do yoga do yoga people who know how
to breathe already people who don't know
how to breathe you know it's ads low
places that you need they start
hyperventilating like
stay economic I don't want to breathe
anymore like why do you make me really
so that's interesting thing people who
know how to breathe actually did well
people who didn't know they actually
much worse calm down yes yes so
interesting the games was also
interesting off the shelf we pick two
games the one was the guy running and
she's jumping things and the other one
was the balls we have to put into we
didn't do a thorough research this
should be researched profoundly what
type of games well we wanted something
that doesn't get people super engaged
like with numbers and thing but you do
get people engaged with gaming that's
the issue you know that's it some people
actually sell yeah it's kind of
distracted me and you know that's dope
that was were what we wanted to do with
the game just get too distracted for a
few minutes as a matter of fact that the
inspiration came from a very you know
empirical source I was my brother used
to tell me he has OCD deco and sometimes
for him to relax he plays with the cell
phone and he kind of lets the mind off
and then he relaxes so I said well let's
let's see how it works so it did work
with some people they are set out cool
some people would get super engage with
the game and like none okay so but you
know wait way I had feels like no stop
right they actually get more anxious so
it's again it's a double-edged sword the
haptic feedback was actually used with
this bracelet that I told you who used
it for doing acupressure this was also
you know we wanted to see vacu pressure
has any significance it was also kind of
like you know justice big humors about
this thing let's see back you pressure
work because there's a lot of debate
Ibaka pressure actually work so we
research a living in Chinese medicine
one of the guys who was from Taiwan and
he said like yeah why don't you think
she work so there's actually according
to that medicine some pressure points in
your recent here so we asked them to
actually press against with the bracelet
you know press against your recent press
against your chest surprisingly enough
some people actually felt some relief I
know it was novelty or the acupressure
say that
part I cannot guarantee at this point so
it was very exploratory study I think
might work may not but what was
definitely was awkward everybody felt
very awkward because it's not part of
the culture that's the other problem
with stress is a perceived component and
there's a stigma associated with it so
you ask people to do weird stuff and
then people even if it's good for you
they still don't feel well actually
somebody came from national taiwan
university to visit and he saw these
things oh that's fantastic yeah i will
apply quickly he's from taiwan is like
this is great people do it all the time
i said here here's nobody inside that
way they're here everybody like why are
you asking me to present my wrists and
my chest like weird values through the
through the different intervention yeah
yeah we did yes just curious sometimes
these can be a mere two set did you look
for figuring out where the actual motor
point was to set the sensors before you
put more people you could just kind of
guesstimate we guesstimate we we kind of
try to you know we did steal them from
Taiwan we'd read some books and you know
where the points should be but it's
complicated yeah it was more like this
was more like let's play with this
rather than anything it wasn't like
perfect should be pressed here actually
as a matter of fact is like it's here
not even in the middle is like in this
side according to the book so well well
it's a guesstimate yeah so this one is
more like a play the okay are ways to
use electric current to find out where
the right
golly thanks yeah the one that actually
got a super excited though it was the
social interpret that was the 14th or
the social one so we say okay how do
people calm down one very effective way
is through interaction with other humans
they go and talk with their friends and
loved ones they say oh I have this
problem and a condom though right they
tell them things words that help people
regain their calmness so what we did is
we are basically instead of applying the
intervention directly we send a message
to a loved one a friend she works were
in for Microsoft first day here today
actually she is this still from Berkeley
she's starting today um yeah we
basically said you know she's stressed
do something about it just make him make
her laugh or tell her something positive
and they sent something like this
messages like this like for me means
nothing i mean what dogs birds a
motorcycle dahhh well she started she
started laughing like oh man this is
great yeah yeah and she felt like so
relax and so she said I'm not just rely
on my powers like but what is this day I
had to ask her like what is this ducks
oh that was a vacation where we actually
went through this lake and you know we
saw a dog and in the middle there was
this bear that actually went through a
mother psyche on it was so funny like
three word for five words basically a
nutshell generating this whole complete
experience but more powerful than
telling mission right which is
imagination so it's that man this is
cool right yes yeah we haven't who we
asked for two people we asked for two
people that we call tap and they most of
the people that they gave us worried the
best friends or boyfriend girlfriend or
mom or dad those are the people who they
usually want to get in touch with yes
and we got consent from them to you know
send a message and we asked them to be
aware of the message because we want to
use the actual SMS
not much as a fake thing there's a study
that they've been done before in the
past where they actually have the log
when waiting in a room and once instead
of having SMS you ask the loved one to
to come for a minute or two and comfort
them and then leaves so there is evident
there was evidence that you know people
actually come each other you know we
know that I'd appearently but we went to
do it three SMS and and it was pretty
cool it worked very well and most of the
messages were humor either based on
narratives or humor most of them were
like very funny things like they started
smiling or very beautiful narratives
that to remember something some of them
were more direct like calm down I love
you very much that also works no sort
but most of them were more creative than
that you got tomorrow we actually
ran later a based on these findings we
ran a assured Turkish experiment where
we wanted to see can actually people
create narratives out of bad moments
like if I cut somebody but this is a bad
moment can you actually create a
humorous funny narrative around the bad
moment and I have some results i'll
publish it someday but basically we told
him like there is this person who's
taking a test and super stress and and
the person cannot study because of the
stress so can you create a narrative has
to be a narrative that's funny around
that and they were very interesting very
very creative things through Turk
completely unrelated people nothing to
do with a person one of them if i recall
well was this guy who said oh yeah you
ask your friend to pretend that he's God
and do you ask him like oh god I need to
pass this test and then he said yeah
well how can I tell you how can I help
you oh well I don't know these what is
the subject is astronomy oh man God says
know how that when I didn't pass either
so you know that so yeah that's what you
want to laugh once you get the laughter
then that you have a company you don't
need more than that once you get
laughing then the hook test becomes
relevant funny now it became funny
or this other one well so I mean there's
all sorts of humor these other one where
the person was saying like oh ask your
girlfriend to call her and say like oh
honey I i have a problem it's like no
but i am studying for a test yeah but
this problem is it more serious and like
what I'm pregnant it was a good and that
the person's like no no it's just a joke
so you know once you get the person
completely out of the the test and their
mind you know test becomes nothing front
in front of pregnancy right so you know
I mean I haven't explored that it's the
subject deeply but we are very
interested in this reaction very
interesting it's just words right so at
the end summarizing this intervention
what we did is basically uh the other
week we observe that they are definitely
context sensitive right this very same
thing that can calm you down can stress
your luck even the messages had some
people who were very like they were
reading and looking at me like they
don't want to have an intimate message
in front of a stranger it becomes
stressful for them to be in front of the
intimate powerful message the the well
the social network not only comes what
empowers and the last one is yeah what I
said you know do you definitely need to
train people to use these tools it's not
something you can just launch yeah well
one of the numbers that i have here is
so this is basically the distress curve
oh here's here are the faces that we
applied so we basically apply the the
they entered the study that we come them
then we applied Stroup then we had an
anticipation face than math and then we
come them again and we basically plot
the reaction this is the subjective
reading of stress and we saw this is
actually statistically significantly p
equals of five people actually got
stress and come with interventions that
we had games were less effective in
general
than than others so the social network
had the biggest impact in terms of
subjective stress yeah yeah yeah yeahs
stressed like you know not zero stress
yeah well this is the level they entered
yeah so it's not that yeah when when you
walk into a room and you want somebody
to be you ask them how they always have
a baseline and then we actually get them
to come the first time you calm them
down and this is actually a very
interesting question from our research
perspective because people say like oh
you should bring them to a baseline yeah
right how do you do that oh just ask
them to sit there well that's an
intervention so just ask them to do
nothing no that's an intervention
without any interventions we will we
will get them going up in the stress we
will have a rich maybe this level or
this level of stress they will have
remain stressed we owe you mean apply
I'm talking about applying only stress
yeah only applying a stress with no
calmness no I mean it will eventually go
down it will eventually go down but it
won't go as fast it will eventually go
down potentially you know I mean it's
just a 30-minute intervention a
30-minute study so eventually could go
down they will go out with somebody
there so that's actually brings a fair
question like do we actually need to do
something just let you know the course
of life take care of it so that's why i
posted the question initially what is
the stress and calmness and should we
actually do something about it I think
there's some people who would benefit
from something some sort of glue some
sort of intervention there's some people
who just deal with it normally deal with
the stress normally they are resilient
and effective
ethically we shouldn't let them leave oh
yeah no no ethically we were mandated to
calm them at the end I mean that was
part of IRB we had to calm them down and
leave and they actually left that they
were pretty much at the same level that
they entered so the effect was you know
subtracted eventually there is a there
is a little snapshot of what hrv looked
in this the same thing it's harder to
interpret HR business you know it's a
complicated nature but you do see the
depiction this actually inverted pns or
resonance should be a you could plug the
other way around but sometimes is the
pure way to read it so did you know the
lowest is more stress rather than that's
right so you do see changes in HIV too
and there are we actually need to crunch
some more data on this HIV to to get the
better analysis the problem that we're
facing though I don't know if you have
been facing this is that there's not a
good correlation between subjective and
and biometric stress there's people who
tell you that they are super calm and
their HR bitches in the roof but they
keep telling you that the aircon and the
other way around these people who don't
get to arouse and there are these are
like super stress now
I know I'm super labile and then Austin
where she's in here is just completely
flattened yeah we're very different well
there's this theater these uh what's
this / alexithymia right this signals
are you familiar with that there are
Lexi time is it a sickness that some
males develop adult males they basically
where they basically taught them
systematically to shut down their
emotion and reading their body you know
like don't cry you're a boy or you know
you should be strong and all these these
people some of these male get to the
role of life and they just don't reader
their body well their emotions and they
eventually they are there you ask them
how are you doing I'm fine I'm fine but
you'd feel their muscles are contracted
I'm fine and then pump me hard then
there is a bad word what do you what i
read from your pee say that there is
bias which is different different people
but is when they say that now oh yeah
yeah yeah we actually normalized these
we rank these two to do the comparisons
we actually went to rank them you know
to normalize the line base night yeah
some people very 81 point up one point
down some people for it 34 points up
point for point sound so yeah there's a
the relative variation at the end you
know it's just the way you interpret
things that's the way the subjective
works the hrb in theory should be more
reliable because it's the heart but this
is a tough question because how do you
know who's lying i mean at the end what
is the stress is it the subjective
problem is the body issue if I don't
feel like I'm stress am I or not if I
think I am not so this is actually where
one of the big big problems right now
we're facing with stress in general
because I've discussed this with
psychologists people these there's these
we had a long conversation with nima
mirage virology from Stanford
like poke like three hours about like
how do we solve this problem and it's
not an easy problem he actually said you
should do your thesis and I was like
Jesus Christ let's see if I finish it
just use the sensor data physiologically
yeah it's better that's better from a
physiological perspective yes now you
can also go from the other side I agree
I mean yeah you will be healthier right
however if you still feel like you
you're worthless and you do nothing you
start moving in so it's like what's the
balance between like I'm healthy but I'm
so miserable or do I wear so yeah it's a
big debate at the end what I'm trying to
say here is that there's not a strong
correlation between subjective and
objective for some humans so the
question is maybe it's that humans are
not some humans are not able to read
their body signals that well and yeah
and for example actually one of the
people who who who were able to too much
better the curves i was comparing some
of them are again the musicians sport
people people who are are in touch with
their bodies more often and they kind of
learn to read their body signals but now
this is just my personal comment so it's
it's not theory though dude as people
to different parts of their bodies or
you know the finger class devote which
finger can you move and see if they can
control their body parts that might
actually translate to control of the
other parts of the nervous system it
might be an interesting point it might
be maybe you know you remember that this
is autonomous nervous system so how much
can you control the NS and that is in
fact great having a fact I agree with
that part so I think I think there's an
indirect relationship I agree with you
yes so it's more like using the body as
a proxy to help day a nice yeah yeah
yeah no so say you started up by saying
that stress has a lot of influence on
our well-being mm-hmm do we know whether
the self-reported or stress or the
objective measures stress which is more
quote better correlated for example for
physical well-being well in theory I
think if you have a better A&amp;amp;S function
you should have better physical
well-being because you will your
functions will be working better but
there again what's the debate is well I
might be better by then if I mentally
I'm not healthy then we'll that
eventually also hurt my body that that's
an open question what I'm trying to say
here is like the ANS sister function if
you can maintain a better level of
functioning awareness then your body
should in theory be better you should
avoid those cardiovascular or best
obesity problems that we listed at the
beginning but that has that's not
completely correlated with your mental
health and your well-being you're
perceived well-being you could you have
a perfect body you could still feel like
not loved for example and and Stratton
things like that
what is the causality change so what
awesome that's it boy the whole discard
discard this card is the debate right is
the mind or the body the body of the
mind it's hard I wish I could tell you
yes i know it's a mind and they might
control the body and the other way
around I think there's a lot of good
research that has to be done to bridge
the gap at the end what one thing I can
tell you is that you do need a person
who has what we call self strong
self-efficacy right somebody who
believes that he can accomplish things
to actually come to even if you have a
crippled body right sometimes that helps
to have a better perceived well-being
sometimes it's the other way around so
it's very cultural too depends how leave
you got to really Janeiro everybody has
a fantastic body that's that that's what
people leave for there are they happy in
average they are the same than the rest
of the world so California has great
weather that everybody average of
happiness is the same so yeah I mean
what I'm trying to evade your question
I'm just trying to pose that there's
context and mental and body that not
necessarily they all come with the final
conclusion of well-being look Nikolas if
I if I can without changing my
subjective yeah stress levels but have a
better stress in terms of the heart rate
variation measures am I help you now
the physical yeah yeah you can and
that's what cardiovascular surgeons do
they basically focus only on that they
don't care if you're happy or neither
your thing that you're okay with your
card should be okay here yeah I think
the challenge is to bridge those two
that's the real rich complex problem but
yeah that's what cardio vascular
researchers do just to close this thing
we also run some disability analysis of
these things you know not only efficacy
to see how do people actually like
things and they like the the social
network think more they thought it was
better they perceive efficacy was higher
if you compare the versus the other the
other the other things they also think
it was the best not only good but the
best they said that they will use it in
the future and they also said that they
will frequently used it more frequently
so this doesn't mean that one is better
than the other I just want to stress
that it's just from this specific style
we run people like the social network
from a usable perspective they say
that's something that I would like to do
to the one that actually didn't work
that well it's you know from a useful
perspective where these two guys are
cute pressuring games their compression
for the awkwardness and the games
because where I we didn't do a good job
with the games that's our nurse I think
which you choose the right games it
might actually work much better so
that's kind of what we have done and
then this is I have a few more slides on
what we are thinking that we could do
too so that we can show you know share a
little bit of the ideas we are really
developed developing them but they are
working progress one of them is
machinima so we for those who know
cognitive behavioral therapy I actually
wanted to run a video that I even put
that video but it didn't work i'm sorry
maybe later i can share it isn't you
all I can tell you the link but what is
machinima for those who don't know
machinima is the mix of machine and
cinema and basically machinima is people
hacking 3dr you know virtual words like
halo or the seams or any of these and
they basically use the characters as
their actors they become directors and
they basically write the script and they
shoot their characters in the behaviors
that they want to shoot and they create
then they edit it and they create a
movie out of it there's thousands of
machine in my videos in the way I think
google invested like 30 million dollars
in machinima.com recently because it's
one of the biggest sources of video
content for YouTube so very interesting
that reason we are using machinimas
many-fold one is because the seams for
example has already a lot of very good
emotional expressions the deck
characters can show fear and sadness and
happiness many other things that we want
to use for emotion it's also pretty good
recently good to me to to hack and
manage you know what we want the actors
to do and basically it's cheap right
like 50 bucks the sims 3 this is machine
in your creative movies so the
interesting part it's not only the
technology they're very interesting part
is that how to create the movie itself
so what we did is we basically started I
don't have the stack here but we started
from a basic manual cbt manual so we are
working with a ucsf team the Latino
mental health team and they have a very
effective cbt manual that I have been
using for smoking cessation
interventions and we basically use their
manual and we read a manual and in their
manual they had things like these like
drawings and things you know okay wait
it had like tons of lines of writing and
you have to as a patient read and read
and read and read and read and some
pictures like this so cbt now
days for that type of intervention
through manuals or even through the
computerized one like mode g-man and
beating the blues and all these other
cbt tools that are out there they kind
of look like homework and that's what
you need to the patient to do our
homework they have to go back and do
homework however people don't like
homeworks and they're like feeling like
they're doing homework so we want to
create movies we want to actually do
movies around cbt so that people can't
really watch a movie three-minute movie
too many movie over an iPad or over a
phone or over a surface or whatever
right so what we have been creating
right now is the the scripts that's the
hard part we have been transcripted
translating the script from the manual
to an actual movie you know we took a
short movie making Hollywood how do you
make the movies in those typical is like
boy meets girl boy loses girl boy gets
girl back you can change that with a
farmer gets farm for me like you get a
thought you lose the todd you know you
start playing with that and we we're
working with some psychologist on the
user to create we're gonna we want to
create a telenovela for latinos actually
so that you can actually you know
Latinos love to we love to watch
telenovelas right which is keep watching
telenovelas so that's something that we
are good at now homework not so good but
telenovela is very good so can we
actually created a novella round cbt so
it has to do with Mark Lee so that
people don't get bored but we're working
on you know hacking these and getting a
telenovela out some hopefully next year
let's see or next months or something so
that's one of the things we're working
on machinima as a way to put a painter
layer of entertainment on top of cbt the
other thing that we're working is
intangible emotions yeah the reason we
are working intangible is because we
definitely need I mean emotions are
expressed so much through the body and
through other senses then
then spoken or or the mind right so
about touching it's about smelling and
feeling and and doing so many other
things emotions are extremely you know
very well press through the body so we
wanted to use the body as a proxy rather
than the mind so we are creating what we
call the happy cube we actually have
already some you know some prototypes we
basically have a bunch of sensors
embedded in the happy cube and a bunch
of actuators that would show later so we
can you know embed the voice part that
our friend you know k how already did we
can embed some biometrics like spo2 and
on the sides of this thing we will have
accelerometer so we can feel the another
accelerometry that we're working on you
can even tie it to a computer and use
their the sensors that are in the
computer if you use it as a desktop
device right that's sitting on the
desktop or it could have some sort of
bluetooth interaction with your phone to
additionally get more data so at the end
what we went to capture is capture is
this context some contextual data and
also the the stress related data that we
help us you know proxy approximately Bob
but we don't want people to see their
numbers here or see there you know oh
you are getting stressed or some know it
we want very subtle messages and like
just change the color and you can you
see that things changing from from from
green to red and you might decide that
you actually want to do something about
it's more like a notch right or you
might decide you want to turn it up it's
like the bother me I'm writing a paper
i'm not i'm supposed to be stressed
right so just turn it off or you can
start playing with it that's where we're
actually also adding some like you know
some sensors some actuators i'm sorry
we'll have sent for example that's one
of the the one that God has really
interested scent is very powerful a very
powerful tool for people to 24 memory
right for memory regulation if you if I
get you the right scent that reminds you
of some a nice moment of your life fresh
cream you know freshly cut grass or free
baked bread or something yeah right so
it will be interesting or we can embed
the the system that already see the SMS
system right just send a message we won
also these systems are being developing
right now in pairs through the network
so you can actually play games like with
your loved one or maybe send like a
queue like you know we we tap three
times in the unhappy cube and think
vibrates three times there and that
means I love you or something some Q so
then we want this the tool for people to
use their body and their imagination and
to connect with others but not no image
here no email no time no what's my next
meeting nothing we don't want this to be
another smartphone with a weird shape
because the smartphones are very
ambiguous to write they can they can
deliver good therapist but they can also
give you this terrible emails that just
get you so freaking stressed now this
should not be an information divide this
is an obtainable emotion device the
other thing that we're playing with is
gaming and narrative sorry this is a lot
of words i don't like this type of
slides but it was kind of last minute so
we have been teaching for two semesters
at class that's called gaming and
narrative technologies for health
actually i created that class with
another student when in berkeley they
give us a chance to create classes by
students for students so with the
sponsorship of faculty member junkin in
this case we develop it and we have been
trying to learn how you can actually
develop games and narratives correctly
for for health and some of the things
we've learned is are very interesting
this these three main point is like to
understand the narrative you know that
powerful narrative the birds ducks you
do need to understand where the person
seats we sometimes assume that you can
apply any narrative to anybody and
everybody will react according to the
powerful north now if you have a very
disempowering narrative already better
than you you already feel like you're
good for nothing that's a different
treatment we actually brought some
people from the Palo Alto veteran
association to to teach over the format
of the class was we brought one speaker
expert in the field and then one a one
hour of design so we did we brought for
example we brought a person from the
Palo Alto Veterans Association she gave
a talk on ill nur it'll form narratives
and then we explore her with either one
our design exercise around Caen how can
we portray in for narratives and how can
we actually change them to an empowering
one so understanding narratives are very
important focusing on the strength is
the other one sometimes you focus too
much on all you you could you could
overcome depression don't talk about
depression you could be faster you could
be stronger better nicer it's debatable
but it's important to focus on that the
other thing is the externalization of
problems we have been playing with can
we externalize that problem that problem
that box the person can we make it
tangible to or like livable so we
actually i have actually a small we're
developing what we call the monsters up
so basically the monsters up is a waste
way too for you to create your your
monster that could be stress or I have a
whole prototype here we want to see you
later powerpoint prototype but basically
you wanna we have three components q1 is
the monster itself and we also want to
show you that there's tons of other
monsters in the area lots of people with
same problem so that externalization and
seeing other monsters orbs oh I'm not
alone right I'm not the only
procrastinator in town the only stress
person in town then we want to play
games against the monsturd we do
something but we want the games to have
meaning so for example you play the
patient's game you have to hit the
monster but you have to wait five
seconds and the next round you have to
wait eight seconds and next you have to
learn to kind of control yourself before
you hit your stress at the end of your
playing we're not claiming that we're
curing anything here released but what
we hope to get is
people will remember through these
metaphors rather would say oh yeah yeah
should be patient right it should be you
know it's kind of like planting a seed
so we want to use that ability that
humans have to remember things when you
know these the fun good experiences to
teach basically people some lessons so
this is the monsters up is one of the
products we created other other
interesting for example there was these
these other thing that we came out of
that class was a funky ack they created
that it was basically a wrapper for a
for a alarm clock but the only thing
that did is that instead of you having
to wake up and do nothing you had to
give three tanks at the end of the day
before you go to sleep and then three
mantras at the beginning of the day that
was it something like that there's a lot
of thing you can explore with just
Bernard with metaphors with people and
we're very very interested about that
and working on that and and the last
thing is the dynamics dynamics of games
are very important it's not only the
look and feel is how you actually use
the dynamics of the game that actually
matter too so so that's kind of what we
have what we have been doing basically
playing more or less that's quite a few
blessed that I left my highly stressful
job and now I'm playing and yeah with a
lot of passion so thanks so much good
yes person I know we were asking a lot
while the talk was going on
just a quick observation I think it's
one just to say thank you very much for
the enjoyable presentation I love the
final slide you know just don't see that
object no matter how many more years
before people just won't recognize it uh
but other than that why a typewriter and
finally thank you for exploring such a
plethora of spaces I think one of the
strengths of the work is it you every
time we mentioned somebody say oh yeah
well we did another thing like this and
just being able to see a page of all the
things that you've been doing to explore
the space i I'd love to have to share
with people because it's so cool that
you're taking this from so many
perspectives to overlap thank you that
so if you don't have a page like that
please create it and send it to us when
you do because I'm sure we'd all like to
build a reference oh I'll do that how
you're going with the implicit
approach woman to teach so things like
patience
we had talked about micro goals for
emotional eating and getting the user to
say instead of eating say the whole bag
of chips they'll say I just won't eat
I'll leave 10 just ten ships know little
things like that where we were wondering
that would actually evoke long-term
behavior will change but we don't know
yet that's that's the ultimate goal long
term yeah as a matter of fact that's why
I'm baby I didn't mention that also it's
not only the power of narratives is a
long term effect that's a problem with
behavior change right you change
somebody's you can change somebody's
behavior very easily once or twice I
then have the habit removed or a new
habit created it's much more complicated
and sometimes the way that I one
approach it is like I don't need to
lecture you about I need you to change
your identity around it your identity
should change from our victim to a
warrior it actually play that game with
my family my father was super sick very
sick he was almost like dying with some
respiratory problem and I wanted to
apply metaphors and see how it work
completely this not not scientifically I
work because my sister was like
completely depressed and I said I said
no wait a minute this is not an issue
this is not him having like a long
problem it's where Mountaineers and
we're going up the hill we're almost
there but we live in the Andes so we
know what a hill means and we do what a
very very big mountain means right so I
couldn't tell her like oh we're sailors
and we're going through no we don't even
know where Howard looks like but we
know how a big mountain looks was it
we're going up and that's why oxygen is
you know it's less but once we get there
we'll see the other side with the beach
and then we start going down everything
will get better and you will be there
mountaineer who is the the navigator
because you're very good at you know
finding things and my mom will be the
Mountaineer cook will be cooking good
things for him and I'll be the
researcher exam always alone so we play
that game please I asked him like every
week like how are you doing in our game
on today and she told me like I feel so
much relieved I mean they help control
stress which was a was an important
factor for him to be better in
really you cannot have a person who have
long problems to be stressed because the
ANS doesn't work well so he helped i'm
not saying that it was a cure and thing
but it helped manage that that that
difficult moment I've been also talking
with people in project management I said
I pressure management is so complicated
sometimes it gets so annoying why don't
we add a layer of fun it's just not you
know like some characterization of the
of the project and then you just play
the game not all the time everyone's
want every week and you use the
narrative of instead being a victim of
the project it's more like a warrior
yeah and in Google I cannot say Allah
but I was working with security team
during the during the summer and one of
the problems that people have with
security is a very complicated behavior
problem it's it's this victim identity
they think that they are at the mercy of
hackers so they basically become their
self-efficacy is no they do nothing and
if they do it they do it there who cares
so we're trying to help them change
their identity so that they become more
active because they believe that they
can actually do something against this
security threat cyber security threat
yeah
