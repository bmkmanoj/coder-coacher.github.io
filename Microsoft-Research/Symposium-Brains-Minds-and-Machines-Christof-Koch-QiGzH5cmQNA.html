hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
now let me introduce the next speaker
Christophe so kristef is better
known than I am so he needs no
introduction but what is not terribly
well known is that he was my first
graduate student back in tübingen in
the Max Planck Institute and then one of
the first post Doc's at MIT and crystal
is now that director or president of the
Allen Institute in Seattle pleased off
thank you much Tommy thank you much it's
my doctor father and the first thing you
have to disagree with my doctor father
is the most the deepest of all
scientific problems i'm not going to
talk about i talked about the last year
nips is the nature of consciousness how
does consciousness our eyes out of three
pounds of highly organized and excitable
matt in our head which turns out to be a
thorn on to the question of intelligence
so today I'm going to talk about
intelligence being that I used to be a
professor I still has this perforce
papas Oriole habits i'm going to give a
little bit of intellectual background
that partly overlaps with Tommy I'll
tell you a little bit about what we know
about the the neuroscience of
intelligence bi intelligence he I really
mean high-level planning making model
building etc and then i'll i'll tell you
what we are doing about this problem at
the young and super brain science so the
intellectual hoods of of both
neuroscience in AI they used to be
heavily intermix they used to be in fact
the same hood going back to well you can
trace them all the way back to of course
lightness and as universal calculo
subsequently cheering and and the
symbolic logic at the point at which
they were still a sort of joint at the
hip is really i mean the many points of
view i like to typically start with my
color on pits they're universal calculus
were they show that using some very
simple autonomous Tomata and you could
find in your network for any logical
predicate this was back in nineteen
forty three and then together with
with memory you could instantiate any
Turing machine and they showed in their
paper this is a their figure 1 some of
the simple computation that you could
that that you could do and I think
historically was very important because
it worked showed for the first time how
high how high level logic of the sort
that particular humans do might be
instantiated in human brains using very
simple needle-like element and of course
these ideas later were taking up by by
John phenomen in his book the brain and
the in the computer and where we're
really at the heart of the hood of the
of the neural network then it was
already mentioned by Tommy the tablet II
probably the most influential work was
say to blend visa for which they would
later get the Nobel Prize at Harvard
where they studied in cat visual cortex
they found these cells have subsequently
we also found in other animals including
in monkeys and and in other key other
mammals so called simple cells that
compute the same orientation and then
complex cells just under yes thank you
and then a complex cells that that
compute the orientation over different
over different locations actually found
here because many of you probably have
never seen it this is one of the
original movies oh ok well that's this
hash that you can hear you see those are
is it nope
so what happened in the 30s and 40s
people developed amplifies it became
very small and so finally you could the
brain became eloquent right until then
the brain was totally silent but now you
could put a piece of wine into the brain
amplified and actually listen to the way
neurons talk and of course people
discovered very quickly there was this
Universal idiom the action potential and
all yawns yeah that's how the brain used
to sound like but now with electrodes we
can listen to at any on this is how they
discovered using bars of light or
variable orientation with you can sort
of you can find the receptor fields yet
a cat was was fixating straight ahead so
the eyes were fixed and then you can map
out the portion in visual space where
this new on can be excited for me in
particular here takes an oriented edge
and then the idea that you go from
because it turns out in the input to
cortex neurons are not oriented it tend
to be circular symmetric and then within
cortex you have this hierarchy you have
simple cells that just compute
orientation you have complex cells that
computer orientation over different
locations and then you're AB the ideas
this hierarchy goes on and then this was
first formalize by Japanese engineer
Fukushima in the Neo cognate on while
you have a series of these networks
simple to complex networks that end up
with was high level was high level
primitives at the recognition layer and
of course at the same time people like
Charlie goes discovered phase cells in
the monkey and then this is work that
Gabrielle crimen who's one of the
organizers and I did together was a
neurosurgeon it's like freed we
discovered the so-called Jennifer
Aniston sell that I sell this is non
human cortex that are highly specific to
am two individuals each cell is is
selectively two pictures in a very much
invariant way including to text and a
computer saying the name of the
individual here it happens to be
jennifer anderson of people that you're
highly familiar with in other words
things that you are overly no exposed to
again and again your body your brain
wires up specific neurons and the idea
was that this just very naturally
emerges out of a very deep a chain of a
feed-forward network for you have simple
and complex and this is really at the
heart of tommy's each
max model that he also just presented
well you have this series of a linear
nonlinear confirmation and you Kaskade
this many times over with the at the top
and you have crack ignition and I think
for in terms of just feed forward
networks in other words if you open if I
show you an image and within 120
milliseconds you recognize it within 180
or 200 milliseconds you can begin to
initiate the movement to release a
button to signal I to signal the correct
identity or category of that stimulus so
those sort of networks explained that
very rapid feet forward sweep quite well
and of course they also give Isis was
last year next year a Google Lynette
give rise to these now what 22 and I'm
sure this in its there probably twenty
eight layers or more layers of of
processing that that all do spectacular
well to recognize them images so so you
could argue that Lisa the origin of
history of AI nua science they were
together or a computational neuroscience
they had they were joined at the hip and
recently they've diverged given the
tremendous calls both in neuroscience as
well as in in deep machine learning so
what is it that we can see about
intelligence in the brain so here really
mean intelligence as measured by
psychologists ie by things like fluid or
crystalline intelligence by things like
IQ IQs a very stable measurement you can
do it it's very reliable you can do it
over many years people have done it over
60 years with the attack the same
individuals and do the same sort of test
consists in a year after you know after
many decades so it's something very
stable it explains a large forever
problem it there is a weak correlation
in this whatever we would ever
psychologist measure with IQ there's a
week but a highly significant
correlation between brain size now in it
so it's weak it only explains you know
ten to twenty percent of the variance
all the evidence we have based on clinic
and lesion studies particular and more
recently on fri or other physiological
evidence really implies that it's
neocortex so it's this new cortical
sheet there's a responsible for for what
we call intelligence and also put things
like perception memory reasoning and
planning and thinking
when it comes to cortex and many things
that we have no understanding of so for
instance is well known fact brains
coming to on averages it there's a
distribution between men and women a man
have typically hundred 150 grams more
brain this translates people have done
this counts now a number of times in 2
19 billion cortical neurons for women
and 23 cortical neurons for men we have
no idea this of no apparent intelligent
difference between the genders that
raises the question why now is now maybe
we think about sex with those four
million neurons all the time it strikes
me is quite plausible and of course we
can think what implication that has for
intelligence or the lack of the earth
now turns out very embarrassing for Homo
sapiens sapiens people recently
discovered because of course we knew
since many years since essentially the
discovery of large elephants and
gorillas and whales that other mammals
have brains that are much bigger than us
but we always said well that's okay
they're bigger bodies and we can
compensate for their by doing brain body
index etc but we human sapiens we exceed
because we're the smartest we have the
biggest cortex of them all and the
better supposedly well it turns out
that's not too so they've now counted it
in a part of 10 pilot whales which is a
misnomer they actually dolphins and they
have 37 billion cortical neurons not
nuanced an entire brain but cortical
neurons and we don't really know why
they you know they're twice as many
nuances we have yet we are the dominant
species it's an unclear reason the other
thing that we don't really have any
understanding of the homo jnana Thal
again this is not controversial is quite
well accepted had a cranial capacity
that's probably translated in tune into
brain tissue 152 to not grams more brain
so it's not clear why the proverbial
caveman that died out at the same time
that we made it into Europe roughly
35,000 years ago why they died out but
it's smaller brain cousin are you homo
sapiens sapiens survived we simply don't
know so we don't really have a good
understanding of the link between
natural intelligence particular this
high-level intelligence and the
underlying neocortex what we do what we
are beginning to understand really quite
well are other aspects of intelligence
that that could be subsumed under the
name of pattern recognition pattern
matching ie vision intermedia a low
level and intermediate level essentially
processing in particular vision where
most of the work has been has has been
going on so all of that takes place in
us in other animals they're quite
different structures involved and button
us it takes much of that takes place in
cortex so cortex a way to think about it
is 2 plus epsilon dimensional
computational tissue I say 2 plus
epsilon because it cause different
mammals it changed roughly from a couple
of square millimeters to something like
a 2000 square centimeter of 4000 square
centimeter so change roughly 10 to the
10 to the 5 in area 100,000 the width
changed only x factor 3 to 5 so in a
mouse it's maybe 800 micrometer 21
millimeter in assets between two and
four millimeter but the extent changed
them tremendously so in assets them the
it's a pizza the surface volume 12 on a
square centimeter it's pizza 14 inch
pizza two to three millimeters thick and
then of course heavily you know fold it
up and you have two of them one in the
left and 11 in the right so that's why I
think of it as a 2 plus epsilon
dimensional computational tissue it's a
relatively uniform so of course since
hundred fifty years newer natomas and
physiologists have found differences
across the cortical chida mindy one is
not m1 it's not s1 it's not prefrontal
but you know if you take off your
glasses and peer edit the organization
is remarkable similar across cortical
surfaces with lots of specialization and
so the question that many people ask in
particular asset dl institute so what is
the canonical columnar operation
performed by cortex that makes it so
such an etch that did that makes our
intelligence human intelligence or
intelligence of other animals so robust
and so flexible i let me briefly tell
you a little bit about Allen Institute
for brain science because we're very
different creatures and then
universities or then industry in fact
we're somewhere between biotech and and
industry we're not for profit we started
in 2003
and all we do is basic science basic
research in the brain sciences we're
rapidly expanding when I came to 160 we
now 310 or 320 and in a couple of years
where we will be 500 our you know our
culture it says that we have a heavy
emphasis on research research is what we
do and we have teams of people had it
typically by people who came from
universities who are faculty at
universities but then we also have
biotech we have product our products are
large-scale data release that we
released to the world at large free you
can right now to go to all of our data
stores and download everything there's
no sign up there's no IP there's no pay
wall and we focus on a few large product
that can be done at scale and so just
like a industry with program management
with milestones we have smart goals with
all that instrument areum that that
industry has and we initiated when I
came with Paul we initiated a 10-year a
billion billion dollar program for for
building solar level observatories in
both the two species that we focus on X
is mouse and human cortex that's our
budget and we all funded by the
curiosity of one individual Paul Allen
he really wants to know how how how the
brain works he also wants to know he's
also started of course number of years
ago in Allen Institute for artificial
intelligence and he just started an
Ellen institute for cell science and
he's just interested in using his
resources that are considerable to
further sort of basic science and he
just gave us this building last month we
moved in a beautiful building where
glass building where we can all be
housed at least we can expand up to 700
people so that's in in Seattle so what
we are we about big signs in a sense at
our experiments and our teams are big
compared to it to academia not of course
compared to LHC or other physical
experiments but they are they're big by
conventional your science standard we
team we work in very tight teams which
makes it's a very different cultured
University that's also the biggest
challenge we have and everything we do
is open so we release all our data
typically many years before we put them
out in our publications in our nature
and in other publication and all of that
we have 25 people in IT that do nothing
but do sort of
part the preparation of the product and
putting it online and making browsers
and tools and coordinate system and
answer the questions of that the user
community out there has so we study
these two system the mouse and the human
they differ athle by a factor of a
thousand very close two thousand whether
it's new on count it's 40 million cortex
in mouths verses 16 or nineteen billion
in human whether it's the area whether
it's a volume or mass pretty much a
thousand to two thousand times bigger so
these are some of the things that that
we do the in fact it's just came out
last week where we do in in in a human
we do gene expression in nine and
different regions so we take my arrays
microarrays in many different regions in
many different brains we process it
using a sort of a standard or a standard
procedure that we hold constant over
many years where we can look at the
transcriptional architecture of this
your arm of the human brain and what you
find is really this is a vignette it's
it's living vignette it's dynamic that
you can look at our website it shows you
pick two places of those 900 any two
places in the brain and you ask how many
different G how many did genes are
expressed if eventually here above a
threshold which are things log to how
many genes are differentially expressed
and that number is plotted as a color so
blue means and no or very few genes that
are differentially expressed and so you
go you know you could you go your
different brain areas so for example if
you focus on the lower right there the
blue area that's all cerebellum so if
you look within the cerebellum there are
almost no jeans that are differentially
expressed about the scheduled level now
it's interesting because the cerebellum
of course eighty percent of your neurons
on your cerebellum most of your neurons
to be precise 69 billion of your neurons
I granule cell in your cerebellum and
they're really very homogeneous same
thing if you look at the upper left with
the singular exception of primary visual
cortex which is quite different to first
autumn to first order the ID'd
transcriptional architecture other words
if you look at actually which genes are
expressed in there in the various parts
of the brain it's relatively homogeneous
across cortex it's quite different if
you go between cortex and hypothalamus
or basal ganglia
it's quite different within the
hypothalamus or was in the basal ganglia
but it was in cortex and and and
cerebellum these are both laminate
structure is very similar now then of
course they are differences in cortex if
you just look at cortex and you do
something like PCA you can very nicely
see that fifty percent of the variance
you can explain by distance in other
words think about this this sheet
there's pizza and now I asked I look at
any two places in the pizza and compare
the jeans the jeans had expressed here
in the genes are expressed here and half
of the different they have caused some
difference between those and how the
difference is explained by the distance
the farther away you are the more
they're differentially Jean said
expressed and it really brings home the
physical nature of this thing I mean you
know to physical process that that we
used to think with and it really brings
home that they and the nature of that so
the bulk of our people had now occupied
in this project mine scope where we
trying to engineer where we're trying to
understand in as much detail as as
possible today using today's signs
everything that goes on as a mouse sees
including its visual consciousness and
so we are looking at atmos here we have
a million retinal ganglion cell they
have 45,000 they project to 23 targets
their retina just like it does in us one
of them is the LG n he is very small
it's only 18,000 that's much smaller
than a human and from there goes on to
primary visual cortex just like in the
human that has roughly a third of an of
of a million in total there probably two
to two and a half million cortical
neurons that respond specifically to
vision in the cortex of of a mouse now
what we do we do three large projects we
do one we generate in thousands of miles
now detailed connectivity at the whole
brain level not only vision but among
all the areas cortex and subcortical we
do a very detailed characterization of
individual neurons their shape the
electrical behavior and that the genes
are expressed including models and we
build cortical observatories where we
observe and put a put it outside for the
community the activity at the cellular
level throughout the entire brain of
these mice and all of these uses think
we all use visual cortex of
adult m eyes we all map everything into
a high-resolution 3d coordinate system
so we know every time we record from a
cell every time we image it every time
we put a microelectrode and we record it
within this atlas that has 10 micrometer
pixels and seen a 20 million voxel for
the entire brain and of course we all
use this common transgenic animals that
we widely give available we shipped
17,000 miles to the community and all of
these flows into centralized and
standard databases ultimately did
deliver to the user community that's our
latest release of our three-dimensional
high resolution Atlas in the mouse so
for instance here what we're doing this
is the original paper there many more
people coming out where we where we take
in one mouse we in fact either in a
wild-type on a transgenic animals we use
a viral technology to infect a
particular population of cells let's see
the layer 5 cells in primary visual
cortex and we then use a two-photon
imaging and two-photon tomographic
technique to reconstruct to cut the
brain into slices hundred forty slices
and to scan in those slices with a pixel
resolution of a third of a micrometer
then to informational and you know do em
annotation alignment etc and to make all
of the data accessible through the
entire brain so now you know where the
neurons in layer 5 the output neurons
the layer 5 parameter self where they
project through at this missus copy
population level and you do that for for
however many population of neurons you
can identify in whatever part of the
brain you're interested in so he can see
this is the first release of the data
Atlas so they are athlete 500 you can go
across each one of those holes is one
injection in one particular part of the
mouse and then you can see that the
first half is the projection the
strengths the logo technically
compressed amplitude of the signal that
tells you about the connection strings
on the same side of the brain and on the
on the right side you see it on the
opposite side of the brain and its whole
brains you can immediately see at high
resolution the whole brain connectivity
atlas that's essential for our models as
well as for the community so this is one
of the most frequently used atlases that
we have then we're doing this Allen cell
type database
where we go in in slices both human and
mouse well we we cut slices and a
standard condition we do a standard
electrophysiological protocol between 30
and 40 minutes and we record all of that
at high resolution we then inject by a
sighting so we can do the reconstruction
of the of the dendrites and axons we use
a variety of models both point models a
variety of G live models of GLM models
as well as very detail by physical
models at the same time we do we look at
the mRNA transcript doing single-cell
RNA seek or now smarter what we so again
in that particular cell we can
understand that the RNA that's that's
been transcribed ultimately we want to
do that for a few reasons we'd like to
get at how many different cell types
they are and also cause we like to use
all that information to do very detailed
modeling of their particular piece of
the brain so modeling as i said we use
this family of different
electrophysiological protocols we use
pulses grams noise noise pink noise
pulses etc to do both biophysical very
detailed modeled as well as said that's
a larger interest to the larger
computation your science or physics
community that once you use their g
lifts 22 in 22 model networks and then
we have automatic procedures for fitting
this data so he can see these
biophysical very detailed models using
using using new on where you can model
both the the dendrites as well as active
and passive currents the passive the
active current we're doing in
conjunction with the Blue Brain Project
Henry Markham and the dendrites as well
as in the soma and all of this is
available to to to everybody then here
we have this paper coming out next month
in done by our transcriptional pipeline
our transcriptional group was ill cat
Isaac and in hong cui zheng where we
asked the question so we know in
chemistry over the particular work done
in the late 19th century that every
every atom here on the planet falls into
one of 92 discrete packets unless you're
doing nucleus
when you can shift things around so the
question is in an adult mouse or in an
adult brain like you are my brain is it
true that every self falls into one of a
small number of buckets and how big is
how many buckets are there so we know
early on people thought well there's
excitation and thence a couple of
inhibitory cell types well now even if
you look in the retina they are sort of
75 to 80 different cell types in cortex
we found using purely transcriptional
methods a smaller number in this case 47
of which 42 a very nice number 42 is in
is the number of actual different cell
types we have in primary visual cortex
now it's interesting this question this
is half as many nuances people have
identified in a patina of course you
could make the argument in the retina
where the physics meets biology you
needs lots of specialized neuronal
structures to transcribe 11 order of
magnitude of light and Madame onto
output neurons that only has two orders
of magnitude of of gain you need all
these specialized neurons but once the
information is put inside the center CPU
if you want the central plaza you don't
need that many different cell types
we'll see it's early days but so it's at
least 42 different types of neurons 23
inhibitory ones and 19 xit three ones
and they not only have different genes
expressed but they have different
electrical behavior in particular they
have different morphology and they
project to different places so the great
model of 20 century apology and it's
also true for 21st century biology it's
all about specificity they're amazing
specific gadgets and the bad news is if
you want to look at pathological brains
you want Alice and schizophrenia and
autism and autism and ADHD etc all the
other diseases we're pray to those
details all matter those details all
matter because it appears that they are
specific their specific deficit they
affect specific types of of cells so
it's not just good enough to know well
it affects / Amal cells you have to know
which type of parental cells I know all
of this data is made available you can
go right now to brain or got to brain
mapp org and you can download the here
for example you see the interface for
the for the visual cell type database
this shows you the back of the mouse
brain you can click on any of the pie
you can get a detailed list you can zoom
in and get a detailed list for example
of the block phase imaging of the
morphology of the if I curve you can go
and do on to the individual curves and
access the individual
electrophysiological recordings and you
can also download your models so you can
download either the point models or the
other biophysical detailed model so it's
not only we're not doing this only to
help us because we have a large modeling
department what we want to model all of
that but to also make all the data
available to all of you and we're also
doing the same in human brain so the
human brain you may know every large
neurosurgical practice and we now work
with five different goop's of
neurosurgeon about once a month or so a
neurosurgeon will have to do an
operation where he has to take out a
part of the part of a brain of a patient
because either there's a tumor there or
there's an epileptic seizure focus and
typically what they do depending on
where the brain is but we in this case
it's deep tissue so let's see on this
picture on the upper left you you you
see there's a tumor in the hippocampus
so the access the overlying a temporal
lobe and they cut that out they sort of
tunnel soon the overlying temple Obus is
hell is healthy and then that piece of
brain you know which could be as big as
a tip of my finger on my thumb or
sometimes it's like this sometimes it's
much less that brain is typically a
little bit goes to the pathologist most
of it is discarded as medical waste with
your puppet HIPAA compliance record in
the appropriate technique we can take
that tissue and 20 minutes later have it
in our lab now 20 minutes ago this part
of the brain was part was part of a
functioning brain and may contain its
memory of its first kiss and it's now
they're right so now what we can do we
can patch it we can do physiology we can
we can recover the electrophysiological
signature we can keep these cells alive
for two to three days we can recover the
morphology we can reconstruct them we
can even use vital techniques and do
things like channelrhodopsin so in fact
we've in infected these new on twitch
channel adopts in for the first time
shown just like in a mouse or in a
monkey you can drive you can excite
these cells using using optogenetic
techniques human cells now and then
lastly we are building because we
interested in intelligence I in behavior
we're building these observatories so he
can seize part of the setup or we train
mice and evelio routine conditions they
can see one of our boxes where we were
there six mice that are all running on
different setups in our case we do
vision so you have this sort of these
little AB platforms like rocket table in
the mouth runs there and it sees
different visual targets and here we're
training it for integer selectivity you
could also train it for faces to
recognize faces but here you train it to
recognize different orientations to stop
and get water when it when it sees your
puppet orientation that we call this
brain observatory and then what we do so
there you can actually see the mouse
running it's fixed in place and we have
a team of neo certain that operates
transforms windows into the skull 5
millimeter windows and then we can then
put two photon calcium imaging
microscopes over there and these are
transgenic animals where the the
electrical impulses the action potential
I convert into flashes of light that we
can pick up and so we can literally peer
at the mouse why on a single trial while
it's you know thinking and making
decision to stop a not to stop and we
can routinely we do this for T me every
time we can identify 12 visual area so
we do that so we know exactly where we
are now we can also do this new
technique which is really cool which is
single trial through skull imaging there
so this is now this is not average this
is soua skull there's no x bound window
in here so G camp it's an AI 93 mouse
this is what happens in real time
without any averaging over the entire
brain as you can see the video of the
mouse there below you can see that it's
running speed so it's 10 and those
little blue dots there at the 50
centimeters per second mark that's when
it gets reinforcement when it leaks and
gets and gets water and that curve there
is a speed and so it's supposed to run
past targets and stop at particular
targets and here you can see six
colorful curves the response at that
particular location and in the middle
you can see the overall brain was far
and what you realize here and this is
never pointed out in all the existing
literature on this whether it's a mouse
a monkey Xiumin there's this brain
whined activity and we have no freaking
idea what it does right so typically
what a paper will do and there's now a
string of papers every week in nature or
signs about for example visual cortex of
mouth which is down the which is down at
the bottom there it will focus on on on
activity v1 and link there to
orientation or to a reward or something
but then there's massive activity you
can see in the front part of the brain
in the retro spleen 'i'll cortex and we
essentially we don't know and we we
don't know what it is but you can see it
on a on a on a single tile as the mouse
does various things whatever you know
miles do it the whisk of course they
move the tail twitches very complicated
thing so again this data will all be
made available finally we're also doing
very deep as structural analysis where
we analyzing that the tissue because we
really want to understand the circuitry
and the gold standard for knowing the
circuit is knowing the structures at
they is at the level of 10 nanometers
are we doing both slide my cosby you and
the clay read as well as a rate
tomographic reconstruction under steven
smith and collaboration with a large
number of other people including andreas
to leah's and and and google and other
people there just across from us at in
seattle and this fox um is there a
tomographic reconstruction where you see
the amazing depth of cortical tissue
this is a sliver 80 nanometers thick
solid micrometer cause and you can zoom
in and you can zoom in and you can zoom
in there the blue is sort of the initial
staining of individual cell nucleus so
here we use antibodies we can stain
green are the excitatory cells red are
the inhibitory cells so we can finally
we come to rest at the level of sign
abscess and they are roughly a billion
synapses per cubic millimeter and so
we'd like to understand that the tissue
you know we first we function identified
using observatories and then we take
that piece of tissue and cut it up and
reconstruct it semi-automatically in
order to understand the circuitry and
then link it upwards with with high
level models
it and that is all right
that was my second last last slide yeah
so so so we hope over the over the next
10 years to contribute to a better
understanding of let's get that all
right so with that I I show you our team
this is part of our team trying to
understand how in both caught in both
mouse and and cut and human how
intelligence and perception emerges out
of cortical tissue thank you much many
thanks piss off arm since the room is
pretty full if you have questions on if
time for one or two just raise your hand
and I bring the mic
thanks Christophe one question is about
the chemicals in the brain the stress
chemicals oxytocin these things I didn't
hear any mention of you know the effects
of those and any any study any data on
that thanks a very very good stuff thank
you so much yeah people did people we we
don't monitor stress hormone so they
they would operate on the time scale of
many seconds and there's a variety of
stress hormones so you monitor doing
surgery etc the level of the stress
hormone again we don't know in detail
what it does at the level of individual
neurons it does lead to an arousal
effect that we can see that's well
understood I mean this is probably quite
anxious for this little creature you
know being fixed in the head unable to
move and running past there so that's
why we do it so it gets used to this
situation well I mean so we do monitor
under some condition these stress
hormones a tablets and many of them
there many different hormones are many
different oils and factors as dopamine
is oxytocin etc and the question of is
the very good one how many of these
factors do we need to keep track off I
mean the bottom line is they're vastly
more variables in the brain that we can
possibly keep track off so we have to
select a small number that are
representative and for the whole thank
you so much that was fascinating um you
should an image right at the end of what
looked like an electron microscope an
electron microscope image with specific
cells stained using a light microscope
was that simultaneous imaging or
something else yeah so we do both them
allied end and and EMA makes thing using
apex where we can use what we can
actually use transgenic animals and do
imaging of particular cell classes and
it shows up as an electron heavy stains
in other words own the e/m we can say
well that's a gabaergic cell or that's a
cell that has a particular promoter and
so we use that we use a combination of
those two get
to give us a dent additional information
what we call w alpha beta which is the
cell type-specific connectome if they're
fully two different types of neurons
they could potentially be 1642 squared
sixteen hundred different types of fine
apses where South have 27 as one type of
synapse on set up 28 but makes a very
different signups on a cell type 32 and
we need to keep track of their to
understand that and is that dense so is
every apex this electron-dense yes it is
alright I'm sorry I'm we're pretty tight
on the schedule um we have a panel
discussion later on so many questions
they're all we also you can assign us an
