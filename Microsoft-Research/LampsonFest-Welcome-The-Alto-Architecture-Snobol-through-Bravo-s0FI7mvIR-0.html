hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
okay so I'd like to welcome all of you
here um of course we are here to
celebrate Butler he is one of the
all-time greats of computer science
fittingly many of the other greats of
computer science are here to celebrate
with us in fact Madhu and Barbara and
Chuck who did a phenomenal job putting
this together told me that they have
never seen people get back to them so
fast I mean when they ask people to
speak it was you know five minutes and
almost everybody had said yes for those
of you who've known Butler for years you
know from any of you who are speaking
you don't need me to tell you what he's
done but there are a few young uns out
there who may not know all the things
that butler is done so let me tell you a
few highlights his his Turing award
citation in 1992 is for contributions to
the development of development of
distributed personal computing
environments and the technology for
their implementation workstations
networks operating systems programming
systems displays a security and document
publishing now you know that is that is
a long list that's a really even for a
touring award that's a really long list
so Butler really touched everything also
in 2004 with Alan Kay who is here and
Chuck and Bob Taylor he won the Charles
stark Charles stark draper award for the
vision conception and development of the
first practical networked personal
computers and of course this is what
Butler is really known for he will be
forever associated with the first
practical networked
computer which is the alto also for his
wildflower blueprint for subsequent
computers but also for being an integral
part of the team at park that did so
much it's just incredible and that you
know every lab since then you know I
said okay we wanted we want to do what
part did and no lab has quite done what
part did but what they did there was you
know the laser printer design to phase 2
phase commitment protocols Bravo which
is the first WYSIWYG text formatting
program the ethernet and programming
languages such as Euclid so this is
really i mean it's it's just it's just
an amazing list hopefully we will be
hearing a little bit about some of that
time and some of some of those really
really great achievements and of course
butler has since then continued to help
all of us to to design systems that will
help move the field forward but there
are other things that you may not know
about butler he he doesn't just um he
doesn't just advise on technology and on
computing a butler advises on everything
of course um but he advises on he
advises on organizations so christian
and i were incredibly blessed to have
butler give us lots of advice as we set
up this lab um he was always telling us
what Bob Taylor would have done and and
and I think we took a few of those
suggestions and you know and so this lab
has this little piece that ties us back
to Bob Taylor but his sense of style
goes way beyond way beyond technology so
interestingly two weeks ago in the
financial time
it was an article called can we equate
computing with art and that article
extensively cited and obscure on an
obscure editorial by Butler from 1972 in
software practice and experience in
which he talks about in which he talks
about programming and looks at it on the
spectrum of the spectrum of creative
endeavors from aircraft aircraft design
to poetry and you know that gives you a
little indication of just how Butler
thinks I mean he thinks about this
spectrum of the spectrum of creative
design so those of us who have gotten to
know him well know that he has an
incredible sense of style that style
goes into many different areas he and
Louis have a phenomenal art collection
and they really and not just wonder in
kind of art but a real appreciation of
many kinds of art music they love music
and they're very involved with music
they have great knowledge of great
knowledge of music they also have I
think the most the most spectacular
garden in all of Cambridge with
phenomenal roses and peonies and I
especially like this because every week
Butler brings in these unbelievable
flowers he can tell you the pedigree you
know of each of each flower and he
brings them for himself um and for Irene
and me so it's really really nice
Christians having he wanted some a
butler said he wouldn't bring flowers to
a guy so um so it's it's funny when we
first moved here you know people were
warning me they said aw you're gonna you
know you're going to be telling Butler
and he's kind of uncompromising and and
you know people who know me I think
uncompromising is a feature not a bug
so we have lots of uncompromising people
and we really have fun together not
compromising with each other it's really
fun actually when we're uncompromising
in the same way though and kind of
everybody else is on the other side
because it Butler's on my side I know
I'm going to win so he has brought his
uncompromising standards and his style
his graciousness um and his unbelievable
generosity to this lab and to the whole
field we're really really lucky to have
him in our lives okay now we are going
to have an amazing day of talks in in
the interests of time we are not going
to tell you the backgrounds of each of
our speakers which are phenomenal but
you know they only have 20 minutes to
speak and it would take you know a large
part of that because most of them are
you know the father or the mother of
something grand so uh so let let me
assure you even though we are not going
to tell you their backgrounds they're
incredible if you don't happen to know
just Bing them okay so what okay our
first speaker is it is it time for our
first speaker or should we we should
should we wait just a few what you're
you're happy to start let's wait five
minutes for all the people who didn't
want to hear me but want to hear Chuck
okay we're actually for a snowy day we
are we are doing pretty pretty well yeah
that article actually pre pre the
software practice and experience article
actually predicted the existence of
Microsoft in this in the sense that
until that time virtually all software
had been supplied by hardware
manufacturers and the idea that there
would be an independent software
business and that hundreds of people
would try to program and that hundreds
of people will try to sell those
programs beard in that paper right in
actually the app store even but yeah I
definitely intended the idea that
there'd be lots and lots of people
independent them of hardware
manufacturers would be doing programming
not just microsoft but you know all
kinds of independent people now we have
a million iphone apps written by i think
several hundred thousand different
developers yeah as i read it i was
thinking wow this is the app store so
why didn't one in microsoft listen more
carefully to butler but of course his
butler and will will tell you at many
points we should have listened more
carefully to power okay so um i am going
to be a really really severe timekeeper
here and i hope that our other program
chairs will be really severe timekeepers
so the speakers are forewarned okay so
our first speaker is you know probably
butler's closest colleague ever Chuck
Thakur and he is going to talk about the
alto architecture and he's from MSR
I don't even know but today I'd like to
tell you about a machine that we built
at Xerox PARC because it has some
interesting properties some of which are
still relevant today this was not the
first computer that mother and I had
worked on together we started out in
1967 initially at the genie project at
Berkeley and doing that the SDS 940 and
later at the Berkeley computer
corporation and then at Xerox PARC so
this was actually our fourth machine
which is good because we were by that
time easan so in 1972 Butler wrote a
memo there's the first paragraph of
proposing that the laboratory build some
number of copies of a funny-looking
machine that I had that I hadn't tried
to design that had some new properties
and he says it might be interact with
every CSL project and sure enough it did
so before telling you about this I'll
have to tell you a little about how
systems researcher Park worked the main
tenets of the thing was that we had to
build and use real systems in order to
understand their value most people don't
do that these days and as a result of
that we missed some things we didn't
need spreadsheets so we didn't invent
them although we came very very close
the highest priority in the laboratory
was hiring the best people that was
number one and the sources of people
were from all over the place the BCC
grouped Utah Stanford sry CMU MIT will
drag in people from anywhere as long as
they were the best and good leadership
helps in this in this quest and Bob
Taylor provided that because he had
actually paid for the education of many
of the people in the laboratory and he
knew everybody so he had come to us from
ARPA and ran a lab for many years and
I'll say more about that
in my remarks this evening so the
organization of Park was actually in 25
laboratories it was set up more or less
like an academic environment the
computer science lab was under Bob and
Jerry Elkind the system sciences lab was
was initially bill gunning and
eventually Burt Sutherland Alan's
learning research group was in this in
this area the general sciences lab was
mostly physicists and that was Jerry
lukowski um the physicists were a little
bit funny because they were sort of a
fish out of water and Taylor didn't like
them all that much uh I thought they
were really great because whenever the
Xerox Corporation which after all paid
our bills had troubles they could turn
to the physicists and generally get some
pretty wise answers so I think they they
paid their way but Bob and I have
disagreed with about this for 30 years
so it's we're just going to have to
continue to disagree the optical clients
and I started out to be a physicist by
the way so I have a soft spot in my and
my head for physicists I know John
urbach run ran the optical science lab
this is 5y optical slams for crying out
loud well one of the big components of
xerography was in fact optics and we had
a very energetic optical engineer named
Gary Starkweather who did the laser
first laser printing engine and so he
was in that lab and later we had an
integrated circuits lab which was to
some extent thought up by me and it was
the best the worst idea I've ever had
because we spent like 15 million dollars
and this was maybe 250 today ah building
this thing which never made anything and
the reason is I didn't know that in
order to run a semiconductor fab you had
to actually keep it busy at all times
and you couldn't just build experimental
things and then go off and build some
other experiments you had to run product
through it and that didn't work so this
was a complete waste of money the time
is here park was founded in nineteen
seventy um it was originally supposed to
be on the east coast because that would
make it closer to the to the mothership
but finally they decided that it was
having to good universities close by it
was more important and so it was set up
at Palo Alto with Berkeley and Stanford
being the university's uh the labs grew
to critical mass over the next two years
with a lot of hiring and in the midst of
that we built the max time-sharing
system now we had all had quite a bit of
familiarity with time sharing we
understood it very well and we wanted a
PDB 10 because the Arctic community used
PDP chins but Xerox had just bought a
large computer company called scientific
data systems and we were a little bit
nervous that they wouldn't like us
buying if he can so we built one uh well
I I've mellowed in my old age Allen
asked us for a financial justification
of this decision so we wrote down what
it would cost to do this building and so
forth then we wrote down what it would
cost to buy the high end as a massaging
that if that was not too significant but
then we worked on what would cause to
write the programs to make it useful for
research and of course we get to make
those numbers up
so there were when we finished when we
finished max we finally took a little
break and finally started listening to
Bob Taylor who he'd been telling us what
to do for a long time but we didn't
understand it and i'll get to that i
think on the next slide so we built the
alto and ssl built polos the park online
office system which was based on a pile
of many computers strapped together with
somewhat better displays but they didn't
have quite the same properties as the
alto displays so they never made it in
1974 the ethernet Alto Research
character generator and slot laser
printer first came to like and a lot of
other printers followed and of course
Xerox never made any money on on our
part of the game but they sure made a
lot of money on printers so Park
actually paid for itself of course
software is always the important part of
a thing like this and a lot of
applications and other projects grew out
of out of the alto just as Butler
predicted in 1977 through 1983 attempts
were made to make money at it and mostly
were unsuccessful Charles participated
in one of those um and finally in 1983
again generously Allen CSL dissolved so
here was one of those computers this is
the father of the alto this is the max
computer the name is both an acronym
upon multiple accesses e rocks computer
is actually named at a party after a
little bit of beer had been drunk after
max polesky who was the president of
scientific data systems this machine was
actually the end of an era because it
was completely superseded by scientific
work stations the memory cabinets which
I designed are the four on the right
bothered assigned the processor he
decided to dabble in hardware a little
bit and I think he decided after doing
this and
the time to debug it and get it working
that he would go back to software it was
actually more tractable but but you
never actually built it yourself Butler
argue or debugged it I never built it
myself period i debugged a lot of the
corrado you did feel that yo and Chuck I
designed the processor I had learned
about Maxwell's equations when I studied
physics and I understood about boolean
logic I didn't understand much about the
space in between that country I deal
with chuck was I would design this
processor and if I ever saw anything
that wasn't zero or plus five on the
scope I would yell for help but in any
case for a while that was actually for a
brief period of time that memory system
was the largest semi-conductor memory on
the planet at three point two megabytes
so where did we get all the ideas well
there's a whole list of things that have
been sighted over the years Vannevar
Bush's paper on the Memex in 1945 lick
and Taylor wrote a paper that was the
thing that he was trying to tell us
which is the computer as a
communications device Doug Engelbart had
you know the mouse which we quite liked
we also quite initially quite like the
five fingers he said until we discovered
that the only person on the planet who
could run it effectively was dug himself
and so he had to leave those out and of
course there was Alan's dynabook and
ideas that had been fermenting in the
back of minds of the DCC mom and so
those all came together to make that so
that's an alto looks pretty modern
doesn't it I mean it's a little bit
bigger it's still the same color as the
pc under your dad as a display and you
can see the mouse there and the keyboard
and it's a little bit curious because
the aspect ratio of the display is
portrait not landscape why was that
it looks much more like a document right
it's a piece of paper and that's the way
we thought about it because you could do
anything Valte oh really only had two
good ideas in it and I'll tell you what
they were one at a time the first one
was the bitmap display the idea that you
could represent the picture on the
screen as a pile of bits in memory and
that any program could manipulate those
bits and produce a picture ah there was
another one but I'll tell you about that
later okay that's a two and a half
megabyte disk on the left with the also
process okay so what's removable I had
to be remote nails of course because
initially we didn't have a network so we
didn't have distributed personal
computing yet we just had the computing
part why is it interesting today well
because it was a personal computer that
was a new thing in the world I was Jim
Mora said it was very interesting about
the alto because the nicest thing
property of had was that he didn't run
faster at night it was a platform so a
lot of software was written for it a lot
of which you use today hardware based on
it and it was used for research and
universities we gave some of them away
with over printers and it was not a
commercial success although as I said
earlier laser printing was the
technologies well wimpy memory from
Intel we use the boards from Max and
what we didn't know is that they didn't
really work we found that out a bit
later I can tell you about that story
offline boards were wire wrapped
commercial technology medium scale TTL
and grated circus cos hadn't been
invented um it was reasonable those day
in those days for a research group of
art of our size to build their own
computers and use them you can't do that
anymore there's what ninety six thousand
bits look like in 1972 ah that's about
this big today you can't even see 96,000
goods
here's the primary engineering team
that's edna cried on the right ed did a
disk subsystem for the alto and also a
few other things like invent the b-tree
there's Alan in the middle there's
someone younger me and Larry Clark with
our technician I think this was about
the first time the alto a big word and
of course the first bitmap graphic
animated bitmap graphics in the world
was this picture the Cookie Monster
eating a cookie and of course we
captured that for posterity here but for
the technical in the onion in the
audience that gives you an idea of the
boards that we used to build the system
so here are some comparisons it cost
about a hundred and five thousand
dollars today we definitely did
something weird at part we spend money
to simulate the future a lot of people
today want the future but they don't
want to spend the money ah the cpu clock
rate was two thousand times slower than
my machine at home 48,000 times less
memory 17 17 times slower slower and
latency uh only 150 x in terms of pixels
but where my eyes were running out so
that's okay network is 300 times faster
and the capacity of the disk is 280
thousand times people think more was a
real wonderful guy because he gave us a
1.8 x per year the disk guys have done
much better and the people who have
actually done even better than that or
the people who make fiber optics so
here's the processor you're not supposed
to look too closely at this there will
be no quiz the point of this is that it
was pretty simple you could put the
entire block diagram at a fair level of
detail for the entire machine on one
page so the stuff down at the bottom was
the arithmetic unit in the memory and
you can see you can see the second good
idea in the out
here the idea was that the aisle device
is connected directly to the main data
highway inside the processor that's this
processor bus down at the bottom ah and
as a result they could make use of the
Altos microcode rather than using
specialized hardware and this was
incredible because it reduced the cost
enormously arm and you could customize
and do things in that microcode that you
couldn't otherwise he's alee do in
hardware so it was easy to to use in
that respect so the emulated machine
looked like a data general Nova most of
you have never seen a nova but it was
pretty simple a risk like machine in
1960 roughly age competitor to the
pdp-11 or PPA ah and they lost so you
could hook I o devices up to the alto in
a number of different ways you could run
them with assembly programs or BCPL
programs you could run as a part of a
timed task in microcode you could
connect either to the low low bandwidth
parallel port or the memory boss or to
the direct main highway as I described
in the last slide and we hooked up a lot
of different kinds of devices a lot of
other laser printers um the initial
laser printer uses specialized character
generator to to do its raster scanning
which could print fonts and limited
graphics but we didn't like that so Bob
sproul built a thing called Dover which
was a full bit now and then we did color
versions and we did something based on
the xerox 9700 or that was a xerox 9700
a lot of other computers the Dorado was
the biggest and the fastest but there
were some others there was the dolphin
which was a attempt to build a faster
alto but it never really took off
because it was superseded by a few of
these other three wild flora damned any
lion and I sentra which came out of a
design that butler did primarily for the
business group that tries to try to
commercialize it uh the dragon was the
last machine we worked on it was
actually a multiprocessor and it was
actually going to use LSI chips but we
disbanded before that lots of gadgets we
built Allen and electric organ for
instance which he quite liked lots of
software the original alto OS a
single-user display based on a thing
that had been done in England by stowing
stray key the pilot system done for the
system development division and finally
the cedar operating system which was
primarily for the for the Dorado for the
dragon software lots of languages the
only one that didn't really work was
less just we didn't have enough memory a
lot of applications Bravo you'll hear
more about that today that morphed into
Microsoft Word Laurel was almost
recognizable email system recognizable
today a lot of drawing applications we
like that vidhanam display a lot of
servers for mail we had grape vine which
was probably the first true distributed
system um oh dear miscellaneous software
yeah people think that Robert Morris
launched the first worm first worm was
actually done by a guy named John shock
at a park and he managed to bring every
alto in the building down with a worm
lots of communications software which
became what we see today in the internet
a lot of exploitation attempts never
really worked the whole population was
about 1500 successors lots of extinct
scientific work stations the alto
predecessor of those and they lasted for
about a decade and then finally when
intel got its act in gear and started
building high-volume processors we got
things like the pc on postscript became
from us and of course Microsoft Windows
inward and here's the final group from
Xerox so it was a good run we had a
decade there and I'll say a little bit
more about some things that happened
after that this evening so thank you
very much and I see I had six seconds
so since we had to race we have 0
seconds so we have exactly five minutes
for question ok there's it there's a
test here who it can who in this room
can identify Mike Schroeder in this
picture ok I gave that this test at the
Silicon Valley lab with Microsoft and
nobody that I gave it to could figure
him out find him out now Andrew Burrell
is a little hard to find to Roy is
actually yeah that's right ahhh Butler
had decamped to Philadelphia by this
time so so in fact he's not in this
picture now he was a one of the first
telecommuters when we did sir other
questions coffee next to the guy with a
coffee cup that's sure yes the guy
sitting in the front row to the right of
Bob Taylor who looks like Jehovah that's
Jim that's Jim morning say what should I
to yourself on the back row I note that
I am a little greater than I am in some
earlier pictures the reason for that has
nothing to do with Park it had to do
with the fact that my daughter just
became a teenager yeah why do you think
the commercialization didn't succeed
because the rocks didn't wasn't a
computer company they had no idea what
they had and they were doing pretty well
in the copier business and when you're
you know when you have this big fat cash
cow that you can just milk and you have
this these upstarts coming and saying
that they know what you ought to be
doing in the future you ignore them and
they were right i mean happens all the
time
well there stood light of laser printers
even to make the computer printing yes
to push it through yeah I the end about
their first sorry about the failure of
the of the office systems actually a
little bit more interesting because some
they had a very good engineering team
and this engineering team had a vision
of what it was what they wanted to build
and they built it much to my
astonishment and think they'd be able to
do it and they shipped the star system
in 1980 want and it was better than
anything you could buy from anybody else
for at least a decade I had one problem
what the problem with it was too
expensive that and the secondary problem
was it was very hard to add anything and
the irony of this is that back at park
there were people like Chuck and me who
were saying to these guys this is to an
ambitious it's going to cost too much
you should build something much more
like the Alpha and but they had a vision
they didn't do that fundamental problem
and I think was they had very good
engineering if they hadn't things irks
corporation was not able to figure out
how to provide them with marketing and
as a result they were too like babes in
the woods when it came fast to selling
this stuff it was very sad but it was us
about the same price as dedicated word
processors which could much easier to
sell right oh by the way how come in
exactly the same mistake they build a
Lisa Lisa night and had exactly the same
properties as the star system yeah and
it failed for exactly the same reason
they had a second go-around with the mac
Alan described as the first computer
good enough to criticize over the colon
back there to see this device as a
communication device like I would love
to hear what it was this paper and he
said but what computers are is to is not
to do computations but to enable people
to people communication and of course we
see that today in spades with social
networks so you
it was a prescient vision and we just
didn't understand him as soon as we got
into gear and we built things like the
Laurel mail system it took off like
gangbusters I mean mail was all over
Xerox sometimes too had to Andros
discussed when he would get calls late
at night about a server that he'd never
heard of failing okay we have 19 seconds
so i will take this opportunity to
introduce the next or are you doing the
introduction Charles Charles and I first
met at Berkeley computer although he had
worked together with Butler at the
University of California he was in the
other computer science department ah i
was i was really shocked by charles one
day because in those days the software
engineers had the machine at night and
the hardware people had it during the
day and we we sometimes had dinner
together when they would come in and
Charles came in one time with a large
pile of camera equipment driving a
yellow Jaguar XKE and I said Charles
what are you've done and he said I
bought it I said how you said about a
credit card and I thought Charles you
got to be very careful about credit in
America it's it's a trap you'll get into
debt and you'll never get out he says no
this is not a problem I'm gonna be
richer I know I can deal with this so
here's Charles
Thank You charge gun yeah I believed in
the future that's what that's what I
always thought that that I wish that
that if there would be a time machine
that somebody would send me money into
the past you know my future self would
because because actually I was I was
very poor at the time and and no money
came and but then I realized that that
that drawing on credit if you if
somebody gives you credit is is a way of
Time Machine and sending money back into
the town so I look at it exactly that
way so I'd like to put some parentheses
around the chunks talk and and describe
the years before and and and and maybe
after the auto and how my life
intersected with Butler and the
wonderful memories that we have to get
today together it all started in in
Berkeley that was called berzerkeley
also I never liked that term but now
looking back I think it was probably
deserved the I arrived 1967 was the
Summer of Love as you remember you might
remember i arrived in the autumn of love
and and as a barely speaking English
this is a wonderful sunset looking from
Berkeley Hills original picture and this
of course the Student Union people I'm
mulling around and and singing and what
have you but every once in a while a
riot breaks out and there is tear gas on
the way to the school but fortunately
long order is restored so part of the
protest movement was about many things
and probably a few percent maybe half a
percent was about this machine on campus
it's as a CDC 6400 a third-generation
supercomputer that was that was out of
the use by students on the campus and
there was a professor oh this is this is
actually my my picture
from the time the back panel it was no
machine for the poor that was no wire
wraps here but twisted pairs
point-to-point communication assuring an
incredible speed and performance and
there was a a young professor
unfortunately this is I can find a
picture from that time most of the
pictures are regional but I so this is a
few years later bottle lampson and
bottle had this wonderful idea of of
teaching computer science using a
language snowball and the only problem
was that there was no snowball system on
the on the on the 6400 and the snowball
is is actually a if you look at it for
mum in retrospect it had a lot in common
with the most modern languages in
particular it was well it was simple but
but it was garbage collected and it was
type type safe and it was reflective so
it had all the those capabilities and
for example he is a program that that
comes the words and and and you could do
obviously it was have excellent system
for teaching computer science so I I was
hired by the computer center and pretty
much illegally I didn't have a work
permit but I wrote all the programs and
that they bought it for me at the end
which was actually a pretty good deal
but we calculate the number of hours at
work then and and so so don't tell it to
the the AI NS immigration naturalization
service it's called something different
now but so this is the the hardest
mobile system looks today it's
beautifully bound probably the binding
cost mode and then I got for it but it
worked really well they are it was up
complete table driven you see the end of
the table as it said around 200 octal so
that means it's about one kilobyte into
the internal system so into the into
memory
the the idea was that that there was
enough gap between the jobs on the CDC
6400 they came in big chunks and there
was always a little gap in memory and we
could run in that little gap and we were
running hundreds of student programs so
so snowball was actually a quite a quite
a success this is the complete team in a
in a later reunion reunion it says
separate team but the three people with
the arrow are there are thus noble
people Paul Mike Jones helped me the
operating system and bottle and myself I
found this on the on the internet this
picture but I have you seen this before
it's on the Internet I was searching for
pictures of the 6400 and found this
website and guess what it was about the
Cal a time-sharing system anyway so if
you if you search for images of 6,400
you find this picture great so the
success of validly just a couple of
anecdotes said from that period of time
Butler I watched the launch of Apollo 11
and actually the landing of Apollo 11 on
the moon Butler didn't have a TV are
probably out of principle I didn't have
a TV because I didn't have any money and
but I rented one and since I rented one
you could rent TVs at the time it rented
a color TV for a week and so we watched
it together and that was interesting but
also I once I made a mistake off of
bragging about how I may not be able to
speak but I can spell really well and
and I challenged bottler 24 to test my
knowledge and but I said so how do you
spell subtle and of course he found the
exactly to just a single word that I
couldn't spell but I can spell it now I
believe me so thanks to the success of
of snowball here I was hired I was still
you know I would suffer more or whatever
I was and was hard at Berkeley computer
corporation and here you see the BCC 500
in its glory and it's hard to believe
that that the beautiful and talented
Alto is the grandchild of this barely
illiterate or
barely literate brute it drag grandchild
there are many mistakes were made in the
development of this system as a later
said about something similar they were
all proprietary mistakes that means that
under penalty of law you must never make
them again and one of them one of the
important concepts that that that I
learned that from from Butler and and in
shock and I'm surprised that he
mentioned that word it's it's bigger ism
it's something that you want to avoid so
I also learned about memory hierarchy so
this is this is 1k of memory in ROM at
the lowest level next there is of course
core memory does 8k 8 kilobytes all
invites so 8 kilobytes of core memory in
the upper left corner and and the
supporting electronics and next comes of
course the drum about 3 megabytes of
dramas you see it's about as big as a
person I I was there one night this is
this is the actual installation I was
there one night when this this drum
burnt up literally burnt up it's a it it
was rotating and it seized and all the
all the the plating peeled off and
jammed and well that was no fire but
there was you know the smell of amperes
smell of amperes as we call it in in
Europe and of course at the highest
level of the the desk it's about I
understand it's about 50 megabytes this
was on to write an upper that that
machine is called a sniffer in its
sniffing for for avalanches of dust that
will destroy the disk and so it would
stop it in time anyway and this is
myself from that time we had wonderful
accommodations as you see we had our own
personal typewriter I mean teletype and
the cubicle two
so and the without any additives from
this period let's see well oh yes I
shared an office with the with Butler at
Berkeley computer and how come I that
happened and because i was so junior the
reason I share the office because nobody
else was willing it was I thought it was
an honor of course yeah I quickly
stepped into the breach and the other
thing is that that other memories that
the butler was writing is fantastic
documentation one night we were we were
into a bcc 500 which was notoriously
difficult to start I mean you had to
push about I'm not kidding over a
hundred interactions with various
buttons and switches and and and typing
and so on to was ideal model that was a
right but but that was I think that you
could start it without the model 30 but
that's correct that was really a big
machine but anyway badal one night just
couldn't stand it anymore and and and
put together a wonderful piece of
documentation that had fun down on
everybody followed to the to the letter
so let me standing a failure of the 500
I could I could follow the the mob as as
you call it to to park i was at that
time I was working for the time still
still awaiting my my imminent what's
word they kick you out of the country
because you're a foreigner deportation
that's what thank you it's kind of
forgot repressed at that particular word
but so the other other quote I was
working for the iliac project that was
protecting me for the from the
deportation because it was working for
the government so this is the beautiful
grandchild as we saw but I want to focus
on on 1974 when when when Bravo was
born in the spring guy I walked by
Butler's office and and casually looked
at his desk as I've got typically I
didn't do that but their worries is
either two or three pages of handwritten
notes on his desk and I was asking him
what what that was and in fact it was a
design for for an editor for the ax for
the alto and impact in particular these
three items were were expressed on those
pages unfortunately these pages were
lost I never was pretty early on so it's
not like I lost them recently I would I
scan everything I can but they weren't
for my memory it's there was a screen
update algorithm and we're going to look
at it in a minute because we don't have
the original notes but we have the
original code that was written from that
node so they are the screen update
algorithm and and and how do you use the
display list which was a feature of the
alto to to save memory because memory
was still very expensive there was a
kind of a player of P playing off the
amount of screen pays screen space that
you use with the amount of memory that
you have for the program to run so there
was this Alberta there and that there
was an implied document model which
which was a spring of characters without
carriage returns your carriage returns
at the end of progress but not between
lines there was a very important concept
of the of the document model the first
step 2 to 4 matic documents and for too
busy big that the flowing of the
characters that there are no carriage
returns at the end of flights and and
also some tricks doing the idea of a
selection that is made by the mouse and
and the typing buffer of how to type in
nine that in the summer or very soon I
implemented a prototype that was just
just showing a couple of lines on the
screen but but we're using those
algorithms but it was clear that that we
would need more ideas and so we extended
in the summer with the
to create this this minimum minimum
viable product as they would call today
the MVP that you needed a couple of more
ideas for example how to store this this
string of characters and and and how to
make the editing efficient which was
wasn't in the original notes and this is
a fantastic idea by jay mohr called
piece tables that was borrowed and peace
tables mean that that that that instead
of operating on the on the on the string
itself you operate on a description of
contiguous portions of that that string
could pieces oh no by JS work half years
later thanks for the thanks for the
correction i I thought it was in well it
was right firstly well I've heard it
from you of course but but but then I
somehow associated that that you had it
from Tom J but that's fine I certainly
got it from from from Butler so it that
also mean means that the file pages
could be cashed in memory and and and
the random access so we had a very nice
Arrangements where everywhere by the
editing time was was proportional to the
length of the session rather than the
size of the document which was which was
pretty important at the time we had a
nice scrolling paradigm which
unfortunately got lost in in the in the
development of of of GUI as from the
phone from the Macintosh the way we were
scrolling is that that we pointed to a
line that we wanted to go to the top of
the screen or pointy the line that would
wanted to go to the bottom of the screen
it was kind of very natural that's not
how it's done today today you go line by
line there was a third method which
Butler called thumbing because you open
open the book with your thumb and that's
the the analog the random access into
the in the document and we decided on a
Moodle user interface not because we
we like the idea but because we wanted
to get on with the MVP and and and that
let that gave room to two other people
at Larry Tesler in particular to to do
the developed the mood less user
interface that of course then that one
the other the race the story about the
Moodle user interface was that if you if
you if you were in the wrong mode and
you tightly type the word edit that was
EDI t that was expanding the selection
to select everything in a document and
then insert I'm sorry it deleted the
deleted to delete the whole document
that insert the character T so all your
word disappeared and empty appeared on
the screen yeah it was undoable only 21
I only to one level so so you know you
could undo the insertion of the tea but
you can go back to the well okay that
was the other feature called replay so
it wasn't that bad anyway so let me not
well we are running a little bit late so
let me just show you this is this is
Bravo of that time and and here's the
update the update algorithm let me see
if I can just follow this you can see
that it is November 74 the there's a for
each for new and an old line that kind
of a compound for each it's written bcpl
and then we need there are two parts we
do really use the word line or you
format and display and you align and
then you do something MP line and the
end now this is all looks very trivial
or the non-trivial part is the ifs that
you perform in order to determine these
conditions what you do there of course
it's obvious but how do you do those
conditions that's critical and how it's
connected to the today editing editing
pretty primitive so it's a it's it's
it's deeper that it then it looks but
it's also very nice that you can look at
that a piece of code and actually see
what it was doing now this is this is
also a key idea that that bottle has
been espousing is that is the notion of
the interfaces have to be very high
bandwidth or the wide interfaces I don't
know what the official term is you know
what I'm talking about right but anyway
this high bandwidth and write interface
is that you don't call a subroutine to
get one character you've call a
subroutine to get a big chunk that is
very easy to handle and in this
particular case this was the mapping
mapping of the character in the document
obviously at those speeds that were
factors of two three or four orders of
magnitude down from what we are used
today it was it was very important that
you did it this way they were called v2
to get the character and what we
returned was a long string that that
could be accessed very very cheaply and
then at the end of that long string we
had to be called back and what the
routine did it will it found the piece
using a binary search and then the piece
was typically on a on em on the on a
disk page we found it in a virtual
memory by a hash look up and then we
have a little bit of trouble because we
didn't have bite addressing at the time
on the on the Nova so we had to do a
trickery and then then we are done
there's some special code special case
for system text that is not only father
so bottle of course wrote the wonderful
documentation those were the days when
when documentation was was valuable
readable enjoyable today it's the exact
opposite educational thank you today
it's exact opposite and and you know
it's why don't you do help post this is
the other page of the documentation
again very helpful giving examples
giving notes and and so on so forth yo
now here's a here's a paper by Louis
Louis Lampson and I want to stress this
in the remaining 40 seconds that this
was the first time probably in history
that non-professional
especially the spouses of researchers
and in France of research ISM coming in
at night using computers that never
happened before it was either a
word-processing professional who went to
that we're using computers maybe and of
course the computer scientists
themselves and and and they were
creating work of of this caliber and
documents of beautiful documents and the
acknowledgments to mr. a Bravo a is of
course for alto mr. Alto Bravo and they
go at that point it was pretty clear
that that that that this opened up the
world for 4444 applications and I don't
think it's an accident that today the
second and the fourth largest
corporations in the world in terms of of
the important metric of market
capitalization our software companies
and I think that it hoped for we are all
it's a let's see so I mean in conclusion
I just want to thanks for thanks for
Butler's help and guidance and brilliant
forward far-reaching insights and
without which I don't think that that
any of us could have enjoyed the success
that we that we had and and I think that
everybody in this room would agree with
me and also some people who are not in
the room and and I just want to quickly
mention two of these people referring to
the fourth and and second largest
corporations Bill Gates says if you
could pick any one to help you with
complex system problems you big butler
at Xerox and Microsoft he was key person
helping with the most complex problems I
only wish I had taken more advantage of
his abilities Bill Gates and Eric
Schmidt of chairman of Google says
bottle is probably the broadest and
smartest computer scientist today and we
all just try to keep up with him and
almost always fell behind his
work his contributions made much of our
world possible and I am beyond grateful
Eric Schmidt thank you so I've three
minutes left for questions yes the key
ideas in Bravo are any of those still in
use today boom I be in a bit let me tell
you I remember as a consultant once when
the scientific work stations were coming
out and people were building they saw
this kind of editor they so I can do
that too well they couldn't much like
that but I decided that the right answer
is the consultant wasn't to try to teach
them this stuff because it it was beyond
them but rather to just wait for Moore's
law to save their bacon and sure enough
a year later their editor work fine well
that's true well the mediator will guide
them out because they what happens is
that that you need this margin of safety
if you don't use it somebody who uses
that margin of safety will wipe you out
because they can put in more stuff and
Moore's Law is great on the other hand
the programmers ability to use those
cycles is much much greater than Moore's
law oh that's Miroslaw yet document has
an increased sorry i reheated because
that the number of pixels you're using
on the display screen to show a page
hasn't gone out much that the human
isn't editing faster so in fact you have
a lot of headroom that Moore's law gives
you to use to write simple code well I
think that's true but I think you
underestimate the complexity that that
that Peter is in some of the programs or
we are intending to put into those
programs and I mean just to spellcheck
to mention just one thing that's obvious
thing but but there are there's so much
more that that I mean there are software
that I could show you that would blow
your mind away and which requires the
kind of margins that we are talking
about here but
be that as it may you you had to oil the
you know you can't get there from here
if there had not been a success in the
beginning there had not been an
investment into Moore's law so it's not
like you could avoid you could have
avoided that without this nothing would
have happened yes l OB other my thesis
has the exact number of lines but I
don't particularly call but it's still
look it's the order of I would say
twenty thirty thousand yeah yeah I mean
we are talking about it's easier to say
it it's about six or seven percent years
ten person years is that the lines of
code have gone up somewhat
commensurately with Moore's law but not
the utility the other hand I will I will
agree i'll be like 75 and 76 as far as
turning out a document and I daresay
ninety-five percent of all of the
features that people use today we're in
that system no no no well okay I think
it was a great start but let me get Bob
for just a second and and say that that
the fact is that modern languages you
know especially see sharp and and to
some extent Java does give you a better
platform and an easier way of solving
problems at the cost of a modest and
reasonable expenditure of cycles but at
the same time you have to be cognizant
of how to use those those those systems
and you you you have to use these these
tricks I and we we are using districts
yes we're doing simply working with a
finish
and now this large software is our alley
cat by legacy so what sir Oh screw
legacy I mean it's I think code the best
thing that can you do is delete code you
know I go every morning and I ask people
you know how much could have you deleted
how much I will replace or well delete
it without changing functionality of
course and and and that is that that's a
big goal I think that the legacy of sunk
value is overrated as some value is
actually a negative value if you want to
get rid of it you want to get the
albatross off your neck the Gator the
song value the greater albatross it is
so if you take our features and General
Orders it was your damn version it's not
not my problem it's it's General Motors
is stupid problem is why shouldn't I
know I shouldn't prevent me from making
money yeah working for bummer what one
thing I remember from working at Xerox
is that Bravo was used at least
initially to edit code as well as
documents and so all the compilers were
written to ignore the little formatting
sections that Bravo would put in in the
file that's Alexis did not survive i'm
curious whether well i don't think it
was a that was a depth to the fact that
the program editors weren't using GUI
not about you know visual studio uses
GUI so it's it's it's quite it's quite
fine also formatting is now projected
rather than inserted in the in the code
so actually using formatting in code
doesn't make any sense it should be it
should be it did at that point but not
even the only reason it made sense is
because the editor was convenient and
the editor was doing formatting but the
editor was built in such a way that was
very easy to to ignore formatting for
so yeah it's that's a that's a small
small brilliant time when that was
important yeah just talking about small
talk of course okay thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
