his or her perception of themselves
right in college I had this undergrad
advisor Andy Van Dam who was just hugely
inspirational and treated me as a peer
for the first time in my life taught me
I could discover asked me to do things
he didn't know how to do no one had ever
asked me to do anything they didn't know
how to do before I was just sort of
retreading old ground and it was
astonishing to me it took me months to
realize that I was being asked to do
things that he hadn't figured out how to
do in grad school I had an advisor who
was not the smartest guy in the room he
was just the best human being in the
room and was hugely more successful than
lots of people around him who were by
his own admission smarter than he was
and so all of those are models we pick
up and I think you just have to try and
be a role model by being who you are and
you have to hope that the the advice you
implicitly give by the way you behave
and support people is influential</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
