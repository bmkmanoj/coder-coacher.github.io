you
yeah so as don't mentioned I've been
involved with the F sharp F sharp
Software Foundation I'll say a few
things about that and one of the
activities as part of the foundation has
been around data science and I'm sure
everyone here has seen some talk on F
sharp type providers which was sort of
one of the inspirations if you haven't
don't worry I'll show it anyway because
it's really nice but it's been one of
the sort of inspirations for making F
sharp better for data science and in
general so let me just start with I
think I have two boring interest lights
one is on the F sharp software
foundation so the idea here is that F
sharp as a language really has large
number of contributors there's large
number of interested parties one is
Microsoft product groups who are
building the the visual studio tooling
for F sharp
there's Microsoft Research doing F sharp
related research and the language design
but there's also companies like xamarin
and they're building tools for mobile
development on Android and iPhone and
they've been building lots of the
open-source tools for F sharp running F
sharp on mono there's quite a large
number of consulting companies around F
sharp who also sort of contribute and
are part of the community there's
there's companies like Blue Mountain
capital which is a hedge fund in New
York and they're using F sharp to do
some of their analyst analytics and they
actually built some of the libraries
that I'll be using and showing today so
really the idea of the foundation is to
bring all these different different
people from both industry research and
from the open source community
bring them together and give them a way
to collaborate and to sort of own the
own the environment in some way so if
you're if you haven't haven't seen at
sharp org then please go there if you if
you find something interesting you can
join the foundation you can send us
feedback and I think it's really nice
example of collaboration between
industry research and the open source
community as well so that's one intro in
f-sharp specifically I think that the
community is really amazing thing in the
in the f-sharp world or I come I come
from the my background used to be
c-sharp and I was Microsoft MVP for
c-sharp and when you didn't like
something about c-sharp you would
complain to Microsoft and they wouldn't
do anything in f-sharp there's really a
different approach where if you don't
like something you just fix it because
the community has all the power
f-sharp is it's open source there's lots
of people helping it and building it and
making it better and we have really good
connections with with the with the
visual studio product team as well and
they actually listen to you so I think
that the the fact that F sharp has very
active very lively community is it's
quite unique thing and this is just a
picture of some of the f-sharp user
groups around the world I actually
visited roughly half of them in the US
in the last month but there's there's so
many active people who are actually
interested country in contributing and
one of the sort of things we've been
doing throughout all this data science
work is actually engaging with everyone
who wants or can contribute so there's
surprisingly active and and great bunch
of people in Minsk in Belarus and it's
just amazing to see so many people who
actually care and want to help
what want to contribute so that's the
intro and what I want to do in this talk
is that I want to do sort of two parts
in one part I'll just show you a couple
of examples I'll do some live coding
which will obviously break because it's
live coding but I think it's it's more
fun that way so I'll go through two
examples and then I'll sort of say a few
things in general and least hopefully
also room for questions so what I want
to show in the demos is this sort of
three step cycle which I think is really
important to data science
we always start by getting some data so
that's going to be in both of the
samples I'll have we'll start by getting
some data and this is where f-sharp type
providers really give you a lot of power
because you can access external data
sources directly from your programming
language the next bit is doing some
analysis so once you have the data you
need some way of interactively exploring
the data joining multiple data sources
doing some quick analysis to see if
there's anything interesting and when
you find something you need some way of
visualize the results either by building
charts or by producing reports so and
then you will usually go back and get
some more data and learn from what you
did before so I'll go through this loop
into examples and my first example is
going to be looking at the US government
depth so the idea is we'll we'll use one
source to get the depth as a percentage
of GDP so that it makes sense to compare
it over the longer time span and we'll
join it with another data source that
gives us the the access to the list of
US presidents
and I'm going to start I'll just show
you how how you would start in in Visual
Studio and then I'll switch to a version
where I already have some samples but if
you have Visual Studio then really all I
need to do is to create a new observed
project I'm using this tutorial project
which doesn't give you anything as just
an empty project with a script file and
to do data analytics I'm going to use a
single package so here I can reference a
new get package and assuming I'm on the
internet I should be able to reference
FS lab which shows here and this is a
single package that actually doesn't
contain anything in itself but it
reference all the other all the other
packages that I'm going to be using and
it adds some wrappers to nicely link
them together so this is all I need to
start and once I once I do that I can
start typing in my F sharp script file
as this is this big enough can you see
the text and here I'm just going to
reference or load a single script which
loads all the all the things I need from
my package and it asks about some
security questions which ignore for now
so this is this is how you get started
and then from from the rest I'll just
switch to another project where I
already created this and I added a few
more things but I have really just added
some open-open namespace statements to
get things loaded and I can select the
code and run it in a sharp interactive
so it's really different to building
projects because
here I have some code in my editor and I
run it interactively in the window on
the right and that will that will
evaluate whatever whatever I typed here
so the first step is that I want to use
some CSV file which is here it's just an
ordinary CSV file with a number of
columns and depth data for the last
hundred years how many people have seen
the CSV type provider already a few so
what I'm doing here is that this is
telling a sharp use the CSV type
provider which is defined in the in the
F sharp data library one of the
libraries I referenced and I'm telling
the the CSV type provider to use this
file the C data see a sample CSV file
use it as a sample and give me a type
which I'm calling depth and the the
depth type will be generated based on
the example so I'll show you what this
does in a second this part is is really
only at the sort of type level because
here I'm saying create a type called
depth and this is why I was getting the
security warnings before because this is
actually running code in the background
in my editor and when I run the second
line this is sort of runtime part where
I'm actually loading the file and here
I'm using get sample to load the file
that are used as a sample but I could
load any other file as long as it has
the same schema so what I can do now is
to look at the the rows
and I can iterate over all the rows and
the interesting thing is happening here
when I do dot on the row I actually get
a completion list with all the column
names from the sample so here this is
where the type provider magic is
happening because it just figured out
that there are these these columns and
it also figured out that here is an int
because there's only integers in the
sample but the depth for example that's
a decimal because there's decimal values
so what I'm going to do here is that
I'll create two time series and here now
now I'm using another library a library
called deal which is sort of data
interactive data analytics kind of like
our data frames which was built at Blue
Mountain capital and this loads the data
in a nice time series which I can see in
the index sharp interactive so you
immediately get some feedback and see
what kind of what kind of data we've got
I can do the same for the GDP so if I
select GDP it's that the GDP yes that's
the GDP I wanted now I've got to time
series data and what I want to do next
is to join them and create a data frame
which will contain these two
informations these two information has
two columns question no this is not a
standard operator that comes from the
dita library and it's really just saying
sort of met this key to a value so it's
like key value key value pair mapping
okay this is a series so the series
thingy so further for the f-sharp expert
this is really just creating a tuple and
series takes is a function that they
sequence of keys and values and creates
a series which has two type parameters
key and the value so here that is a
series where the key is int and the
values are decimals so it's mapping from
keys like years to values in this case
just numbers but it's generic and a
bluemountain they use it for financial
data where they have keys as daytime of
sets and the values are float but you
can map to from strings like country
names to values as well so I wanted to
create a frame and this is going to be
another expression here so frame takes a
list of mappings from column names to
columns if I want to create if I want to
create that then I can just create depth
and GDP is going to be mapping to GDP so
this is not surprising the small
particular interesting
it just aligns the two series there's
more clever things happening if they had
different sets of keys because that's
where you can often make mistakes and
that would align them by the key you'll
see that in a second I could really just
load the csv file directly into a frame
but i wanted to start with the csv type
provider so now that I've got the frame
I can do various calculations or read
the data back and I'm just going to read
the series back first and show you a
line chart showing how the depth has
been changing so there
one interesting thing I can just pass
series to a charting library and that's
where the FS lab integration is helping
me so this is the US government depth as
a relative to the to the GDP and the
change over the last hundred years one
thing I can do is that I just downloaded
the CSV file from some random website on
the internet so maybe I don't really
trust it one thing I can do here is to
sorry I think I kicked something under
the table what does this do huh there's
like a machine with lots of numbers and
I don't know aha that's it number three
okay sorry about that so what I want to
do now is to sort of do some
verification that the data I've got is
is correct get data from some other
source and do some basic sanity check so
I'm going to use another type provider
here and that's the World Bank type
provider and what this gives you is
access to the data collected by the
World Bank that's an international
organization that collects lots of
indicators about countries and they
don't really have the depth data that I
need but they do have GDP so I can at
least check that one of the columns from
the CSV file matches to what more
trustworthy organization has and this is
again a type provider so here when I
look at countries it gives me access to
all the countries in the world and this
is actually connecting to the Internet
to get the countries so Scotland isn't
there yet
but if they decide to split I can
program against Scotland without
recompiling the World Bank type provider
currently I only want United States and
here I've got access to indicators this
is again getting the current list of all
the indicators that the the World Bank
knows the UI and Visual Studio doesn't
handle this all that well I need some
search button here but the thing I want
is GDP and current US dollars and this
gives me the data and I can turn it into
a series using the series function and
now I've got data in a time series from
another data source and you can see that
this spans from 19 1960 to 2012 so it's
a different range you can also see that
the numbers are different that's just
because they publish the data in single
dollars if I want it in billions which
is what the CSV file uses I can apply
calculation to the entire series and
then the last thing I want to do is to
join the data so I can just add it as a
new column and say GDP from World Bank
and a sign a sign this mutate the frame
and add it there and you can see I've
got missing values at the beginning
which is because the frame automatically
aligned the series and fills the rest
with missing values so this is how you
can easily get multiple data sources and
join them together now the next thing I
wanted to do is to do check if my data
actually makes sense so I'm going to
create a chart with the GDP from the CSV
file and a chart from the World Bank and
combine the two in a single a
and you can see you can see the
alignment working there is actually a
difference I could spend more time
calculating how big the difference is
depending on whether I care I think it
looks roughly roughly similar so just
for the purpose of the demo I'm going to
say that I'm unhappy with this but you
can see how easy it is to get multiple
data and sort of have some verification
for what you're doing and really large
part of this is that I can do this all
live typing the code seeing the results
immediately so this is the first step
and I've got one of my data sources
which is the the depth data and I want
to join this with another data data set
with information on who was the US
president I could probably go to
Wikipedia and just type it all copy it
all line by line there's not that many
of them but luckily you don't have to do
this with f-sharp because we have type
providers for lots of things there's
actually a PI provider that can extract
data from tables from HTML tables so
that would work with Wikipedia here I'm
going to use a different one which is
the freebase type provider and what this
does is that it a freebase is online
knowledge knowledge graph database which
has lots of different information I
think it mostly corresponds to what you
can automatically extract from Wikipedia
and when I look at what they have I get
again a completion list so I can go to
sports there's I think they they
actually call football soccer but
there's like World Cups if I wanted to
find who won the last one
you can waste lots of time with this so
I'm just going to follow my plan which
was to go to society government and
there's a list of US presidents and this
gives me a sequence of values so I can
just take the first one and this is
sorted alphabetically I think or in some
random order so I'll get Abraham Lincoln
and once I have that value I can again
look at all the interesting things for
example Abraham Lincoln was born in
Hodgenville there's also a list of
parties that he was member of so if I
look at all the parties and print the
party names then you can see he was a
member of the Republican Party National
Union Party Whig party and Illinois
Republican Party so you can explore the
data really easily from your sort of
code first editor editor view and here
so so what I need to do now is to get
the last the president's over the last
hundred year years and extract their
start and end year and their their
membership
I'm actually going to cheat here and
copy some bits of code so this one the
query curly brackets that's actually
interesting thing because it uses some F
sharp meta programming techniques to
take the expression I wrote inside the
curly brackets which says iterate over
the president's swords them by the
president number and skip the first 23
and it will translate this to some query
that gets sent to the freebase and it's
actually actually executed on the server
rather than running this locally there's
quite a few other type providers that do
this there's a type provider for the
Hadoop hive which can translate your f
sharp codes to hi grace so this will
give me some some collection of the
President objects and this is really the
only sort of long piece of code that I
have to show you what is doing what it's
doing here
is that we take for all the presidents
we iterate over all their governmental
positions if that was if the basic title
is president so we are basically
iterating over all the presidents we get
their start year and the end a year if
that's null will just fell in some
default which when I was writing this as
you can see it was in 2013 you can sort
of write the code and tweak it as you go
so we get the years and then we get
their their membership whether they were
whether there's a they were members of
the democratic or republican party so
let me run this and we'll see what we
get I got the results as a F sharp list
or collection of tuples and I can easily
turn this it's just another data source
that I can really easily turn into frame
so I'll take the terms data and here
what I'm doing is to say turn this into
a data frame which will turn it into a
mapping from ordinal index to a multiple
different columns
and by default this doesn't actually
know how I called my columns so you get
the item one item two item three once I
have it in the frame format I can just
say rename the column in this East
president start and and party so this is
this is the data I've got from the
freebase I think there might be a bug
because when I'm checking here I'm
really just checking if they were
Democrats and then I say they were
Democrats but there's who was it I think
there's there's one president you sort
of switched parties which confuses this
very simple extraction I'm not actually
looking at their membership during their
presidential term but if no one's
complaining then I'll just use this if
you see a bug then then shout and
complain all right so what we've got now
is that I have my presidents that's one
frame and I've got another frame which I
called goof which has the government
spending data and what I need to do to
actually display this is to join the two
data sets and that's one of the things
that you can do with the Deedle frames
so what I want to do is use the join
operation and there's there's quite a
lot of different ways for joining the
data the the library I'm using works
pretty well for financial data sets as
well as sort of lots of others but for
the finance you often work with time
series so there's lots of ways of
aligning interesting time series if I do
it just by calling join
I don't get anything useful because what
happened is that my presidents are still
indexed by just an ordinal number so
that's different index than the years so
to join them I actually need to first
three index the presidents and what I'm
going to do is to say index the rows by
start and now I just transform the data
set so that the P is the starting year
now I can join them and it should be it
should be giving me more useful data so
for every year I've got the depth and I
have a president for every year when the
president started when the at the start
of their term I actually want to have
that propagated for all the for all the
subsequent years so that's one of the
things I can do here if I say this is a
left join that's what I'm doing
but then there's option to say a look up
and that's basically what to do when
there's missing value so I can say exact
or smaller which means there we go
propagate the previous value to fill all
the all the subsequent missings so now
I've joined the data and I can do some
charting I'm actually going to be using
another another charting library which
is more of a prototype but it works
nicely for this sample so what I'm going
to say I want to plot the depth and this
is HTML based so it will just
open a open a default web browser with
with the data this wasn't all that
interesting but I can also say use
another column as the color see and now
I've got colored chunks that represent
different presidents or I can use the
party so this is where it gets more
political I can color them by party I
don't want to spend too much time on
this so I'm not going to calculate who's
better but you can see you could you
could easily easily do that as the next
step so what I was using here is a bunch
of F sharp libraries one was F sharp
data which is a collection of all the
type providers for CSV files World Bank
in freebase I was using the Deedle time
series alignment and the data
transformation features I was also using
a number of charting libraries and the
last bit I used was this FS lab package
which gives me a really easy way to
reference everything with just by
referencing one package so that was one
sample and I want to go through one more
which is going to be slightly easier for
me on the coding side but we'll show
some more other interesting aspects so
what I'm going to do in the second
example is to look at different
information about countries in the world
starting from the World Bank type
provider and I'm going to close this
I'll probably just restart F sharp
interactive in case I broke something
and I have a separate project and this
one is actually using a template which
you can find in the online on
templates in visual studio called
FS lab journal and you'll see what it
does in a minute but we start with
pretty much the same thing just
reference that the packages and what I
want to do here is to use the World Bank
to get to compare a population of
different countries so I'll get the
World Bank data collection and here I'm
actually going to be I'm interested in
all the countries so I'm iterating over
all the countries in the world and for
every country I'll return a mapping from
the name to population in the year 2000
and I'll turn this into a series and
this will this will run for some time
and then it will give me the population
I'll do the same thing in the year 2000
so now I've got two series this returns
data in individuals so again I can do
some transformations like divided by
million to get the population in
millions or round this and these all
these operations just work on the whole
series so it's really making the
calculation over a time series easier
here it's not actually a time series
because my keys are the country names so
I can not just work with year to
something but work with country to
something and that will align the the
data by the keys as well
so I want to create a frame which has
this as population in the year 2000 and
I'll add another
thing which is population in the year
2000 and I'll call this ah thank you I'm
trying to cheat but didn't work so now
I've got now I've got the two columns
aligned and one thing I can do here I'm
going to be using another charting
library just one more which is actually
a wrapper for the Google charts if I'm
allowed to say that and they have this
interesting thing where I can say create
a population chart for the year 2000 and
you can see that the obvious suspected
results there's a lot of people living
in China and in India but again it's
really sort of easy to get the data and
see some visual results more interesting
information is to actually calculate the
difference so where has the the
population been growing the most which I
can do just by taking the basically
subtracting the two time series so now
I've got the the population growth and
if I want this as a percentage I can do
some more calculations and see what my
results are so there's now I've got a
series with population growth there's
some missing values which I get because
I'm you I have some division by zero I
could get rid of that but that's fine
and I can add it as another indicator to
my data frame and display that so now
we've now we
getting more interesting data because
here you can see that the the countries
where the population has been growing
the most are actually quite different
from the countries where there's a
there's a great population already so
for example Mongolia has 33% more than
10 years ago so that's that's getting
one data here the other thing I wanted
to do is to add some more indicators
such as GDP so again I'm going to
iterate over all the countries and add
different indicators like GDP and US
dollars I'm mainly using the year 2000
because that's where the World Bank
actually has the data for most of the
countries it still has some missing data
which is handled nicely and when you're
calculating over the whole series it
actually handles the the missing data as
well so we've got some more indicators
and I'm actually going to copy over a
bit of code that adds some other
indicators and let me see what we've got
so we've got again a data frame which
has a number of columns with different
different attributes and the data
acquisition is really easy with the type
providers but there's another thing that
I can do with with type providers which
is less about getting the data in but
more about interoperating with other
environments so in a sharp we've got
quite a few libraries for doing the data
analytics but we are never really going
to be able to re-implement everything
and that's where I can use PI provider
to integrate with our
so how many people here know our or have
heard of our pretty much everyone our
isn't the pirate programming language or
it's actually for statistics and what
we've got here is our type provider
which uses my local installation of our
and it gives me access to all the
packages that are installed on my
machine you can even call the install
packages command from f-sharp because
it's just a function but here there's
like GG plots for visualization lots of
other things I don't really know that
much about our so I'm just going to use
basic graphics but the nice thing here
is that I can now see all the our
functions that are available and I can
call functions like plot and give it the
data that I created on the F sharp side
and this will actually magically convert
the F sharp data frame into an hour data
frame
pass it to R and display it using the
the plot function so this window comes
from the actual our runtime and I'm not
a statistician so I'm not going to make
any bold claims looks like the
population in the 2000 is correlated
with the population in 2010 that was
kind of expected for all the other
indicators yeah maybe I don't know
but the the key idea here is really you
can access all the statistical packages
that people have been writing over the
last lots of years our has like 5,000
different packages and this mechanism
gives you really nice integration
between f-sharp and and all the our
libraries and there's the the
integration is really smooth because it
will automatic
we serialize or convert the data it does
it in a kind of lazy way so it's not
doing it all the time it does it only
when it actually has to so there's one
more thing that I actually wanted to
show you about this template which is
that so far I was doing it just as an
f-sharp interactive script and I was
just typing some code in there and when
I'm when I'm happy with the results what
I can do is that I can turn it into a
report and to do that I can use these
special comments with double or triple
stars that's just a way to hijack the
normal F sharp language to insert some
special things in there and I can write
some comments using the the markdown
formatting so here this means heading
it's kind of readable text base format
so it's useful even if you're doing it
just for yourself
so here I said here's a snippet that
does something I can include other
commands like this include value which
says in my report
I want to include whatever this data is
or do I want to do next we want to say
now we can display the population and
I'm just going to copy some more
commands this says the output of this
snippet is called geo one and I'm going
to include it or we can add some more
comments saying this is how we calculate
and display the growth and then we have
another section on understanding the
indicators and I think this is the last
bit I need so you can basically annotate
your analysis
with useful comments which are useful
even if you just don't use it for
anything else but then I can run this
project and what it will do is that it
will use F sharp compiler service which
is open sort of version of the F sharp
compiler that you can call from your
libraries and the compiler service goes
over your script and it formats all the
all the headings all the HTML it
includes the code snippets it will
actually even give you types of things
this is just generated JavaScript
JavaScript sync it inserts the data
frames as nicely formatted tables it
will insert the the google charts
because this is just HTML based so we
can see it here and it even includes the
r chart which is tricky because r is
just a capi that we are calling all
right so that was the second bit and
here I was again using the D library as
a sort of integration point I was using
the Google charts wrapper which
following the good tradition of
prefixing every name with F we call foo
Google charts I was using the r type
provider to get access to 5000 tested
packages and I was using this this
template for generating reports it can
actually generate PDF reports as well so
to say a few words in summary I think F
sharp for data science is really sort of
easy cell because you have all the three
parts of the acquire analyze and
visualize F sharp is super strong at
acquiring with the type providers
there's good libraries like deal archive
provider there's some work on
I think more machine learning libraries
like decision trees on the analysis part
the visualization that still needs some
work but that's actually where the F
sharp community is super active these
days so we are sort of working together
on making that even better the the fact
that you can use F sharp interactively
type some code see what it does I think
that's absolutely crucial for doing data
science but at the same time in F sharp
year your end up with dotnet code that's
fairly robust and you can sort of start
from the prototype phase and go to
production quality code just as a
continuous process rather than starting
in say MATLAB and then passing your code
to some C++ developer who will spend two
months rewriting that in C++ so that
they can actually deploy it that's
that's an actual story and you can find
more on the F sharp org website so
there's a couple of words about how we
are actually building this I think this
this is really sort of interesting
learning points here but it was open
source most of the project start as open
source from the from the beginning and
pretty much all of them use lots of
tools that were built by the community
they're all hosted on github they have
actually really nice documentation which
is using one of the tools so being open
from the start
I think really helps to engage people
and get their interest the other thing
is having a permissive license so all
the libraries I was using are either
Apache licensed or they're using the BSD
license which means that everyone can
just do anything use them for commercial
purposes I think this is really again
important
if if you want to get companies
interested in it they either have to
have a way of buying it or they just
need to be able to use it and that's one
thing that is really great about the
Blue Mountain Capitol people because
they actually build lots of things
internally and they really said letting
others actually use it and the other
thing is really sort of being engaged
and being part of the wider community
that's been super important because all
of the projects I was showing have
larger number of contributors both from
companies that are actually interested
and from the open-source community so
this is one of the things that we've
been doing under the F sharp foundation
umbrella is to have this working group
of people interested in data science and
machine learning that are actually
actively contributing to these projects
and when there's an interesting project
that sort of fits the aims has the has a
usable license then we can just include
it in the in the tools the idea with the
FS lab package is to pretty much include
anything that you might want to use so
if you're sort of in that area and you
want to talk more then around the whole
day and I'm from Cambridge and I'm
actually doing sort of one day a week at
Microsoft Research here so just drop me
a note and we can chat about
verification ability or scalability all
this kind of work obviously this is all
running on the local machine you can
easily imagine what happens if we do the
scale services program your model pick
your favorite project and third on that
tabular or many of the others and how
can you make it as elegant and smooth as
Thomas has obviously put a huge amount
of effort into making things complicated
things simple and how can you fit those
things into this kind of world from Mike
sorry Microsoft product perspective as
well I think it's interesting what does
it maintain the great oz rear ml as a
cloud-based service that you might
integrate into this kind of work flow
smoothly you know just you know just
insert some massive scalable calculation
on a cloud service which we could in
some sense make money from as a company
so in programming models like this is
just a starting point for to hook in the
many different things we do at a
research lab like this many other people
are doing around the world so if that
comment yeah I haven't actually sort of
talked about this from the research
perspective I just wanted to show you
how the whole experience actually looks
so that's why most of my time was spent
just coding and actually showing it I
think there's there's a bunch of
interesting research questions including
making it more typesafe the other thing
I'm actually really interested in is
just understanding how life coding works
in general because people doing data
science have really different process
than people writing software there's a
there's a colleague in the computer lab
who does life music coding I think
that's that's actually a lot more
inspiring for this kind of work so
that's just a bunch of ideas
anyway well this is the comment I mean I
thought you guys more about using
f-sharp to drive I sure an L because you
know the experience in a Chevelle
essentially our functional programs you
know they've got this kind of graphical
UI for assembling of but it'd be really
cool if we could like program them drive
it from f-sharp cool yeah we should
definitely check oh there is a MATLAB
type provider it's in a more sort of
prototype phase than the R type provider
the the company who did it they don't
actually need it at the moment so it's
it's actually on github but before we
can actually put it in there it needs
some more some more lot so that's a
great opportunity for contributions
sitting on a tiny data side Chemical
Norval Jason um I think it does require
some a chef skill it's not the most
obvious thing you can do in F sharp it's
not as hard as people sort of sometimes
say it is I guess there's there's part
of it is that you don't actually need
that all that often there's there's lots
of interesting data sources that would
be great fit for a tie provider but we
have things like the JSON type provider
which is kind of like the CSV one where
you pass it sample JSON and that
actually works for lots of cases where
it gives you an easy way to access
anything that has chased an endpoint I
think maybe Don's doing some work with a
couple of his interns here to make it
easier so
doing a lot of work to Jemaine to make
running times easier but I think the
general thing is it's better to have get
the data into a standard format like CSV
or into our database system or or or
Jensen data or something like that so
what we really look for these very
widespread common formats which have a
sufficient schema or in verbal schema to
drive a fun experience you've been
sitting here and then talk bodies of
others who sort of gradually bring in
more and more the world or data to this
kind of mechanism if you have good ideas
for type of private projects often the
way to get them to go to the system is
to is to find one or two other
collaborators like if it would only take
two or three of the people on a MATLAB
top provider with a vision for how it
needs to work yeah I do kind of crank
through that process for polishing the
experience and making it simple and make
it robust and then because it is
open-source you you you know it's just
amazing how people can collaborate on
these things to to really polish it for
all the corner cases that occur for
instance when even when you're working
to CSV native there's so many different
corner cases in CSV fast and by making
that a collaborative process from the
older whether people are using the
provided scan adding that little bell
and whistle away you have tabs
separating or something like that or
some other other things that are needed
to really make those things extremely
broad spectrum and so that process is
chaotic and the HR community has a
secret weapon which is a guy called
Gustavo Guerra
who actually works in some other part of
Microsoft but he's basically whenever
someone puts an f-sharp project on
github he will fix it and it's just
amazing how many improvements he made to
the F sharp data library that I was
using so
to crisis a very useful omnomnom of
mobile development
genre an Android developer Windows Phone
spectrum which is quite hard for doing
itself okay it's a really compelling
that's are you so presented I suppose to
mommy
the other thing a big data so means as
opposed to maybe just statistics is that
it tends to have like a high performance
computing aspect even the size of the
data says we are all the numerical
methods of unified through PA or
something like that I was wondering if
you could say something about that is
that something you thought they were
it's something that the the F sharp sort
of data science and machine learning
working group has been definitely
looking into there's a couple of steps
in that direction
there's the Hadoop hive type provider
which is one thing we've been actually
doing some work with bluemountain
on making the data frame work over data
sets that don't fit into memory by
having like a virtualized view I think
there's there's definitely a lot more
that could be done on integrating other
projects I think the the Microsoft
Research Lab in Silicon Valley has a
bunch of interesting things like the
Nyad Nyad project which is like big
compute that updates on the fly so
finding finding a way of integrating
more of these into the F sharp ecosystem
through some form as definitely
interesting thing I think one of the
things that people have been talking
about is building something for
accessing spark which is a Scala based I
don't really know that much about it
Scala based big compute thing but if you
if you have other sort of projects that
you think would fit then definitely let
us know if you want if you're interested
in in joining this it's like mailing
list that
entirely public because we just don't
want random random questions there but
it's if you just drop me an email I can
I can hook you up with the organizer of
this and you can be on the mailing place
and help us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
