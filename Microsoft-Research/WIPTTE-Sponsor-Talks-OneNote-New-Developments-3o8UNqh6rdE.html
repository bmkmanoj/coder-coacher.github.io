you
next next Baker is mike thompson who is
the education person in OneNote he was a
member of the OneNote team back in the
and at the very beginning and has just
had been passionately interested in
education he was one that first saw the
potential for OneNote in education on
the OneNote team so it's great to have
him back on the OneNote team working on
education thanks Jonathan and said as
actually it's great following chris
Pratley because i worked with Chris for
gosh over 11 years on and off and so
recently we actually got to meet all the
innovative educators who were also at a
conference at the same time and Chris
came to that event and so introducing a
lot of these teachers to the guy who
basically invented one note and then he
invented sleigh it's like the teachers
were falling down in droves like oh my
gosh I can't believe I'm meeting mr.
wanna dance way so it was great to have
Chris there and by the way if you notice
I'm wearing a cape I know a whip tee is
a little more serious crowd compared to
the name of the ET crowd but we're going
to lighten it up a little bit so my name
is Mike in and like Jonathan said I'm on
the OneNote team I've been working in
the education space for for many years
on and off I was on the team for six
years from 2004 till 2010 and then I
left for about four and a half years it
worked on office 365 and then I moved
back more recently to work on education
again and I'll do probably a combination
of things here today in terms of make
sure my slide goes i'll do some there we
go all these I'm talking and I'll do all
the solutions I'm demoing I think I'm
assuming a lot of everyone here knows
what 10 days I'm gonna assume rate raise
your hand if you if you don't know what
the heck wonder it is because I'm not
going to wait for you sorry anyways a
lot of people don't know that one note
was recently pulled out of the office
organization this is an internal thing
pulled out of office and moved in its
own org and Satya Nadella has been
putting a special focus on one note he
is thinking of it as a special gem you
might say that is less discovered than
we would like it to be and we have our
whole organization as general manager
and business unit now in addition we
have a whole group
Engineers and program managers just
focusing on education and that's a new
thing so back in the day so to speak
when I was on one note and I was doing a
bunch of Education things on the side
there was one person working in
education in his weekends and nights and
that would be this person and now there
is a large group of Engineers as a bunch
of them in Vancouver Canada see Alex
there somewhere in redmond but we've
probably got about 20 ish engineers and
pm's just focusing on education and
features and scenarios and products so
that's a good thing and Saatchi has put
a specific focus on the education space
and so you'll start to see a whole wave
more focus just in the education space
and just in general when we talk about
OneNote in education we start with these
the core pillars just saving time more
organized and collaborating better and I
know who here saw Rob Baker's talk to
Tim people so Rob Baker's talk is
fantastic and I think that when you get
into the more advanced tener as I call
that unicorns and rainbows and that's a
that's a great place but a lot of
teachers and students and education
folks you can't start them out with
unicorns and rainbows because they've
been told about unicorns and rainbows
for a real real long time and most of
them won't believe you if you start
there so we just start out with hey it's
going to save you time help you get
organized and collaborate better but
then we'll move on to unicorns and
rainbows later on and they may or may
not believe you but a lot of times it
does happen the other thing we're seeing
right now is this explosion of
innovation with OneNote an education
space and I think a lot of that is due
to the class notebook app and the staff
notebook up but a lot of its due to we
have multi platform support now on one
note we have inking on the iPad wave
inking on on obviously tablets surfaces
are getting out there but we're seeing
this explosion of innovation happening
and we have things where we have lesson
plans being delivered in OneNote all
types of really interesting content we
have this is in the lower right some
folks in Scotland we have educators who
are hacking curriculum national
curriculum into OneNote and the reason
they're doing that is in Scotland
there's a lot little small islands where
there's no internet access at all so you
go to school where there's Wi-Fi you get
content delivered in OneNote and now you
can take it on any device you know I've
got I like to tell people now I've
Microsoft celebrates diversity I can't
believe it and we love iPads too and so
if you have a android or ipad or a mac
or browser but you can take all that off
line in OneNote and so when your
curriculum is in OneNote the kids can go
home when there's no internet and do
homework or title one schools too if
lots of places in the United States
don't kids don't have internet at home
or another scenario is student-athletes
who ride the bus a lot turns out when
you're on the bus for two hours you
can't do homework if your device can't
go offline or with paper it's you're
lugging around all these things and then
in France we've got a great case study
it's actually getting pretty broad or
dyslexia has been in research kids with
dyslexia and they've ruled it out to
2,000 kids and I believe they're they're
considering getting even larger grant in
France but the research has shown that
when using just one note on a tablet to
no other software other than one note a
hand scanner for scanning in pages and
tablet kids with dyslexia can keep up
two to three times faster than they then
they can without because a lot of times
just keeping everything in one place and
that organizational model if
everything's exploded all over like it
is in the modern classroom you know this
kid is not it's not a college kid here
if you can see it especially when when
you're that age and you have dyslexia
organization can be a challenge and so
the fact that it's all in one place
France is considering rolling this out
to 200,000 dyslexic kids this program
and so we're just seeing a lot of really
interesting things happening in the
education space now the other thing I
hear who here has heard of the OneNote
class notebook oh great a lot of folks
that's good so this and if you saw Rob
Baker's talk he does a great job talking
about originally the way this we got
Jonathan Gruden here mr. Gruden and for
those of you who don't know you know
I've worked in one in education a long
time we did lots of things over the
years we saw lots of things that were
happening and Jonathan started talking
to a bunch of different schools and
bought maybe a year or two ago two years
ago and yeah oh I whip it whip that's
right i know he talking about to rob
baker
see I think talk to Appleby and
Whitfield and st. Thomas came to some of
those and a lot there was a lot of
interesting things happening and lots of
different flavors of ways people are
experimenting with OneNote to make it
more efficient and so Jonathan came back
and actually talked to Chris Pratt Lee
and he talked to me because I wasn't
even on the OneNote team at the time I'd
left but I had this whole like you know
I like to say I was addicted to the
space and so here comes Jonathan with a
little bit of drugs and I fell off the
wagon and I got back into it again but
but Jonathan and myself started working
with a whole bunch of schools and we
proposed the concept of this class
notebook out that takes a whole bunch of
stuff from a bunch of different schools
and we added some more things to it and
and ultimately the idea was is this
class notebook helps a teacher set up
this whole one node structure in one
notebook and it has three parts has the
collaboration space where everybody can
read right project-based learning
co-authoring all those good things about
OneNote has the content library that's
read only for the students but the
teacher can put things into it so the
teacher can put in a syllabus or lesson
plans or lecture notes or curriculum and
the kids grab a copy of it and they can
move it to their private student
notebook and that's the part where the
teacher and the student have a private
space in which they can collaborate
together and real-time feedback and
happened and both ways and students can
do their work there or they could do
things in the project-based learning
collaboration space and that's where
we're seeing a bunch of really cool
things happening and related to that
about two months ago we put out a staff
notebook who here knows what the staff
notebook is for education maybe not as
many people so it's a very similar
concept but it's designed for education
staff and staff leaders and staff
members so you could have a principal
collaborating with teachers you might
have a curriculum plc but you can do
similar things where you have staff
meeting notes staff initiatives policies
and procedures maybe you have in the
read only part you might have policies
and procedures dates and deadlines and
in the private staff member notebooks
you can have things like professional
development or if your principal
classroom observations and I'll show
some of these things in just a moment
you might have things like lesson plan
feedback and that whole structure can
help
entire school then digitize and you have
staff notebooks that staff leaders use
with principals and vice principals or
faculty members in college and they can
collaborate together and then the class
notebooks are where the teacher and
students and educators collaborate and
you can actually start moving all this
content digitally organized and
collaborative all in one place and so
that's where that's where we're seeing
some there's sort of OneNote schools out
there that have completely gone digital
it completely are mostly gotten rid of
paper and everyone collaborates more
effectively better feedback everything
is on any device you know staff in my
pocket is I like to say I kind of hope
my whole staff out of my phone and so
that's the thing that we're seeing a
bunch of great stuff around and so at
this point I think I'm just going to
jump in or actually maybe i'll just show
i love there's some great quotes here if
we've got you know a window into their
brains is what people are calling it
with class notebooks shipping the way
i'm teaching student engagement and
accountabilities improved synchronous
feedback dramatically shortens the
lettering cycle so a lot of really
really interesting things are happening
in the classroom and staff as well with
this and we're seeing in staff notebooks
where where principles are saying
teachers are actually able to hit the
the statewide standards more effectively
at a higher level due to some of the
things that are happening with class and
staff notebooks so with that I think
I'll just jump into one not real quick
I'm curious who has seen the have you
seen a class notebook or staffing a book
app itself have you have you actually
done that oh yeah a lot of people
haven't that's good so I'll pull up the
class notebook first and I'm gonna be
honest with you guys for the staff
netbook this is a secret it's basically
the same thing with some different icons
and text but don't tell anybody but I'll
launch the class netbook and it's an
office 365 app it's free and the way it
works is it's designed to let a teacher
set up this class notebook or if it's a
school leader staff leader set up a
staff in a book just in about a minute
so I say create a class notebook so here
I might do math
period well 21 cheer I probably have a
21 in there this just tells you the same
thing I told you you get a collaboration
space get a content library and then a
private student notebook for every kid
in the class I can give a co-teacher so
if I have a code teacher or a team
teacher parent educators we've heard
great stories of para que ters becoming
co-owners of the notebook to help out
the struggling kids in class then asking
my student names and now right now we're
a little more low-tech you you can
imagine in the future at an undetermined
date will get smarter than this and will
support distribution groups we'd like to
you hopefully tie in two different s is
in the future other other places where
we don't get into classroom management
sure question yeah no that's great we're
gonna make it easier for sure promise
and then the last step this is the part
that's nice right this is not too hard
for an educator a teacher right it's
only a few steps then just what do you
want to put inside of each student's
private space and we give a few
suggestions and I can turn off quizzes
and maybe I want to add labs or maybe I
want to add other things but it's very
easily customizable and I it next I'm
pretty much done this just gives me a
preview so I'm a teacher I get to say
all my students i'm on the hub I get to
see everybody I can interact with every
single student the student view is just
I only get to see my own stuff so I
switched to the student view I only get
to see my land stuff I can't see all my
other peers obviously but I still get to
use the collaboration space in the
content library and then I hit create
and it goes out and it creates this
whole structure this is the thing that I
know that place is like Country Day
appleby would feel all these places you
know you know no more hardwiring all
this stuff together we sort of make it
all happen very quickly and yeah
and then the email goes out to everybody
how you just got invited to a class
notebook click this link student and
open it up we also insert the link
automatically and they shared with me
for office 365 so you never lose your
link so students donate if you lose the
email don't worry it's right there and
then you just click the link here to
open it up and I'll just show you a a
pre-populated class notebook here math
201 is one example my collaboration
space i might have group project work
project-based learning so Group one is
doing this stuff and got all types of
beautiful things in their group two is
doing some sort of mind map maybe
there's discussions happening the
content libraries places where I put
things like you know problem of the week
so the students can go grab a copy of
this problem of the week and drag it
into their private student notebooks
lectures handouts so I got a tweet today
from a teacher just started using class
notebooks about a month ago he said hey
kids were sick for a week and it's other
kid when I trip to Korea and they came
back and they were totally cut up they
just all the content was in the content
library they grab copies they did their
work so it actually helps efficiency
where previously they couldn't do these
things and maybe I've got all my
curriculum here 7th grade English lesson
plans you know maybe this was
co-developed in a staff notebook all
this curriculum in English and we have
this happening in local middle schools
they co develop the curriculum in
English in the staff notebook then they
move it to the class notebook and the
teachers can grab it they can tweak it a
little bit but everything's been
digitized they're saying it's sammamish
high school locally they've gone about
85 maybe ninety percent paperless and
they only started using a class and
staff notebooks in the beginning this
year and so it's very much changing
their saying our copy room is like a
ghost town nobody goes there anymore
wait in line for copies anymore and
again the best part is probably the
private student notebooks so that I can
browse around and look at student one or
student to I can actually see what's
happening almost in real time this is
that window into the brains here's my
real time feedback that I've may be
given and maybe there's a kid who asked
a question and they're like they're
confused and maybe they mark a little
tag here with IM confused and so as a
teacher I can hit fine tags right and I
could say oh who are all the
confused kids in my class right now and
I can very quickly then go and scroll
down and find all the questions think of
school of my finger is probably easier
my questions go there we go so there's
my questions maybe one kid mark they
need help but maybe they inked it and
there's another kid who's at all i'm
confused i can very quickly just skip
around and actually see what's going on
so imagine if you're a teacher and you
saw about eight people you say okay
everybody got that right who has a
question Jonathan I bet you have a
question he's like no I'm good no one
raises her hands and then I go back in
five minutes later I see this hmm i
guess the maybe that either the
introverts weren't extroverted or maybe
i did a crappy job teaching the lesson
like obviously things are different than
i thought they were and so yeah i can
address that in real time and start to
really improve the way that learning can
happen so that's a whirlwind tour class
notebooks again with staff the books
it's a similar concept i won't go
through the whole app the app looks very
similar it we give you some default
starting content that's different like
we give you a default staff meeting
notes section we have things like
initiatives where you could do
fundraisers or spirit week if your staff
maybe you've got your curriculum being
developed michael smith made this this
might look familiar to you got some good
force beautiful Polly Ridge for a poly
can to content from forest ridge but the
staff they look similar but again
professional development imagine if
you're a teacher we hear this from
principals a lot of them like to type so
if I want to do classroom observations
in the modern world if I'm a principal
and I'm going to give that private stuff
I'm her feedback I've got my phone I go
into the class I just take a picture
goes into their staff notebook because I
got it my pocket and then with my iPad
maybe because it's not just pc ink with
my ipad i'm sitting in bed i'm writing
my feedback I maybe do audio recording
and make formal observations and embed
the audio all the self-assessment
communication critical thinking all this
can be digitized lesson plan feedback
can be digitized it can be private just
to that teacher from the principal or
vice principal or the faculty you head
or the department leaders parent
communication evaluation you can do lots
of things here you can you know this is
in the only way we give a bunch of
suggestions but this is the type of
thing that we're seeing right now and we
think that this is a very powerful model
to help schools be more efficient and to
collaborate better at the end of the day
one note can sort of become that
organization and collaboration platform
for a school and the pretty picture the
infographic because people in education
a lot of times like infographics this is
how we see it right we have staff
leaders collaborating with staff members
and teachers at the top to the middle
here and then organically or not
teachers and students collaborating with
class notebooks and one can become an
organization and collaboration platform
for a whole school or whole education
place so that's that's where we're at to
that right now and but now we're going
to talk about flying cars in the future
obviously no one here is under NDA so
I'm going to be painting broad strokes
not committing to anything I guess is
what I'm saying so so one thing is we're
going to keep making class and staff
notebooks better that's one thing
hopefully that's obvious we're not done
with them there's a lot of improvements
we can do there like via you can imagine
that some people want to automate the
process of pushing out content and not
having it always the student get it that
that's a something I could imagine
somebody might want you can imagine lots
of improvements in the way that students
and teachers are automated into the
process of who gets added and who gets
removed you can imagine lots of
different scenarios I won't talk about
all of them but we're listening to
everybody's feedback and if you haven't
ever sent mail to OneNote edu at
microsoft com it's a great place to send
us feedback also OneNote user voice comm
is a great place to vote up and vote
down and put suggestions in but that's
definitely we're listening to feedback
and we're highly responsive the best
part for me as a former the only
education guy in OneNote person is that
the answer used to be that's an awesome
idea I love it but we'll get to in 10
years and so now with the whole team of
engineers that's that
an awesome idea and I think we might do
it in two months maybe so it's a very
different world that we live and know
and the other thing is is we just
announced office 365 API is including
one note ap is that means office 365 one
of AP is so one can imagine and this is
not an imagination it's real now lms is
want to pull stuff in and out of OneNote
and one can imagine there's lots of
scenarios in which one note can start
interacting in lots of interesting ways
and doing things with workflow or with
pages or sections and longer-term
interacting with the page content
there's a lot of interesting scenarios
once you start having api's and so this
is something you'll start hearing and
seeing a lot more of and we're going to
start working with small medium and
large education companies is the hope
and there's a lot of interest obviously
because class and staff notebooks has
started generating a lot of interest in
the education community the the ISVs and
partners are starting to hear from all
these teachers like hey I started using
this class notebook thing is pretty cool
hey we're using staff notebooks and it's
pretty cool how can it work with your
LMS or your thing and so they're hearing
from folks about that which is good in
the ink world we started with ink on the
pc we've got ink on the Mac we have ink
on Android we have ink in the new edge
browser you have nerve edge it's the new
browser that we just announced yesterday
same e which is good but way less words
and less clunky to say and held a lot
better um so you'll be able to ink in
the browser so ink is becoming much more
of a first class citizen for Microsoft
across the board I would say and you
know one that's we've always cared but
now the rest of company cares about a
lot more to I think because we believed
ink is a critical differentiator I mean
you saw a lot of the pages from one note
I mean try doing real stem on a keyboard
just doesn't work and rob baker i think
his point really well because it's just
a bunch of stuff you can't do in stem or
otherwise just almost any subject you
can't do very well with just a keyboard
you can kind of cram it in and make it
you know but just it's not natural
intuitive it's not super
it's very robot and so robots can only
handle so many things well and you lose
a lot when you lose ink another one
we're looking at is content conversion
and distribution got our good friend
Alex here we're working on some fun
things with him hopefully you'll see
soon here's an example who here knew
that grease moved their entire national
curriculum into OneNote well they did
that who here knew that Finland with
their whole national crookham in the
window yeah and Scotland's working on
and it's not just these guys there's a
bunch of teachers out there who are
building their own curriculum wouldn't
it be great if we can help them get that
out to the world in an easier way I can
imagine a lot of scenarios that one note
makes the perfect digital binder in my
pocket on any device in any platform and
I can annotate it I can do all these
things I can share it and so that's just
a great scenario not it saves time
better organized annotation digital
better for the environment there's lots
of good reasons so that's when we're
gonna be looking at and what's nice is
we have a universal distribution
mechanism and it's a free one one that's
free any platformer in device and it's
free and it's interesting we talked to a
lot of companies and a lot of educators
a lot of places that they do still
didn't know one that exists which is sad
we're going to change that but I talked
a lot of these folks and I show them all
this there's every platform every device
all these can't you show them these
scenarios and they're there I think the
technical term is their head explodes
they have no idea so yes is all possible
it's been around for many years and now
it's yours another one is econ related
but community we want to build a much
greater community around one note around
content we want to let teachers educator
anybody really but we think education is
a huge place and not just teachers
students what's the term UCG or ugc
user-generated content we want to create
communities of content that make it
really easy for people to share
notebooks look at other notebooks have
communities of different places host
them different places and so you should
think and see more about community
around notebooks in the future and then
almost done here who's here has ever
heard of or seen one note
in education calm oh so sad write down
this link take a picture tweet it put it
on wherever you want to do whatever your
mechanism put it in OneNote yes it is so
yeah it got upgraded because we added
more personas we added there's students
there's a student section a teacher
section in an administrator section but
it's a website design five to seven
minute interactive is professional
development PD but it's designed
exclusively for education teachers
students and school administrators and
this we like to say someone who goes to
this site can go from zero to ninja in
OneNote in about an hour maybe a little
longer if you're slower maybe a little
faster if you're not but in general
you'll learn a bunch of stuff here and
it's all bite-size chunks so you can sit
lunch watch 14 minutes for the
interactive trainings and save yourself
five minutes every day for the rest your
teaching career things like that so this
is a site that we're trying to really
let more people know about and have a
lot of hopefully more people using it
soon and with that I am happy to answer
questions and I'll share this deck
there's a ton more resources and links
and other things i'm on twitter 10 notes
on twitter happy to reach out on twitter
as well
I don't need the microphone a sock I've
got biology teachers who are not doing
all their lab notebooks middle school
lab notebooks at one note they love the
fact that they can do it one note don't
have to carry a bunch of lab books home
with them every night but they've run
into one little glitch when they try and
mail when the kids are mailing or
sharing these these pages and i'm
assuming now they don't have to do that
but i'm wondering is do i recommend that
she goes to the new one note and work
with that we're already in office 365
class notebook you mean yeah last
notebook or do i tell her this like some
time to fit well how about this i see
michael smith in the audience michael
smith why don't you answer that question
cuz he lived in both worlds yeah we used
to do the same thing emailing back and
forth that we've been using the shared
notebooks is so much easier even I have
a teacher just last week is not
tech-savvy starting up and running with
the the notebook and did a presentation
for a group of visitors yesterday so
yeah go all the way thank you yeah
that's what I would have said too um
just a little thing I love the fact you
can instantly grabbed audio the
Instagram video why not still pictures
Oh insert pictures directly from the
camp well here's an amazing thing now
that we have 20 engineers in Canada
without promising any dates real soon
you might see a feature like that real
soon that was the subliminal man from
the Senate live did Kitchener okay so uh
yes that is great feedback and we hope
to address that very soon what's that no
there's ink on iPads yeah down the Mac
but we are improving the mac with other
things very soon to that uh hopefully
we'll make mac people happy one thing
that we would really like to see is so
you can I like the the individual
notebook of individual notebooks per
student but it would be great to have
collabera collaborative notebooks for
small groups of students in the same
class
I know that you can do that in the
collaborative space but that's basically
open to anybody so having a smaller
group of permissions that like four
students could share a collaborative
space now that's great feedback we've
heard we've heard fee black like that
and is there a way to partition within
the collaboration space sort of there is
a workaround it's not the best but it a
lot of classes are using it you can
password protect a section so what some
classes do is they'll say okay group
number one of five students here you go
in here and you know use this password
maybe the teacher has it maybe not but
they can collaborate then it privately
it's not totally elegant but that's a
near-term workaround but yeah I think
that's good feedback as we move forward
we can again you can imagine there you
could have a plain Jane class notebook
or people who want you can imagine i say
i want three collaboration spaces for
content libraries and no private student
you know you could almost like build
your own in the future where you can
pick and choose but i continually am
running into our humanities teachers not
wanting to use one note for essay
writing and things like that because it
doesn't have some of the functionality
as word and i know that it's not word
but but they're not using it to write
essays because they want to be able to
and use some of the features of you
review and track changes and so are you
guys continuing does anyone else say
that or am i the only one um i would say
and it's interesting is I wish Chris was
here Chris proudly because you know this
goes back to 2004 where we have these
same discussions I would say this one
that was never designed to replace word
or PowerPoint or other things and we're
always very explicit about what we do
want to do and don't because it's a
slippery slope but once you because
there's a lot of people like well can't
you just add formulas from exhale into
one node and and we could but there's a
little bit of we have a finite number of
things we can do with extra more people
and as soon as you start adding too many
things it becomes a Frankenstein and
it's like it's never enough to the
people who really want word and it's so
then it and we would actually say do
word is meant to do
essay writing now you could embed that
essay or printed into one or do your
draft in OneNote but when you're done
like moved into word to do like the real
final format thing because one it's
never going to have all the richness of
pure word we might have little pieces
here and there but I mean at the end of
the day we're not going to be adding
large numbers of like Excel like or word
like features is is probably the right
answer one more question Sharon well
just a quick thought on that you know
lots of professional writers will draft
in by typing but then when they're doing
really ripping things up and doing
rewriting and when students are taught
to do serious rewriting it's often with
ink and they're writing different levels
of comments that are meta comments and
inline comments and whatnot so it could
be interesting to consider longer term
trying to be able to port documents and
lock them up with editing like you do on
paper and pen now when you're really
doing the highly loaded you know
intensive mental work of ripping up
about your document no it is good
feedback i'm like i said i would say i'm
not never saying never but i would say
right now we definitely have a set of
things we know we have to do and that
one is probably definitely lower on the
priority list and if you notice we're
we're innovating more rapidly right now
on non-windows platforms all of our
audio Mac iOS Android iPhone they're all
innovating they're catching up you could
say the web app so we're still adding
things to win 32 but we're adding things
that are much more rapid cadence on non
win through you okay thank you very much
