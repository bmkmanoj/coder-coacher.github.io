welcome to the Microsoft Research
visiting lecture series my name is rich
Stokely it's my pleasure today to
introduce Sarah Wilson Sarah is a
blogger a television host she's a health
coach as well and she's here today to
talk to us about her book I quit sugar
this details her experience weaning
herself off sugar spoiler alert she's
much happier off the sugar she's also
going to tell us how we can do that in
our own in our own lives and what we
might expect after we pull the sugar
plug so please join me in giving a warm
welcome to Sarah Wilson hi everyone
thank you very much for having me here
and hello to everybody watching this
online from your work cubicles I'm sorry
you can't be in the room with us
I quit sugar in January 2011 and back
then I was a journalist I guess I still
am a journalist I've been a journalist
for 21 years and I had a weekend
magazine column that I had to write and
I was short of a topic I used to write
about how to make life better and I
jumped out of an aeroplane with Richard
Branson I've meditated with the Dalai
Lama I've cracked really bad jokes with
Edward de Bono and done a bunch of
things and I was sort of a topic and I
thought oh gosh I should really try
quitting sugar just to see what happens
I've also got an autoimmune disease and
I don't know how many of you in the room
either have an autoimmune disease or
know somebody I'm betting that pretty
much everybody here at least knows
somebody with an autoimmune disease I've
got one called Hashimoto's which affects
the thyroid I've got very very sick at
the time well shortly beforehand I was
the editor of Cosmopolitan magazine and
I'd burnt myself out massively I'd
collapsed in a heap the doctors had said
that I was the worst case of Hashimoto's
they'd ever seen
they said it's a miracle he's still
alive people were prodding me they had
turns coming to a sort of you know look
at my blood test results and and and
observe it as a freak of nature
so the endocrinologist the doctors
nutritionists all said to me you've got
a quick sugar you've got blood sugar
issue problems your you know heading
towards cholesterol issues pre-diabetes
and so on so I had two reasons to quit
sugar I also had a very good reason not
to quit sugar and that is because when
you've got an autoimmune disease your
hormones are all out and you're
particularly addicted to the blood sugar
kind of rollercoaster and I was very
addicted for all intents and purposes I
looked like a really healthy eater I was
one of those seductive sugar addicts
I ate dark chocolate I had honey in my
chai tea I didn't drink soda or pop as
you call it here I didn't eat any kind
of candy apart from dark chocolate but
again I'd convinced myself that didn't
count but it added up to about 26 to 30
teaspoons of sugar a day now to just
give you some context you may have read
recently that the w-h-o or the World
Health Organization has just come out
with their draft recommendations to
change the daily recommended sugar
intake now this is a really big deal the
last time they tried to do in 2010
basically every of the sugar Lobby
lobbied the Republican senators and
essentially
George Bush approached the w-h-o and
said we're withdrawing I think it was
almost 500 million dollars of funding if
you try to instigate these new
recommendations now they're been very
cautious this time and they're putting
it up for public recommendation so at
the moment up until the 31st so today
people can have a say you can go on
there and say I support these new
recommendations and I highly recommend
you do that if you want to get back to
your desks and frantically get in your
say but essentially what they've done
the w-h-o have recommended following
sugar intake for children it's three
teaspoons a day for women it's six
teaspoons a day and for men it's nine
teaspoons a day and that's based on I
think an 1800 to 2000 calorie
diet so we're talking very small amounts
the average American and this is a very
conservative estimate it's about 22
teaspoons of added sugar a day now I
should tell you also that those w-h-o
recommendations include fruit juice they
include dried fruit and they include
other kinds of sugar substitutes as well
as honey so yeah pretty frightening
points of comparison and in a moment I
will actually share with you some
indications of how much sugar is in
everyday products and everyday healthy
products as well so what exactly and so
I should say I eventually did quit sugar
and I and I did it as an experiment for
two weeks so that I had something to
write about and I don't know if you know
too many journalists but there's nothing
like a deadline to make you do something
so so that gave me the the good kick up
the backside to do it and so I'm
actually really grateful for that I'm
also grateful for my disease it also
forced me to quit sugar I probably
wouldn't have done it otherwise to be
absolutely honest with you
so which doesn't sound very convincing
does it when I'm here trying to tell you
to quit sugar but um so I quit I gave it
two weeks within two weeks I was feeling
remarkably different my skin visibly
changed it took I lost I'd put on quite
a bit of weight about thirty pounds from
my autoimmune disease and that's not
that much actually for the kind of
disease I had a lot of people balloon
out and I'll soon lost that weight you
know and it just dropped off really
naturally without having to put too much
effort into it and gradually gradually
obviously it's a number of years later
but I have been able to get my disease
on my TSH levels for those of you are
familiar with this terminology to a
point where it's it's almost manageable
I'm almost off medication from having
been on the highest dose possible I'm
almost off my medication I'm very
careful about saying that because I
don't recommend people come off their
medication when they quit sugar you
really have to monitor it yourself and
I've been doing it for a long time now
so why is sugar so bad we're hearing so
much about it in the Pro
I'm sure you've seen dr. robert lustig
presentation on youtube you know there's
there's countless books coming out I've
arrived in America with my with my book
you know a lot of people say look is
it's just another diet you know we've
had Atkins you know no fat yes we eat
fat protein carbs what are we meant to
eat the issue with fructose or with
sugar is this sugar which let's call it
the same thing as high fructose corn
syrup it's the same stuff once it's in
your body
okay give or take a couple of molecules
but essentially it's the same kind of
the kite same kind of stuff it's both of
them are about 50% fructose and 50%
sucrose sorry glucose so every day table
sugar or high fructose corn syrup is 50%
fructose and it's the fructose that is
the problem it's the only molecule on
the planet that we are unable to
register in our brains as having eaten
so when you eat glucose or protein or
any kind of food molecule we have a
corresponding hormonal in our brain that
says ah I've eaten I'm now full and it
turns on this of appetite association
mechanism and it shuts everything down
says I'm full now I don't need to eat
for a while so you've probably noticed
that you can consume a container this
large of either soda or fruit juice or
you know some kind of you know sweet
beverage we can also eat a whole packet
of Oreos in one session we can also eat
a huge amount of calories contained in a
candy bar and we don't get full you try
to eat that much yogurt in one session
or even milk in one session you will
absolutely struggle to do it and the
reason being is that it contains fat it
contains a whole bunch of other things
and it doesn't contain fructose so our
appetite mechanism kicks in it says I'm
full I don't want to eat anymore
bang done move on to the rest of your
day sugar does not possess that
mechanism at the same time it's been
proven it albeit in studies with rats
but this is not the kind of study you
can do on small children lock them in a
room and give them a hole here
um candy and see what happens it's seen
as addictive as cocaine and heroin now
there's number of studies that have
shown that rats actually preferring
sugar over you know cocaine and heroin
and this is heroin and cocaine addicted
rats so I'm very careful with those kind
of studies because they haven't been
done on humans they're not gold standard
but does give you an indication and
again anybody who has gone back to the
freezer for another scoop of ice cream
or another oreo knows how addictive
sugar can be and anybody in this room
has got sitting there going I really
don't want to quit sugar that is the
addictive nature of sugar talking to you
right now now why would this be the case
why would we be evolved where P
sophisticated beings we've been around a
while now why would we evolve to not
have an ops witch and to be addicted to
sugar well it makes absolutely
absolutely perfect sense ten thousand
years ago we know when we were running
around the savannas being chased by
wildebeest you know we actually there
was very very little fructose on the
planet there was a few berries quite
bitter berries a little bit of honey or
that was really hard to get to you had
to climb a tree and combat bees and you
know climb through bushes and there was
really very little on the planet but
when we did find it we found that when
we ate it it was an instant source of
fat so fructose is the only molecule not
only is it addictive not only does it
not possess an appetite
off switch it's the only molecule that
goes straight to our liver and is
processed in our liver so other energy
sources are processed through ourselves
and it's a slower process fructose is
processed in our liver and it's
basically transferred into two fatty
fatty acids or liver fat within instance
so as you drink your can of coke by the
time you put it down it's turned into
fat and of course fatty liver of fatty
acids and around the liver is the worst
kind of fat visceral fat you've probably
heard doctors and so on talk about
visceral fat it's the fact that gets in
and around your organs very hard to lose
it's very much linked to heart disease
and a whole range of other metabolic
diseases
so wonderful when you're being chased by
a wildebeest or you've got to go and
hunt your honey or your berries for a
whole day okay we need this energy we
were designed not to expend more energy
than it takes to go and get our food if
you're not I mean so we actually had
these pockets of high saturated by
highest saturated content you know
quantities of fat via fructose that
actually gave us that instant energy so
of course we evolved to be highly
addicted to it to seek it out to be
obsessed by it and then to gorge on it
to have an abs to be able to find a
berry bush and eat it and eat it and eat
it and eat it and really really get some
good quality quantities of fat into us
and that made sense back then of course
it makes absolutely no sense now now our
bodies our genealogy is exactly the same
as it was ten thousand years ago but our
diets are dramatically different so I
probably don't have to spell out how bad
that equation all works out to be we
only have to sort of look around the
world wherein to see just how sick sugar
ease is is in fact making us the final
thing that of course with discovering
really only in the last thirty to sixty
years is that fructose is also causing
what are called metabolic diseases
they're very much the modern diseases
that we all hear about so type-2
diabetes you know everything old Simas I
think they're saying that there's about
22 different types of metabolic diseases
depends on who you talk to
we're talking as I say you know heart
disease type 2 diabetes you know a bunch
of cancers autoimmune diseases anything
to do with inflammation sugar causes
inflammation and and essentially there's
now very very convincing science linking
sugar to pancreatic cancer and I think
we're going to see it linked to even
more cancers going forward this the
peer-reviewed studies deciding to roll
in week after week and you're probably
seeing them in the press on a regular
basis so the next question I get asked
is well why aren't we told all of this
if this is such terrible news why hasn't
some edicts being issued you know from
from above well I guess there's been
attempts and of course we I was talking
to somebody at lunch today those
attempts I sort of shouted down by the
sugar lobby as as sort of efforts from
the nanny state we've we've heard that
over and over again and I was sharing at
lunch that somebody said to me recently
at a conference I was speaking out with
with dr. Lustig and a bunch of other
actually American scientists and this
woman who was speaking she said well
look if if if era than any state okay
well my nanny she knew what she was
talking about and when it comes to diets
and dietary thinking I would actually
listen to my nanny before I listen to
anyone else and I think we've actually
got to a point where we actually do need
government intervention on this very
very modest matter problem is of course
there's a web of and I won't say I won't
say conspiracy or anything like that I
actually think there's there's very good
reason why we've been led to believe
that sugar is fine and fairly innocuous
you know okay empty calories but you
know a bit of sweet stuffs not going to
hurt anyone everything in moderation you
know I hear that all the time it goes
back to the 1960s basically there was
heart disease was on the up and up and I
think Eisenhower I think I've got the
right era had a heart attack and so you
know the search was on for what was the
cause of heart disease as well as as a B
C D levels that were starting to
increase and there was one scientist
here in the u.s. called Ancel keys and
there was another scientist in the UK
both working on this very matter over in
the UK the science had found that sugar
was the problem over here
saturated fat was found to be the
problem now the study that was done back
in 1960s Ancel keys was the guy that
invented the army ration packs he was
the beloved scientist within the
government because he was a bit of a
hero for inventing these these ration
packs and he was quite immediate heart
for for back then he knew how to get a
headline you know and he managed to do
this study on 22 countries around the
world problem was that linked obesity
and heart disease I should say and
saturated fat consumption now fantastic
except for the fact that he decided to
only release the results
seven of the 22 countries and of course
he cherry-picked the seven countries
that showed a connection between
saturated fat and heart disease and so
back then before you know we had Bing or
Google you know people just accepted it
the FDA took on board that advice and
developed the food pyramid we all grew
up I think everybody in the rooms old
enough to have grown up with the food
pyramid that food pyramid then travelled
around the world I grew up with food
pyramid in Australia it's gone
throughout the world and as you know at
the bottom it's got carbs and if you had
a look at the picture that they draw
this doughnuts and muffins and and so on
nobody distinguishes what kind of carbs
so we're talking sugar then you've got
protein and then of course you've got
that tiny little segment at the top
which is fat and and we were very much
advised not to eat saturated fat many of
us grew up being told margarine was the
way to go the various Health
Organization's took all of this on then
we got subsidised sugar and then
subsidized corn syrup and so then we had
excess amounts and basically it became a
very cheap product they became vested
interests in ensuring that the food that
we eat contains sugar and of course corn
syrup and around and around it went and
to the point where now if you have a
look at the dietitians I think
Association of America I think that's
correct title is in Australia to the DIA
I think it says dia here as well if you
have a look at the the various heart
foundations and so on have a look at
their sponsorship pages you will be
absolutely horrified or perhaps not to
find that their major sponsors their
main sponsors are coca-cola Nestle
Kellogg's and so on basically big sugar
so we've got these organizations we've
got nutritionists we've got a whole
range of people invested in this idea
that saturated fat is bad now there is a
link between saturated fat and sugar and
the link is this when you take such
rated fat out of the product you've got
to put something else back in to make it
taste good and also to put to replace
that fullness of mouth texture okay so
what is everyone been putting back in
for the last 40 or 50 60 years
sugar so the low fat
industry is incomplete cahoots with the
sugar industry so if you go and compare
low-fat and a full fat version of
something you'll find that the main
difference is that the the low-fat
version is absolutely drenched in sugar
so much so that you end up getting this
ridiculous scenario where the full fat
version is way less fattening
once it's in our body on a plate yes you
add up the calories and the full fat
version will probably come out as more
fattening but when we eat it and I kind
of think we all know that that's the
important bit right we don't sit there
with it on a plate we eat and stuff
once it's in our bodies and it's a
completely different equation and
basically the fat gets metabolized we
burn it off we burn it off slowly it's
it triggers association the appetite
hormones we break things down when it's
a full fat version it's got all the
enzymes that help you break down that
particular food when you take fat out
often all the enzymes come out so you
actually are not metabolizing the food
properly and yes you get full so you
don't need as much and I think last week
I think was it last week your speaker
was speaking about the whole calories in
calories out
Jonathan Bale oh is that right I don't
think some of you might have come up to
his presentation and and from what I
know of his book he very much dispelled
for that whole calorie myth when we eat
food it has a very different you know
we're not that simple
if it was the calories in calories out
that makes you fat I mean life would be
a lot simpler but unfortunately that's
not the way we work so that's why we're
not being told so we've got to work it
out for ourselves and we're going to
make the change ourselves and you know
my book is called by quit sugar it's not
called you must quit sugar or everyone
go and quit sugar it's I quit sugar I
gave it a go and I tried it all out and
this is how it worked and this is what
might work for you I've got a question
at the back did you want to ask it now
or at the end it's relevant now again
I'm sure he's a little bit like you're
spent on that one added sugars and
Patrick tools are you finding an apple
if I'm eating a banana we're in for it
right so does that come with fruit all
subjects yeah not burrito Katie potatoes
whole bunch of fibers okay so the
question is is what about whole fruit I
think this you know is is that does that
contain sugar is that can included in
these sugar sort of recommendations well
very good question because I'm about to
get to all that right now so if you want
to wait five minutes I'll take all of
that off but very good question so I get
asked often what are some things that
you can do to cut back on sugar
so there's a couple things you can do
and this is where I think I get to your
point the first thing you can do is not
drink your sugar in any form whatsoever
so if you don't want to quit sugar
straight away it's all just too much if
you've got a gnarly
white-knuckled resistance to the whole
idea there are a few really basic things
that you may be doing that you know you
can probably start to eliminate and
it'll probably make a very big
difference so don't drink your sugar so
fruit juice a glass of coca-cola it's
just a standard glass sort of the same
amount contained in in a can is around
about 9 to 10 teaspoons of sugar a glass
of apple juice whether it comes from a
carton or whether it's been freshly
squeezed by Buddhist monks using organic
apples on the side of a mountaintop in
Burma it doesn't matter right it's the
same stuff when we're talking sugar
glass by glass of contain exactly the
same amount of sugar about 9 to 10
teaspoons so if you're somebody who's
skipping breakfast and going to one of
those juice bars you know and getting a
kale apple pear peach and spirulina
whatever it is I'm betting your sugar
consumption is way over your daily sugar
recommended sugar consumption and that
is a really scary thing so if you can
cut out juice never drink juice drink
water milk tea coffee all the rest go
and while I mentioned milk milk is sweet
it does contain sugar it contains
lactose okay lactose is not the same as
fructose we can a lot of people have
evolved especially
you know in Western cultures to actually
metabolize lactose so it's if you've got
a lactose-intolerant intolerance there's
a different story but from the fructose
point of view it's it contains
absolutely no fructose milk is fantastic
stuff if you can tolerate it
so fruit juice the next one is low-fat
products I mentioned at a moment ago
when they take fat out a lot of
manufacturers put fat back in so go and
have compare your mayonnaise low fat
full fat go and have a look at the sugar
content and you'll see what I mean
probably the worst culprit and again
it's a breakfast food is yogurt so if
you're looking at a small carton of
yogurt you know or standard serve for a
low-fat plain unsweetened yogurt okay no
added sugar you're talking about six
teaspoons of sugar now how can they
whack on a label it says natural and you
know no added sugar well they disguise
it and they put it in the form of things
like inulin which is essentially a sugar
once it's broken down in the body but it
can be classified as a fiber or a
prebiotic you know we know this wording
from the side of the planet don't we
so low-fat yogurt in particular is
absolutely drenched with sugar now if
you want to go into the detail of how to
read a label I've got that in my book
bear in mind it's probably going to
become hopefully outdated very soon
because the FDA is about to change their
labeling laws which is fantastic news
because American label nutritional
labels are you need a degree in science
or maybe to work at Microsoft to be able
to read them and calculate how much
sugar you're actually eating but as a
just a top line thing eat the full fat
version people you know it's the best
way to go it contains the enzymes that
break down the food it will satiate you
so you eat less of it it will contain
the nutrients that you need so you're
not actually eating empty calories and
it means it doesn't contain the added
sugar the final thing that you can do is
avoid sources so people say to me well
you know I ate out quite a bit I used to
be a restaurant reviewer I still very
heavily involved in the food industry
and I eat out quite quite a bit so you
know how do I do that well the best
thing to do is
to avoid sources so when you go to I
don't know your food court over here
Microsoft or even you know if you're
choosing between restaurants you know I
went over to the food court and had
lunch over there today I chose fish pork
vegetables with no goobie sources goobie
sources the goob
that's sugar okay barbecue sauce tomato
sauce 50% sugar contains more sugar than
chocolate topping chocolate ice cream
topping when you go to a Thai restaurant
you know you can have in one serve up to
half a cup of sugar and you know that's
why it tastes so good if you're going
out for dinner
choose Indian over tie and just request
that there's no sugar but it's generally
sweetened with coconut products and
coconuts fantastic stuff very low in
fructose and beautiful sweetener and in
a beautiful source of fat this is a
piece of trivia for you I often asked
what's my big sort of go-to thing to eat
when I've got a sugar craving you know
this is when everyone is pre-cut and I
did them gotta have to get the name of
it not daybreak good Wow what's that
good day thank you this morning and I
left the coconut oil with with Margaret
because she was like what's the trick
what do I do what could I do when I did
get that hankering and I think a lot of
women in the room men as well know that
feeling after lunch when you slept I'm
not feeling full I'm needing something
sweet you know and you hold out to about
three o'clock and then you go and have
your muffin or you or your candy bar my
trick is to eat a tablespoon or two of
pure coconut oil pure saturated fat it's
sweet I mix it with cacao sometimes it's
got a beautiful sweet flavor you have it
and a few people in the room I have
tried it because I was speaking earlier
it you eat it and all of a sudden you
just go ahh and then you can get in with
the rest of your day and you can get
through to dinner without needing to eat
another thing
now it's a medium chain fatty acid
the only other and it contains an acid
called lauric acid the only other
substance on the planet that contains
lauric acid is breast milk mother's
breast milk
it is incredible for you
if you are needing to lose a little bit
of weight it is the secret weapon
it works in credence II your face your
face is just not working press with the
idea of eating a spoonful of coconut oil
but seriously it is it what was that
1 to 2 yeah 1 to 2 and if you like you
can mix it with some cacao powder and to
make it into a chocolaty snack I make my
chocolate recipes basically coconut oil
cacao and and a little bit of brown rice
syrup as a sweetener or I personally
don't use the sweetener anymore I just
don't need it my taste buds have changed
quite a lot but cope with it I put my
pumpkin you know my sweet potato I
cooked chicken any it's it's it's got a
really high smoke point it's one of the
safest oils to cook with you know Indian
cooking they they know what they're on
about it's fantastic and fantastic for
inflammation as well so if you've got
any kind of chronic illness it is
wonderful stuff anyway I'm not paid by
the coconut oil industry by the way so
sources yes Indian food could often be a
lot better than Thai food you know Greek
foods fantastic you know it's grilled
meats
it's salads it's vegetables anything
where you can see what the thing if you
can point to the ingredients and you
know what they are then it's progeria k
gu b sources avoid them so getting back
to the fruit question I've said fruit
juice is bad I'll also add to that dried
fruit dried fruit works out to be around
about 60 to 70 percent sugar and that's
why breakfast cereals you know the
healthy breakfast cereals contain just
in one cup about 5 to 6 teaspoons of
sugar and it's you know predominantly
from the dried fruit those are its
natural well my response to that is also
is arsenic and petroleum does it mean
women to eat it now granted fruit whole
fruit contains wonderful fiber and it
contains lots of minerals and vitamins
and yes it does contain a lot of
fructose so an apple will contain around
about 3 teaspoons of sugar a banana 3 to
4 teaspoons depending on obviously on
the size of the piece of fruit
you can choose low fructose fruit and
that's what I tend to eat so berries are
fantastic strawberries blueberries
blackberries and so on I'm kiwi fruit is
fantastic it's low in fructose as well
grapefruit is okay your stone fruits a
medium your worst culprits and you
probably not going to be surprised
pineapple bananas and grapes and
watermelon okay really high in sugar and
you know I don't know about you but most
people donate just to note a small
handful of grapes people can eat this
many grapes and you're eating vast
quantities of sugar so whole fruit is
fantastic stuff and if you are getting
your sugar intake from whole fruit then
you know what that's the best thing you
can do for your health and I have
absolutely no problem with it the fiber
slows down the passage of the sugar onto
your liver you know the water also slows
it down and ensures that everything's
metabolize well but if you're eating a
fruit salad with three or four pieces of
fruit in it you are consuming double the
amount of sugar that you're meant to in
one day so just bear that in mind I
personally I towards vegetables I find
vegetables contain more minerals it's
more bang for your buck you know and
that's just how I go about things
so some of the other questions I get
asked and I'll cross over to your own
questions in a moment but I'm guessing
that some of you might be wondering
about alcohol well I've got good news
good news and bad news
the good news is that in wine for
instance on a really keen red wine
drinker it's the sugar that ferments to
become alcohol so very little fructose
is left in red wine white wine not so
much champagne or sparkling either
Voyage it's still got quite high
quantities your white spirits your dry
spirits are no fructose so they're a
better option
beer is maltose again it's not fructose
so I'm absolutely not advocating going
out and getting sloshed instead of
having dessert and dr. Lustig has a
really good saying a glass of wine
treat it as dessert so a glass of
one or two glasses of wine a night is
absolutely fantastic for metabolism and
so on and in fact Lustig in his latest
book outlines science which is not
absolutely proven but that does point to
the fact that the health benefits of red
wine it actually sends your body into a
slight shock it gets your body activated
and your blood sugar levels kind of
fired up and it means that when you eat
your meal you actually metabolize it in
a far safer way
so one maybe two if you're if you're a
bigger person glasses of wine it is
great when you have the spirits mix it
with soda or you know soda water or
seltzer or whatever it is that you you
want to call it not tonic water tonic
water is just as sugary almost as sugar
is as coca-cola so yes that's the answer
on alcohol again remember alcohol taxes
your liver so if your livers going
through a rough time really go easy on
the alcohol and then sweetness people
often want to know what sweeteners I use
and in my book I outline the details in
a lot of detail I looked into it for a
number of years and you know looked at
the science looked at what was happening
overseas there's a number of artificial
sweeteners that are allowed in Australia
and in the US which are banned in Japan
and the EU Splendor I think is one of
them I avoid all of those anything
ending in oh L sorbitol maltitol
and so on avoid okay it's a sugar
alcohol and what that means is that it's
it's very hard to digest I don't know if
you've noticed when you have chewing gum
it can make you a little bit gassy
that's basically because your stomach is
just going I don't know what to do with
this I'm just going to it's like it
doesn't have the choppers to break down
the molecules so it just got passes it
to the large intestine the large
intestine
basically has to use all kinds of
bacteria to try to break it down and it
variably produces a fair bit of wind so
not good anatomic apart from anything
else so avoid anything India Noel and a
lot of sugar-free products have multi
toll be really aware of it there
exceptions xylitol if anyone who goes to
health food shops you might have noticed
xylitol being sold it's deemed
relatively safe it's fairly processed
not the best option now the two
sweetener and the other exception is
Ruth atoll which is generally mixed with
stevia and I know many of you would have
heard of stevia because it's starting to
get a lot of traction stevia is the
plant it's related to the mint plant and
it's some little bit of a bitter taste
it's mixed with your ether tal to kind
of turn it into a granule like sugar so
it can be used one for one like normal
table sugar and it also gets a rid of
that sort of bitter taste to a certain
extent so I think here the most popular
one is trivia and I think equal also
make a stevia and in fact I found one
this morning it's in my other jacket
pocket it's a stevia mixed with dextrose
and dextrose is glucose and I mentioned
another exception to the OS rule
dextrose glucose we can metabolize them
so I think this particular one is mixed
with dextrose which is I hadn't seen
before so stevia fantastic its natural
it albeit processed but it's it's it's
quite a good substitute and the other
one that I really like to use and it's
relatively unheard of here
is brown rice syrup it's essentially a
slow-releasing carbohydrate it's 20
percent moisture 80 percent so the
concoction of of glucose and maltose and
it breaks down quite slowly in the body
so it's not that huge dumped into the
system I use it like honey I bake with
it I drizzle a little bit of it every
now and then on some things and it's
available in most health food shops it's
going to become more readily available I
feel and it's really interesting when of
Paltrow put out her cookbook a while
back and use maple syrup and agave and
blah blah blah and agave as I mentioned
I think I mentioned it 70 to 90 percent
fructose it is one of the worst things
that you can do do not touch agar bay
apart from the fact also that it's
really processed and there's you know
all kinds of political and ethical
issues with it as well but she's now in
her second book she had a she has a very
famous brown
a brownie a chocolate brownie recipe and
in her first book it's made with maple
syrup and agave and in her second book
and I flatter myself to think that I
might have had something to do with it
she actually does contribute a recipe to
my book but she uses brown rice syrup so
there's a few more chefs starting to use
this yes Oh a good question what about
coconut palm sugar
sometimes there's also coconut nectar as
well and coconut blossom nectar it is
essentially palm sugar and which is
about 35 to 45 percent fructose and it's
not as sweet so a lot more is used and
that's what's often used in Thai food is
the palm sugars and large amounts of it
so a lot of health food shops and vegan
places and raw food places use it and
they love to say it so it's natural so I
was asking on petroleum but um yeah it's
it's not as high but you do tend to
people to tend to add more of it so it
works out much the same so yeah brown
rice syrup I I think it's great stuff
it's quite affordable it's about the
same price as honey I've gradually
reduced and reduced and reduced the
amounts that I need which is a really
good idea because any sweetener now
there's released some studies that have
shown that even just the sweet taste can
continue a sugar addiction so the more
that we can get off into artificial
sweeteners and these sugar substitutes
the better I do confess to having a
number of dessert recipes in my book but
I do flag that they're to be treated as
treats you know even though they're
sugar-free they need to be eaten as
treats so that's sort of my overview I
try not to get too preachy but sometimes
can't help it because um I'm behind a
pulpit and I have a microphone and an O
and a really an audience so um any
questions I can see a hand up at the
back
monk fruit right through regular
granules okay so the first question is
monk fruit it's a relatively new
sweetener and good on you for hearing
about it it's some African fruit that's
really ugly looking and it's been used
as a sweetener and I think it's been
used in a very similar way to stevia it
needs to be mixed with your ether tal to
be sort of granulated and to be
palatable they're still experimenting
with it I'm not seeing it being used by
manufacturers yet coca-cola and Pepsi
and so on are all experimenting with
stevia at moment and I'm hearing all
kinds of rumors about Pepsi trying to
buy out all stevia crops around the
world that kind of thing I'm not hearing
it about the the ugly and humble monk
fruit yet but you keep an eye out for it
in Australia we can get it as a
granulated sort of substitute but I
haven't found great results with it yet
but I'd say the science will start to
improve second thing was the dried fruit
thing dried fruit is basically you take
all the moisture out you're left with a
very concentrated
Maalik you know nodule of sugar so
around about 70% sugar so it's I really
if you can eat if you can treat each you
know sort of a dried apricot as if you
know if you have two halves you know two
pieces of dried apricot that's as much
as you eat then that's fantastic I don't
know too many people that only eat two
halves of a drive dried apricot you're
generally a handful you consume in about
five pieces of fruit so avoid dried
fruit absolutely yes what about things
like race and other greens pasta bread
cups starchy carbs and yet I get asked
this all the time you know where does
that all fit in okay so I'm the no I'm
the quit sugar girl I focus on that
message asked me personally you know
about carbs or and I should said to that
thing I say work on one thing at a time
so if you're trying to get some sugar
out of your diet work on processed sugar
and obvious sugars and then if you know
if you do it for a couple months and you
start to see
results you may find benefits from cut
you know cutting back on your starchy
carbs now the science does show that
these starchy carbs break down pretty
fast into essentially sugar and has the
same very similar metabolic effects and
we're seeing a lot of people you're the
Paleo diet and all that kind of thing
there's a lot of credence I think
there's also a lot of nutters attached
to some of these movements and I
distance myself a little bit from it ask
me personally yes I minimal carbs
because I just find I find them hard to
digest the toxins as well the argument I
make is that a lot of these grains
contain toxins
you know cows have hoofs various animals
have horns to defend themselves grains
have tough husks which are very which
contains toxins so that's why I love him
get bloated when they legumes and
various grains it's if you're somebody
who's preparing your grains really well
that can make a difference generally
most people don't so yeah I tend to
avoid them the low nutritional value
they contain toxins and so pace a load
on your digestion and we just all have
weak digestive systems now and there are
much better things to eat when I you
know I sort of see them as a bit of a
waste of my saliva glands okay so I'll
give you a nice little snapshot thing
people ask me what's the best bread to
eat
sourdough even some commercial
sourdoughs that you get from Safeway or
whatever will still be better than a lot
of your whole grains whole grain bread
forget it it's you know it's a very long
story if you want to read about it read
Michael Pollan's cooked the fantastic
book and it does go into quite some
details to the whole whole grain I'd
prefer to eat white bread to whole grain
to be honest in terms of the toxic load
on my stomach and digestibility provides
very little nutritional benefit that you
know really but sourdough the the yeast
it's an alive culture it actually helps
break down the gluten and it also breaks
down any sugar so
that's the best way to go yes what can
you share on milk versus some milk
versus behind that now whole milk so
milk fat versus semi or whatever skim
milk always eat the whole food our
grandmother's our great-grandmother's
they you know they knew what they were
talking about now essentially I eat when
you are pig farmers when they want to
fatten their pigs they feed them skim
milk because it's basically got a much
higher sugar load not because it's added
but because when you take out the other
bits and pieces what you're left with is
sugary water okay so keep that in mind
it's fast more fattening
I know it's it can put it doesn't seem
to make sense but have a look around at
everybody eating low-fat products and
have a look around at how many of them
are not losing weight the the other
thing is is when you take out fat you
take out a lot of the wonderful enzymes
so the lactase is the enzyme that breaks
down the lactose a lot of people I know
who thought that they were milk
intolerant started drinking full fat
milk as an experiment and found they had
no problems because they're actually
drinking the enzyme that helps break
down the lactose don't mess with your
food
never eat an egg white omelet oh my
goodness it's probably one of those
things you can do
egg white is really hard to digest you
need the enzymes that are contained in
the egg yolk to break it down you also
need the fat that's eaten contained in
the egg yolk to actually absorb the
proteins I mean its mother nature knew
what she was doing
we just tamper and get fat and sick yes
I go back to what you said beginning and
understand what is the link between
autoimmune
winning children yeah and you mentioned
that you went off your bed because I
understand it it's just like you have to
supplement your parents in the case of
thyroid okay so you obviously know um
yeah yeah are you saying that you can no
longer need to supplement oh no no I was
careful to say that I through diet over
a very long period of time I have been
able to reduce the amount of medication
I take and I've been able to modulate my
health so the question was the link
between autoimmune disease and sugar
consumption and also whether quitting
sugar has seen me come off my meds I'm
still I still take Tyre oxen and I may
have to take it for the rest of my life
and that's fine
I mean me the modern medicine is
required when you when you have a
complete deficiency so I take a small
amount so I've reduced it from 250
micrograms down to 25 a day and that
works for me now you know and I find
that because my blood sugar levels are
stable or my hormones have kicked in
you know I've basically restored a lot
of the damage and doctors sort of go wow
how did you do that so um and I'm not
I'm not unusual there's a number of
people you know I know in my orbit
who've done the same thing through food
they met you manage your illness rather
than it managing you so the connection
between autoimmune and sugar at its most
basic level sugar in flames
okay autoimmune or autoimmune diseases
are a inflammatory disease and the other
thing taxi gut sugar basically destroys
your gut
you've probably heard of leaky gut and
essentially most people with an
autoimmune disease have a leaky gut and
what happens is toxins and foods and
gluten in the case of thyroid in
particular gluten passes through into
your bloodstream the antibodies come out
as they need to an attack now you
probably scratched yourself and got a
scab it gets inflamed gets red and it
pushes to the surface that's what our
immune system does or a splint off it'll
you know push it to the surface and do
its work and heal it's fantastic what
happens when you've got an autoimmune
disease it gets confused
and it goes hey let's just kind of go
out and attacks morgan's while we're
here and in my case the gluten molecule
is very similar-looking
the receptor to the thyroid receptors on
our cells every pretty much every cell
in our body has a thyroid receptor and
so when we eat gluten it brings out the
antibodies and the antibodies go away
let's go in attack and so it goes around
and has a bit of a party on my thyroid
so and that's what happens with all
inflammatory diseases so that's a couple
of the connections then you introduce
the insulin you introduce the hormonal
imbalances and it's just this cluster I
was going to say the rude version of
that word but the cluster of stuff yeah
um how much time have I got left I
haven't been keeping an eye on time oh
there is the time I've got how much more
oh I've got another ten minutes of
questions I think I saw a hand up over
there yeah yep that's you um if you want
to work sugar you like going don't you
order PR yeah yeah how to quit sugar
cold turkey or otherwise well a lot of
people say moderation and I say you can
unfortunately sugar is the only molecule
on the planet where you just can't do
moderation we're not designed it's the
only it is literally the only thing on
the planet where we cannot do moderation
with it
so yes I do suggest cold turkey my
eight-week program and it's I don't like
doing the salesy salesy thing but I did
research it with addiction theorists and
so on and worked outs are the best kind
of way to do it so it's an easy enough
for one week and then it's cold turkey
it's replacing sugar with fats
essentially you're switching your body
from a kind of if you can imagine your
metabolism is like a fire and you when
you eat sugar and cheat carbohydrates
you're throwing like karo and paper onto
the fire and it'll keep burning but
you're going to have to attend to that
fire all day when you throw on proteins
and fats it's like putting a log on the
fire you put it on your eat it five six
hours it's slowly Lee burns and five or
six hours you could replace things and
you're ready for your next meal
so and that takes about six weeks to
adjust you know that appetite mechanism
so I recommend an eight-week process and
you know four six of those weeks it's
absolutely no no sugar no sweetener II
that no rice no brown rice syrup or
stevia and the final week you introduce
fruit and things like that back in so
it's no fruit for that six weeks which
people go oh but you know I live I live
to tell the tale I lived for six weeks
for that fruit yes and I've got another
question here I saw you okay so green
smoothies versus green juices so green
juices is the difference being and you
squeeze and keep and don't include the
fiber a green smoothie if it's actually
made in the proper way
blended where you don't actually chuck
any other stuff out it's a much better
option because you're getting the whole
fruit you gain the fire but you're
getting everything in there I actually
have a real thing with food wastage I
campaign against it in Australia and so
I have a problem with juicing for that
reason as well but green smoothies if
you're going to go for a green smoothie
go for one that has very little fruit in
it I personally don't need the fruit in
it I'll throw one or two frozen
strawberries in and blend it up with you
know some cucumber celery and so on but
yeah I think green green smoothies are
fine it's green juices that are the
problem because they don't have any of
the fiber yes so um another thing that
we've been taught to do is graze every
two to three hours yeah I noticed you
just said 5 to 6 hours so I don't know
if you were being literal yes I am being
absolutely ritual um so the whole idea
of grazing and 18 5 to 6 meals a day was
invented literally in the 1990s so it
was kind of invented by a nutritionist
because we're all having blood sugar
issues we were so addicted to sugar that
we need to keep the Corolla coaster
going so you speak you know two
generations previously they at three
meals a day if you go to Europe they
don't snack they have breakfast lunch
and dinner in fact in many countries
it's lunch and dinner you know
they'll sort of have a something very
small for breakfast and it's lunch and
dinner but they sit down and ate a
proper meal I know it sounds ridiculous
but I think one of the big problems in
the West we don't eat enough we don't
eat enough at lunch in particular so
people have these like little kind of a
sushi roll and then like you know a
little lesson at all that or a little
salad you know hold the dressing and
then they go eat a whopping great piece
of banana
you know muffin in the afternoon and
then they go and eat something else
before dinner they pre eat and then they
go and have their dinner and then they
have something after dinner throw a log
on the fire and get on with the rest of
your life and stop thinking about food
it's what I say so I ate three meals a
day but I - one - two tablespoons of
butter or oil on everything vitamins a e
K and D which is your essential vitamins
and minerals especially leafy greens are
not absorbable without fat they're fat
soluble vitamins and there we are eating
these you know eating them without
without fat you know the French our
grandparents they will put butter on the
vegetables for that reason so yeah I am
I'm very much against in fact on my
eight-week program online I have an
online program if you want menu plans
and shopping lists and the whole thing
recipes for the whole eight weeks at I
quit sugar calm you
I actually it's it's no snacking from
week 7 onwards yeah
so I eat my snacks with my lunch that's
why I say so at the end of lunch I have
my like coconut chocolate thing yeah so
that's the way I do it and I just I like
that that much height that much food for
lunch you know and then I'm done so yeah
anyway there's a lot you'll read a lot
more about all of this because the
science is rolling in and showing that
you know it's not good for us to keep
not give our stomachs arrest I've got
room for one more
I'll do these - sorry yeah on a typical
day what would you eat that means what
way typically okay so for breakfast I
will eat some of these recipes are in
the book I'll eat some spinach and
frozen peas it sounds ridiculous I cook
all my vegetables and I encourage this
in the book is to cook up your
vegetables when you first buy them so
I'll go and buy my broccoli in my kale
I cut steamed them all up and put them
into Ziploc containers I'm single I live
on my own so it's a way my freezers full
of these individual serves so I grab one
of those put some frozen peas in it I
take it to work I throw throw me in Bowl
two eggs and maybe some cheese stir it
up put in the microwave I don't have a
problem with microwaves if it gets real
food into me and that's my breakfast
I'll have a green smoothie and I'll eat
it with a handful of nuts I will make a
big smoothie with basically cacao like a
chocolate smoothie with cacao and milk
and yogurt and chia seeds and and so on
for lunch
I do love slow cooking so I make these
big batches of slow cooked meat with
vegetables and freeze them in batches so
I at the office i defrost it and I just
take in as a key and handful of beans
and steam that up with it so it's
vegetables and meat I have these
mishmash meals and I've got some recipes
in there where I just kind of one pan
wanders just cook up a hold of edge
Tibbals I use sausage you know it's a
really easy a good quality sausage I
just cut that up and cook it up dinner
it's sort of much the same thing or I'm
out for dinner so at a restaurant I'll
order I Greek food Aida love the cheese
I can re you know I'll eat some fish and
vegetables so yeah that's that's and
like coconut oil yeah
Oh at the back yes so me - sounds great
how I feel for kids
so deeply grown sorry yeah it is harder
I guess sounds salesy in Australia we're
very awkward about doing hard sell
we almost pretend we've got nothing to
sell in fact you know we almost tell
people not to I don't don't over in my
book you know but maybe I should feel
confident here saying I've got a book
called I quit sugar kids cookbook which
is available online it's an e-book and
so it's got kids recipes it's got advice
for how to deal with kids a couple of
really quick pointers I'm sure many of
you here are parents don't stigmatize
sugar so my big thing is don't talk
about not eating sugar just have really
great food in your house that just
happens to not contain sugar don't get
hung up about kids parties if I go to a
party and eat a holly sugar just kind of
you could as soon as you stigmatize it
you know you know when you see a wet
paint don't touch sign all you want to
do is touch it you know tell kids not to
eat sugar that it's going to become
obsessed so I think kids eat just like
adults if they start to eat less and
less sugar they'll go to the party have
a couple of sips of soda and feel sick
and that generally is what happens I
think is keep it as natural as possible
cut out the fruit juice the dried fruit
in the in your granola bars and all of
that kind of thing
I'm just make swaps without making a big
deal of it and get your kids cooking and
get your kids shopping so if you want to
start to educate your kids at that age
take them shopping with you and tell
them to go and find the mayonnaise with
the least amount of sugar or the yogurt
with the least amount of sugar and then
they're responsible so their table tips
and good luck alright well I think
that's all I've got time for I'm going
to sign some books so if you've got any
specific questions come and come and ask
me
