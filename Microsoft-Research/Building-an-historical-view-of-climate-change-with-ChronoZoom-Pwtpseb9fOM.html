study snow and the water that comes from
snow I'm interested in snow i'm
interested in glaciers I'm interested in
how they paved over time
so the struggle we have in communicating
science is how to present information
based on data chromosome is indeed
revolutionary in the way that they have
figured out how to show information at
different time scales to look at periods
all the way from the Big Bang two
periods of a few years and to do that
with the same tool to zoom in very
rapidly from one time scale to another
to move through history at whatever
speed you want to move so we can explain
the variability that occurred in Earth's
climate over periods of tens to millions
of years in the last century climate
change is driven really by human
activities there's been rising
concentrations of greenhouse gases in
the atmosphere and there's also been
human aerosols so we understand the
processes that drive climate change at
various time scales and so in chromosome
being able to sort of show the present
in the context of the pass is really
useful again to try to help people
understand what goes on at time scales
that they individually cannot observe
the fact that Chronos who runs in the
cloud makes it really easy to use you
don't need any sort of clients light
application except a browser the only
thing that really shows up on your own
computer are the results much of what I
study is not very easily accessible as
you have to hike and ski to get to some
of the places where I work the thing I
can do with kronos ooh is I could not
only show data over many years I can
also show images and diagrams and graphs
and time-lapse movies in cron assume you
can create books stories that that you
can drive yourself you can explore a
story I have to tell at any speed you
want you can skip over some details or
you can dive into some of those details
I hope other people will use chromosome
to tell their interesting story by
uploading their own information both
data and images and text the most
exciting part of my job as a professor
is turning on lights in people's heads
to suddenly see in people's faces that
yeah I get it this is an explanation of
climate change now that I really
understand that is just exciting
