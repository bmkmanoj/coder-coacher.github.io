ladies ladies and gentlemen the fellow
university faculties first of all I
would like to thank you very much for
inviting me for the for sharing my view
on interdisciplinary education &amp;amp; Young
says case of interdisciplinary education
let me start with the Korea while South
Korea has been overwhelming success in
both education and information
technology over the past century Korea
has transformed itself from a receiving
country in from overseas a donor country
which being labeled abella fund there is
envy of neighboring countries and
korea's education system is open
credited for national success at all in
operation server in February 2013
president / promised a second mehandipur
following in the footsteps of her father
one of the key word during prep our
kunis administration has been her ideal
way creative economy which requires an
interdisciplinary approach to research
industry and economy as the basis for
this creative economy predator park has
prioritized the importance of industry
technology convergence for expansion of
growth potential and creation of new
jobs based on cutting-edge science
technology information and communication
technology the law of higher education
institution becomes even more critical
in the creative economy since
universities at the front line of
knowledge creation and education
cooperation and collaboration between
academia and industry institutions and
cooperation researchers and no
makers are critical in this era of
globalization and rapid technological in
advancement universities and our
industry partner must respond to demand
for new knowledge in our information age
and interdisciplinary education is one
of the answers to this demand for new
knowledge yonsei university was founded
in 1885 129 years ago by christian
missionaries and is widely considered
korea's best private university as well
as korea's most globalized one we have
always held a leading role in Korean
higher education we are one of the first
universities in Korea while changing one
on audiences prosecutors was first
Korea's modern medical school more
recently we have been at forefront of a
liberal art and residential education
through to his missionary origin yonsei
university seek to educate leaders who
will contribute to humanity in the
spirit of truth and freedom and the
servant leadership and we encourage a
strong spirit of community contribution
yangtze is curious oldest and the
largest private university and upheld is
rich tradition of excellence while
positioning itself as Korea's most for
looking and liberal institution of
higher education throughout its history
yonce has been the pioneer of higher
education in Korea by presenting new
paradigms in education and research
according to The Times huddle higher
education reputation ranking yonce is
all of the top private universities
worldwide as well as in Asia in quality
education
cutting-edge research premier patient
care and community service as
world-class University since my
inauguration as president in February
2012 I have emphasized the following
forces as the key element for success in
today's world communication creativity
emergency and cultural diversity
communication involves not only language
and the ability to listen and speak with
others but also the empathy and the
strong personal qualities that enable a
person to be a good communicator in
order to communicate well a person needs
to be able to truly understand and
connect with others even with those who
hold very different background
creativity is the ability to think in
new and innovative ways a skill that is
critical in all fields today creativity
drives inventions and positive change
and parameters to grow in new direction
without near idea the world would be due
and aesthetic place a place without
chain or invasion the dynamic
convergence of discipline the striking
grows in interdisciplinary and the
integration is a neutral trend in higher
education and research today such
convergence in academic field requires
at the same time a back-to-basics
emphasis on general education and
traditional horde discipline of Detroit
history and philosophy we need to remain
true to the fundamentals of higher
education while accepting and adapting
to change convergence II allow us to
remain true to our original idea while
also adapting to the
first is the change of the world around
us finally we live in a double
globalization in which cultural
diversity in our societies now the norm
we need to recognize and acknowledge
that we are different from each other
and yet have the insight to see the
similarities deep inside us on the
outside we may seem to be different in
appearance culture live and history and
yet inside we all share the dream of a
better world and butter of 80 tomorrow
we need to embrace and reconcile diverse
and seemingly incompatible
characteristics based on the principle
of the 4c yonsei university is leading
change in Asia's higher education by
responding dynamically to educational
and market trend and sobbing as the bend
guard in research education and Industry
tie interdisciplinary education is
gaining momentum as a keyword because
our complex information which society
requires flexible thinking and on
ability to adapt new input that depends
on a knowledge across discipline and an
ability to process various different
kind of information it brings together
two or more distinct academ field and
works with research methodologies that
draw upon perspectives and the skill
from several disparate the discourse on
introduced period studies goes back to
patrol I still can't Hager plot
advocated philosophy as a unifying
science and view the philosophers and
someone careful the enticing knowledge
similarly other thinkers right such as
the current contigo and the contour so
shared
of the unit of knowledge until mid 20th
century interdisciplinary education was
considered a way of the new university
and college by the late 20th century it
was not just an experimental program for
alternative to the traditional
curriculum what entered is cool now even
the oil city holds for more into
disability citing primarily primacy of
the practical the oil CD accounted for
the rise of interdisciplinary education
or I to five factors first development
of science which led to the creation of
a new field of lila knowledge and
attempts to define element common to
disparate second student demand for
knowledge that was applicable in reality
third problems of university operation
or eben administration for spoke a
chanel and professional training
requirement by industry and jamaka fifth
the original social demand for dot
Indies and new subject cannot be
contained within a single disciplinary
frame such as environmental research
these demands were felt in Korea and in
Asia as well and the youngest among the
first in the reason to respond and
develop ie and research program while I
poses challenges for University because
faculty and programs are configured our
own line of existing department field
and this brain yonce support this future
direction and is promoting new paradigms
in education research and campus
infrastructure toward this end yet the
answer one of the ways in which we are
promoting interdisciplinary education is
through the liver rod which by nature
promote
critical thinking and emphasized tools
over content in process of deep
emphasizing majors of field or study on
a sphere in the general higher education
noted a student at liberal at callies
are significantly more likely than those
that are the college to understand and
sympathize with people from diverse
background according to what was your
national study of liber8 there are seven
outcomes of river art education
integration of learning inclination to
inquire to inquire and lifelong learning
effective listening and problem solving
moral character intercultural
effectiveness leadership and well-being
tying the search word leave a lot on the
internet we can find this amusing it
shows many of keywords that accompany
lead to liberate in Asia however the
Liberata is a new and unfamiliar concern
because universities in the reason have
a digital traditional emphasized only
professionalisation liberal arts
education is a fairly decent trend and
the answer is pioneering this move for
the first time in Korea yonce in for the
first time in Korea and also in Asia USA
introduced a residential college system
at the international campus in sogndal
meanwhile our flagship international on
the great program unload international
carries stand as the benchmark for
Liberata education in Asia residential
college system at yonsei university is

proneness the reason is home to many
multinational companies and
international organizations the Green
Climate Fund which is often in 2013 is
expected to rival the World Bank in

bases in Songdo medical and biological
research complexes in the area engaging
cutting-edge e RND in conjunction with
industry partners the Songdo global
University campus complex next or

countries
around the world you are seeing as
program a couple of the ways in which we
are utilizing our new campus located in
turn as jumping off point to the
becoming I chose World University yonsei
university stands at the cutting edge of
research ventures as well we are
strengthening our research capacity by
responding to the needs and potentials
or barriers convergence research
initiative and activity actively
engaging interdisciplinary research
project in the process we are supporting
the development of future technology
young sir encourages research and
development in advance the science and
technology that develop on the new
medicines and new biomedical technology
through the expansion of the engineering
school and establishment the school of
biomedical science and technology
development of new medical and
biomedical technologies will improve the
quality of life and prosperity of future
generations and will be essential in
creating future values in Northeast Asia
the Asian continent and across the grown
our new campus at Incheon oars houses
the USA Institute of convergence
technology is affiliated on the grid
protein scrub integrate technology
stability in 2011 the Institute of
convergence technology focuses on four
main areas research computation
communication sameness transportation
smart living and the medical system the
next generation of expert in this field
is forced by scrub integrated technology
supported by the Korean government
industry partners and the USA this
innovative undergrad program aims to
train future leaders in smart technology
I CT and as an environment in 2013 yonce
established the icon Institute of
convergence science which consolidated
50 existing research centers on all four
campuses and provided on incentive for
formational interdisciplinary research
Tom's drawing on faculty from diverse
field icon in promoting creative and
innovate convergence research while
encouraging sustainable development in
each of the individual research centers
contributed to president parks vision
for creative economy icons will serve as
a leader in global convergence science
research on the administration side also
we are actively promoting information
and resource sharing among our various
campuses qin qiong one jus Sandow and
yonsei university health system to
better facilitate the use of resources
across campuses we are sending network
communication and cleaning among them in
initiative ranging from great
information sharing to collect the
workshop we hope 93% of employers say
that a demonstrated capacity to think
critically communicate clearly and so
complex problem is more important than a
candidate on the on the grid major more
than seventy-five percent want higher
education to place more emphasis on
these skills and eight percent agree
that regardless of their major or
college student should acquire broad
knowledge in Dibble art and sciences
employers recognized the
stood a liberal art education better
prepare students for your world problems
and job this has been demonstrated to be
true in the United States and we are
working on persuading Korean employees
of the same as the world continue become
more technologically advanced with a new
discovery made every day knowledge is
more accessible and you because the
neighbor in such a narrow a simply
sharing of knowledge is not enough and
we need to move to critical creating new
knowledge ease new forms of social media
and Internet platforms enable bezel and
interactive means of information sharing
with information traveling fast and
further the thirst for new knowledge
demand creative and innovative ways of
thinking and is up to universities to
provide an environment and the source to
enable thought you thinking
interdisciplinary poses challenge for
university because of a department based
on the nature of existing title 10
program faculty and sometimes student
can be resistant to the programs that
are unfamiliar or the change existing
patterns of funding research or teaching
yonce is striving to break down these
barriers and implement a true
interdisciplinarity through the
residential college programs and unload
international college at our
groundbreaking international campus we
have changed the vision of undergrad
education career through new research
initiative and sharing information
technology among our four campuses we
seek to promote synergy in our
