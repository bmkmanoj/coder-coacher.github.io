it was like a Royal Rumble now it was
actually really good so we had nine
startups and we had it's pretty
surprising actually had twilio Microsoft
Twitter slack kick and IBM I'll show up
and we asked basically half and half two
simple questions so we asked the
platform companies how are you
supporting companies and startups
building value on your platform and
there's really good stuff over there you
should go check it out I've just got a
quick summary one is just that they're
here they're showing up right which is a
big big deal there's some notable
absences and I think we should
appreciate you know the folks that have
shown up to work with us here on the
second one is that they're actually
working together right so you've got
microsoft and kick and slack and all
these companies actually interoperating
which is pretty weird actually I mean
it's actually really really good it's
good for all of us the tools I mean the
stuff that they provide for us to build
on is a big big part of it although you
know the early part of the discussion
was well we give you tools that's our
job right and like we need a lot more
than just tools from the platforms
another good point was there's they're
open sourcing stuff right so there's
this is also good so they're not not
every platform companies trying to
accrue all the value owned it and
monetize it which i think you know we
spoke about sort of saying maybe there's
broadly some thinking about where we
should open source and not open road
maps are good not every company is doing
it but every company probably should be
doing it although even that is not
sufficient right open enterprise sales
support so you know actually helping
train sales and BD teams about our
products and and start pushing them and
then surprising amount of the companies
actually have funds of you know
relatively large fund so that was sort
of how the company sort of the platform
company said we're helping you ever no
man where's Phil I just deleted my whole
Evernote ok so then we asked startups
what do you need from the platforms to
be successful move faster the first one
was money and everyone everyone who's
running a fund also it was kind of like
how do I get that money I don't think
there's ever an easy
to that but yeah this platform companies
who have fun should just tell us how we
can get it this one for Peter it's a
little harsh but it's true i think the
platforms are being thrown together and
you know the stuff is coming out really
really fast and there needs to be some
more foundational thinking so some of
the stuff that's already been said you
know what are the specific primitives
and so you know we sort of said this is
like the web like the webhead HTML and
mobile had 20 year old objective c and
java api s and we have send receive
api's right so it's a real problem and
just like waiting for that to get fixed
and you know it came up that we want to
influence that right we don't want to
just wait for platform companies to
figure it out well everyone in this room
has ideas for primitives platforms are
shifting under our feet just like more
stability would be really good I mean we
understand that things are changing but
we need to know and not just have stuff
go down official partner programs need
to be put in place so this is a solved
problem right i mean we know what
partner programs look like from you know
a million years of enterprise business
like knowing where you are how to get
into the process where you are in the
process what happens timelines you know
we're all running on limited you know
cash so we need to be able to move that
along in my notes these are all caps
with four exclamation points discovery
how do you find bots right monetization
that's for ! how do we influenced the
design process like how specifically do
we get in a room with you like this this
is all this stuff needs to be processed
driven it's like it's amazing that
everyone's here but like we need to know
how do we push it through and then
lastly how do we build sort of a
sustainable ecosystem because of some of
the things we said around lack of
transparency lack of ability to
influence we're all kind of building
there's probably a lot of overlap and
like nobody wants to compete with
Microsoft or slack we want to build
value that accrues there so being more
open so that we don't have to do that
would be good but the main consensus was
actually sorry the last thing is we want
help from all the companies that did
show up
after I stopped talking we have to clap
for because they're amazing for being
here have to guilt all the companies
that are not here which is also on the
board you guys should tweet that
directly at the companies that are not
here Facebook Amazon exactly so that's
it again thanks to all the platforms
that came and are here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
