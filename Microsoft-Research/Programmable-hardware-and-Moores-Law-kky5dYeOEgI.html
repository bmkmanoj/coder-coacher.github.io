will have on Moore's Law is it something
that will extend this a little bit it
gives us a little bit of breathing room
in the meantime I would say that that
you know an FPGA can accelerate software
when you move something in and if it's
an amenable workload by about 100 x yeah
a 6 you know typically a thousand X in
terms of performance per Joule F pj's
are about 100 x and so I mean what that
means is that if we are able to deploy
this programmable hardware in our cloud
we will be able to start moving
workloads over yeah now I should
emphasize here that this is still a
research project sure you know this is I
think our goal is researchers is to try
to shift the industry but but when you
have a lot of programmable logic in your
cloud it's a target where you can start
migrating services over each time you do
you might get 10 x 20 x tune in some
more get 100 x and as you move more and
more services over you get more and more
efficiency so even if moore's law stops
or even if even if moore's law keeps
going but for cost reasons our cpus
aren't getting that much faster yeah
okay this gives us a scaling path yeah
for some number of years we can keep
improving the performance of our
services we can keep improving the
quality of our services running at
larger scale we can improve the
efficiency of our services the cost of
our services well past the end of
Moore's law yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
