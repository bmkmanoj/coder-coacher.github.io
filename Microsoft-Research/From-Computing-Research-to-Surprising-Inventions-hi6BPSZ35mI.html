hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
thank you it's really a pleasure to be
here today and an honor to have a chance
to talk to all of you what I wanted to
do was to build on the lecture that you
heard this morning from Rick wretched on
why Microsoft is engaged in research and
the nature of research and so let me
just dive right in with a classic
problem in computer science research
which is called the pancake flipping
problem and so I don't know how many of
you are familiar with this but I'll
explain it by the way I do realize that
there are different kinds of pancakes in
India so let me switch to the picture to
this it'll be a little bit better so the
pancake flipping problem is a very old
classic problem in computer science so
we imagine that each pancake has a
number one through n and they're all
scrambled in this stack and so now we
want to sort the pancake so that they
are in order 1 2 3 4 5 and so on to em
and the only operation that we are
allowed is to insert a spatula somewhere
in the middle of the stack and then do a
flip of the pancakes that we pick up and
so the question is for a stack of n
pancakes what is the minimum number of
flips required in order to sort all the
pancakes and there's a slightly harder
version in fact there are many
variations of the problem a slightly
harder and common variation of the
problem is to imagine that the pancakes
are actually burned on the bottom and so
you not only want to sort them but you
want to have the pit the stack of
pancakes end up with the burnside still
facing down so that no one can see that
the pancakes are burned so this is a
very old problem and one of the
surprising things about this problem is
that one of the most important early
works on this problem was done by the
founder of Microsoft Bill Gates
and this is way back in nineteen
seventy-nine when Microsoft was still a
very very small company not even in in
redmond washington and so the reason to
explain this is to just give you a sense
of how much research means to Microsoft
it's really in a sense in the DNA of
Microsoft really going back to its
founding where even the founder of
Microsoft co-founder of Microsoft was
directly involved in research and
publishing in research journals so now
continuing on the theme of working on
problems what I'd like to do now is to
give all of you a test and so if you
will bear with me on the next slide I'm
going to show you a picture and the
picture will have lots of different
colored and sizes of dots and so what i
will do is ask you to look at this
picture carefully and tell me how many
red dots there are and i'll give you
five seconds to complete the test okay
all right here we go 5 4 3 2 1 how many
blue dots
I can hear many of you talking but i
don't think i heard the right hand sir
they're they're actually seven booth
outs but here's the actual point of the
test when we work in Microsoft Research
and for anyone in research when we try
to work with the product groups the
teams of people who are very hard at
work and very focused developing new
products those product groups are
exceptionally disciplined and focused
they're trying to understand deeply what
does the customer need what does the
customer want what problems does the
customer have that we want to solve and
when do we need to finish our product in
order to make sure that we can satisfy
the customers needs and so there's a
level of focus and discipline and all of
you in this room when you were counting
the red dots you were also showing the
same kind of focus and discipline to
solve the problem and that is very
similar analogous to the focus that
product teams have but every once in a
while it becomes important to know other
things in this case to know how many
blue dots there are and so one of the
roles of research at least research in a
company like Microsoft is to have a body
of people a well of knowledge to draw on
in case the unexpected happens and we
need to know something new or we might
even come to a realization that the
world has changed and suddenly it's more
important to know how many blue dots
there are than red dots and so in
research one of the things that we
always try to do is look for the
unexpected and try to understand not
just the current focused product that
we're trying to develop but all of the
things that could be needed in the
future all of the other things that our
competitors might be thinking about
working on all of the ideas that are
flowing in all of the researchers in the
broader research community and so this
is in some sense for me a way to think
about our role in Microsoft and for that
reason Microsoft Research and
researchers in general are a different
kind of people
early this morning in the first session
there were several questions from you
that basically was asking you know can
the programmer get involved in research
what does it take to get involved in
research and I think in some sense if
you are the type of person that loves
surprised that love solving problems
that doesn't need to be told what
direction to go in but you can set your
own direction then research is really
for you and that's something that that I
think you can all keep in mind now let
me give a more concrete technical
example of this idea of surprises or
seeking the unexpected that really made
a difference in both the basic research
community and in Microsoft and I was
chuckling earlier today in fact
throughout the day because in fact the
problem I want to talk about is the
problem of hearing someone's voice in a
room full of people that are all making
a lot of noise and so somehow this
problem seemed perfectly appropriate for
the day so this is actually a picture
here it's a famous picture of the scene
on the New York Stock Exchange floor and
here you can see lots of people shouting
and there's one person in the middle
with a notebook taking orders for trades
to sell or buy shares in various
companies and so the remarkable thing
about this is that in this crowd with
all of these people shouting and lots of
noise and bells ringing people running
around the floor and all of that
pandemonium it is still possible for a
human being to focus his or her thinking
on a person that they can see in the
room and have a chance to hear it
there's a way that our brains are able
to take the fact that if I'm trying to
listen to you and everyone else is
talking I can process in the computer in
my head the fact that when you speak the
time difference in the arrival of your
voice to my left ear versus my right ear
will be different in just a certain
mount and in my mind I'm able to process
that and focus my hearing on that person
this is an amazing thing that humans in
fact many many animals are able to do
and so one of the classic problems in
signal processing and computer science
is how in fact to build a machine that
can do the same thing and so if we want
to build a machine that has a microphone
let's depicted in the middle of this
diagram and we're trying to have that
microphone here a specific persons voice
of course it's made more challenging by
the fact that that person is in a noisy
crowded environment and in fact that
environment might contain other sources
of noise that surround the microphone
the question is can we build a machine
that can still pick out that person's
voice and this problem of course just as
it does in humans and in animals
requires more than one microphone and so
we might have a microphone array the
idea being that if we're able to
calculate or compute using a computer
the time difference in when a person's
voice that we're trying to hear hits
each of the microphones and make some
sense out of those time differences
through what's called an audio pipeline
then we might be able to pick out that
person's voice and get some other
information such as the direction that
the voice is coming from and so this is
a classic problem in computer science
and we have a research group in our lab
in redmond washington that works very
hard on this and closely related
problems that group is led by a
researcher named yvonne Tasha now in
fact Yvonne has been working on this
problem I think his first paper that he
published was back in nineteen ninety
seven he was doing work in bio medical
engineering and really trying to
understand the computational processes
in animals and humans and then later in
after 2000 run 2001-2002 he ended up
inventing something called the mvd our
adaptive beamformer and that mvd our
adaptive beamformer actually set a
standard
for the kind of signal processing to do
to solve this this sensing problem now
that is an example of what I call blue
sky research here we have a researcher
who just has a curiosity how is it that
a human can hear pick out a person's
voice in a noisy room and also has the
additional curiosity can we make a
machine or a computer do the same thing
and so that kind of very basic
curiosity-driven blue sky research is an
important style of research and
certainly style of research that we
support very strongly in microsoft
research but for really good researchers
that's not enough once you think you
figured something out you actually want
to build it and try it out and so in
this case this was true for van tasha
and so what I'm showing here actually is
a machine that Yvonne and some students
that you work with built and if you look
this machine is has nine microphones in
it and so those nine microphones then
are going into a signal processor that's
in a computer and so if you put this
microphone in in a room with lots of
noise and say please listen to a noise
at a certain point in the room then it's
able to calculate through time
difference of the sound travel to each
of these nine microphones and able to
filter out all the ambient noise and
just have crystal clarity on the
person's voice and so let me give you a
demonstration of this i'm going to play
two audio files the first one will be a
recording of a microphone in a noisy
room just recording a person talking but
lots of other people talking and walking
about so i'll just play this is just an
eight second audio file so listen
carefully
okay so that's a very noisy room and
when you have a single microphone this
is something that is pretty typical in
fact I would dare say that if we had a
single microphone on this stage today
that we would hear some very very
similar kind of noise so now in that
same room recorded at exactly the same
time in the same place is this 9
microphone device placed and now with
the new adaptive beamforming and listen
carefully and so now suddenly out of all
of that noise everything almost
everything has been filtered out except
for the single person's voice that we're
trying to hear and so very similar to
the capability of beginning we have a
machine now that's able to pick things
out all right so this is what I would
call an example now the blue sky
research but of inventive or disruptive
research trying to be the very first to
build something that does something new
so what happens in Microsoft Research
then is that we show these things that
we build to the product groups and we
have lots of ways to do that one thing
that we do within the company is a show
called tech fest where all the
researchers show off their best
inventions to the product teams in the
hopes that the product team will have
some interest in making use of it and so
in fact a product team took a look at
this test Reagan was very very
interested in using it but of course
this thing is not something that you
would want in your home this is just a
too big too ugly too expensive and so
they asked for some changes they asked
for example well the microphones that
are being used are too expensive so can
you please make it with cheaper
microphones that don't work as well why
this seems kind of hard and then on top
of that they ask for more things how
about just using four microphones
instead of nine
you know nine will be too expensive in
to complicate oh sister for also that
test rig used to push to talk in other
words you would push a button so that
the machine would know that you're
talking and then it would listen and
then you'd let go of the button and so
the product team said no let's not have
pushed the talk it should just be
listening all the time and be able to
hear anyone and then the last thing is
that it's important in this system for
the microphones to know the shape of the
room and so in order to do that what the
device does is it admits a piercing
noise that echoes all over on all of the
walls and then it tries to calculate
through the echoes of that piercing
noise throughout the nine microphones
essential parameters of the shape of the
room and so of course you don't want
devices in people's homes emitting
really awful shrieking noises and so is
it possible also to have a pleasing tone
for calibration and as simple as that
sounds all of these things are extremely
difficult technical challenges in fact
technical challenges that one might at
first blush think is not possible but in
fact the whole thing was successful and
those of you who are familiar with the
Kinect and if you aren't the Kinect is a
beautiful device for an xbox or for
Windows machine that is able to see in
three dimensions track a person's
skeleton so that it can understand your
physical positions and it has a four
microphone array it does adaptive
beamforming so that if you're watching
for example a movie or television with
your xbox you can actually from sitting
on your couch just talk to your xbox and
say things like Xbox Bing Clint Eastwood
movies and you will get a whole
selection of those kinds of movies and
so what we move then from is from blue
sky research too disruptive research to
mission focused research the mission to
actually make a product that is cheap
enough to manufacture
and pleasant enough for people to want
to buy now all of that work is very
interesting but we are also scientists
and scholars and we participate in the
open research world and in that open
research world one of the most important
things to do is to publish the results
of our research and so in fact in this
case Yvonne Tasha and a student Nilesh
Madhu and another colleague at Microsoft
Research Alex acero wrote a paper on
this adaptive beamforming and microphone
array technology and this is an image of
that paper and that publication that
open publication policy that we have
Microsoft Research is exceptionally
important it's a way for us to share the
new knowledge that we develop and to
participate and interact and also
benefit from all the great ideas and new
research that people in universities do
now one interesting thing about this
paper is that this paper was published a
few months about ten months before or
submitted for publication about ten
months before the Kinect was launched
for for sale and the thing that was sort
of funny about this is that this paper
was submitted but then rejected for
publication and maybe there's a lesson
here that for those of you that do end
up trying to get into research another
aspect of life as a researcher is that
you get rejections all the time so I was
rejected by the first three graduate
schools I applied to a large number of
research papers that I've submitted for
publication they have been rejected a
large number of grant applications that
I've submitted have been rejected for
funding and then here we see a paper
that was also rejected and if you get a
rejected paper you get comments from
reviewers who have carefully reviewed
your paper and the comments on this
paper were pretty deadly
one reviewer said the solution proposed
obviously doesn't solve the problem at
all someone said this does make no
improvement to the state of the art the
last one reviewers said that this
approach has serious drawback for
realistic scenarios and of course the
reviewers in this case were all wrong
because in fact this paper the ideas
people were going into a product that
has been the fastest selling consumer
electronics device in all of all time
but what happens here is that sometimes
when you really push the frontiers it
takes some time for reviewers to really
accept that there are new ideas or new
new approaches and so the story I told
you is just a larger story of the red
dots and blue dots we start with just
basic curiosity-driven research we just
wanted to understand how is it that
humans can pick out a voice in the noisy
room then we get to the point from their
of trying to build something once we
think we have some understanding if it's
useful in a company context then we
might follow her to the mission to
actually build it into a real product
and then even once we have the product
or work isn't done because there are
always ways to find new uses of the
technology or to make improvements to
the technology and so this is what I
refer to as the pipeline of blue sky
research too surprising inventions this
idea that at every step we can surprise
ourselves and keep keep the technology
moving forward and in fact as a manager
of several microsoft research labs I use
this pipeline in in organ organizing the
structure of our research investments by
looking at all the possibilities in
research and looking along the x-axis
here at research that has a short time
horizon research that where we want a
quick answer versus research where we
need patience and then on the y-axis the
kinds of problems that we solve problems
that are known to us that maybe people
pose to us and as we move up the y-axis
research problems that
just purely open-ended curiosity-driven
and this set of four possibilities in
this space of blue sky disruptive
mission focused and sustaining research
is for me a management principle on how
we keep advancing the field so that's
Microsoft Research what I want to do now
is talk a little bit about all of you
and I'm hoping that some of you might
someday develop a strong enough interest
in that pipeline of research that you
also might aspire to becoming a
researcher and getting involved in
research and so let me say a little bit
about this as I look to all of you and I
came here assuming that most of you were
around 20 or 21 years old and if that's
true then at least in the United States
people tend to work after they get out
of college or graduate school and then
work a whole lifetime and then there's a
standard retirement age of 65 so if
you're 21 years old that means if you're
in the US about 44 years from now you
have 44 years of work ahead of you and
then you would be ready for retirement
and so one question to ask when you
think about research and you is what is
the world going to be like 44 years from
now and what will your role be in
inventing the technologies and tools and
ideas that exist in the world in 44
years because all of the speakers here
today will be long gone before that
happens and it will really be in your
hands to invent that future and if you
have an interest or an aspiration to
create that future
then this is one reason to get into
research now looking at 44 years is
really hard very very hard and so one
exercise I go through is in order to try
to imagine what life will be like 44
years from now is try to look back 44
years and look at what happened 44 years
ago and so 44 years ago was 1969 and I
was 9 years old I remember so you can
figure out how old I am and so in 1969
an amazing thing happened in science
technology and that is that was the
first year that we put a man on the moon
and this is a very very famous picture
from National Geographic of the time of
a picture of Neil Armstrong on the moon
that's for me when I was a nine-year-old
child this made me want to become a
scientist made me want to become a
researcher just the very idea that you
could work with tens of thousands of
other people for the single goal of
putting a person on the moon was just
completely inspirational the other thing
that happened 44 years ago in the same
year 1969 is what is referred to by some
computer scientists as a mother of all
demos because in 1969 in computer
science something very important
happened which was the creation of the
ARPANET and the ARPANET is really the
foundation of what we now see as the
internet and so in 1969 there was first
in July the string of two nodes one in
in Palo Alto and one in Los Angeles and
then there are two additional nodes and
when there were the four nodes in
December Doug Engelbart gave a demo
showing how a person in Utah and a
person in California using that network
could collaborate over a long distance
on the creation of a document and this
was really a stunning achievement
in in science technology and this
happened in the same year that we put a
man on the moon that's good
so I'm asking a very silly question here
and so don't take this too seriously but
I want to pose the question anyway just
to get you all to think of these two
amazing events in 1969 these two amazing
events 44 years ago which one was more
important and it's a silly question
because both were monumentally important
it is really you know there's no basis
for picking one over the other the other
thing to think about is you think about
these two events 44 years ago what do
you think will happen this year that
people at your retirement age will look
back on to be as important now on this
question of which one of these two had
more impact I have a silly answer to the
silly question and that silly answer is
will your child go to the moon and so I
have a son who is 15 years old and he
has never used Saturn 5 booster
technology to help us homework
assignments he's never used lunar
landing technology to find new videos
and new entertainment or to socialize
with his friends but he has used the
arpanet technologies in now called the
internet to do those things and so the
point here is that one of the things
that's special about computing research
is that the results of computing
research oftentimes create technologies
that become available to everyone and
when you have a technology that's
available to everyone that's called
technology democratization you always
get new technology disruptions because
by putting extremely powerful
technologies in the hands of very large
numbers of people you have an engine for
new inventions and new ideas that it
just leads to everything that we've seen
in the computing and information
technology industries over the last 50
years and so I for this reason I just
think of computing research as the most
important and most amazing place
to be working so as we get back to you I
now want to announce something to get
all of you a chance to be involved in a
research project with Microsoft Research
and i'm going to explain this research
project by describing a project i ran
back in 2009 called the DARPA network
challenge so this was a research project
that i had that was staged as a contest
and so in this contest what we did is we
had 10 8 foot wide red weather balloons
and they were held on 100-foot ropes and
anchored to the ground and they were
hidden throughout the united states in
the locations that you see on the map
here and they were then held aloft 100
feet in the air for 8 hours on the day
that Doug Engelbart's famous mother of
all demos took place and what we did is
we challenged the world to find these 10
balloons and the idea being that the
first person or team to find the correct
location of all ten balloons would win
the first prize which at that time was
forty thousand dollars really a lot of
money so what had to happen is and the
whole purpose of the research project
was to see if computing technology could
be used to rapidly mobilize a large
enough army of people so that you could
have a chance of going out throughout
the entire United States in finding
these ten balloons now as it turned out
over 4,300 teams signed up for this
challenge and in fact those teams
managed to recruit millions of people
not just in the United States but all
over the world in fact there were
hundreds of people from India that
participated as
members of teams in this contest the
amazing thing is in that contest out of
4300 teams a team from MIT managed in
just 48 hours to mobilize about two and
a half million people and use those two
and half million people to find all 10
balloons in less than nine hours really
an amazing accomplishment and it shows
the power of social networks now this
contest of finding red balloons is a
little bit silly because it's not very
useful but imagine if there is a
disaster and we need to find and
mobilize an army of people who can
operate heavy machinery who can tend to
people who are injured what if people
are lost in this place and we need to
mobilize an army very quickly to help
find lost children that possibilities
and be able to mobilize large numbers of
people to do things could be an
extremely powerful use of computing
technology and so in Microsoft Research
India in our India lab we have research
going on that's very interested in
understanding the possibilities of
computing technology to do that and so
what I'd like to do is describe that
project and invite all of you to
participate and so before I do that let
me first describe how did the MIT team
win and so here's what they did they
open their doors they had a website and
said sign up and work for us to find
balloons so if you signed up to work for
MIT and then you went out in the world
and you were the first person to find
the balloon for MIT then they would pay
you two thousand dollars but that's not
all if you on top of that sign up for my
tea but also recruited a friend to also
work for a mighty and your friend found
the balloon then your friend would get
two thousand dollars and you would get
one thousand dollars and that was an
important incentive because that meant
that you had incentive not only to hunt
for red balloon
but to recruit as many of your friends
and family members as you could possibly
find to also help you find balloons
because if any of them found the balloon
you would win one thousand dollars
furthermore if you recruit someone who
recruits someone who finds a balloon
then you will win five hundred dollars
and so on and so kept going down by
house and so using this so called
recursive incentive structure or lottery
tree the MIT team was able to very
quickly motivate people not only to go
hunting for red balloons but to recruit
as many people who might themselves
recruit as many people who themselves
might recruit as many people to find red
balloons and this turned out to be a
very effective way to do things and this
is only one way that you might
accomplish this task of finding these
balloons are many many others so now let
me get to microsoft research and the
project in the india lab and ask you to
participate in an experiment with us and
i hope you all will participate and this
is really a question research question
is it possible for you for each of you
to mobilize a million people perhaps you
would use the internet perhaps you would
use text messaging on your phone perhaps
you just use a telephone and call your
friends how would you do it and so to do
this we're launching today a contest
called the whodunit challenge actually
it's not today's starting februari first
next next week and on that day the first
person who can mobilize a large number
of people in india will win one lock
rupees and so now let me give you the
rules and what how the contest works we
have a server setup and in that server
are hidden five secret clues the clues
tell something about who about what
about where about when and about why and
all five clues together tell us short
story so for example the server
clue for who might be my name Peter Lee
it isn't but it could possible it just
as an example the what might be that i
visited some place the where might be i
visited here in combat or ii that i did
so today and i did this visit today for
the texas tech conference and so the
contest is to try to find all five clues
and piece them together and the way that
you can get clues is as follows you can
use your phone and send a message first
of all send us a missed call then from
that you will receive a clue back by SMS
and then to win all you need to do is do
that enough times to get all five clues
and then submit all five clues by SMS if
you're the first person to do that you
will win the one lock rupees now there's
a catch because if that were the whole
contest to be a little bit too easy
there's only one clue that will be given
her phone number so that means you need
at least five different phone numbers to
have any chance at all of getting all
five clues but more than that some clues
are much more common than others and so
in fact by probabilities you will need
to have a very large number of people
working as a team in order to have a
chance to get all of the clues okay so
the contest will start on februari first
and so you have between now and februari
first to get involved and to mobilize
your team and so the contest will run
febri first februari none 2013 this is
