you
well thank you for coming and welcome to
the session on research issues in
Internet Governance am very pleased to
be here joined by our panelists
distinguished panel of speakers so just
to kind of get an idea of the room how
many of you are familiar with issues and
Internet governance and okay great
perfect because usually when I asked
that question I get you know sort of
this very view and people say like what
is that you know their eyes your freeze
over so what I'd like to do for those of
you who aren't familiar with it is to
address three things in my opening
remarks just give you a formal
definition for Internet governance which
I'll shortened to say you know what is
IG give an overview of the process
because unfortunately it's very
difficult to have a conversation about
the substance of the IG issues without
understanding the process that's ongoing
in the US and globally and then also
then dive into the substance and then
that's where I'll leave for our
distinguished panelists to help frame
some of the issues so IG define as the
Internet becomes the underlying
foundation for the digital economy and
its impact starts to be felt both
culturally socially and economically
increasingly regulators across the world
start to scrutinize who's actually
managing this infrastructure that in
addition to an additional set of issues
which include a unique role of the US
government that the internet operates
without centralized control without
heating geopolitical boundaries that
information and services can be accessed
by anyone on any devices without
government formal governmental control
these factors combined further
challenges the traditionals of national
sovereignty and also exacerbate the
listing tension that's already there
because of the impact of the internet
and these issues including others such
as Snowden form the pressure points for
the ongoing public policy dialogue and
Internet governance so that's the
environment in which these discussions
of taking place so a formal definition
of Internet Governance is the
development and application by
governments the private sector and civil
society in their respective roles of
shared principles norms rules
decision-making procedures and programs
that shape the evolution and use of the
Internet inherent within that discussion
for those of you who aren't familiar
with the conversation is the involvement
of multi stakeholders beyond the
government so it includes civil society
the technical and academic community who
had been involved in this conversation
people like yourself have been involved
in the formation of the internet since
the beginning and also business however
the central debate in IG issues is
whether such a federated
multi-stakeholder approach is a more
appropriate model for developing the
impacted policies then what would be
term a more intergovernmental model like
the UN model where governments sit down
and negotiate treaties on how to run and
how to control various issues on the
internet I'll come back to that a little
bit more so how did these issues get
started it started all you know roughly
about in the late 90s such a when when
commercial use of the internet started
to take off and the world starts to
recognize sort of the impact of the
evolution of ICT on economic development
everyone started to pay attention to
these issues there were two parallel but
interrelated developments in the US the
US government under the auspices of the
National Telecommunications and
administration or NTIA for short in the
Department of Commerce started an effort
to privatize the management and
operations of the Internet this includes
things such as management of the IP
address
is the protocol numbers and also things
like root root zone name servers
management of some of the administration
of some of the contents for some of the
domain the Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and numbers or I can for
short was incorporated as a nonprofit
corporation in California in 1988 in
response to this request and I can then
entered into contract with NTIA to
assume the IANA functions from this
simple start icon has grown into a large
organization with sophisticated and
processes that would involve multiple
stakeholders in its policy development
processes participants from the
technical and academic community civil
society business and governments are
involved in the policy development
process on equal footing in 2014 ntia
announced its decision to terminate the
contract when it expires on September
30th of this year 2015 and that I can't
need to convene a multi-stakeholder
process to transition the current role
of ntia to the global multi-stakeholder
community this began this whole process
and discussion on the iono transition
which is ongoing as we speak today so
that's what's happening in the u.s.
internationally at the same time in the
late 90s the UN took up the issue of
what oversights are necessary to realize
a global information society this
discussion these discussions culminated
in a development of something called the
Tunis agenda at the world summit on
information society whistles for short
the Tunis agenda is a seminal document
that to this day lays out many of the
issues in globalizing internet
governance it did for things amongst
others but these are the ones I want to
highlight for this conversation here it
recognized the role of multi-stakeholder
approaches and policy development but
also that old government should have
equal footing so again that gets back
the role of the US government it created
something called the Internet Governance
forum or the IGF as a global
multi-stakeholder forum for dialogues an
active public policy issues this is very
much an environment where many all the
different stakeholders come in and
discuss issues but there's no policy
making thirdly it set up 11 action lines
that the different UN agencies and all
stakeholders can work together to build
out and realize the information society
especially in developing countries and
lastly it requested a review by the UN
General Assembly of the progress in ten
years and that's in december this year
so in 2014 two events are happening
which impact the Internet Governance
discussions the iono transition and the
whistles plus ten review so that's the
process and the environment against
which these issues are being discussed
so what's the substance of the issues
often IG is considered a monolithic
discussion a single discussion with
multi-stakeholder risom as the best
solution for all issues involved in
reality and our speakers will really
delve into this the issues involve a
much much more nuanced and complex there
are many ways to frame the discussion
and we'll explore some of this
throughout the session however at the
highest level you can look at two broad
categories the technical issues and
technical governance of the internet for
sustained stability security and
resiliency of the infrastructure and
secondly social political governance of
Internet use including issues such as
integrity of the information privacy and
security child pornography fraud
surveillance etc there are also macro
issues such as trusting the overall
ecosystem passworded data flow and
appropriate sovereignty models for the
digital world furthermore what we have
traditionally considered the internet is
also changing you heard from Jeanette
this morning about all the technology
innovations the machine learning
transnational cloud data analytics
consumer robotics and social machine
each of these further extend the impact
of the internet in novel and unforeseen
ways creating additional complications
so therefore it seems fitting that in
this year we haven't on discussion to
explore how internet governance can
benefit from more comprehensive nuanced
evidence-based dialogues engage more
multidisciplinary academics engage more
of you into this conversation with the
objective of contributing new rigor
expertise and perspective on specific
issues that in a way that would enable
progress in the overall policy
discussion so that's really the
intention and the objective is this
discussion that's what I'm thrilled that
these panelists are able to join us here
each with a very different perspective
on the issues and as well as practical
experience in participating in these
issues I've asked our panelists to
address two questions from their unique
perspectives how academic research can
help enable more thoughtful
evidence-based dialogues in internet
governance public policy discussions and
what are some of the issues that can
benefit most from academic research and
expertise you all have the path the bias
of the panelists but I'd still like to
introduce them briefly Laura dinardo's
is a well-known eminent scholar of
internet architecture and governance a
professor in the school of
communications at American University in
Washington DC and affiliated fellow of
the Yale Law School information society
a senior fellow of the center for
international governance innovation and
a current research director for the
global Commission for Internet
Governance Lauren has published multiple
books and gaged look globally in
multiple policy discussions Brendan
Curtis is a postdoctoral researcher at
Syracuse University School of
Information studies where he is
currently researching governance
structures in securing Internet routing
brendan is a regular contributor to
policy discussions but he has actively
participated in I can in the
in our transition process from multiple
years now next we have Stephanie forest
of regions distinguished professor of
computer science at the University of
Mexico a recent chair of the department
and a member of the Santa Fe Institute
external faculty the stephanie is an
expert with 20 years experience leading
interdisciplinary research and education
programs at UNM but more interestingly
she spent a year at the US State
Department working on cybersecurity and
had direct input into some of the policy
discussions and Susan Aronson is a
research professor at George Washington
University's Elliott School of
International Affairs and a former
minerva chair of National War College
Susan is the author of multiple books on
digital trade in human rights and
globalization she's also involved in
advising government and other policy
stakeholders as she looks at these
issues Susan is contemplating developing
a new international affairs curricula on
the Internet we're also thrilled to have
Paul Mitchell who will be a respondent
Paul is a senior director in Microsoft
regulatory affairs team leading policy
initiatives in telecom and internet
governance Paul has led Microsoft's
involvement in various IG forums
including I can di tu various UN
agencies and has engaged frequently with
policy stakeholders globally on these
issues Loretha me ask you to start our
panel and also in addition to the
questions if you can share your
experience and how you have engaged with
IC policy stakeholders globally directly
and indirectly and what has been some of
the outcomes thank you certainly good
morning everyone it's a pleasure to be
at the Microsoft faculty some it's nice
to be out of Washington today and in
this beautiful part of the country and
thank you very much Caroline for that
nice introduction for organizing the
panel really the first thing to be said
is obvious to all of us in this room but
it's not necessarily obvious to
policymakers and that's that internet
governance is not a discussion it's
actually a set of functions that involve
the administration in the coordination
of the technologies that are necessary
to keep the inter
operational and then the enactment of
substantive policy around those so
there's a lot to study it's not just a
process or content or a discussion a
second point is that in picking up on
what Carolyn said although the internet
is absolutely governed it's not a
monolithic system as you said but it's
rather layer upon layer of functions
some of them are carried out by the
private sector some of them are carried
out by traditional governments in inter
international treaties and some are
carried out by this strange construct
called multi-stakeholder governance so
it's very interesting to study of course
there is the administration of names and
numbers by I can there I said my first
acronym my fault I was trying to not say
any acronyms but since you used it it's
fair game and the US has some oversight
in that area Brendan will talk about
this quite a bit in his remarks there
but there's also the establishment of
technical protocols by institutions such
as the internet engineering task force
in the world wide web consortium there's
an entire other area of regarding access
and interconnection coordination
everyone here understands that the
internet is not actually a cloud it has
buildings and fiber-optic cable and
satellites and coke machines and the
buildings where you can get a soda and
people working at it you know there's a
physical infrastructure and there are
private contractual arrangements and
also government oversight in some cases
of how that interconnection happens and
more obvious areas cyber security
governance involving a combination of
public and private sector institutions
and I would add to that the
policy-making role of private companies
such as Google and other information
intermediaries which through their terms
of service and through their
institutional decisions make decisions
about civil liberties access to
knowledge privacy what counts as free
speech in the digital age cyberbullying
and other kinds of important policy
making roles so it's a fascinating area
because we have the technical mediation
of the public sphere but in some cases
the privatization of the conditions of
civil liberties
within that sphere so I enjoy studying
it very much and as academics I think
breaking down the categories in not just
calling it a monolithic Enterprise is
very helpful because policymakers will
ask the question well does it make sense
for the Internet to be governed by the
United United Nations or the US
government or Microsoft or a
multi-stakeholder construct so that
question let's just dismiss that because
it doesn't make any sense the question
really is what is the proper form of
governance in any particular area now
another point to make is that this stuff
matters there's really a lot at stake
and academic research really helps move
the policy-making decision away from a
framing such as it's just a technical
decision and into the realm of that
matters for innovation for global
economic policies and trade and of
course for civil liberties and I can say
that as an engineer as well as a social
scientist that it really does matter in
fact the thesis of my own work is that
the arrangements of technical
architecture are also arrangements of
power you see that in just to give a few
simple examples where would we be
without web accessibility standards for
the disabled how is social media Terms
of Service are defined makes enormous
decisions about what can stay online and
what is taken down who can speak we see
things like access regulation net
neutrality rulings making decisions that
affect competition and innovation and of
course the administration of names and
numbers domain names like microsoft com
and their associated numbers really a
lot of trademark issues there but also
free speech there was a proposal for a
dot gay TLD top-level domain and some
countries did not want to have like
Saudi Arabia said we don't want to have
in the world very interesting and
important free speech issues so I just
mentioned that because there are very
real public policy issues here and
that's what academic study is how it
affects every day people now another
task of researchers of course is to
identify the problems you could say that
the Internet Governance ecosystem has
worked very well the internet is still
operational we continue to be able to
send email and to check read it and
upload things to Twitter and obsess as I
do over all these applications we have
three billion users this will quickly
grow to five it's scaling very well
despite all of the data breaches that we
hear about the Internet is you know
relatively secure compared to what could
happen and every sector of the global
economy depends on the Internet to
function things are fairly stable but we
can't take this for granted so it's
always important to to say what could go
wrong so coming back to carolyn's
opening remarks one one thing that I
would posit is that government
involvement in some aspects of Internet
Governance is is creating profound
problems I'll mention just a few of them
so one destabilizing factor is the loss
of trust in cyberspace in a recent poll
of 23,000 internet users in 24 different
countries we found that two-thirds of
users were considerably more concerned
about privacy than they were in the
previous year now some of this is
because of the Snowden disclosures of
NSA surveillance some of it is because
of growing awareness of the private data
that is collected and used to monetize
the business models we do everything
online for free and obviously the
Faustian bargain is that data is
collected about us and then monetized in
online advertising there's more
awareness of that also more awareness of
the high-profile security breaches so
this combination of the government
surveillance private surveillance and
increasing security humans
many complexities really has created a
loss of trust another destabilizing
factor is one that I study a lot and
that's the co-opting of internet
technical infrastructure for things
having absolutely nothing to do with
keeping the internet operational so it's
being used for geopolitical means most
obviously when the Egyptian government
cut off internet access using internet
exchange points and other kinds of
technical points of control but also
many other areas such as law enforcement
and large media companies turning to the
domain name system to enforce
intellectual property rights to cut off
sites that have pirated material to
filter data that in sensor data and some
parts of the world so the domain name
system really carries out a
straightforward function of translating
names into numbers but it can be used as
a mechanism for cutting off content and
when you think about the scale of this
that hundreds of billions of queries
take place a day and it's a system
that's distributed over multiple servers
it's very it's very complicated has
technical complexities and implications
and I'll just mention one more Brendon
you'll talk about the uncertainty over
the iono transition that's a potentially
destabilizing factor we're going to go
from us oversight to X Y or Z what is
that thing that we're going to just
because things have gone well in the
past doesn't mean that they will
continue to do so so how that transition
occurs is very important and of course
just finally the attempts to overlay
national borders on the global Internet
we have increasing politically driven
movements to localize data in countries
and a lot of this is a response to
trying to have more private data but
let's say that Carolyn and I you know it
didn't work out for you at Microsoft and
I didn't want to be an academic anymore
I would wanted to start our own company
let's say it was a social media company
how would we possibly do business in
every single country that requires us to
localize customer data there we would
have to set up server farms in every
country so this has implications not
only for how rights get distributed for
in human security and human rights but
also our ability to innovate so I think
that these are very important issues
having academics with a technical
background coming from computer science
I know we have many computer science
scientists here at this event is vitally
important to bring it out of the realm
of political science and into the realm
of keeping the infrastructure
operational and keeping a universal
internet so I'm very grateful to have
the opportunity to to discuss this the
internet is governed there's not a
single system there are huge profound
policy implications the system has
worked fairly well but we can't take
that for granted so policy engaged
scholarship that engages in these issues
is important and I would just suggest as
one closing thought that the need to
keep the internet operational and the
governance around that in order to keep
it operational really should count in
rank as high as other kinds of global
collective action problems such as
environmental rights anti-terrorism and
Hugh and other kinds of human rights so
it's vitally important and I'm very
happy that you invited me to speak about
this today Thank You lure for your
comments and a very comprehensive
exposition of the issues as well as the
challenges as well as certainly a lot of
really interesting questions we have I
hope that many of you out there starting
to think about related research
questions to answer some of those
challenges because they are challenges I
think the other thing that laura has
pointed out is that these questions
really require multidisciplinary
conversations they are costs disciplines
and they really do require the
understanding
so Brendan as you speak to address the
questions can you also please share with
us your perspective from your
participation I can because you've been
in the trenches and also your view on
this process at work sure so thank you
carolyn for having me here to join my
esteemed colleagues and as well as all
of you i hope to get some dialogue with
you and involve you in kind of this
discussion about this elusive topic of
internet governance so you know what is
this ionic transition all about and why
is it of interest to academics so
Carolyn covered a little bit of icons
history created in 1998 and it was an
organization that was quote-unquote
purpose-built to maintain the registries
for top-level domain names tlds Internet
Protocol address blocks and also various
protocol parameters of more than a
thousand registries and together these
are the iono functions the intent was
always to transfer the governance of the
iono functions to the private sector but
the US government maintained its
oversight role for over the last 17
years now the USD has at times that
oversight role has been controversial as
its inserted itself into the policy
process probably the most notable case
is the dot xxx case from several years
ago but really oversight holds more of
symbolic importance in that it places a
single government's role above all
others and this symbolism became more
pronounced with the Snowden revelations
and that spurred the Internet's
governing organic governing
organizations so I can the regional
internet registries and the internet
Engineering Task Force to call for
ICANN's independence and it also
fostered dialogues with other
governments about how to do internet
governance and how to govern it so
example of that would be the net mundial
conferences that have gone on now these
developments would culminate in the
March 2014 announcement by the NTIA to
transition the governance that they I
can to the multi-stakeholder private or
multi-stakeholder community excuse me
and technically you know the transition
simply means that the US government will
no longer have an authorization role in
the maintenance of those registries but
more importantly what it does is it
removes the US government's ability NT
to use the iono functions contract that
it has with I can as a sword of Damocles
the contract creates real power to keep
I can in compliance with broader usg
objectives and such as those that are
detailed in the joint project agreement
during the Bush administration or more
recently in the affirmation of
commitments that the that i can has with
Department of Commerce so you know from
a social scientist perspective the iono
transition is definitely it's a crucible
for kind of exploring policymaking from
things like institution building and
economic regulation of critical internet
resources to interest group or aka
stakeholder interest group politics and
larger issue geopolitical issues about
the role of government visa V other
stakeholders and the role of
multi-stakeholder versus multilateral
governance so at the request of the do
see I can was asked to convene a process
for developing trans the transition
proposal and the respective names
numbers and protocol communities all
argued to develop their own individual
proposals and then coordinate those
proposals to submit them to the
Department of Commerce
now the numbers in protocol communities
developed their proposals actually quite
rapidly it was more of for them it was
more an exercise of clarifying their
already existing contractual
relationships that they had with the
IANA functions operator that is I can't
currently today but the proposal for the
names community was would take much more
time and it would be much more difficult
a cross-community working group of which
I'm participants in as our several other
academics and civil society actors as
well as business side and actually a few
government participants oh well I well I
can was formed to perform the iono
functions in reality it spends about
ninety six percent of its budget doing
policy development activities for tlds
and developing the contractual
arrangements amongst registries and
registrar's and the affected
stakeholders and so given this the
question was well how do you ensure
stable non-discriminatory access to the
ayana registries and maintenance of the
red the registries and we had two camps
forming one was an internal camp and
this was a camp that proposed giving the
I Anna to I can indefinitely and one was
an external camp and that was a proposal
to essentially replace the NTIA with a
new contracting Authority and eventually
that the group could not settle on
either one of these models eventually
the group moved towards a hybrid
solution which proposed functional
separation placing the ayana into a an
affiliate with which I can would
actually have a contract so much like
the arrangements that the numbers and
the protocol communities would have and
this proposal the the origins of it I
was a co-author on it with along with
someone from centre of democracy and
Technology Matthews years and a long
time I can participant Audrey Doria so
the arrangement would ensure the
separation of I cants policy development
from the IANA functions implementation
and the PA this post transition I Anna
would be
subject to a stakeholder run periodic
iono review function and the proposal
was actually recently approved by the
chartering organizations of the working
group this just happened down in Buenos
Aires a couple weeks ago at the ICANN
meeting but this left one big question
how do you ensure so if I can't has a
contract with the PTI how do you ensure
that the that I can and the ICANN board
is held accountable to the global
multi-stakeholder community and that was
a separate discussion and it's ongoing
so this conversation was very much about
determining kind of the necessary
corporate governance mechanisms that I
can needed in order to be released from
the DLC contract and what they came up
with so far there are some pretty
substantial reforms one being reformed
two icons mission statement and
basically precluding I can from
regulating services and content that are
reliant on the DNS so that's a big one
the second reform would be to the
independent review process of board
decisions and making those decisions
actually binding which is another big
step in the right direction in terms of
accountability reforms and then the
final was to plan a per provide a
membership powers to icann supporting
organizations and their advisory
committees and this would include board
removal stat strategic plan and budget
approval by the community as well as
enforcement of the iono functions review
decisions so the reaction to that and
particularly the membership proposal has
been somewhat mixed the community
strongly supports it the NTIA as well as
some ICANN board members have pushed
back on this notion of creating hard
forms of accountability particularly
membership I'll just give you a little
quote from assistant secretary
Strickling from down in Buenos Aires he
said he asked the community why does it
go through
cycle after cycle of putting its own
people on the board and then stops
trusting them to act in the interest of
the multi-stakeholder model now as a
scholar this highlights for me you know
kind of a defining feature of Internet
governance and that's this tension
between loser more cooperative forms of
governance versus more formal
institutionalized mechanisms and we see
this all over in different areas of
Internet Governance this tension and and
what to do about it so arguably going
forward I can is shifting towards more
formal institutionalized forms of
accountability and in some you know
these governance problems are of
interest to lots of different academics
whether you're you know a political
scientist and institutional economists
like myself or a computer scientists who
might be able to devise systems that
allow us to run the iono functions in a
much more decentralized fashion but
there are lots of ways to contribute and
there's lots of ways to have impact
great thank you for sharing your
experience and also the hundreds of
hours that you spent developing these
transition proposals and the
accountability issues and still hundreds
of hours to come and um Stephanie if I
may ask you to go next and also in
addition to addressing questions also
address you know sort of how your
research background was able to
influence development of the policy
positions at the State Department and
also since you've been back into the
academic world how that's influenced
some of your current work as well okay
it is the microphone working I got the
other kind of microphone well thank you
I have to say it's quite an honor to be
sitting up here with everyone who's been
thinking about these issues for so long
and really the sum total of my
experience was the one year that I spent
working at the State Department as a
science and technology advisor in
from july august i guess of 2013 to
august of 2014 and it was a great
experience and I learned I learned a
huge amount but i will say coming back
to the computer science community the
most common question I get is a version
of the one that Carolyn just asked which
is did you make a difference and you
know would be a tremendous act of hubris
to say yes I Stephanie in one year in
Washington had a great impact on the
federal government this incredibly huge
beast so I'm going to try and say a few
things but I say say it a little bit
tongue-in-cheek because the government
is indeed very large and one of the
first things that I came to appreciate
when I went to Washington is the fact
that work in government is completely
different from the way we an engineering
approach it you know we tend to set up
problems and then as they said in the
last panel define an objective function
and then we go to that objective
function and both I mean first of all
the our government is a democracy and so
it's many of the mechanisms and
procedures are about the process of
government rather than getting to a
particular outcome and then just even
the way that work gets done in the
government the best way I can describe
it is it's stream stream oriented
computing where there's this huge River
of issues and documents and meetings and
things rushing by and every now and then
you have time to reach out and grab one
and do a little processing on it and
then throw it back into the river and so
it's very it's very hard to say exactly
what kind of impact one has in that kind
of model but I did and and so during my
so at the State Department I was
associated with two out of the three
groups
that are specifically charged with
working on on cyber issues and I worked
on many many different things during the
year but one of the things I happen to
work on was this I Anna transition and
so I will talk about that since it's
relevant to the earlier remarks and
again this is just a little bit of
insight into how government works on a
daily basis I was asked by one of my
colleagues to attend a meeting and
because he couldn't go and it turned out
to be the first first meeting of an
interagency task force that was charged
with planning and thinking about how a
transition of these iono functions from
the US government to something else like
how that could happen and so I because I
went to that first meeting I then became
a member of this task force and it
seemed pretty interesting so I just kept
going and we met regularly for several
months before this transition was
announced and so you might say so that
was pretty interesting just to be in the
room what impact did I have well I work
directly and I think I shaped to some
extent the language that eventually
became part of the public release and in
particular we spent a lot of time in
this task force discussing what the what
the criteria would be for a successful
proposal so the the idea is that the
what what the what was publicly
announced was sort of a a request or
invitation to this multi-stakeholder
community to come up with a proposal to
the US government for how the IANA
functions could be transitioned and what
they would be transitioned to and so
what we worked on a lot were what the
criteria should be for a successful
proposal and I guess to put it in
computer science terms and this is
reiterating something that was said
earlier one of the things I pushed for
was what we
call separation of concerns that is that
the management of the kind of
engineering operations of the iono
functions should be to the extent
possible axximo extent possible sort of
firewalled and separated from the
government government policy making you
know should we should get da amazon
those kinds of discussions and then the
other thing that i think was important
was that because i was at the State
Department the State Department doesn't
think of itself as a technical agency
and because I was there and and often i
was one of just two or three people in
the room who could understand in detail
what these technical functions were this
this end because i was a member of the
small State Department team the State
Department was able I think to bring a
lot of balance to the discussion and
government about how the transition
should be managed and I guess that
became a little more evident after the
public announcement there were a lot of
kind of early early course corrections
to what was happening right after the
right in the six weeks or so right after
the announcement and I think the State
Department played an important role in
that and I think they were able to have
a more active and focused voice because
they had had a pet computer scientist on
their team okay so i think i just got
the flag 45 minutes left so i want to
turn to the second question which is how
did this affect my research and I guess
there's three things that I want to talk
about the first one and and this wasn't
just from the I n it was really my
entire year in government there are many
things that come up in policy
discussions that people assert to be
true and so one example that might
surprise you is that in in nearly every
strategy document i saw in every
conversation that i went to that
involved something about the ITU and
regulating the internet one of the first
words that comes up is spam spam is a
huge problem so they say and that is why
we have to regulate the Internet that's
simplifying oversimplifying greatly but
at some point I kind of woke up and said
what do you mean that spam is a problem
you know you're telling me that everyone
in Africa doesn't have a computer the
way they access the internet is through
a little old-fashioned flip phone and
some sort of minimal interface that
Facebook provides why what do you mean
that the spam is a problem and so there
are a lot of questions like this the one
we recently actually followed up on that
and looked at data breaches which is
something in this country everybody
believes is a growing problem and when
you actually look at the data turns out
there's no statistical evidence that
data breaches are becoming more common
or bigger and I think there's a lot of I
just got the wrap-up sign anyway a lot
of sort of widely held beliefs that are
not backed up by rigorous data or other
kinds of evidence and so that's
something I think we can contribute to
in research and I've been looking at a
bit myself the other the other two
things are my year reinforced my
interest in what I call large-scale
security questions cyber security
questions that is what what kinds of
interventions actually would make a
difference in how secure our systems are
not like which ones will get accepted
into a top-tier conference and which
ones are the most rewarding technically
but what kinds of interventions will
actually make a difference where should
they do be deployed and how should they
be deployed so that's that's a question
that that I'm very interested in that I
think requires a level of modeling that
the computers in simulation that the
computer security community generally
hasn't been interested in
and then finally also on the
cybersecurity front it was the people
who do higher-level thinking about
cybersecurity than what I was acquainted
with over and over and over again say
attribution is the problem how do we
attribute an attack even if we can trace
it back to a particular IP address how
do we decide who we can hold responsible
for launching that attack and so that's
a question that I'm actively working on
now kind of trying to put it in a
strategic game theory context and stay
tuned we have a model and someday soon
we might have some results so it was a
great year and I think computer
scientist should should take more
interest in in going into these other
agencies like the State Department and
and you can make a difference great
Thank You Stephanie for giving us sort
of the inside view on the formation of
the request for the IANA transition and
also for your advice on how researchers
can really question the formation of
some of these policy initiatives but as
well how policy can be injected into
advanced cyber security research as well
Susan if I may ask you to address your
comments but also as you interact with
policy stakeholders around the world
what are some of your observations with
respect to need to educating these
policy stakeholders as well
you can use this if you want Thanks yep
can you hear me now thank you into it
what a cliche okay so and I grew up in
an academic family so I learned from you
know age to let's say that I that
scholarship should be useful so that's
kind of my focus here the first thing in
Washington one of the things that
strikes me is that there is no policy
person responsible for ensuring that the
policies that we make that govern the
internet whether its domestic or
international have do not undermine the
internet and it's long associated norms
of openness interoperability and
multi-stakeholder ISM and maybe you
don't agree that those are the norms and
that's something to discuss but I do
find it odd and perhaps scholars should
look to see if we need someone or
someone's to examine specific policies
and how they may affect the functioning
of the one global Internet secondly the
demographics of the internet are
changing dramatically the user base is
moving away from Western countries such
as the United States and EU and Latin
America towards many developing
countries in Asia including China and
Indonesia and many of these countries
the government's and the citizens don't
share the u.s. you if you will dominated
the USU norms of openness
interoperability and multi-stakeholder
ism so what effect will that have on
internet governance it's to me a very
important question third I do trade and
human rights and I'm very interested in
the relationship between digital trade
if you believe that cross-border
information flows are traded
and human rights and I can tell you that
neither area has good data and without
data I think it's unlikely that I could
convince you of any research question
that I've done enough research so for
example data itself is both an input and
output right we are the United States
likes to label itself the data driven
economy the knowledge intensive economy
well we have very little data on data as
an input or as an output and so I urge
scholars to start coming up with data on
data okay and then finally I think there
is a trend going on away from
multi-stakeholder ISM where governments
and engineers and businesses and average
citizens who care about the Internet can
interact towards government dominated
venues of Internet Governance such as
trade agreements such as the UN and if
my hypothesis is correct scholars need
to examine what that means for those
norms that I mentioned before of
openness interoperability and
multi-stakeholder ism so the so those
are four of the issues that I think
academics should start looking at and it
would be great if such research could be
interdisciplinary Carolyn asked me to
address one other question and I will be
very brief in that regard because I
really want to hear your questions as
does everyone else on the panel and that
is what should you and I learn about the
internet and about internet governance
and it seems to me the internet is both
a platform for and a subject of
governance and hence it should be a
subject of civic education you and I
need to have more information and to
influence the debates about how our data
is used by governments and by companies
and so the I think all academics
be involved in trying to educate not
just their citizens but the broader
public about internet governance issues
issues such as how our digital
technology's changing the economy
society business and government how our
digital technology's changing notions of
national sovereignty how can digital
technologies undermine and or facilitate
economic growth and development how our
digital technologies affecting human
rights are human rights the same online
as they are offline if people behave
differently online than they would
offline so those are some of the
questions that I think we we should
address and I look forward to hearing
your question so I'll ended at that
great Thank You Susan for highlighting
do some issues for us and in particular
the that the demographic change is a
really really interesting question and
its impact on how the internet evolves
going forward Paul what what I'd like to
do at this point is to ask Paul to be a
respondent to these comments and also
then set some of the context for further
questioning chinita thank you it's nice
to see you all thanks very much for
coming it's interesting that the my day
this morning started out by watching a
hearing featuring i Ken CEO fadi chehade
and NTIA had Larry Strickling earth
assistant secretary for information
communications policy and talking about
all of these issues and the the most
salient issue was how in the conclusion
of this transition could we the citizens
be certain that the resulting
organization would continue to be
accountable to maintaining a secure
state safe resilient internet free from
capture of special interests I'm not
sure that it was
really resolved and the hearing it was
interesting but it it wasn't yet another
example this is the eighth or ninth one
of these hearings in the last two months
on this topic and it's a another example
of a lot of information coming together
at one time and as you heard from from
our panelists this morning it's it could
maybe best be described as organized and
functional chaos at some level when you
listen to the questions that Susan just
threw out around how the internet
actually can impact things as
fundamentalist human rights or trade or
sovereignty national the shift of
populations on the internet from
basically Northwest to Southeast and
that that pivot point is basically been
reached right about now we're at the
point where there are as many if not
more Eastern participants on the
internet if you want to think about it
that way as there were historically sort
of the the Western eu-us North America
dominated and that is having a
fundamental impact but I think that one
of the things I didn't hear anybody
bring up this morning was a way to think
about being involved from an
organizational strategy perspective so
you each individually identified areas
that you are personally interested in in
research and we're clearly there's a gap
but i wonder if you if you would be
willing to each of you take just just
maybe a moment to identify in your own
mind how you think this kind of research
could be best structured so that
entities like Microsoft or Google or
Facebook or other entrepreneurs can can
actually make use of it in terms of how
we choose to drive our own business for
it one of the things is true about
Microsoft today is different from
Microsoft of the past is that we don't
have anything to sell to anybody who is
not connected
on the planet anymore so everything is
connected we're all reliant on this
infrastructure not just Microsoft but
basically everyone and I think Laura
pointed out right at the beginning that
that this is essentially the entire
global economy is is wrapped up in the
internet so I've wondered if you just go
down the line and you know 60 seconds or
less how should we in the private sector
engage with you and the academic sector
to basically l you know enhance our own
ability to make this whole thing better
that's a really large question and I've
never answered anything in less than 60
seconds but go right maybe the first
thing I want to mention is that I am
involved in a global Commission on
internet governance I serve as the
research director it's a completely
independent commission it's chaired by
Carl Bildt the former Prime Minister
Sweden it has about 28 people from all
around the world and a set of about 25
researchers and we're developing policy
engaged research that informs the
debates now that being said I think it's
essential to have a more private sector
input into that my personal opinion is
that that having more connections in
these various flora I know Microsoft
does a great job of going into the
standard-setting organizations being
involved in the Wyss asst process and
with your role in Internet Governance oh
you're definitely in the debates but i
think what needs to happen is to have
more of a global focus not speaking to
Microsoft but just to all of us you
could hear it in this room in our
discussion even a team of researchers
coming together that are
interdisciplinary they can't just be
interdisciplinary they have to be from
different parts of the world I think
that that's part of it so I would say
that having interdisciplinary
connections having events just like this
that bring people together is a pretty
good start and identifying very specific
problems taking it out of the realm of
these concepts and into hard problems
and then assembling the people that are
necessary to solve it okay let's go to
the other end and
season okay thanks I've been thinking a
lot about this since our dinner last
night and it seems to me that we need to
change the incentives to both encourage
people to share data more but we also
need to encourage this the incentives to
get people to respect data more and and
when they share that data to do so in
ways that build and do not undermine
trust and I know that's very generic
what I just said to you but I only have
60 seconds and the how I think is not so
easy but again there are too many data
sets that are proprietary and we need a
greater understanding of how let's say
data sets related to malware from one
company relate front to that of another
company so I'm saying fire I and
kaspersky if we could only get them to
put their data forward Plus let's say
the cert data we could do more
comparative studies of whether or not
malware uses increasing and the the
strength of the attacks as example again
on the other side I think we need
greater respect for the privacy of
people's data and if companies such as
Microsoft which due respect that privacy
can push for norms of good corporate
behavior in that regard I think that
will be extraordinarily helpful well
first of all I think companies like
Microsoft are at least it was to me
surprisingly well represented in nearly
all the meetings that I went to when I
was in the government I mean all the
kind of pie public meetings not that the
government's meetings inside cover but
anyway all these meetings I went to
there was always someone from Microsoft
and always someone from google so i
think the
the issue is really how to help how to
incorporate all the other stakeholders I
mean this idea that industry is one
stakeholder and civil societies another
stakeholder and governments or another I
would push to kind of refine our
understanding of what these stakeholders
are but certainly large large
multinational companies I think have
much more influence on the process of
Internet Governance then certainly
academics or smaller smaller entities
that's a great question and so you know
how do companies approach this field of
internet governance wait you know first
a kind of level set you know ten years
ago at the dawn of Internet Governance
discussions or maybe even you know a
little before that actually you know
Internet Governance was largely about I
can as an institutional innovation and
policies around internet names and
numbers and now it's become you know a
much much broader set of concerns about
the ongoing sets of disputes and
deliberations about the internet and the
policies that affect it but the
overarching dilemma you know still
remains the same it's it's this tension
between sovereign states and their
desire to set communications information
policy through traditional mechanisms
versus the transnational nature of the
internet and its governance mechanisms
and you know it we really shouldn't
focus too much on I can or the regional
internet registries there's so much more
interesting governance governance
structures that are out there that are
happening below the surface that we know
very little about so that that's an area
that I think companies need to pay
attention to more generally I'd say in
in terms of kind of looking at internet
governance Carolyn mentioned you know
four areas that a taxonomy of kind of
how you would look at research in this
area and I I have to admit I kind of
cringed because it seemed a little bit
disciplinary focused and for me that
doesn't necessarily lead us in the right
direction of how we want to look at
these issues so I tend to look at
internet governance as four buckets
right and so we have an intellectual
property rights bucket and we talk about
copyright and Trademark and kind of this
tension between the transnational
information sharing versus setting up
boundaries technical and legal
boundaries around trademark around
domain names and digital content the
second area would be content regulation
and so issues about and these are really
the tough ones about censorship about
freedom of expression so they touch on
you know specific issues like spam the
third area would be security and that's
kind of a catch-all you know ranging
from issues like malware data breach
intrusion but also the tensions and
relationships between internet security
and national security and also issues
like data protection and data data
privacy that falls in there and then the
final area that I would think about if I
was trying to organize a research agenda
for a company would be the critical
Internet resources and kind of the
fundamental infrastructure of the
internet the DNS Internet routing how we
govern those resources and also the the
you know issues like fragmentation how
do we confront this issue so that's
great I was hoping you would give us
that a little taxonomy there so without
without prompting so here's the issue
that is actually very current today the
there was a working group within the
icon community that was addressing the
issue of privacy and proxy services so
those are where you can register a web
site but you can hide your registration
behind a privacy proxy entity we know
hear from our work with digital with
Digital Crimes that a lot of of
malicious activity on the Internet is
hidden behind privacy proxy services and
that when we identify the activity it's
very difficult for us to get the actual
data about the
that is responsible for the website
that's that's causing the problem this
working group at ICANN was split on the
issue of whether in in the future
websites that engaged in commercial
activities and financial transactions
should be somehow prohibited from using
these privacy proxy services so the the
working group was split on this issue
because on the one hand it's very
difficult to identify what exactly is a
commercial transaction for example if
you're a blogger in Uzbekistan and
you're taking donations on your website
and for a variety of reasons you might
fear for your life if your data was
public that's a that could be defined as
commercial because the financial
transaction and you here at least in the
u.s. you would generally support the
idea that this person should have we
have a right to privacy for protection
on the other hand there are you know
numerous fake Pharma vendors out there
that are selling sugar pills as though
there's something else for real money
using credit cards and you would perhaps
think that those should be shut down I'm
just interested in the views of the
panel here on we by the way as Microsoft
is so member of the business community
we have to weigh in on this particular
issue there's a large online discussion
going on right now today because we will
file a comment on this very issue by
noon actually in 16 minutes and so I'm
interested in in your take on on two
things first of all the issue itself but
more importantly how within this
organized chaos though the Internet is
how should an issue like this actually
be resolved I will answer that really
quickly I did the ability to have
anonymous speech has been fundamental to
democracy so it's very important to
acknowledge that but how does that
translate into the online where
all is the question I would break it
down into two requirements I think
anyone should have a right to register a
web site and not have any member of the
public just look it up like a who is
look up kind of situation and know the
person's address where they live that
seems like a fundamental right to be
able to not have that publicly available
without that there wouldn't be the kind
of speech that we have today but there
also has to be traceable anonymity so
that law enforcement can get a record of
something if it's necessary so I think
that there that there shouldn't be there
should be that requirement to have
traceable anonymity so that you could go
to the registrar and find that record
out and that would have to be done based
on a national law you know rule of law
based on the country that someone is in
so that that you could find out in law
enforcement situations anyone else you
know just one thing that concerns me
about this discussion is it's often put
in terms of specific human rights such
as privacy rights versus you know they
are the needs of governments to find
people and I think often governments do
not share due process concepts and so it
very much concerns me that we're having
this debate in the absence of any sort
of shared norms regarding due process so
that's what I want to say well I don't
think in the 15 minutes that are left
I'm going to make suggestions for how
Microsoft should change its comments I I
I will say though that I'm quite
skeptical of the way that law
enforcement equities is the buzzword
that I learned in the State Department
are kind of dominating these discussions
and how policy about things like
takedowns and other things that are in
this umbrella that you mentioned is
really getting made outside of the
public discourse it's you know
killer law enforcement agents going to
particular judges and getting court
orders to do things that in many cases I
suspect the judges don't fully
understand and i think that's not the
right way to make policy and one of the
things that i advocated for when i was
at the state department is the idea that
governments should refrain from
attacking the that's the inflammatory
way to say it but attacking the core
infrastructures of the internet so i'm
very skeptical about using things like
the dns and routing tables as a way to
fight cybercrime and then of course the
question is what comes next you know
like what's your answer no I don't have
a full answer except generally I think
that we should push as much of this out
to the edge as we can and take it out of
the fighting over the DNS for example
and push them up through the abstraction
layers because otherwise once other
governments figure out how to do what
our governments doing it's going to be a
massive food more of a food fight than
it is already so at this point what I'd
like to do it because we have 15 minutes
left is really to open up the
conversation and see and hear from you
in terms of Basel II issues that you've
heard under opinions from our
distinguished panelists what are some of
the questions that you have on this
issue yes please all right hello thanks
so I decided a question about the oh
sorry my name is Brendan O'Connor at
university massachusetts amherst so i
was wondering about the foundational
issues for may the institutional
economic point of view are the
incentives there for nation states to
cooperate on internet governance far
into the future um so for example twenty
percent of the world lives in a place
where they can't access the full
internet and Internet Governance has not
been able to achieve kind of a full free
internet and so that's if you live in
China of course and Chinese government
has decided it's better to run a
different form of the internet that
debatably is somewhat separate from the
rest of the world internet and proposing
more standards isn't going to change
their incentive structure or preferences
to switch to that and you can imagine
that you know maybe other countries
might decide they would prefer a form of
the internet that's more like China's
than like the us-eu lots of acronyms
model um and so you know maybe even if
nation state incentives are just really
against this form of internet governance
have the same challenges that other
forms of international cooperation have
like no climate change treaties or
peacekeeping operations and things like
that so it's wrong if anyone has
comments about what does the future look
like when especially with more
distributed you know power at the
geopolitical level for example thank you
that's an excellent question who would
like to comment Susan so much for your
question you know I'm actually very
optimistic about this for two reasons
because there are more and more studies
showing the economic benefits of an open
Internet to everything from human rights
to good governance to and I think
increasingly not just citizens or
advocates of an open Internet but firm
so I am optimistic even in places like
China the other thing is that that's one
of the reasons that I see government the
US government moving to government
dominated venues which could be
dangerous because again you want people
in business to be these advocates but
you know in the trade regime this is the
positive side of it there are potentials
to challenge nations for censorship for
Internet restrictive practices in a way
that builds on access to information and
due process rights because those are
embedded in trade agreements so I think
there are growing incentives that more
and more people are aware of and that
you can see this in venues on the other
hand one could argue
that more and more governments are
forming their own intranets and it is a
scare you know what what's happening in
Russia for example so I'll let other
people comment excuse my ambivalence
there but I am more optimistic than
pessimistic Susan I hope you're right i
think this question of fragmentation and
data localization and all all the issues
that go with that is one of these issues
that that we we kind of just say that's
bad and i think a little bit of thought
and investigation could be put into
asking the question what would the
internet look like if it went that
direction and some of you know i'm a
proponent of biology as the answer to
all questions in computer science and in
biology we certainly have a lot of
diverse ecosystems and diverse species
within ecosystems and diverse
individuals within species and so i
don't know that it would be bad to have
a world like the one that you're
outlining but i think i think we need to
ask that question think what the
consequences would be yeah it's a great
question and you know picking up on
Susan's points I think that you know
states do recognize kind of the economic
benefits of a unfragmented internet and
unfragmented dns and unfragmented
routing system and you know their their
tacit lee if not explicitly endorsing
multi-stakeholder governance around
critical internet resources i mean we
even see china last week at that moon d
all kind of openly supporting the
multi-stakeholder model that being said
they're doing very you know the types of
things that a lot of people would not
like to see them do at the domestic
level so what I think we need to really
pay attention to going forward is
what happens to the role of governments
in multi-stakeholder governance
organisations so we need to really kind
of unpack they're not just monolithic
governments as stephanie was saying they
have variety of interests sometimes they
conflict and we need to actually have
those agencies government agencies
participating in these governance
organizations and expressing what those
interests are so we can have so we have
a greater understanding of where we need
to adapt policy to meet the meet those
needs just really quickly thank you you
could argue that we don't have a
universal internet now because of
language barriers because of access
barriers because of access speeds
because of filtering and censoring
systems and the fact that we see
different information in different
places but at a technical level there
has been the building blocks of
universality for the internet and I
think that that is really key and I'll
say that the I'll assert that the cost
of fragmentation is real whether you're
talking at the protocol level the
institutional level or at the level of
private companies what's often left out
of this discussion is that the largest
users of the internet are private
industry large companies like find the
financial services sector transportation
energy and they are doing business
globally and I know Mackenzie is right
now in the middle of a study they've
done the qualitative part and they're
working on the quantitative part of the
cost of data localization measures and
different country specific requirements
on the financial services industry so I
think that those kinds of governance
decisions that are primarily geo
politically motivated have very profound
economic implications not just for the
cost of private industry doing business
but also for the potential for
permission lucinda that we have today
great thank you and I'll just add my two
cents on top of that which is the
panelists have talked about both the
benefits the economic benefits as well
as the cost of some of the issues such
as the fragmentation I'd like to put an
appeal out there that we
absolutely need evidence on on what this
means because a lot of the you know in a
policy conversation these things get
thrown around and there aren't very hard
evidence actually looking at quantifying
what are the benefits what are the
evidence really formal rigorous methods
as well as what is the cost of the
fragmentations let's have that evidence
on a table to enable more inform policy
discussion that's a little bit of this
what this conversation is all about
another question if not what I'd like to
do is to ask a question to all the
panelists but then also ask for your
closing comment and what I'd like to do
is kind of go back meaning that this is
a research conversation and you're all
fantastic researchers what if we were to
start the IG public discussion policy
discussion fresh how would you frame the
discussion in a way that you know maybe
enables more rational approaches and
also who should be at the table what
would be a holistic framework to guide
this discussion you know there's this
pop keeps on mentioning organized chaos
is there a better phone listed framework
to look at this i would say that a
better framing would be one that does
not adopt one of the extremes that we've
seen over the last 20 years on one
extreme we have a community that says
these are just technical decisions and
if they have no political implications
on the other hand we have policy makers
making it all about the geopolitical
implications and of course the truth is
always somewhere in between so I think
acknowledging that the stability and the
security of the infrastructure itself
material in virtual is absolutely one of
the greatest public policy problems of
our time keeping that operational I
would say that that is the that's the
framing that I would use and I would in
kind of expand on that framing by saying
that we have to acknowledge a very
important fact about the Internet and
the very important fact about the
Internet is that it's no longer a
communication network we still think
about it like that as
communications between people but think
about the last session that we were in
with cyber objects now more objects are
connected to the internet than people on
the planet and if all of us were taken
off the planet now the internet would
continue to exchange information isn't
that interesting surveillance videos at
least for a time that it would keep
flowing for a while and we have to think
about the fact that it's an autonomous
system in some ways and it's a control
system as well as a communication system
think about the Supreme Court ruling
quoting Chief Justice Roberts in the
cell phone ruling in 2014 where he said
if the proverbial Martian landed on the
earth today it would assume that a cell
phone was part of our Anatomy right so
we have to think about it integrated not
only into the internet of things but
also are in a way our biology thank you
the way well so I mentioned earlier kind
of my way of thinking about what
internet governance issues are or what
you know what buckets they fall into so
i guess i would i want to advocate for
what i think will accomplish greater put
push forward the internet governance
dialogue and for me that's closer
engagement of kind of political economy
institutions and computer science
research and you know to do that and to
do it well is going to take a take a lot
of effort from data to institutional
support from companies like Microsoft
and and the academic world too but
there's some really important things to
that that need to be that we need to
learn about you know we can focus all we
want on I can and its structures and we
should we do need to pay attention to it
but these kind of underlying Network
forms of governance that occur all over
the Internet we know very little bit
about we don't know much about it from
an economic perspective the supply and
demand of what why we have these
different forms of network governance we
don't know much about the
economic characteristics of it so for
instance like routing registries are
used increasingly but we know very
little about how they actually operate
we don't know what if they have public
good characteristics or if they have
other characteristics we don't know if
their network externalities associated
with their use so there are a lot of
interesting areas that really are only
going to be we're going to only have
greater insights if we do
multidisciplinary research thank you so
if we were going to start the discussion
from scratch I guess the two things I
would say is first of all I might not
use the word governance because I think
that that has already kind of
politicized the discussion and what a
better word would be I don't know I've
heard some alternatives but I think that
kind of slants the discussion of the
problem and kind of following up on what
Laura said which I completely agree with
I think we need some way to realize that
the kind of the timescales of political
policy decision-making and the
timescales of engineering
decision-making you know they're very
quite different and so one of the
frustrations i see is trying to put
those two things together when the way
the processes run are just at completely
different speeds so that's one thing and
then the only the only other comment I
would make is I think if the public the
average citizen who we speak to every
night when we go home or on the bus had
been involved and really engaged in the
importance of these discussions much
earlier it would be a different
discussion and as it is the average
person on the street didn't realize that
any of this mattered i think until after
the Snowden revelations started coming
out and so that's that's another thing
where if we'd had real public engagement
and if we stood today had real public
increased engagement I think it would be
a different conversation well two things
and I'm going to
first to the normative so the internet
is supposedly built to facilitate trust
and it seems like it did do just that
right because one user and one producer
of information don't know each other in
general but it seems like these days
more more the internet is leading to
greater distrust among human beings and
that is to for many reasons right and
but so I hope that the central norm be
that we use to think about is how can we
facilitate trust among users and
producers of information the second
point I want to make is particularly to
Americans is that many governments
provide public goods online and so
whether it's an election as in Brazil or
its healthcare services or education we
need to understand that some governments
look at these issues and and their
citizens as matters of information
security not because they don't want to
share information but because they are
providing services to their people and
they feel that must be done in a way
that protects the security of that
information so my long when two point
there is that we need more tolerance of
different governments cultures to really
achieve good governance online Thank You
Susan for rating there's some issues
what oh there's a Les Paul to give the
closing remark so thanks and thanks to
all of you for for coming in and
spending some time here you've each
provided some great examples of places
where there's more research needed I'm
particularly struck by Susan suggestion
of that the Delta between norms and
process sort of norms and and rule of
law and and how that impacts the way
that that the internet it ends up being
used and trust amongst countries and
among citizens that's one example
Brendan listed four separate categories
where research and additional engagement
is is necessary we heard
the economic impact and we've certainly
a Microsoft used the you know World Bank
stats on an X percent improvement of
broadband equals a live percent
improvement in GDP those get kind of old
after a while I think there is a lot of
that could be done that's really more
focused on on what the impacts are when
you start from zero because there's a
whole part of the world that is not
connected and that that looks like a
great new research opportunity for
starting from zero and and you know
bringing populations online these are
also populations for the most part that
aren't don't speak English or don't use
Latin character sets and this is another
area we didn't really touch on but the
overall internationalization of the
Internet is as a process that is at this
point is a work in progress and it's
it's moving but it's not moving as fast
as many people would like I think
there's opportunities to engage there
for people who are are particularly
interested in the emerging new parts of
what will be the internet economy and
then the other thing that I I think
you've each individually sort of touched
on in in some way is the is the
pressures that are occurring when when
divergent cultures are pushed together a
little more quickly and a little more
closely than might naturally have
occurred in in the time when I was
growing up we didn't have the internet
and we used stone tablets to do term
papers things like that the the ability
to get an idea too many people it was
pretty hard you couldn't do that today
you know anyone in this room in five
minutes can get it an idea across the
world to you know somewhere towards
three billion people if you work really
hard at it and that has a tremendous
sociological implications but it also
has a tremendous technical in technical
implication on for the people who are
building the service and infrastructures
that enable that I think there's a real
opportunity to do some work there on
just just what the
long term for you know projected impacts
of that kind of accelerated
cross-cultural pollination could be as
well as and there's two sides of that
there's the good side which is you know
how I can elevate societies but there's
the flip side which is how rapidly you
can spread destructive material
destructive ideas and you know tears
things down at the same time so those
are great opportunities I hope that all
of you here might have taken away
something that will spur an idea that
maybe you'd like to pursue as well and I
hope that you enjoy the rest of the
conference thanks for taking your time
and thank you to all of our panelists</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
