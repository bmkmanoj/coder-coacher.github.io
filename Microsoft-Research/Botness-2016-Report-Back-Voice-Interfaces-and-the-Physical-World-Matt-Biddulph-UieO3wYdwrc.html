session about bots and hardware but we
had a tiny circle of people and there
was a huge circle of people talking
about voice so we merged our sessions to
talk about voice interfaces and the
physical world generally and we had a
whole lot of different thoughts on that
from the group the initial reaction from
people who'd built skills with Alexa was
when it comes to voice interfaces it's
really hard to know where to start both
how you get the user into the interface
and what is the right way to trigger
your service what are the right words to
use and I think it mostly comes from the
fact we just don't have that much
experience building these things yet
there was a lot of discussion about what
his voice good for versus not and a lot
of course is based on context sandy
herself had built a skill to train her
dog so she could say Alexa tell LexA
tell the service to train my dog to bark
and then she realized that a voice
interface wasn't the best way to
interact with a dog because the dog
can't trigger Alexa and talk back to it
so then there was a lot of conversation
about the wake words ah you know and the
fact that it's always a lexer to trigger
Alexa O's hey Cortana and so on and the
fact you can't personalize that feels
like it's rather limiting but but it's
actually because of a very specific kind
of machine learning problem that out of
the box we need it needs to recognize
Alexa said by almost like any human
being that might say it and only later
can you start to learn for more voices
of your users in context we talked about
how Siri feels like it's trapped inside
the phone now we've started to get used
to a lecture in a physical device and
the fact that it has a little blue light
that lights up when it recognizes things
multiple users are really complicated
it's really hard to know if the same
person is in the room as originally set
a reminder or something politeness is
really complicated you don't their loads
of things we could do if Alexa could
just start talking by itself but it
wouldn't know whether it would be
interrupting you or is the appropriate
time to do so we talked a little bit our
kids and how kids will pretty much trust
anything with a voice talking to them
and so the world of exploits with voice
interfaces is terrifying for kids and we
talked a bit about um context and the
sort of the audit trail of what's
happened at least when you've had a
message
interface by typing with something or
you've had an email trail or you've
written something animo you know what
happened voice is ephemeral and your
interaction with the device disappears
into the ether</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
