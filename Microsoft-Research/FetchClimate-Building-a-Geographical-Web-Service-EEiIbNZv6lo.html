Microsoft Research Cambridge or a min
the computational ecology and
environmental science group the mission
of that group is to carry out
computational science that should let
humanity manage our natural resources
better as part of that research mission
we develop new software tools predictive
models in geographical information
services that should allow people to
carry out that kind of cutting-edge
research more widely today I'd like to
show you fetch climate which is an easy
fast way for anyone to extract complex
information about the climate either
just with a few lines of code in a
program or even just through a browser
so here's our browser running fetch
climate i'm in redmond it microsoft
headquarters so i'm going to zoom in on
the area around redmond and i can just
really easily draw a square here to
populate a grid and hit fetch what's
happening is this is a silverlight
application which is communicating with
an agile service that service is looking
over a large number of large data sets
and it's choosing the best date of to
answer the query is then doing a whole
bunch of complex mathematical
calculations and sending the result back
to our application running in the
browser the answer of that query is now
being visualized on top of bing maps by
a dynamic data display which is another
prototype tool that comes from our group
you can see that interactivity we hover
the mouse over here we can see for
instance that the average temperature in
this place is about 2.8 degrees we can
download data so we just hit download we
get a choice of formats and we can see
all the information that we would need
from that query it's got different times
as well so we can do a query for a
fraction of the year or even a fraction
of the day and then we have the air
temperature data itself we have the
provenance so the data source that was
used to supply this information and we
even have an estimate of uncertainty
that uncertainty is something that the
experts find really hard to assign to
data that was a research project in its
own right and yet that's always supplied
every time with a fetch climate query
now we can for the browser version we
can run multiple copies of fetch climate
at once and so I'm going to show you a
couple of examples of fetches that I did
earlier so here's one of wind speed
over the eastern US that's the kind of
thing that you might want to look at if
you're a energy company or the
government planning wind farms and in
this fetch and put a string of locations
across Africa and each of those
locations I've extracted 60 years worth
of rainfall data and we can just hover
over one of those points and see what's
happening to rainfall and unfortunately
this looks pretty worrying because it
looks like there's been a steady decline
in rainfall over the past 60 years it's
the kind of thing we probably all seen
in the headlines recently African
droughts and so on so thanks to fetch
climate anyone can get that kind of
information really easily it's live it's
ready go and find it have a go and
please tell us what you think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
