you
my name is your cuca representing zap
fest tonight and that you're here to
listen to the guan le talk about touch
develop or how to help absa just with
your phone without sugar do is wait
until now thank you so I'm Nicola
chairman and I'm here together with pila
del u we are two members of the touch
develop team and we are going to talk
about a new way how to write programs on
your phones so what we are all very much
aware of in our everyday life is that
computers are shrinking we have seen
different input devices and the wavy
surf the internet now is totally
different from what it used to be you
can just touch on the screen and move
things around before that is the
invention of the mouse we could drag
around things and so what I want you to
think about I said all of these new
input devices they are not just fun for
everyday tasks but how can we actually
use them for programming yeah there are
many applications out there and writing
programs is one of them so devices are
getting smaller and smaller so you might
think that in some sense they're getting
more limited but in many ways the latest
generation of devices smartphones is
more powerful than ever and in one point
that really sticks out is that unlike a
PC you have your phone always with you
that's the medically different from how
you interacted this with a pc in the
past you always have to phone this you
and also no secret is that if you look
at sales numbers smartphones are taking
over pc is kind of not going so fast
anymore so if you just look at the
numbers here that is a billion units
sold in a few years literally every
person on earth will have a phone so you
always have it with you and everyone on
earth to some extent
have a smartphone which is a
general-purpose computing device this is
a full-blown computer and in another
aspect it's a much more fun computer
than the pc ever boss because it has
many more sensors the pc had what a
screen a keyboard and a mouse and what
does the smart phone cam is tap screen
of course cameras not just fun but also
back it's always connected to the cloud
it can talk to other devices with
Bluetooth it has gps knows how fast
you're going how much you're
accelerating much more sense i SPECT
then ever before but as good as this
computing devices if you think about the
state of the art of creating software
for smartphones there's a big disconnect
so you create smartphone software by
using a pc using a traditional setup
this languages that were invented before
mobile devices even existed you're
supposed to write text with a keyboard
you can use the mouse if you want and
then to try the program's out to use an
emulator and may be deployed on the
actual phone so this is state of the art
and so so I guess everyone here in the
audience this has been writing Windows
Phone apps already so to anyone who has
never late never knows phone up in the
past Oh or lunch actually okay so then
maybe I can ask everyone who did write a
Windows Phone up did you submit it to
the marketplace who submitted it to the
marketplace are a few people who got it
accepted the first time ooh one person
one person of the entire audience so
that actually maps our experience and
statistics it it is pretty tricky to get
apps out there not just because of the
software you need the skill set you need
to have had also because of the process
and you have to go through so if you go
back in time then when I go up and I'm
sure many other here had similar
experiences that is what my computer
looked like when I turned it on for the
first time was it a smartphone but
pretty cool and it wanted me to write
code that's really it's not the greatest
end user experience I admit but it
shaped an entire generation you turn it
on you get exposed to the idea of
writing code and how sad now you get
such a powerful device and what the
built-in experience provides is that you
you just get finished apps from the
market place and you are a consumer by
default you are a consumer whereas it
used to be much more prominent to
actually create content create apps can
we change that that is a research
question that our group here in building
99 to gone and we came up with a
radically new development environment
that we call touch develop it is
actually a Windows Phone app it's
available for free in the marketplace so
I'd know and it's fully development
environment that also picks social
collaboration features it allows you to
write code run code and share your
programs with other people and after all
the talking I will now hand over to paly
who will give you a demo and keep one
thing in mind everything they're going
to show you it's on a phone only there's
no pc required the whole idea behind our
project Vall said you might not even
have a PC and yet you should be able to
write software so really write some
enemies is probably daughter and I'm
also a developer in the new touch
develop team and today we're going to
write write a nap together so before we
write the app together we should get the
phone here so if I had a live stream I
could actually write the app and keep
walking around I do sometimes and
sometimes I find myself coding well
while biking but I won't do that today
so touch develop allows you to write
apps everywhere and they allow you to
write apps for your phone it's a pretty
cool environment to to be creative while
you have something to do i'm just going
to remove the autofocus here so it's a
nap and we're in Windows Phone so I'm
just going to launch a touch develop and
you land on the hub where you can browse
those new scripts that have been
published by other users and then you
can look at whether you've got more
points or so forth but we're going to
show that later we're going to start by
by creating a new script and and writing
some code so I'm going to tap on the
little plus button here and then I can
pick a cool name so I'm going to call it
zap exempt vests 2012 and create right
so we have a script is an app it bundles
code in my bundle events and a bunch of
assets and we're going to go into the
code editor which we call actions so
there is an action called main here and
I'm can just tap on it to open the the
editor so here we are in a what looks
like a traditional editor so we have a
typed imperative language it's a pretty
simple scripting language if you have
done c java language like that it's
pretty intuitive we use the arrow
because you don't see dots on on small
screens so i can i can run this code so
i can hit the play button down there and
i can just run the code right and well
at the time of Nicolae this would have
been exciting to be able to display
strings but these days not so much so we
can make it a bit more interesting so I
can select this and for example I can we
factor that into into a for loop so we
have control flow so we have things like
let's go back and do that again I'm just
going to cut this in fact so I'm going
to add a new a new for loop you see that
we have if statements we have four eh
before all the good stuff that you know
going to do a for loop and here you see
that there's not a lot of typing to do
we weave the older boilerplate code is
there for you you can touch it and you
just have to provide your prevailed in
this case I'm going to use this little
number editor and we are here in the
expression editor which is a specialized
keyboard to enter expressions right so
if i press back and back into my my
little function here and then I'm going
to say I'm going to tap on do nothing
here and I'm going to add one more
statement so there's going to be a
command and I need to add a string and
strings live here and as you can see I'm
using a big finger on a small screen
fact I'm doing type was here cool and
we're going to post the string to the
wall so touch develop tries to be to be
simple for end-users and we try to use
part I'm that they understand we are in
the Facebook poll the facebook era so we
actually don't consult right line or
printf we we post things to the wall
right and that is pretty cool so we just
did a little loop and we're displaying
text so we have a web of rich language
we can really do whatever we want and we
can also leverage all the cool stuff
let's on the phone the sensors the media
and also maybe your calendar and so
forth so instead of doing something that
is cool but cool a long time ago just
going to cut that what I'm going to do
is maybe a pick a random picture from
from the phone so the phone as all my
pictures and I'm just going to go and
look for media so there's a media and in
media avid and have any easy access to
the picture albums but the pictures
maybe I can also get the songs there's
going to grab the pictures and in this
case there's a handy method co random so
this this action returns a picture
object and there is a refactoring button
here that says store in variable
so I can just do that and now I've
declared a local variable and I can come
back to to my code so we've we picked a
picture and we're going to just display
that to the wall again adding a new
statement a command and now you can see
that pic is a is right at the at the
front of the intellisense so we actually
we've done quite a bit of work trying to
make the best guess and reorganize those
buttons so as you type we we change the
order in order to to predict what you're
going to try to use in that case so
we've done that demo quite a bit so it's
a nose that we want to post it the wall
alright so we're running this and it
picked a picture right and I can run it
again and again and again so that's
that's a good start we already did
something that wasn't trivial but we're
going to make it more interesting so
there's there's been recently uh well it
seems that people want to see a picture
but a with some sepia filter in do you
want to see the old school yes should be
like recorded so this entire proper the
question is whether it's recorded its
yeah it is recorded and it will be
monday also available next we'll send
the same building couch on the same
aliases
like question so what are those arrows
after media features so the question is
what are those arrows the question is
what are the hours are they are they are
dots in c-sharp and you hold those so
it's like a dot in c-sharp the effect
then some different iterations and the
daughters too small on the screen to see
where so the error is more expressive to
select a property of an object yeah all
right so what we want to do is tin the
picture so I'm going to tap on the first
statement and I'm going to sneak in
another line here so i'm going to add
another command and i know that there is
a there's probably a tint method defined
on pick but i'm not sure exactly where
it is so i'm going to search for it and
here i'm going to do tint and there is
actually a mythical tint and it well it
will turn the picture right so if we go
back now and run it we got a familiar
effect where you can't see anything on
the screen almost so in fact CPI is
rather boring so let's go ahead and
change that and instead we're going to
pick a color ourselves so I'm going to
we're going to use a specialized editor
analyze to pick colors because many
times we're going to customize a color
speaker a bright one it's big green
favorite color here and there we go so
we got our green color I can run again
and now we got now the app that that
runs and that is actually a picture that
runs over this ok so so far so good
we've we've written a little app that's
funny what we want to do now is is maybe
make it more interactive so whenever I
shake the phone I want to do that again
and again and again and see you and see
more pictures and to make it more
artistic I'm actually go back going go
to go back here instead using a random
color which
is going to be more interesting random
there we go alright so back to the back
to the script editor we looked at code
but we also have events so events are
first class and they allow you to
respond to what the environment is is
doing to the phone so we can tap on plus
to see what we have so you can see that
we have events like shake or phone face
up and down which are related to the
accelerometers we we process the
accelerator and we we turn that into an
event for you and you have more events
down so you have events related to the
music you're playing whether you are
starting to play music or what's what's
the active song on the phone you also
have events for the camera because there
is a there's a hardware there's a camera
and you can you can be notified when the
user tries to depress the camera so
there's a there's a whole lot of
interesting events that you can register
to so we're going to do shake today and
tap here and we're back into the
statement editor and in this case what
I'm going to do is I'm just going to
call the main action that we just wrote
so the way you do that is you access you
look for a singlet uncle code and code
there we go and then and I'm going to do
it again and notice how the button here
as a triangle and I called code but when
we put it in the the expression editor
we don't put the code and the reason is
space the reason is that after a while
you recognize the symbol and it saves a
lot of space we're dealing with very
small screens here right so I can read
this we got a picture and every time I
shake it shake it shake it we get
another picture there was a question in
the audience on a green at all the right
head over to this
so the question is they are green and
red else at the top corner of the
buttons if you go into the expression
editor what do the colorful buttons mean
they means some are green and some are
are red there is some internal there is
some internal coloring scheme these are
the green ones here are our singlet ins
and art is a special one and then based
on the return type you'll have different
colors and I deleted the coda I was
supposed to do undo perfect right hunnu
works we're good to go all right then I
can shake right so the last thing I want
to do is maybe I see a variation of my
pictures that I want to save so I'm
going to save that to the phone so we
can add one more events so let's go back
to the script editor and you can see
here are how interactive building an app
is when you're already on the phone
again really play around to unit trial
kind of things and you need it's it's
really a playful so I'm going to add
another event and it's possible to
register tap events on certain kind so I
can actually be notified when a picture
is tapped on the wall so the tap will
picture will trigger whenever the user
taps on a picture and in that case it's
very easy to save it to the phone so i'm
going to do item and save to library and
that will save the picture into a
special album in the windows phone right
so we launch the app and we generate a
couple pictures in fact i like i like
this one with the bike one so i'm just
going to tap on it and and I don't know
whether it did it all right so it's
changed let's change the app and let's
have the phone vibrate or maybe uh maybe
play some music even more
exciting it's pick a random song and
play so media songs random play it's
pretty straightforward so let's do it
again come on whoops you can probably
pressed a button I probably press the
button and we're back and let's see so I
have to find my scripts which is
probably cold exactly as 2012 and it's
driving in all right I like this one
okay it did it and save the picture so
we're good we can actually go into the
camera to stop the music alright I'm
going to go into the pictures and if you
go into the safe pictures library you
can see that it's already there actually
yet save the previous one so you can
these are all the things that you can do
we touch to it pretty easily you can
play around build your app and then when
you're happy with your app yeah i would
like to run you up so when you're happy
when your app you want to share it we we
all want to show up what we have and we
am to have users so in touch develop in
order to submit an app you just have to
press a button it's here at the bottom
and it will publish a your script to our
bizarre right there's a live this game
or don't store passwords in there
because it's all public so you hit
public publish and and you have to be
connected to internet of course let's
run it again I am in flight mode but I
should be also on the Wi-Fi which is
turned up
yeah alright so we want published today
but if we had published then the script
would show up in the in the new section
and so maybe we finish the demo later
when I figure out why I lost the Wi-Fi I
converter the publishing experience so I
have a different phone here which
happens to have an internet connection
so i won't be able to recreate this
level at scripps at pd just thought but
let's create another one maybe tint come
of a picture so i want to take a picture
with a camera tint it and post it to the
wall and that should be pretty easy to
do and I spread the name but it doesn't
really matter so I go in and add a
statement to take a picture so the
camera is one of so many sends us into
the phone so I can just go to sensors
take a picture store it in a variable
and then operating on the available I
can tint it similar to what pili already
short I'm really walking fast through
the program and tinted in a random way
and then I will show it on the screen so
this program actually does something
interesting ok so that's my entire
program if I run this program it will
ask to take a picture yeah so you just
took a picture and let's accept that and
here it is so cool up and to share it
with the world indeed I just press the
upload button for the script and let's
collect it spinning mistake
upload a fish so it's not sent to our
cloud and all scripts are actually
automatically analyzed in the cloud we
are looking for a certain privacy
concerns what information does
potentially leak we sort of everything
and now if anyone looks for all of the
scripts that the f in this clip has are
then you see now what's currently
happening so 16 seconds ago I posted
this script and other people are
publishing other scripts ok so we just
had fun writing scripts it's finished ah
you're back on the internet I'm taking
another phone and I'm looking so that's
another phone i'm looking at new script
and if you have a windows phone right
now you can do the same thing open touch
of it up go to new and you will find it
so this is a this is very similar to a
market play experience where this is
very similar to a this is very similar
to market players experience where you
can look at the app and see what it's
doing so you can know cannot get an idea
what's happening there there my oh
there's no screenshots there's a forearm
so there's no screenshot and maybe I can
fix that can you like it too I can also
like it but i haven't read it yet so i
can actually go and look at the source
code directly from the from the preview
page kind of style and I get a feeling
what's happening here so I'm going to
download it this will download the for
the full code of the app and open the
editor and I can run the app so it turns
out that it's taking a picture Nico I
returning you the favor there we go all
right we got nigga lion green that's
pretty cool what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take a screenshot so this
allows to take a screenshot of the app
and upload it to the cloud so it's very
easy to actually make it your app more
appealing to have people download it
it's very important and since i like it
i'm also going to
I'm also going to go back to the review
page and then I'm going to add a little
like to that I'm gonna say that yeah oh
we got all ready to likes three likes
this app is on fire oh that's very good
we will come back to this clip later I'm
gonna going to drop a message to me
color any color saying this is cool
right Oh an acolyte yeah sure I just got
a notification that somebody like my
script yeah so it's a fully integrated
experience when he writes a comment I
should get another notification this is
cool all right now it comes with a bit
of today and and now in fact when we
come back to the to the new page you can
see that there's actually a little all
the preview of the screenshot in the in
the list of apps to make it more more
more attractive so in just a few seconds
we oughta script and we published it we
decorated it with all kinds of metadata
how cool is that I mean it was never
easier to get programs out there even on
pcs so we showed you how we can write
some script in a few seconds let's look
at what other people have been doing
so since half a year it is possible for
people to share scripts and since then
we have seen many downloads of our apps
you are really over vampired by the
response so we almost had 200 up
downloads for windows phone and they
have been six thousand scripts and
different script variations published by
all of the users and you can see that
it's really very diverse there are many
games but also utilities and you can use
bing maps and you can draw charts it's a
general-purpose forming environment so
let me show you some of the cool scripts
in action that people have been writing
so I already installed them on my phone
and let's start with a pretty simple one
break it you probably recognize this
game immediately so I can use the
accelerometer to tell the phone that I'm
tilting it so the game works for tilting
the phone and then when I tap on the
screen the ball gets going and we take
away some licks once in a while I can
also produce a ripple effect but that
depends on configuration so somebody
ought this entire script on the phone
there's no pc I think that's pretty
amazing and how difficult is that that
probably must have been a lot of work
right let's look at the code behind this
so I can go into the code editor and and
first of all you see that they're just
three functions here this entire game
consists of three functions main
drawbacks and game so when we look at
main there's some setup work in the
beginning it's basically two pages of
code and then the second page is a main
game loop so while running it does
something basically a move surrounds the
pedal depending on the count
accelerometer reading and then it counts
your lives and you have three lives and
when all of your lives are gone then the
game ends obviously so we can look at
this other function
invoked here what does that function do
so when you are out of lives and it
takes your high school and it posts it
to a leaderboard so we have many
built-in cloud ap is in touch develop
and one of them is a centralized
leaderboard if you write a game you
don't have to worry about we have to
maintain a high score list we do that
for you so there's one more function and
that is called robux this one is
interesting because it's very easy here
to see how the grid of bricks is created
so there are two nested for loops and in
the loops rectangles are created with
different colors so those are the breaks
that is the entire game and you have
seen how to write code right so in half
an hour after a bit of practice you can
write such a game and sell for 99 cents
s we will see later and if you keep
producing apps every half an hour that
actually a monster something let's look
another one so here is another famous
game one of our users audit yeah every
day we are just surprised by what our
users can do on the phone so I can I can
swipe down to accelerate I can tap on it
20 Tate and I can swipe to the sides and
this is not going to look very good yes
again there's a high school fully
integrated experience last game
this one is called cloud hopper and
again it uses the accelerometer to move
around the little guy here so I take the
phone off to cover so that I've done so
much better and again there's a
centralized leaderboard here it's
actually even shown this is what people
are playing the game can you beat that
high score that's really tough yeah I've
been playing this a lot what's really
cool is whatever you find on the
skipper's I intouch develop all of these
scripts are free so you can just play
these games for the fun of it so another
yes so they're all free I really has i
released under some sort of license he
was ready some license when you upload
so the question is when script is
uploaded it's some kind of license that
says that everything is free indeed so
there's the terms of use it basically
says when you upload the script to give
it to the public domain read the Terms
of Use so we recently added a feature
that allows to create rich data types
using a graphical editor and a really
cool script that user set features
called my blog so when I run this script
the first thing it does is it does a web
request to download a list of all birds
in the world and it puts them into a
dictionary ok now the app is running I
can browse all of the birds that are
known to the app and let's say outside
you just saw an eager then we can take
from ze and select eager what kind of
ego well I've seen bald eagles here but
I'm not really sure if it is a bald
eagle so the next thing the Aptos I can
ask for being pictures that match the
script
of bald eagles so it's easy to connect
to Bing Bing search and Bing Maps yeah
that's exactly what I saw so now I can
lock a broad sighting there's a plus
button at the bottom you can create
simple you is in touch develop and when
I press the plus button the phone will
use gps to take my current location it's
just one function call in the code get
current location and it will store it in
a table and know whenever I want to know
again there I saw that but I can pop up
a map which shows me where we are right
now so this is a pretty rich application
that has a little database in its back
end and you can get this entire
application on the phone while riding in
the bus to work so to just show you how
this database looks like so so far we
have only looked at code but just also
they also events vivi added shake events
in the code there's more so there's data
data is like your regular global static
variables in other programming languages
one difference is they are persistent
you don't have to do this tomb stoning
and serializing all the state we do all
of that and it's very easy that's way to
maintain global state now on top of that
there's a concept of structure data
types here under the title of records
where you can configure tables and
images which are basically collections
of records you can also add artwork and
there's the library concept to create
modular applications yeah that's another
pretty cool script any questions about
scripts that can be created as touch
that up so far yeah so so far we saw how
tonight a back-end code logic forums app
apps of what kind of support does this
app provide for creating you whines what
kind of you guys can I create
what kind of you is can you create so
today it is a bit limited you can you
have seen the concept of the wall there
you just post stuff then there's a
concept of pages so you can basically
have a stack of voids that show
different things and on top of that or
at the bottom of it you can have
application bar buttons that is what the
app allows you to do today we right now
have an intern who is actually just
walking in he is working on a better way
to create you is using basically as an
extension of our built-in language so we
do not want that you have to learn xml
and another language but we we will have
a completely integrated experience to
create even richer you is but you have
found that for many click applications
what we have is fully sufficient but we
also have and that was used in all of
the games is a concept of a board which
is basically a canvas on which you can
paint anything but it's a bit richer
it's actually it has a built in physics
engine you can place objects as physical
properties like speed friction and that
allows you to draw anything you wish
yeah another question to Christians
actually thirsty do we have to run these
programs from inside touch develop or we
can just publish it as a normal data if
you have to under program from this in
touch develop or can you publish them as
like Rudolph's excellent question
they're so past I collapse I will talk
about that in a moment education is the
about consumption of these scripts did
you measure how I was about a culture
for the skills would seem to be the
power consuming
I know how about power consumption of
scripts there is a question so what we
do is actually reinterpret the scripts
so they are running a bit slower than
you're used to which also means they
consume a bit more power on the other
hand we have very high level API sui
that live from a very high abstraction
level so we have a built in physics
engine so for many tasks you don't have
to add low-level code in dustings in
tight loops but you can use our
high-level ap is so that power
consumption is not an issue but in
indeed in the big picture it's part of
our research agenda how they can get the
power consumption down even further okay
then back to the snow it's okay so we
looked at many scripts some of the many
scripts that people have written there's
a link on this page so this is a fun
video of an event we did recently so we
went to u-dub and we had a similar event
to the rocket on that we are planning to
do inside of Microsoft and here's an
experience aboard u-dub stands for the
University of Washington you're in
seattle
to the game everyone windows phones for
weekend
thirsty so I do
shake the changes are not normal and I
was hungry I got that you see close so I
developed a facial recognition app using
touch to note and the purpose was to
train it on a set of people that I
already recognized and I gave it two or
three images for each person and then
whenever I took an image that I didn't
know about of them later later on words
for a took a facebook image of that it
would recognize the person in the image
and both the scientists away I really
enjoyed working in touch develop I never
knew you could do so much on a touch
device without actually using an IDE on
a laptop or a computer I was really
impressed with the language and the API
was well and really well thought through
I really enjoyed working on this out my
friend Ian fender thought about this
cool idea he was just calling pay phones
because you can go look at the you can
go look at the number on the pay phone
and calm and you wanted to call his
friend when he walks right so we did
this things like we need to make this
moving out I run around and I take a
picture with the microsoft phone they
gave me and of each of the pay phones on
campus and around campus then we built
an app that like takes the user's
location tells them what the closest to
them pay phone is so you can walk into a
pay phone or near it you know in a bush
I guess and then they call it right so
it's like a pay phone cranker yeah hello
hey I'll come on what's your name
news-record acceleration deceleration
and Jessica readings but
Soviet on so fun on that weekend and so
did the students and I think it's again
was pretty amazing what they came up is
very diverse games utilities playing
cups you name it so what's really
different about touch develop is is
really the language and the editor so we
designed a new language that actually
fits a touchscreen editor so it needed
to be strongly typed so that we can do
really good intellisense predictions but
otherwise it's a traditional imperative
for c2 a language that the kind of
language has basically took over the
world all of the software is written in
such languages yeah buts really really
cool is that pretty much every API that
exists on the phone is available in
touch develop so that includes of course
all of the sensors we already talked
about but also all of the data sources
that sit on the phone pili was
interacting this pictures and the songs
but you can also access the calendar
contacts everything so one apps that
used to be our top up I think notes
number two is called my online meetings
it was actually written by a manager in
Microsoft he's not a full-time program
robots he's a manager at Eagle added so
what it does it it looks at the current
time then it goes to your calendar picks
out the current meeting you're supposed
to be in and if it's an online meeting
then this like really expressions it
gets out the phone number you're
supposed to call and the access code and
it combines it into a huge phone number
this pauses in between and dies it and
then you can pin that to the start
screen of your phone and and run it with
a single button click so that really
shows nicely how you can combine all of
the different data sources in a phone
script it together in a way that no as a
built-in app does and you can do it in a
few lines of code very useful so I also
mentioned the physics engine that makes
it easy to write games there's full
support to pin apps two tiles and to
actually change for the shown on ty
it's we also showed that you you can do
web Cleary's there's whole support for
JSON objects and XML so you can interact
with rich web api's it's very easy to
share scripts we show to you how that
works and by making it really really
easy to share scripts he also
potentially made it easy to share
malware somebody could write a malicious
scripts that takes your current location
and sends it to his own web service what
about that we don't really want that so
what we do is whenever you upload your
script you can only share it with other
people by going through our center Skip
bizarre and in that script bizarre the
automatically run information flow
analysis on the script to determine what
data sources go to what data sinks and
then there are two cases either we
classify such a flow as safe when
basically you get a chance to review the
data before it goes out then everything
behaves as normal so if your scrip takes
a picture from facebook well if the
script takes a picture with a camera and
then share it on facebook you get a
dialog that asks do you really want to
share that you click yes then you're in
an excellent position to decide whether
it's okay to share not but if the
picture gets tainted if some bits in co2
composition now or if this dialog is
missing then by default we would run if
you downloaded script we would run it
with anonymized information and you have
to go to some settings menu to override
it to run it with your real information
so by default you're always safe you can
also manually inspect scripts because
they always come the source code and
everything we do is fully automatic
there's no manual review process your
script will not be stuck in a waiting
room for a while so we already showed
you some of the social features people
can give hearts to script right comment
there are screenshots and there's a
notification system that notifies you
when ever does something whenever
something happens that is related to
your scripts so it's really interactive
so we were pretty early let's touch
develop over a year ago and then
something interesting happened on other
platforms other IDEs popped up and so so
there's a ID for Android and codya for
iOS and they are really cool ides you
should check them out if you have such
devices but there's something
fundamentally different between touch
develop and those IDs for those IDEs you
basically need a keyboard attached it
was blue tools or however you can do it
because they require you to enter either
Java code it's curly braces and
everything or lure code so it's it's
basically just using your mobile device
sopc without changing the UI and so
let's touch develop you really try to go
step forward and see how should the
programming experience be if if this is
the first computer you ever hold in your
hand we are really used to keyboards and
initially you might miss your keyboard a
lot because you're so used to it but
after I our entire buttons really become
very intuitive and this thing that is
pretty close to how a great experience
for entering code on a touch device
should be if you want to learn more we
have created a book is the help of
microsoft research connections that is
available to download as a eight
megabyte PDF file from our webpage
there's also set of slides basically 1
slide per API area to learn how to use
the API so canvas touch develop so one
question was how to run these scripts to
any touch develop to run a script and at
first the answer is yes if you publish
the script and you want to share with
other people that other person needs to
have a Windows Phone NZ touch develop up
and then sharing is very very quick
right just a matter of seconds
publishing script and then
it's out but there's also a pass to sell
ups and get rich so when you publish
enough it gets a unique ID and let's
actually look at that so if i go to our
web page the touch develop web page then
you can browse through everything that
is happening right now there's also the
book and many other materials but we can
see what is happening right now it's a
similar view as we had on the phone you
can look at new scripts we also keep
track of top scripts that can run a lot
and there are featured scripts that
contain novel feature set haven't been
used like that before but here new we
see the script that we just published
alright so I published this one that is
me and when I click on the script and if
you lock in on the web page with the
same credentials as you did on the phone
then new things are possible because you
are the author of the script so we have
a little system where you want to make
sure that before you turn the script
into an appt it's actually of high
quality so we require that three people
like it or give it a heart fortunately
that already happen for my script and
unless some people take away the hard
now and then I get this new button get
started this your own up and then see if
I can still do it and then a new page
will pop up set the guide me through the
process of entering summer metadata and
at the end of the process I can download
exact fire so these are basically all
metadata items that are required to
submit an up to the marketplace so there
are some descriptions regarding the text
it asks Who am I there's some
disclaimers if you want to add a privacy
statement and you have to upload certain
images so basically if you want to
publish an app in the market place you
have to follow the rules of the
marketplace you also have to register as
a developer and then you can publish
your zip file so at the end of the
download process you get exact file and
you submit it with regular up hub and
then you are free to actually charge
money for it we also have an option to
integrate ads into your app so that's
another potential revenue stream so what
we do to generate the exact file is we
basically bandar the script cote road
with our interpreter engine so it will
behave exactly the same as it behaved in
the touch develop up this does it answer
your question ok so that is CN that is
basically everything that is possible
today in touch develop and I want to
talk about one really cool feature that
is coming up soon and that is
distributed state in the cloud so if you
think of all the latest mobile
applications they typically store all of
your information in the cloud right and
it doesn't matter on what device you
access your data it's always the same
and in the background everything get
synchronized and magic but if you want
to implement such a nap yourself it's
actually pretty challenging you need to
set up a server that hosts the data you
need to pay someone for that you need to
worry about user identities and
authentication and then then you have
conflicting data coming from different
devices you have to think about how to
merge these conflicting updates so
there's a lot of work that
has to go into getting a rich
distributed state application we want to
change that so in one of the next
updates of touch developed but we will
allow you to do is to basically check a
checkbox called cloud next to a global
velba and when you do that we know who
you are because you have to login in
touch develop with windows live ID or
Facebook account and then we will host
data for you in the cloud and a lot of
research has been done in our group to
figure out a scheme how we can
automatically deal with structured data
that gets sent to different clients so
the ideas were bought from code
repository systems where you can check
out data work on it and then later when
connectivity's were stored you check it
in and we basically lifted these ideas
of versioning systems to such a data
types so the different devices can do
that and when they come together again
they the data the updates get merged how
do they get merged where for every data
type we have built in merging functions
you don't have to define them and they
usually do the right thing so for
integers cloud integers have special
operations you cannot just read and
write them but we provide a new
operation called add and then you can
accumulate changes and merging is
basically our fee and this also extends
to structure types like records if
different clients add a record to a
table that's no problem no conflicts
they just get added as you would expect
it so that's really exciting that's
coming up in one of the few jab dates ok
so to summarize we were really surprised
by how popular touch develop became over
the course of the last year we had many
many downloads and also another
interesting data point is set
most of our users actually rated very
highly so that tells us that the editing
experience actually works so if you
haven't tried it yourself yet and you're
still suspicious are tied you you will
be surprised how easy it actually is
touch develop is the only mobile editing
environment for code that really takes
the new form factor seriously if a
touchscreen and great apps on mobile
devices have to resync the UI otherwise
they are not great touch develop makes
available all of the sensors so
conceptually there is no application you
couldn't write in touch develop that you
can write in C sharp or in this a studio
we believe that touch develop is great
for also teaching and learning so we
find that many of our users they just
try and touch develop on on the windows
phone marketplace because they are
trying out apps so many people for the
first time in their life actually get
exposed to programming we have a
built-in tutorials that guides you step
by step through the button clicks to to
create a little program so we see that
assert of all of the scripts that are
written are by such users who probably
write programs for the first time in
their life but you also think that it's
great for teaching in a classroom so if
you think about the next generation of
students when they come into a classroom
what kind of computers are most used to
its mobile devices everyone needs a
phone and then if they get an exercise
for the teacher says now go to the PC
and implement a sorting algorithm then
it's it's hard to get taken seriously so
we believe that it's much more fun for
students to actually do exercises also
on mobile devices and we have some great
experience already in high schools he
has been teaching an entire class in a
high school so it's a great way to to
introduce people to programming and
finally is there any interns into the
room and you want to take these ideas to
university
a phone loan program so you can write us
an email and then we might make
available to you a number of Windows
phones for classroom so that you can or
your your class at the University can't
I doubt that's ever saying we have to
say and if there are questions for the
general presentation then you are free
to ask now yes so what this is about
arrows so this gets changed with these
kids try the schedules compliation
general for example or a tiger it's just
how help this is handled yeah what about
errors excellent question many things
come to my mind so in general we follow
a philosophy that is similar to most
mobile applications when it catches you
don't get a dialogue but it basically
just goes back to the start screen so
there is no elaborate exception handling
but there's a concept of invalid values
that you can test for so by default we
assume that if something goes horribly
wrong just let the user start over and
things will work out better but you can
test for invalid values if you want to
so there are of course also potential
compilation errors we have a
semi-structured code editor but it's it
doesn't guarantee that your code is
correct you cannot make certain kinds of
errors but you can still have
mismatching parenthesis at the
expression level and then you actually
get shown type errors in the code it's
if you try or touch develop and you type
something that doesn't make sense you
will see it immediately we are currently
working on the bugger support so today
when the app caches because there was an
invalid value for example you take a
picture and then in the program you
assume that there's a picture but maybe
the user actually canceled picture
taking then the program cannot continue
right so today when that happens you get
very little feedback in the phone what
actually went wrong but we are working
right now this one of our interns on on
a debugger on the phone
any other our related answers okay yeah
is touch develop done with the third
party AAP is in silverlight or journey
special access you have the touch
develop done this only the public civil
at api so did we get some special access
we didn't get any special treatment ever
saying in touch develop you could write
in C sharp a social Studios using public
knowledge yeah so some of these
applications are CF like media with them
cannot be created integral would tell
people made applications in fact about
to make these things like their pictures
um what about media really wants to
answer yes there's two things to the
actus answer we we don't bundle any kind
of media so we don't bundle in any
picture or video but you can easily
create links to videos who are hosted
somewhere on the web now there is an
anecdote to that a user actually rode a
sprite editor in touch develop and then
you would encode the sprite as a big
string and then he wrote of course the
encoder and the decoder for that holy in
touch develop and then he could actually
now it could write write and create
these little sprites and he start
creating games that has pride in them
and then you had this massive piece of
text in the code where you had all these
images encoded so you had a lot of fun I
guess doing that yeah any other
questions
but did not say in the library that
there was you had one of the things you
can put in Arras media as part of the
program so the media you see in the API
so is the question is whether there was
a media in the screen but I think it
means out no no in that so you had the
code and then you had venison in down
the bottom there was a part yet exactly
so that is basically a mechanism where
you can supply links to two sounds and
pictures and you get a nice preview what
they actually stand for and then you can
use them in code as just like built-in
songs and and pictures but they will
actually fetched at runtime through
those links so if you distribute this
program any other end user also they
download the pictures from the ultimate
sauce yeah they still there yes
otherwise it's going to be an invalid
value and either you check for it or the
program will terminate yeah when you
should show me the list of the events
that you support I understood the high
level ones like shake the fall or
something that do you have some some of
the low little ones like give the girls
nice of all the touches on the screen at
the moment something like that or like I
Jerome
so the question is whether we have more
targeted event like touch tap swipe drag
on particular elements so we have that
for the 2-d game board so the game
engine you will as soon as you declare
it you can actually see new events that
allows you to register to tap swipe drag
on the board but also on every
individual sprite or sprite set but we
don't give you tap or drag on wall
elements for example like I really like
the idea and that is amazing but is it
possible to to do the step back and use
it on the pc sofa like from an emulator
or something like that if you don't have
windows phone on you everyone yeah so
you cannot use it on your pc and we do
not want that people use it in an
emulator because it really takes away
the whole point you get immediate
feedback when you use the accelerometer
and all of our buttons on this on a pc
that would be huge and your sis mouse is
a super fine selection ability it
doesn't make sense so you really want a
different experience on a piece season
on the phone and we didn't want to
weaken our philosophy it's actually it's
a great exercise for us to constrain
ourself to this form factor if you only
have that much space you really have to
seriously rethink what you are doing
yeah maybe some additional question do
you know but if application is reached
some limitation of the platform it will
be really cool
get some C sharp example code from dice
developer and Ed and South Beach is a
motive we've entered currently
individual mhm so the question is but if
you reach a limitation and we want to
continue outside of touch develop how
can we get the code so what is available
today is you can actually look at the
code on the website in the touch develop
language actually not exactly how it
shows up on the phone but here we are
this is our internal representation with
curly braces and there's currently a
master student working on a compiler to
c sharp and then you could use that but
we don't provide any built-in
functionality to to turn it into a sea
Shabaab it's actually pretty tricky
because there are two ways you could do
it there's a naive way but in this naive
a I talked about tombstoning and VC
realize all of the data and take care of
tomb stoning but that wasn't quite work
if you translate in an affair to see
sharp and if you do it in a way that is
bulletproof then the c-sharp code would
look horrible there's tons of
continuation everywhere so it's a tricky
subject so for example if you look at
the sample here we take a picture we
take a camera picture in reality the
application is terminated I we go into
the photo application it takes a photo
it comes back and it drops a photo some
well-known place and then the developer
in c-sharp has to pick it up and then
continue with that right so we made it a
single call but in reality it's it's
much more tricky than that when when
you're implementing it in c-sharp so the
code Jen would be a bit more ugly yeah
it's impossible to have the scripts like
running the background
is it possible to landscapes in the
background today that is not possible
because we haven't implemented that part
yet if you want to help us we are little
research team since you're working for
microsoft you are happy to join us to
implement all of those little missing
pieces but there's no inherent reason
why you shouldn't be able to run things
in the background regeneration lost
equations is it possible like if these
DVD events or iron or big their
extension points that that he provides
are not enough can we call some
additional let ya extension points in
visual studio and integrate and refresh
the look like is it extensible is it
extensible can you add integration
points so what we do have is a library
concept so if you let's say talk to a
web service and you want to reuse that
piece of code in different scripts then
you can lapse it into a library and
reference it again and again from
different scripts what we currently do
not allow is that you kind of mix and
match C sharp and touch develop code
that's the interesting idea we haven't
really thought about it yet so I'm in
the phone we are a third-party
application and we are bound to all the
rules and we can't just drop a dll and
start using it it has to be in the
manifest it led to the force that is to
as you lose it would have to be then a
standalone up and no longer purely phone
development okay it is a call out to a
web service right so you grieve lament
your library's web service of yes my
calls after then so the comet is set you
can always implement extra functionality
as a web service in deeds for example
one of the students there's a face
recognition he actually the face
recognition he didn't implement it on
the phone he he was using an existing
server side implementation so and we do
support HTTP request and JSON parsing
and XML parsing so you can definitely
interact with with all the rich web api
is out there
is it possible to extreme
music
this is possible to stream data to some
extent yes we have built-in support for
you get the video and you can open you
can open a video stream and then the the
native phone player will kick in and
play that on your wheel song and place
in the background too we don't we don't
support that in the API okay
then thank you very much for staying
here this is the conclusion of the
