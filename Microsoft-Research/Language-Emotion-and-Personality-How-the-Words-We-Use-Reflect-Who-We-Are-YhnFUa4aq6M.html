hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
it's a it's an honor to to to have
hosted Jamie Pennebaker in his second
round that's being a visiting researcher
at Microsoft Research we came last year
for a brief fir time and this year East
he's been here for a little bit longer
so he's had a little bit more time to
dig in on some interesting projects
along his lines of interest jamie is
there region Centennial professor of
psychology at UT Austin I should say you
must in Texas at Austin in case people
don't know what UT is like this is also
at the yoga slope you know a Toronto
people in the audience here at Microsoft
Research and he's a social psychologist
he studies how natural language reflects
people social and psychological states
he explores the links between words that
we would think just fly by he removed
from our studies function words stop
words their importance in language and
how they can be studied to give us
insights about personality intelligence
thinking styles social relationships
status power deception and other emotion
related behaviors and he's a highly
cited social scientist and his most
recent book is the secret life of
pronouns what our words say about us and
I have to say since meeting Jamie
hearing his talks and reading his work
you might notice that my email has
changed a bit in terms of power
relationships implied I'm just teasing
but go Timmy okay thank you by the way
they're a bunch of seats up here so oh
yeah it's gonna do this my first oh
that's right I'm not using any slides
but I know this is going to be a shock
what I wanted this to be more of a
discussion and to discuss today about
the nature of real-world language it's
important to appreciate that I'm coming
at the nature of language
from a completely different perspective
than a computer scientist and very often
if you've ever talked with a
psychologist a research psychologist you
may have had this experience that the
two of you talked past each other in
each of you are thinking what in the
world is this person talking about don't
they understand anything and let me
assure you the psychologist is thinking
the same thing what I'd like to do is to
give you a sense of my perspective as a
social psychologist and having spent now
a lot of time with computer scientists I
have a better I have a good appreciation
of your perspective and one of the
central differences in our perspectives
is you have been trained to think about
trying to think about the real world in
terms of what accounts for the most
variance you're great at classifying
your machine learning is one of the most
exciting tools around however what
machine learning does is it doesn't
really tell you why a person is using
language or doing what they're doing
it's not it's not a device aimed at
understanding why people do what they do
I come from the perspective if trying to
figure out what makes people tick and I
don't care about how much variance I'm
accounting for and in fact that the real
advance I think is this melding of these
two professions of both trying to
understand what's what makes a person
the way they are and what's driving them
but also coming at it from how can we
optimize this and I think that there
should be more of an interaction between
computer scientists and social
psychologists because they're just a
natural connection and also I say social
psychologists because that's what I am
but there are other types of
psychologists as well as cognitive
psychologists and others so a little bit
of background I a social psychologist is
somebody who studies interactions group
group behaviors and and other things
like that I when I began my career I was
interested in in the MA in mind-body
issues what makes why do people get sick
when they do how do they perceive their
bodies and so forth and I had done a
number of studies on this
and I was putting together a book and it
occurred to me you know how to just get
people a general questionnaire to find
out who reports physical symptoms and
this was a really different type of
project for me and I got together three
students of mine and I said I want us to
come up with a questionnaire and you can
ask people all right the idea is ask
people whatever you want what do you
think would be interesting to know about
people so we started generating
questions we asked what you know
questions about what they ate what their
relationships with other people how they
got along with their parents and one of
the students in my group said how about
this did you ever have a traumatic
sexual experience prior to the age of 17
and I thought sure that sounds good so
we stuck that on and then we passed this
out to about 800 students and we found
that about 15% reported having had a
traumatic sexual experience prior to the
age of 17 now here's what was
interesting this was a 12 page
questionnaire this is back when you
actually handed out pieces of paper and
that one question was related to every
health problem we had on on the
questionnaire and about this time I was
contacted by a magazine that was very
popular at the time Psychology Today and
they were doing a study a an article on
physical symptoms and they called me
because that's what I was doing research
on and they were gonna do a survey in
the magazine that people would mail mail
back so you can see this is in the old
days this was not a random sample but
they got 24,000 people responding to
this question questionnaire and one of
the questions I had on the question and
that one was the sexual trauma question
that we found 22% of women 11% of men
report in heaven having had a traumatic
sexual experience prior to the age of 17
and those who endorsed it were 2 to 3
times more likely to have been
hospitalized for any cause the previous
year they're more likely to been
diagnosed with high blood pressure
cancer coal's flus every everything that
we asked and I started to come
fascinated by this why is it that people
who report this question have so many
health problems so we did we started
doing more surveys
what we found was it wasn't a sexual
trauma per se it was having any kind of
major upheaval in your life that you
kept secret there was one thing about a
traumatic sexual experience unlike most
other traumas almost everybody who had
had one kept it secret and this started
to make me wonder does holding a secret
a major secret is that a major is that
possible that that is kind of the toxic
age and in fact we did some surveys
finding that if you found two people if
one who who had had the same kind of
trauma who both said it was equally
traumatic and one they had confided in
others and the others hadn't the person
who had not confided it was far more
likely to get sick and then this led me
to the next part of my career where we
had people come in the lab and had them
divulge secrets we had them write about
emotional upheavals and so he would do
these studies we bring people in they'd
be randomly assigned to write about one
of two conditions in one condition we
asked them to write about the most
traumatic upsetting experience of their
lives and the other half were asked to
write about superficial topics and we
had them write for 4 days 15 minutes
each it was a powerful experiment these
students wrote about horrific stories
and what we discovered was those people
who were asked write about traumatic
experience experiences in the months
afterwards went to the student health
center at about half the rate as people
in our control conditions and this study
that first study was published in the
mid-80s and then we started to do some
other studies and another lab started to
do other studies and by now there's
probably between three and four hundred
studies that have been published using
this method is called the expressive
writing method and it's been shown to be
linked to improvements in physical
health mental health people do better in
college afterwards they do their it it's
shown to have a profound effect on
people's emotional state their
relationships with others and so forth
but the question that started to bug me
in the early 90s was why does writing
make such a difference and there had
been a number of studies trying to test
various models and
they all kind of came out and one thing
that occurred to me it was wouldn't it
be interesting just to go in and to
analyze what they had actually written
can you tell who's gonna benefit from
writing by just looking at the way they
put their story together now at the time
the first thing I did was to rely on
judges nowadays I would have used some
kind of crowdsourcing
but this crowdsourcing what was
basically some graduate students in
clinical psychology a few clinicians we
had them read these stories and we in
some of our projects we would get the
people whose health improved we call
that group X and we have another group
of people who wrote and health whose
help did not improve we call that group
Y and then I'd say gives give them a
group of essays from group X and group Y
and asked what's the difference well the
thing about this is if you ask people to
write to read traumatic stories what it
does is it depresses them and so here's
a here we discovered a technique that
first of all was not very reliable that
just judges didn't agree very well I
took forever it was expensive and it
depressed the people who were doing it
this is not an efficient way to student
to build a career so it occurred to me I
had taken for training college I've
always been interested in in in at least
low-level programming and it occurred to
me maybe we just need a computer program
that could analyze language and
initially I started calling friends
around the country asking them who who
has a program like this because it seems
obvious that there should be such a
program and I couldn't find anybody so
working with one of my graduate students
who actually had been a computer science
major as an undergraduate
we built a program called Luke Li WC
linguistic inquiry in word-count
a remarkably stupid program by by your
standards I hope you were horrified how
simple this program was the idea was I
wanted to come up with a method by which
to go into any given text and calculate
the percentage of words that were
positive emotion words negative emotion
words anger words sadness words etc but
also cognitive words words it told us
that people were thinking in certain
kinds of ways and also words that would
get at some specific topics and there
were certain theories that were hot at
the time and I wanted to be sure to to
capture those but then we would get
groups of judges to generate words we
get words from the sources and elsewhere
and we would come up with lists of words
and each word was judged by multiple
people so it was a it was a human based
system what we discovered oh and as long
as we were doing this we also through in
other words including various common
things like pronouns prepositions
articles and so forth and what we
discovered early on was there were
certain classes of words that seem to
predict health improvement one was we
found that for example use of positive
emotion words the more positive emotion
whereas a person used in a in a in their
writing the more their health improved
so if they'd had a traumatic experience
and they can still use words like joy
love happiness they were much better off
than if they didn't and ironically even
if they said I'm not happy this
experience gives me no joy the saying
you're not happy is a predictor of
getting better as opposed to saying sad
in other words if a person is not happy
they're still thinking along this
dimension of happiness and negations by
the way or very interesting but we're
not going to get into that today life's
too short but another dimension that we
found on that first run was that
cognitive words a cognitive words
included words like because cause effect
causal words and in sight words
understand realize no and etc the people
who increased in their use of these
cognitive words over time benefited
whereas people who did not increase over
time did not and the effect sizes for
the cognitive words was much much bigger
than the emotion words
and using some other analyses a little
bit later is when I briefly got into the
the LSA the latent semantic analysis
world what we also discovered was that
there were that certain classes of
pronouns predicted improvement and
basically these what we found was that
people who flipped back and forth
between using first person singular
pronouns I me and my and other pronouns
like he she they you even we and going
back and forth between those no
particular order was associated with
improved health whereas people who wrote
using pronouns in the same way across
those four days did not improve and the
effect sizes were quite big and this and
these were averaging across multiple
studies I'm gonna tell you the reason is
a great question how about this what we
think it was was changing in perspective
it's a marker perspective switch and
it's very similar to what a therapist
would do a pass we do this if you went
in if I went into a therapist and I said
you know I'm having problems with my
relationship with my wife she does this
she does this she does this Yunus then a
therapist would say stop how about you
how do you feel and if I went in I say
I'm having trouble with my wife and I
feel this I feel that I feel this the
therapist would say stop tell me about
your wife what's your watch perspective
and what what this is doing is that
people who naturally can do this are the
people who seem to benefit more quickly
now about this time I was also it was a
very interesting time because the mid
90s were a time mid to late nineties
were a time where the internet came of
age all of a sudden I was had access to
data that I've never had before in
digital form and I'd start downloading
it every night I'd come home and I just
download data and one of my favorite
places was AOL again this for some of
you this is this has meaning for some of
you this house wow that sounds like
history I read about that somewhere
but there were these AOL chat groups
that were fabulous
in any case I just didn't I'd analyze
the data using my computer program and I
became interested in sex differences and
because we all have an intuitive sense
of how men and women talk and what I I
would download this and I analyze it and
it came out backwards from everything I
thought and I did what all good
scientist too I ignored it because it
can't be true as a fluke and then you
know a few weeks later I do another
download and analyze it came out
backwards flukes these things happen
and I did this several times before I
started to think you know maybe I should
just line up all of my studies and see
how men and women are already are
behaving and what I discovered were some
really striking differences now before I
tell you those differences another side
issue I was on my way to give a talk
somewhere and I had just bought a book
by George Miller called the science of
words science of words was was
interesting because he made a
distinction in it that I'd never heard
of by the way I have no linguistics
training I don't understand linguistics
it's a and I tried by God I did try but
it just was not a field that I could
ever rep my head around but Miller was
interesting because he started to break
words down in ways that made sense and
one was this profound difference between
what he called content words and
function words content words are
essentially nouns regular verbs and
adjectives and most adverbs these are
content when we're when you're having a
substantive conversation with somebody
these are the words that your brain is
processing our the average person in
this room has a book has a vocabulary of
between fifty and a hundred thousand
words of which at fifty and a hundred
thousand words all of which are content
were
except for a small group of other words
called function words and function words
are pronouns I me you he she it
prepositions to of four articles ano
thei conjunctions and or but negations
no not never and selected adverbs that
don't have any direct reference like so
very really words such as that now
what's interesting about all of these is
that these function words there's only
five hundred in English and no matter
what other languages you speak
you have function words as well and they
account for a minor a very small part of
vocabulary and what's interesting is
even though there's very few of these
function words they account for over
half of the words that we use what I've
said so far 55% of the words I've said
so far I've been counting have been
function words now in the next few
minutes you're going to start listening
to what I'm saying you're going to start
paying attention to the function words
and you're going to give up really
quickly because your brain can't process
them they come in first of all in terms
of speed they come in at crimeans speed
and secondly if you start paying
attention to these function words you
can't hear what I'm saying and this is
what's so interesting these words are
there for everybody why are they there
well there's shortcuts and they're also
words that shape what I'm saying is some
very interesting ways that I'll tell you
in just a second and the other issue is
function words and content words are
processing the brain very differently so
for example there are two areas that
we've long known to be relevant to be
related to language and they're
particularly interesting in looking at
brain damage one the two areas are for
almost everybody in this room on the
left side of your brain even if you're
left-handed and the one that's about
right here in the temporal lobe is
called Verna keys area and the one
that's right up here is in the frontal
lobe and is called Broca's area
if there's damage to the frontal lobe
and Broca's area is damaged the way the
person speaks is really slow and
hesitatingly so hesitating so if I asked
a person with Broca's damage to describe
this up here the person might say podium
wire computer screen and it would be a
pretty boring conversation and also with
a great deal of hesitancy and the person
also would be clearly lacking in social
skills which is interesting in terms of
the frontal lobe is associated with
fronts which objects are named with
someone with damage to Broca's area is
in an order that would reflect some sort
of correct syntactic constructions such
as yeah that's a great question I don't
know I have no idea
Wow excellent question
damage to Verna keys area is interesting
because historically what they what is
it's generally described as a word salad
but if you listen to the salad here's
what it would be so if I asked a person
with the verdict is damaged to describe
this they say much like this oh yeah
sure
this is right here and next to that is
this and you can see that and right here
is this all of the words are function
words now what's interesting function
words are social they require social
skills to use so for example let's say
there's a piece of paper in the room and
I come and I'm the first one in the room
I pick up the piece of paper and it says
I'm not here I'll be right back does
that note make sense well yeah kind of
but on another level it makes absolutely
no sense because it's on the floor it
might it might have just blown in from
somewhere else and it doesn't make sense
because I who's I will will implies
future tense when was it written be back
back does this mean back here or was it
where was the note actually from in
other words
these words are words that only have
meaning between the speaker and listener
at one particular point in time in a
particular location and even if we found
the author of that note a year from now
and we gave the note to the author and
asked what did this mean the author
might say I have no idea now here's
what's interesting as you start looking
at these function words they start to
tell us who people are and it was
interesting it was only these function
words that we were finding differences
between males and females males and
females generally including downloading
things were by and large talking about
similar topics not completely but
similar but their use of these function
words are profoundly different so for
example I'm not even going to ask you
this because it'll just embarrass you
and if it makes you feel any better I've
embarrassed people at Stanford at
Harvard at Cambridge at junior colleges
at the people who've been best admitted
people in old age homes which is
actually I find both interesting and a
little disturbing although it's good for
me but there but the point is ok so so
here would be the test I would give you
who uses the word I more men or women
well the answer is women overwhelmingly
across almost all contexts who uses wee
words more men and women of course you
all know it's wimp as women but of
course it's not because I wouldn't be
asking it there's no difference articles
a and envy you would guess women but you
have no idea in fact it's men
overwhelmingly who uses emotion words
more you would probably say women you'd
be wrong and there's no difference
cognitive words words like because cause
effect words such as that you would
think men again you'd be wrong it's
women and who uses social words more
he/she they we etc you would guess women
and thank God you got one right
and the mistakes you would make are
exactly the ones I made when I started
as well and then starting to go in and
analyze this more it's important to know
that function words tell us where people
are paying attention so pronouns tell us
where people are paying attention now
most people would think that the reason
people think menus i more words more is
because they think well manner
self-centered they're arrogant etc well
they might be self-centered and arrogant
but that doesn't mean that's where
they're paying attention I means you're
looking inward you're looking it's it's
a self focus and women are more self
focused than men and as we've done
studies and others have now as well
anything that causes you to pay
attention to sell to your body boosts
the rate of your using the word I so for
example people who are physically sick
use I'd much more than people who are
not physically sick people who are
depressed use I words more than people
who are not depressed and and we words
are interesting there's no difference
there because there's two types of we
words once we word type is you and me
together holding hands it's beautiful
and women actually do use that kind of
we'd more but the other kind of way is
the we which means it's the kind of way
I use with my graduate students well
guys we need to analyze this data
differently
that's and that does not mean we're
gonna hold hands analyzing their data
together it's essentially shortcut for
you and males males use that kind of we
much much more add if you cannot
determine who the referent is it is
probably a male it's also interestingly
that it when you can't figure out who
the referent is and we the person's
being deceptive and you what you can do
is actually look at politicians
politicians use we all the time and the
more the politician uses we the more you
should be nervous and let's see-oh
cognitive words are always fun cognitive
words are interested well let's do
cognitive and article articles males use
used articles at much higher race a and
NZ and the reason is you only use
articles in front of or almost always in
terms of concrete objects or things so
if you are if you are talking about
carburetors or a you know a certain
computer chip you are going to use lots
of articles however if you if you are
talking about more social things you
don't use articles and in fact that's
the big difference males generally talk
more about objects and things and women
tend to talk more about people
that's why females tend to use social
words more and what's interesting is is
that when you're talking about people
people are far more complex than objects
and things we'd like to think rocket
science is the most complex thing that's
ridiculous human beings are far more
complex than a rocket you can get the
best scientists in the world and predict
how this group of ten randomly people
randomly selected people are going to
behave in the next room over the next
three weeks you can't do it it's whereas
you can do that with really good
scientists predicting the rocket the the
point is is that when males and or when
people are talking about relationships
they have to use much more cognitive
words why is it that Joe is interested
in Sally when everybody
know that she's the terrible person for
him and you're starting to use believes
think understand cause and effect
whereas when you're talking about
carburetor carburetor broken stand yep
so the point is is that that men and
women are using language different now I
want to make it clear I don't really
care about differences between men and
women I'm using this more as an example
of how we can start to think about these
words as reflecting thinking now my real
interest over the last several years has
been to look at the nature of language
and especially function words across
three domains the first is essentially
personality dimensions the second is
kind of situational dimensions no less
are looking at it in terms of social
processes and I'll talk about each of
these briefly
the first is trying to understand the
differences or how we can get a sense of
people's personalities by the way they
use words and we started this actually
it wasn't a personality project but it
was actually the first a study that I
did that was that we're trying to get at
since that who people are and this was
looking at who commits suicide and we
were looking at poets poets commit
suicide at incredibly high rates is that
it's probably the most dangerous
profession in on earth if you're a
published poet so what we did was we we
got a small group of suicide poets who
committed suicide and a control group of
poets that we matched in terms of him
when they were born age sex education
and so forth this study was only about
16 people as I recall so eight in each
condition and we analyzed their poetry
and I was honestly because this was
before I had really gotten into any of
this research I was thinking well this
will be easy because the people who are
going to commit suicide are going to
talk a lot about death they're going to
be more depressed and so forth
the only difference we found was the use
of the word I that suicidal poets used
the word I
much higher raised in non-suicidal poets
they didn't differ in terms of negative
emotion words they didn't differ in
terms of death related words either so
it's quite interesting that this one
damn it this one feature the use of I
was so different and it's important to
appreciate I words are fairly high base
rate word in natural conversation and
probably even in poetry I is the most
common word used by people in which is
probably around 4% of all the words we
use I then got involved working with
some clinicians and we did a series of
studies looking at people who were
clinically depressed who previously
didn't print depressed and people who
were not depressed looking at how they
wrote essays on coming to college and
again the people who are depressed use I
words the most people who were not
depressed use I words the least and
people who had been depressed but we're
not now we're somewhere in between we've
also looked at this as a I've been
called several times to do an analysis
of a person in terms of did they really
commit suicide and the most interesting
case was the analysis of a Australian
explorer who Henry Hellyer who died
mysteriously in 1840s and the big
question was did he commit suicide or
was he murdered
and there were a lot of his writings
were available and what was interesting
was by looking at his writings what we
found was in the years and months as he
got closer to death his use of I spiked
just prior to his death which suggests
very strongly that it would probably be
suicide now we've also looked at this in
terms of other individual differences
let's see where to submit some others a
one thing that we've been doing a lot of
work on recently is thinking style can
you get a sense of how people think we
recently so recently we did a this
project where we analyzed the admissions
essays for people who have been as
accepted in the University of Texas this
is this was 25
five thousand students each person had
to write two essays and with what we did
was to go through and and these were
people a few years back so we could
track their grade point average over
four years and what we did is we went
through and we looked at these eight
dimensions of function words and what we
were able to do is to come up with the
psychometrics of function words are
gorgeous
so I spend a lot of time in the world of
psychometrics and articles and
prepositions are positively correlated
with each other
I'm sorry psychometrics means can when
you're coming up with a scale you want
to find out is this scale internally
consistent in other words does each part
of this scale measure the construct
you're trying to get at so an SAT test
for example you would hope that all 40
questions let's say we're looking at the
math part all 40 questions are at least
somewhat related to the other questions
and that each question is related to the
sum of all the other questions because
you're trying to get at this coherent
construct of intelligence and the same
thing is true for personality and so
forth so what we find is that articles
and prepositions are both positively
correlated with each other they go in
the same direction or use articles for
more use prepositions these other six
dimensions that we're focusing on
personal pronouns and personal pronouns
adverbs auxilary verbs etc those are all
internally correlated with each other as
well and those six are negatively
correlated with articles and
prepositions meaning we could turn these
oh you know we can reverse score all of
these and all of them are are correlated
with each other they're all getting at
the same general concept of what I we
call a thinking style and we're calling
this thinking style a categorical
dynamic index and this categorical
dynamic index means the higher you score
on it that it's more use articles and
prepositions unless you use these other
things the more you are categorizing the
world the more you are lick
the world in a logical formal
hierarchical way at the other end people
who are using lots of pronouns auxilary
verbs conjunctions and so forth these
people are looking at the world in much
more of a narrative way they're telling
stories and it's really quite
interesting so you can go in and pull
out the top scorers and you read these
essays and the essays are not very
frankly very interesting I want to come
to the there are three reasons I want to
attend the University of Texas the first
is there computer science department is
very
Hull's great promise in my in my inches
follow the law and then you pull out the
top the bottom ones of this dimension
and it'll say the reason I've been
interested in computer science was
because when I was five years old my
family moved from Oklahoma to Tennessee
and on the way this happiness you know
where they're telling a story and you're
thinking wow what a great story and then
you look and see how these people do in
college and the correlation between this
CDI score and four-year GPA is about a
point to correlation and a point to
correlation predicting four years later
is really pretty remarkable so the
higher than the the more formal the the
more you're using these categorical
words the better you do in college
telling stories you're screwed and and
this is true by the way if you're in
fine arts if you're in physics if you're
in it makes no different what field you
are the higher you are in categorical
thinking the better you do and one
reason is all the tests whether you're
in fine arts English in any area of
science whatever are they're asking you
to to analyze to think logically they're
not asking you for this test could you
tell me a story about protons so it's it
so so this is what American and probably
world education is to think in logical
formal ways now what's interesting is
CDI is also highly stable in other words
it's almost a personality dimension and
we recently we've been using this as a
marker of using it for author
identification and with one of my
graduate students we just published an
article on the discovery of a or it's
been discovered a long time but it deals
with a book by it's been thought or ply
thought to have been by Shakespeare
scholars have been arguing about this
particular play for the last 300 years
so Shakespeare died in the early sixteen
hundreds a hundred years later a guy by
the name of John Tebow in London claimed
he had discovered three manuscripts
written by Shakespeare and that he now
had put them together and come up with
and had a new play that was called
double falsehood and in fact the story
matched one that was they knew existed
that had been presented in the early
1600s and so for this ever since the
early 1700s scholars have been fighting
whether or not this was a real play by
Shakespeare or not so we simply went in
and analyzed all of Shakespeare's work
all of t-bo's work and there's the
evolved and then there's another guy
john fletcher who had actually
co-written a couple of plays by
Shakespeare and using CDI and also some
of both we use both machine learning and
some of the some other method men
methods actually used multiple methods
and all of them we showed this play
really does have the fingerprint of
Shakespeare and there's a little bit of
fingerprint of john fletcher in the last
two acts which actually is very similar
to two of the other plays that we know
that fletcher and shakespeare
collaborated on but the point is is even
using this kind of metric this this
categorical thinking metric is
interesting because it it's telling us
differences between people
now personality is one issue it's also
interesting to look at how people's
language changes as a function of big
you know events in their lives can we
tell your cycle what's going on in your
life by the way you're using language
and in fact we can get a sense we know
for example the old the older you get
there are certain changes in the way you
use words so for example as you get
older and again this goes opposite of
what I think most people here would it
predicted certainly it's different what
I predicted the older you get the more
people use positive emotion words and
the less they use negative emotion words
the older you get the more you use
future tense and the less you use past
tense yes that's a great know that's a
good question is it just this survival I
think not you know you know our samples
are sufficiently large and diverse oh
and I I can tell you why the answer is
no because we also analyzed texts from
authors including Shakespeare who wrote
over a large part of their lives and
they showed the same pattern so as they
got older they use more positive emotion
words fewer negative emotion words fewer
eye words more wee words more
cognitively complex words as you get
older which kind of makes sense when
you're young you know you're in your
teens your 20s your emotional life is
going up and down like crazy as you got
older you know you know it's just like
this hey but it's all great
kids are gone yeah this is life simple
of course they I'm sure they're you know
the nature of our statistics we don't
look at that but of course there are so
there's you know all of this make it
please understand I'm speaking in
generalization so in everything I've
told you most of the people are going to
the majority of people probably go to
the way that I'm telling you but there's
always some that are not and maybe the
ones who aren't changing they're gonna
die see we've also been interested in
looking at specific events so for
example we looked after at 9/11 we had
about a thousand bloggers who were heavy
users of livejournal comm and we had
these people to be in our study they had
to post on average at least every other
day and what we were able to track was
what happened to this sample on 9/11 and
many of the things you would expect so
immediately afterwards there's a drop in
positive emotion words an increase in
negative emotion words now what's
interesting is is how long do emotions
last and what we found was once nine
would have been hit
by the way we had data for four months
two months before 9/11 two months
afterwards so we have a really stable
baseline what happened is the media
after 9/11 you get a big increase in
negative emotions and it takes about 11
days before they get back to baseline
positive emotion words were very
different positive emotion words there's
a big drop and it comes up very quickly
and by day four there at baseline and
day five they're above baseline and they
stay above baseline for the next two
months an interesting irony 9/11 and I
think this is true for many major events
is associated with long term positive
emotions and why would that be because
it brings the culture together it's a
social phenomenon so one thing we looked
at was the use of the word we what you
find at 9/11 is there's a huge drop in I
and and remember I told you I was
associated with depression
people are not depressed there's a
difference between depression and being
said there is a drop in I and a huge
increase in we and this increase in we
it went up and then within a couple of
weeks it came back down but it didn't
come down to baseline and in fact over
the next two months it remained above
baseline so upheavals are interesting
because they do foster social
interactions with others we've also been
interested in how you can use language
to track threat so for example we looked
at we've been interested in and can you
predict if a leader is going to go to
war there been lots of leaders that have
attacked others and one of the
interesting ones was George Bush and
going to war with Iraq and what you can
what we did was to analyze all this
press conferences just his language and
press conferences and bush unlike the
Presidents before and after him spoke to
the press a huge amount which from a
data perspective is fabulous and what
you find with him was his use of AI
words were pretty constant up until
August of 2002 and all of a sudden his
use of AI words dropped from about four
percent to two percent now that's by the
way that's a huge huge drop and it
stayed at that level until after we went
to war about eight months later in I
guess it was February or March of 2003
and then it gradually came back now I
became curious so by the way I didn't
tell you about deception when people lie
they tend to stop using AI they tend to
be they start distancing themselves and
by the way we went and looked at other
leaders who have threatened and gone to
war and we found this same general
pattern there's a drop in AI and I think
part of it is is that if a leader is
thinking seriously of attacking they
they're holding their cards they don't
want to convey what they're doing now
we've done the same thing in looking at
the tweets of the Boston bomber the one
who has just been convicted and what we
found with
was he was using Twitter he is Twitter
at a very good rate and his rates of
using I was about I think was around
seven or eight percent and in October
about mid-october his drop his use of I
words and all his tweets dropped to a
very low level in the state that way all
the way till the the actual balmy and I
would submit that that is probably when
he made a decision to to join his
brother in in the bombing the point is
is that it's interesting to start using
these kinds of signals to get a sense of
people's psychological state one other
let me make another kind of side note
here in the computer science world there
is a huge interest in sentiment analysis
and sentiment analysis has generally
thought of as emotions the idea that you
can tell a person or a group emotional
state by looking at the use of emotion
words this makes sense on one level in
that it seems like that would which is
just common sense but it's not it
doesn't make sense from a psychologists
perspective because language did not
evolve to express emotions through words
in because emotions are expressed often
through actions tone of voice and so
forth that emotions are also expressed
through these through through these
function words so for example if I'm
angry at you I may not say the word
angry at all and I can read your email
and I can tell you're pissed even though
you don't say the word angry it's
leaking out through these other
dimensions and in fact we do a pretty
good job at I identify an emotional
state in fact we do just about as well
and sometimes better taking an emotional
state by looking at function words as
opposed to just emotion words so that
the two types of information are really
important so sentiment analysis really
is more than just or should be a lot
more than just emotion words yeah
here's the so you mentioned that when
people are lying they start to you the I
a lot less you also mentioned way back
and you connect that is keeping a
traumatic experience secret was March
with a market indicator of sort of like
future health problems and that people
use I more often tend to have those bad
apples oh well there's we're juggling
different issues here when a person is
actively holding back something holding
a big secret and not telling another
person they will use I less in other
words they are and this is what's so
intriguing is there's a lot of work on
the links between self-deception and
other deception and one of the one model
right now is that they're really kind of
the same things so if I if I've had a
major upheaval and I don't want you to
know about it our interactions are going
to get stilted because I'm not going to
say much about me I'm also going to be
thinking about that event quite a bit
and I'm not going to be paying much
attention to you and so and this fits in
with they've now been dozens of studies
looking at the nature of deception and
language and across multiple studies the
general pattern and I should tell you
there's some interesting weirdness about
deception because there's so many
different types of deception so
deception writing a yelp review is
different from deception in terms of
interpersonal me lying to you or vice
versa in the more personally made lying
to you and also the criminal
investigation world deceptions markers
are low use of I another one is lack of
complexity in language one of the
dimensions of complexity are what we
call exclusive words where it's like
except without but and it turns out that
when you're lying it's almost impossible
to use those words because these
exclusive words are making a distinction
between what is in a category and what's
not in the category this is in it but
not that and if I
ask you what were you doing last
Saturday night and you did something
that was illegal and under policemen
asking you you're gonna say oh well I
did this and I did that and then my
friend he he did this and I and then we
went here and we did that if I'm telling
the truth
I'll say well I went to the store I was
going to get this but then I realized I
forgot this but then I did this but then
I didn't do that
in other words I'm saying what I did do
and didn't do and if you're lying
it just becomes way too complexity to
just say what you didn't do because you
didn't do any of it so exactly so now
this brings us to this last issue about
so these are some of the situational
factors one of the issues that's also
interesting is looking at social factors
for example can we look at social
relationships through the nature of
language and function words and one of
the things I've been intrigued with is
the nature of status who's got higher
versus lower status and one thing that
we've discovered is the relative use of
I it's a really powerful marker in any
interaction the person who's the higher
status uses the word I less the opposite
of what you think and the person who is
lower status uses the word I more and I
started we first did this project with
emails and then we did it with
experiments where we would manipulate
status and other other ones where we
just have people come and talk and then
we analyzed letters that we had access
to in terms of people in in the military
high versus low rank and so forth and
you can take this to the bank and I was
looking at our very first project with
email interesting well that's the
interesting like I've been it's not true
for me though because I love everybody
you know everybody's equal and so I
looked at my data and it was just like
everybody else's and what
happen is the an undergraduate right me
dear dr. Pennebaker I am so-and-so and I
was wondering if I could meet you
because I'd like to talk about so-and-so
and that I write back dear student thank
you so much for your email how about
next Tuesday that seems like that would
work and then I I look at my email to
the Dean dear Dean I'm Jamie Pennebaker
I don't know if I can do this I can do
that and then the Dean writes back dear
Jamie thank you so much for your email
better than now what's interesting about
this is nobody is putting anybody down
it there this is not some kind of nasty
stuff this is the language of power and
status in our culture now here's an
interesting issue I've talked about this
finding to two groups everywhere and
Americans often come up to me afterward
and say wow I didn't realize I was using
language this way I'm gonna stop using I
and my emails and I always think oh
that's kind of interesting and then I
spoke to a group and there was a a guy
who was from China and he came up and he
said wow that was a great talk I now
realize I need to start using AI words
more in my email and I was thinking this
guy gets it because if someone if I'm
the high status person and somebody else
is low status person and they send me an
email and they are trying to you know
say I'm you know I've got a lot of power
that that kind of puts me off if they
come to me and they basically they are
being more genuine that that works
because that's what a natural
interaction is so it's very interesting
how we as a culture interpret these
finding you wouldn't believe how many
emails I get where people will not use I
once and then I'll have a PS at the
bottom it took me 30 minutes to write
this email because you know I wanted to
not use I also by the way if you feel
self-conscious talking to me forget it I
can't hear it send it send it to me but
send me what you want to say by text and
then I
put in my computer program but but I
can't hear it yeah it's very similar
there are of course some differences but
in terms of the general patterns it
everything holds up pretty much the same
yeah okay so so the coat so we've done
cultural studies and we're finding the
same general patterns in terms of status
depression kind of the major things
we've looked at sex differences they
hold up in in every culture we've looked
at so far so and we've looked at it in a
lot of different way so our computer
program Luke we've got got it in about
15 different languages and the languages
that are most disparate from English
that we've looked at have been Chinese
Hungarian which is disparate from every
damn language there is and we've done
all the European languages Russian but
the patterns hold up
remarkably similarly that's right
however that's right however so several
languages still have articles but every
language can distinguish between the cup
from a cup and and but different
languages bounced around that so in in
in Chinese if you say cup it means a cup
so there's you don't need a but if you
meant that cup there's some word for
that or this particular cup so they all
exist but it's true every culture has
some interesting subtle differences in
function words that I think says a lot
about the culture itself let me go
through two more things really quickly
I've gone on already much more longer
than I usually do in terms of these
social dynamics a second issue beyond
status is
trying to get a sense of can you get a
sense of how two people are connecting
with one another this is a Cortana kind
of issue as well and the question is is
how do you know if two people are
clicking they're connecting well one
thing we've come up with is a metric
that we call language style matching or
LSM and we essentially calculate a score
in terms of how similar the two people
are using pronouns prepositions articles
conjunctions and so forth and you come
up with a very simple metric and what
you find is that more the two are
matching the more they're on the same
page so for example we did an analysis
of speed dating and speed dating is
glorious I from a researchers
perspective where we've analyzed the
language of the two people now what we
find is that we can predict who will go
out on a subsequent date at rates higher
than the people themselves and you're
thinking well that's not possible
well it is possible because there's a
lot of people who one person says yeah
this would be great and the other person
is saying are you kidding they would
have low style matching it's only when
the two people both both are on the same
page we've also looked at a separate
study with eighty second eighty six
dating couples among college freshmen
freshmen dating couples are great to
study because they're really unstable
you know basically you need variance and
and we get these and to be in our study
they had to do instant messaging to I am
quite a bit and they had to agree to
give us ten days or nine days of their
IMS and what we found was the greater
their style matching the more likely
they were to be together three months
later in fact those who are above the
mean the above the average eighty
percent were still dating three months
later those that were below the mean
only fifty percent we're still dating
now so so that's the this style matching
work we've also been using this in terms
of small groups so so I teach a giant
introductory online class course of
about it between around fifteen hundred
students and we break the students ever
into small groups or every other day and
every time they're in a different group
and one thing that we can do is we can
assess the degree to which they week
induce language style matching across
them and find out the degree to which
they're on the same page and what we're
trying to now figure out is can we
manipulate the group because we're
monitoring the group constantly and we
can now give the group feedback in terms
of are you all in the same page you're
not paying attention to one another and
and and other ways of manipulating this
working well together for a couple that
might be together what do you say about
not just be the matching but the nature
that's that well that's our problem are
our groups are not we don't allow them
to stay together so each time is very
different
oh I words function words it's not just
in style matching zag imagine what works
on both sides buttons are no well what's
interesting with the couple's it doesn't
really matter so if the two couples
aren't if both of them are not using
aye-aye words that's fine you know
they're both probably geeks talking
about this program that they're working
on but that's but that's beautiful and
then there are other people who are you
know one who's really self-obsessed the
other one's self obsessed that's
beautiful no and by the but and by the
way these are kind of first analyses the
the so that's the that group data and
there was one other issue I had an
overhead I wouldn't have to oh yeah yeah
yeah and this is what starting to look
at communities and so looking at say
blogging communities what can we learn
about people in terms of their social
dynamics there and this actually gets at
this a little bit one of my former
students Cindy Chung did this
dissertation that was
it was just lovely what she did was to
look at diet.com she was interested in
diet blogs and one thing that's cool
about diet calm is people post their
weights whenever they they they post and
so what she can do is track them over
time to see who loses weight and she's
interested in can you tell the language
of weight losers versus those who don't
lose weight and in terms of the actual
language the more personal their writing
is the more likely they are to lose
weight but but there was one thing that
predicted weight loss far better than
anything and that was that was the
comments now I would have predicted most
of my colleagues in social psychology
would have predicted that the more
comments you receive the the more likely
you are to lose weight turns out it has
virtually no effect instead it's the
more comments you make on other people's
blogs the more you lose weight it's kind
of the difference between giving and
receiving that giving aid and support
seems to be much healthier than just
receiving it and there all sorts of
interesting theories that might explain
this and one of them is it's it it
suggests a greater commitment to the
community a greater perhaps commitment
to weight loss as well now what I've
done is given you a huge bunch of
results in a very very short time and
the time that I've spent here at MSR has
been honestly fabulous because I've
spoken with a number of you and and it's
the kind of work that's being done here
is breathtaking and from a social
psychologists perspective I think you
can start to see why I'm so excited
talking with people because you guys are
first of all have access to data that is
unbelievable and the questions you're
addressing are fascinating and many
perhaps most are at their very core
deeply social psychological questions
and this is why I think there's just a
natural affinity between our field
and I would urge you to to go outside
the computer science community God knows
I love the computer science community
but also go out and have lunch with a
social psychologist so I'm going to stop
here and open it up to questions
freshmen do you have any way to to
factor out the fact that some of them
may have spent enough time together that
they were starting to talk to like each
other
funny you should ask we I one of the
things I'm interested in and this is
what I called my linguistic drone
project which is okay that's right you
all have drones so that we can work
together can you can you identify a
person by the way they use function
words in terms of who they are hanging
around with and where they are in the
country so what we were able to do with
with this project because most these
people went to high schools in the state
of Texas and so what we were able to do
is I picked eight high schools that were
fairly similar in terms of social class
and analyzed any given group and to see
if I could how well I could pick a
particular person or group of people
here and would they be classified
correctly and I did better than chance
not great but so which tells me that the
people within a high school are probably
being taught in similar ways and and
they probably talked together and and
adopt a similar kind of language that
the signal is not very strong but but
there's something there yeah what I see
you deserve for very subtle and very
surprising just you do you have any
sense of other writers became fiction
writers who are good at creating a voice
that isn't their own are they doing that
mostly do content words or they just
have an intuitive understanding and we
to leverage this that is beyond what
else regular folks can do
well it's funny because someone I gave a
talk at the University of Toronto and
somebody asked that same question and I
remember answering because my wife's an
author I basically said oh well writers
you know clearly can get into the heads
building and then that that night I went
back and on my computer I actually had
some data and turns out I was wrong most
writers are really good at conveying
characters through content but they're
not as good through function words and
we've done analyses there's some authors
who are actually very good at conveying
the tone of the opposite sex but in
general most writers make their opposite
sex characters speak like their own
gender
also we've doesn't Micheline work on TED
talks that have been translated and we
find that the language of the TED talk
reflects the translator more than it
does the the actual speaker yeah yes
well I convey more and that kind of
makes sense from a social standpoint
where I mean my language is
communicating something to you does it
work on an internal yeah yeah yeah no it
we've done several studies on this
because it's a really important question
just language drive a psychological
state we've done these studies and it's
pretty easy to change people's language
by the way so we won't have
questionnaires and we'll have open-ended
questions saying tell us about your
first year in college here's what some
other people say and all the examples
are we or in the other condition all in
I and then they write what do you think
and people will write the way the other
people do it has no effect on any
seeing psychological that we've measured
so if you're depressed
st. changed your language that won't
make a difference however I think
language can serve it's more like a
speedometer so it's reflecting and it
can serve as a cue about how you're
doing so for example I've always thought
of this kind of experiment I've never
done it but I know if I sent you into a
room with a small group and I say okay
when you're in there don't use the word
I use words like we and so forth and I
don't think you'd be more or less likely
to become a leader however if I said
beforehand okay when you go in there I
want you to try to become the leader
really work at trying to do this if I
told you to do that you would do much
better than chance of becoming a leader
and your language would change in line
with what if leaders is so it's really
that it's the psychological state is
driving the language I think how you got
people to share secrets and have them
like did you promise they wouldn't be so
what so so here's the way these studies
work you know there's not many times in
our lives where you are given the
opportunity to really let go and explore
your deepest emotions and thoughts so
they come into the lab and they talk to
me or maybe a graduate student and I say
okay in this study we're asking people
to write about their deepest thoughts
and feelings and that's most upsetting
experiences in their lives and what I'd
like to have you do is write around you
know write about this and really let go
and explore your deepest thoughts and
feelings your name will never be linked
with what you're writing we won't share
your writing with with others except for
searchers it'll be it it will be
analyzed along with your questionnaires
but we really are interested in what
makes you tick and I would say over the
last I actually haven't done an
expressive writing study in a few years
but I'm sure I ran several thousand
people back
from the beginning and I know I can
think of one person who did not
participate ever virtually everybody
participates it was kind of like being
on an airplane where Elbasan you getting
this weird you're sitting next to
somebody you're both talking about
secrets yeah also sort of age of the
plane obviously this is incredibly cool
actually interesting how do we think
about bringing into our lives like my
roommate is dating this girl for four
years do I tell them to go like look at
their emails what do you think I think
the place to start using in interesting
ways is to try it yourself and I do not
think writing every day for the rest of
your life is healthy in fact I think
it's unhealthy
I view writing as kind of a life course
correction that every now and then and I
do this myself every few months every
year or so sometimes I'll just sit down
and sit down and write for you know a
day or two three days for 15 minutes a
day or 20 whatever exploring my deepest
thoughts and feeling in terms of what's
going on in my life right now and I
think it's a really powerful way to put
things in order because we don't usually
do that
no often we might have someone that
we're close to and we can talk to them
about some topics you can talk about and
then they have graduate and they're big
strong destructive elements
the Internet right people to people sort
of behave differently and the way they
express express things differently so
some of the things that we store in in
one of the projects that I was involved
in earlier is that the when you think
about proper nouns in for example people
who like I don't know the Daily Show on
friends right in in early 2000 but now
people with the same personality would
like some other thing they would not so
what what you're describing is the
distinction between content and style
content and function words I don't care
what you like your function words are
gonna be pretty similar and if you look
at the evolution of language function
words are really similar to
Shakespeare's time but if you look at
his content words geez it's that's why
it's so hard to read him but that the
reality is is and this is true over the
lifetime and this gets into some of the
issues that I've been doing here at MSR
which is can you identify personality
through things like twit Twitter or I'm
particularly just in search terms now
what you're suggesting is search terms
are going to change over the course of
you would think even two years the data
I've been analyzing man that's not true
at all there's some features that do
change but others are really remarkably
similar and if we looked at them over 10
years or 20 years you know there's gonna
be some changes but I've been bet that
the people who are interested in
celebrities today are gonna be
interested in celebrities 20 years from
now the related questions so when we try
to look at how people look at things and
sort of the words they use on Facebook
or Twitter versus what they did what
those the words are used for such they
are very different things because when
it comes to Twitter and and Facebook
there is also an element of portraying
particular persona right you don't use
the word that you will sort of use
thirty and you can sort of see that
there are certain types of topics which
never get tried I don't know exactly but
their function is you're gonna correlate
at least point three with each other so
their personality is still the same
whether they're doing one or the other
Ellucian question um maybe Twitter has a
lot of misspellings a lot of errors that
actually a stick and become away people
talk and I'm wondering how messy is the
input data usually and can you learn
anything from that messages this is a
statistical question if you're looking
at 1 million people who cares they're
you know it we can handle error error
errors error in terms of finding truth
is a function of sample size or number
of data points and as we get you know if
you're looking at a particular person or
a small group of people then these are
things that it starts to make a
difference but once we move to scale
that's not something that I personally
lose any sleep about because I've you
know I've analyzed data that was really
dirty and really clean the same data set
to see would my conclusions be
substantially different and I've never
found that to be the case expressive
writing is it important that it be sure
that they think it's going to be shared
and and our verbal confessions like what
you're doing with that psychologist you
know in treatment and therapy is that
service enroll is writing distinctly
different than therapists I think
they're very similar the difference is
when you're sharing with somebody else
you are there is a high threat there so
even talking to a therapist there are
some things that a lot of people won't
talk about it's just it's too
threatening if you can completely trust
this person you're talking to whether
it's a close friend or a therapist or
whatever then it probably can be as good
as writing as long as that person is
supportive of you it is that accepting
of you but right that's the beauty of
writing writing is you are the audience
is you and when we do our research we
make it clear that they'll never get
feedback they'll never be linked with
what they're writing we've done studies
we had people write on a magic pad you
know those things you have is a kid do
you write on it you lift it up and it
disappears and we get the same effects
riding on a magic pad is on paper that
you turn in so I think that real active
ingredient here is translating the
experience into language so it's a
little bit of both that's why I prefers
press conferences that are not scripted
or at least not as scripted and you know
it's also interesting most good speech
writers try to mimic the personality of
the person I've got one very quick story
John Kerry ran for president against
Bush in 2004 if you remember him he was
a stick he was formal and he just
couldn't connect with people and I read
in the New York Times that his handlers
were aware of this and so what they were
encouraging him to do but to use more
wee words in his speech and I read that
and I thought oh Jesus this guy is toast
now it's interesting because use of we
among you know politician is a marker of
being emotionally distant
and so here his people are telling him
okay now let's try to be really distant
and and he could do it know if what was
also interesting is language really maps
a person he was rigid and you know kind
of controlled and his language was the
same it's kind of a part of the package
deal and what we find is in terms of non
verbals and verbals they tend to go
together and you know had he spoken I
using I words in that same way but it
made a difference I think beats me baby
and this could see my hands might have
anyway and this is a exception of our
interpretation if it gets at the Y and
maybe they know this is speculation
because you have a nice really nice
binding inviting trauma and someone it's
cathartic useful for things including
health care health stream about that you
know in the future why what's your set
of best guesses it's a speculative why
and how might we for the study that to
come to the answers okay so this is one
of the the big problems in science is
that we've all been trained to think it
there that there is a single answer this
vast a particular theory that's better
than others writing is interesting
because it is a cascade of phenomena
that drive it and this has been one
thing that because there been enough
studies now we know we know some of the
reasons it occurs first of all you've
had a an upsetting experience a
traumatic experience think about what's
happening you obsess about it you think
about it you're walking down the street
you're you're thinking about it you're
talking to a friend and that you're
sometimes thinking about it then as well
you don't have working memory you don't
have free memory to devote to the
conversation you don't have free memory
to devote to reading and studying the
way you usually do and by the way people
have had a traumatic experience have
more problem their relationships they do
more poorly in school they have more
difficulty sleeping and on and on and on
we know that after writing people have
greater working memory so they've been
now several studies showing greater
working memory immediately afterwards we
also know after writing they sleep
better sleep is one of the most powerful
markers of health and it's also linked
to immune function and there have been a
number of studies showing that writing
associated with the enhanced immune
function and given an hour MD in the
room
immune function is a dirty concept
because the immune system is so so
complex but the point is is that sleep
is good for you we also know sleeps
related sleep disruptions associated
with depression so here we now know
greater working memory people sleep
better the other issue is that we also
know that writing about something helps
to organize the experience putting it
into words think about what happens when
you have a traumatic experience and you
don't you're not able to talk to
somebody about it or you can't write
about it what happens is you're walking
down the street and you're thinking oh I
should have done this and then you start
thinking about this feature of it and
then you go a little bit further then
you think oh god I felt so guilty about
this and then you start and it but you
don't put it all together and what
writing does is it forces putting things
together in a coherent meaningful way
one other oh and one other issue is is
just merely writing about it helps to
acknowledge that it occurs the number of
people who have a traumatic experience
and what they do is they work to not
think about it to pretend it didn't
happen
and just labeling it makes a difference
there's been some nice work on using
fMRI data you see of UCLA showing just
the mere labeling of an experience
brings about is associated with a change
and then all of this what's so
interesting about this is it's also
associated with social changes so for
example we've done this done a couple of
studies where we give people beepers or
it not be prison there's a device that
that I developed with one of my graduate
student called the E or the
electronically activated recorder it's a
it used to be a an actual tape recorder
and then it became a digital recorder
and now it's just a cell phone it comes
on for 30 seconds goes off for 12
minutes and we ask people to wear it for
several days and in our writing studies
we would have them wear this for two
days before they were assigned to
condition and then again a month after
the writing now what we found was that
people who were in the experimental
condition who wrote about trauma spent
more time talking to others afterwards
laughing more they were more socially in
and here was the cool part from my
perspective we gave him a million
questionnaires and we asked them how
tell me about your life you know how
much are you talking with others and so
forth we get no differences in
questionnaires people don't see that
their lives have changed because self
reports are self theories people are
working on what they think their life is
and it's not and we are now seeing
objectively that there are these changes
so this is the these are this is why
there's not a single answer because
writing is bringing about all of these
things these changes that are really
each one on its own is often hard to
measure hard to conceptualize hard for
even the person themselves to see but I
think that that's this the complex
answer okay each year Microsoft Research
