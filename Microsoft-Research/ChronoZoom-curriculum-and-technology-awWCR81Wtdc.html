teaching history to understanding the
past is the ability to reanimate things
that have already happened and to be
able to see those those trends and those
changes in those perspectives 15 years
ago that meant having access to the
puzzle pieces of the past the primary
sources the documents the archives the
things that professionals only had
access to technology is an amplifier of
what happens in the classroom if it's
used well it amplifies the educational
process that's used poorly it amplifies
the distraction and amplifies the
problems that are going on but good
teachers using good technology can do
amazing things there's definitely a gap
between what students do in the class
with papers and books and then
technology you need to bridge that gap
somehow so that it flows in some sort of
cohesive manner before the technologies
like one note in chrono zoom
collaborating on group projects was very
difficult and the technology was not as
seamless for example we'd be sending
back and forth presentations or notes or
passing around paper notes and it just
was very difficult to collaborate and
have everyone contribute to the project
by doing this in our school in our
school setting I think that you can not
only learn from yourself and what you
can do with technology but you can also
learn what other people can use and do
with technology
the most valuable litmus test for
technology in the classroom is whether
or not it allows teachers to do
something they couldn't do otherwise
software like one note in krona zoom
enabled kinds of collaboration
presentation project oriented learning
that haven't been possible before the
use of these technologies i am not a
techie person and i was able to
successfully use chrono zoom in my
school which is very limited technology
I have one computer in my classroom we
have computer labs but they're very hard
to get to because everyone wants to be
in the computer lab even those facts
that I'm not techy and very limited in
technology here at my school I was able
to implement chrono zoom very well in my
classroom because of its simplicity how
easy it is to use and because it speaks
for itself in terms of what it shows
what it presents and what students get
out of it getting Chronos arm up and
running as really as easy as opening a
browser because it's a web-based
application there's no nothing to
install there is no question of hardware
compatibility I think the initial
reaction to chrono zoom of my teachers
has been whoa because of the initial fly
through which in a sense captures the
notion of big history when I first saw
it and saw the zoom from the view of the
whole cosmos down down down down down
down into the view of humanity I
realized right then it was a magnificent
tool for giving perspective in a way
that you can't see otherwise about the
temporal relationship between things
tools like Crenna zoom allow us students
teachers practitioners scholars to
essentially take huge piles of data and
create understandings of what that data
might might show us and tell us from the
past it's a presentational tool they can
be used very quickly as by a teacher to
present it can also be used by students
to develop their own presentations but
it also is one of those kind of tools
that is scalable when I start Corona
zoom I couldn't wait to have my students
build timelines I designed a project in
which they had to research a world
religion or philosophy conduct research
create a storyboard on a OneNote
notebook and then build a timeline in
chrono zoom in my world history class
right now I'm using it to present about
the austro-hungarian empire and so I
just created a tour I thought I'm going
to be presenting my whole class it was
really interesting to use the tour
because it kind of does the presentation
for you you put the information in and
you put the pictures in and then it
takes you or it takes the class through
it and that's really really helpful when
presenting
one thing I always tell my students is
that history is messy and chaotic what
Chronos room does is it allows me to
visually show my students history and it
shows them that mess but in an organized
manner caramelizing of a tree because
it's like the main branch splits off
into tiny little info buds that each
contribute to the main purpose it's a
wonderful tool because it has not only
text information but it has pictures and
videos that you can look at to help you
visualize information more chrono zoom
gave me the opportunity to place
timelines into the hands of students
that they not only got to see the
progression of things changing and
staying the same but they also got to
interact with history so chrono zoom
what it does is it teaches chronology
allows you to visualize history and it
also teaches cause and effect usually in
my regular history classes we would just
learn this happened in this heaven then
this happened but with chrono zoom and
messiahs she shows us that each event
doesn't just happen like that events
actually overlap and one thing might
happen at the same time this thing is
happen you can zoom in into different
box and it's just like different layers
that you can go into you it's like going
through a book of history just turning
the pages and turning the pages until
you get to the part that you want to
read chrono zoom has forced me to really
look at why dates are important and why
things are centered in time and cause an
effect and how that relates to other
timelines of history chrono zoom changed
the way that I view history or think
about history because the importance of
chrono zoom is tying the subject at hand
to a date so tying the political
structure of the austro-hungarian Empire
to a specific date has really helped me
learn about it better because I've had
to connect it with a certain point in
history because we take full advantage
of the tablet PCs that we have a lot of
time those projects aren't shareable
outside the school because the people
our students want to share those
projects with may not have tablet
sees chrono zoom feels a really unique
niche for us however because it brings
some great capabilities but it's also
something that they can share with
grandma who may be running on our old
Windows machine when I show Kronos into
my parents they're really you know
surprised by it about how new it is
because they're like oh you're not just
you know making this product by yourself
you actually have a format to work on
and they were really interested again
with the timelines and the exhibits and
the tour that you can take to another
student who is about to use chrono zoom
I would recommend not limiting
themselves and what they can present
with chrono zoom for example don't just
think that because you have to tie
something to a specific date in history
you can only focus on that event there's
so much you can connect to that event
and present through chrono zoom and it's
really beneficial to know that this is
the future of technology in the
classroom natural interfaces like pen
and touch collaborative software like
OneNote innovative software like crona's
and that allows you to do presentations
and put information together in ways you
couldn't in the past
