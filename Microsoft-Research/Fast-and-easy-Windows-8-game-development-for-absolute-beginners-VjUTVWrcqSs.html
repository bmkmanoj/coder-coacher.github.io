alright so go ahead and not introduce
started give a round of applause to a
room thank your room thank you hello
everyone and welcome to the session I'm
alone and I'm a dev in the windows steam
I'm pacifically I work for the printing
and imaging technologies and today we'll
be discussing about developing a casual
game for windows 8 and this is for
beginners like you and me and hopefully
experts in you would find something
interesting out of today so sometime
last year I got interested in developing
casual games during the rtm face of
Windows 8 and I started exploring the
options on what are the tools which are
available for writing games for windows
and this is what I felt so if you are
venturing into game development for the
first time be prepared to be oval
overwhelmed with the number of choices
you will be facing so I spent some time
looking over the choices and figuring
out what exactly is my skill level and
which is going to fit my time frame so I
want to have a quick ramp for learn
learning it and so that I can start
working on the game as fast as i can so
i will give you a quick summary of what
i found during my investigations so as
you know windows 8 supports c++ c sharp
and html5 JavaScript so if you want to
do something like a very highly
professional game like halo which has
some 3d effects and you should be able
to control the camera position and angle
and lighting and shading and all that
then you should be doing Direct X or use
engines like unreal if you are
comfortable with C sharp then there is
this very popular tool called not to
framework called unity which is the most
popular
platform development framework out there
and if you are if you are okay with
casual games where you want the user to
just play for a few minutes or a few
hours like Angry Birds yeah how was your
class sure I think unreal and unity are
paid I don't know the exact cost
structures but I think we should be able
to look it up fairly quickly but I am
currently going to focus on this
particular tool called construct to
write so html5 JavaScript is fairly new
to the game development space but the
but the game dopers are quickly adopting
it irrespective of the fact that it's
pretty much nascent so theoretically
speaking you can write a HTML 5
JavaScript game with just notepad and
access to a browser but you don't want
you don't really want to do that because
there are some rich tools available
although although there are some popular
games which are built from the scratch
for example if you have heard about cut
the rope and cutthroat I ease the
website so they have completely read it
on the game for JavaScript and html5 and
there is this other game called contours
your I don't know if you heard about it
but it's it's also very cool in its
contours yo dot IE is a website and you
should be able to take a look at the
game so that those two games are written
from the scratch using the html5
JavaScript canvas element and there are
some middle level tools like create Jas
and impact years I think those are free
they give you a set of helper libraries
which help you start your coding pretty
fast but still you need to have a pretty
good understanding of how to do
javascript programs the one we are going
to talk about today is called construct
2 which is which is a which is a very
easy way to write a game or even mock up
a game if you want to do a professional
game or a 3d game and this one does not
require you to have a
understanding of JavaScript you do not
need to know JavaScript at all so that
is what we are going to focus on today
so I have structured this stock into two
major areas the first off we will take a
look at an introduction to the construct
to tool itself and give you a taste on
how easy it is to develop a game or
prototype a game and the second part I
will focus on a particular plug-in which
I a third for constructive which helps
to bring all the rich windows 8 features
to construct two so let's that's all
with my slides and let's start off with
developing a game I'm going to try to
living the game from the scratch and
let's see how far I can proceed alright
so let me launch
I bought their software i don't know why
i hate get that okay so let's launch
constructive hi this is not a free
edition I have a license okay and let's
do the most natural thing which we do
which is file new project okay so as you
can see construct 2 comes with a bunch
of built-in templates ranging from my
own oil you can type whatever you want
let's say jump have an infinite jumping
game template let's say I want a car
game sure anything else what bird I
don't know so bird is a I don't know
explore scrolling game right so you can
type scroll and you should be able to
get you know the scrolling game behavior
anyway that's not fun and let's do a
simple blank project so that we can
understand the basics right so I'm going
to create a blank project and this is a
fairly simple ide you just close this
and what you have here is there is a
project view over here and you have all
the items which are listed here which is
currently part of your project and
whenever you select an item over here
your your properties window would show
the corresponding properties for the
item selected this is fairly basic so
the only interesting thing over here is
the layout let's talk about that so a
layout you can think of a layout as
uninteresting Lee you know
pre-configured set of objects which are
going to appear on the screen a layout
can be one layout / level or one layout
/ you know the title screen for your app
or one layout for your menu it's wrong
so let me make this layout as level 1 so
we are going to start designing the
level one for my game right so we are
going to do a platform style game 4
example a mario style jumping game where
the main character jumps around on
platforms and collect stuff and jumps on
enemies right so I'm going to change the
layout size to something big I'll just
zoom out to show you that this is the
whole layout size here and as we said
this is a horizontal scrolling
platformer so you will have more space
for the player to jump and and the thing
you should note here is that there is
this little dotted line over here which
represents the window which is currently
visible to the user right so for a Mario
smile game you will have a long strip of
layout and your window would be one part
of it so that is what we are trying to
design here all right okay so now that
we have the layout set up let's add some
background to this layout so the way you
do it is you can either right click
insert new object or you can go to
object types insert new object or you
can double-click so i'm going to
double-click from now right so we want
to add a background to this layout so
there is this this is object called
tiled background I'm going to select
that and I'm going to just place it over
here anywhere this opens up a image
editor and I'm going to open up an image
which i already have prepared for so
here is a background for our game and
the background shows up here cool I will
close this and you can see that this
this object is a resizable so I'm going
to resize it to fit the whole screen so
from the name you can understand that
this is a tile black background which is
a very common technique used in games
where you take one small image and then
kind of tile it over there and if you
are smart enough to design the tile then
it would look as if it's a whole new
image right so in this case I am going
to position at at the top left and I
know the layout size so i am going to
fill it in or you can do it you know
with mouse
okay so we have the background set up
nicely okay so we are going to add more
and more objects to this layout like the
player and enemy and the land on which
he would jump on all that so by mistake
I would drag this and then it would
spoil my careful positioning so what I'm
going to do is I'll create layers so
let's introduce layers the concept of
layers to you so every layout can have
layers if you if you have worked with
photoshop or gem then you would know
Leah side but for the benefit of who are
not introduced to it let me try to
explain that so you can think of layers
as transparent sheets laid out on top of
them and the bottom most transparent
sheet think of it as having the
background and the next transparent
sheet you can add the player and the
next one you can have enemies and all
that so in this case our bottom most
layer is going to be the background i am
going to rename it to background and i
am going to lock it in place so this
means that i cannot select this
background anymore and it's locked in
position which is which is nice and i'm
going to add another layer and name it
as main into which i will drop all my
main players and enemies and everyone
else so let us have that main layer
selected and let's add the player the
the central character to this game so i
am going to just double click and add a
sprite if you are not familiar with
sprite a sprite simply means an animated
object in the gaming world so i am just
adding a sprite and notice how the
crosshairs as a tool tip which says main
which means that we are going to drop
this whatever object we are trying to
add into the main layer and again we get
the similar image editor view here but
this is a little bit different this time
because we chose the sprite so let's
import the sprite I am just right
looking here and imports pride and i'm
going to import the player sprite let's
start off with the idle animation
so so constructive gave me 11 frames for
this particular idle animation and this
one is just empty am going to delete it
and as you can see the there is some
empty area around this player which
might take some space so I am going to
just remove it by cropping it shipped
crop will remove it from all the frames
so I'm just going to do that alright so
now we have the player over here and
there is this concept of hot spots which
means what is the what is the place of
contact for this particular object so
this is a platform game and this player
will be jumping on solids right so the
hot spot is going to be the bottom I'm
going to do a forum here and then make
it available to the whole animation and
that's pretty much it so I'm just going
to set it set the animation to loop and
preview it so he is nicely idling there
right so I'm going to change his name to
idle animation and set the speed to a
little bit faster whoo so I I'll just
track him here and let's just run the
game so you have created the game which
runs on IE and your player is idling
there right he is waiting for your
commands alright so now let us add some
platform for him to jump on i'll add
more sprites here and again on the main
layer i'll do the same thing input
sprites trip and i'll get some tiles i
just happen to know that this sprite
sheet is made up of 144 frames so i just
say it over here and let construct two
takes take care of splitting it up so
it's actually doing some work splitting
up the huge sprite sheet into 144 images
and we got it now so the first one is
empty i'm just going to delete it
yeah that's a fact that's a standard way
in the gaming world where they have a
concept called sprite sheet where they
lay out everything and you can split
them up whatever the way you want so
that's how they distribute the assets so
if you go to professional websites they
will sell sprite sheets for one team for
example like an aircraft based theme
they will sell a sprite sheet where you
have in all kinds of aircrafts and
everything so you can split it up okay
so this one I am going to use it as just
a placeholder so I don't want it to
animate at all so I'm going to set these
p20 and let's zoom in a bit and then
show you how or what I am trying to
achieve here okay so i'm i am trying to
create a floating land on which the
player is able to jump on right so so i
happen to know that the frame numbers
one and a few other frames are
interesting to me i am going to control
drag to create a copy of this and
control dad and I'm going to make one
for is another frame I want and 14 is on
the frame way not 14 13 I think yeah so
I'm going to do some snap to grid and
then try to align these guys so that it
actually looks like a land all right so
if I ran this sure there's a floating
piece of land right ok so now is the
most interesting part for this demo I'm
going to do some trick and add a
placeholder here just like the usual way
what we have been doing
and set the origin to bottom I will
explain what what this is all about so I
have created a Remy's turn of the snap
to grid so I have created a little
square which is going to be the bounding
box for this player so let me make the
opacity 50 so that I can see through it
and I am going to create it as a
bounding box for this player right ok so
I don't want the you know the props
which he has and other things getting in
the way so at this point we have
everything set up for the player to jump
on the solid right this is where
constructive comes in and gives us a lot
of saves as a lot of time so if you look
at if you look at the properties there
is something called behaviors which
comes built in with constructor for all
the projects which help you assign a
kind of behavior to each object right so
i am going to assign a sign a
platform-style behavior to this object
and let us see what that means so i have
a sign i have selected this box will
which i will call player box and alcohol
this is player so i have added this
platform behavior to this player box
right and i'm going to declare this as a
solid behavior make it as a solid all
right that is what i did i haven't
written any code so let's see what
happens so i am using my keyboard to
jump if you look at the you know the
bounding box it's jumping around so we
did not write any code and we already
got the platform behavior for free right
so all we need to do is bind this player
to the bounding box and hide the binding
box right so i am going to hide the box
by saying initial visibility to
invisible and i am going to go to the go
to the event sheet okay so this is
another little new concept so even cheat
is the way you program with constructive
and whatever you have in here would be
executed 60 times a second and it would
be rendered on your screen right so what
I am going to do is I am going to ask
for every take position the player to
the player box okay so so if we take we
are asking the system to position the
player to the player box so now we have
hidden the player box and now let's see
what happens so that is it so your
player is jumping around so there is
some more scope of improvement here for
example if you want you know mirroring
the player if you if you click on the
left key you want to play to face the
correct direction right so let us do
that by adding a keyboard object if
staying King going to take five seconds
to have it available set and I am going
to add on keypress when the right key is
pressed what do i want i want the player
to mirror not mirror and when our left
key is going to be pressed
i will say i want the player to be
mirrored ok so let's run so he is
mirrored right
okay so so we have a we have a basic set
up here over here and as you can see I
can add more animations to this
particular player so in the interest of
time I am just jumping on to one of the
checkpoints I have where I have added
you know the jump animations and jump to
run animations and all that this
particular player to help me with
getting on to the next part okay so i'll
show you the animations what we did so
for last time we saw here there was only
one animation and now we have added a
bunch of animations that's it and we
need to have some logic tiden as well so
all it does is if the platform is moving
then set the animation to idle to run
and when the animation idle to run is
done go for run and this is just a
simple state machine which you can
figure out right and if you run this you
will have this nice you know the run
animations and jump animations for that
okay
and the interesting thing which we
should do is for the player I already
added it so there is this behavior
called scroll to behavior which means
that the screen will follow the player
let us remove it and see the difference
so without scroll to behavior if the
player jumps off piece he is not shown
in the screen right so so let's add a
scroll to behavior and now let's see
what happens so let him jump off the
cliff so it follows him right okay
so now that we have the player let's add
some enemies over here so I'm going to
make a copy of this the floating land by
control drag one more and one more okay
and I would like to add a enemy to it
but but before that let me let me adjust
the window size 640 480 sounds 1995 now
you can see that the dotted lines are
you know expanded so that you have a
bigger window so i am going to add a
sprite for the enemy and i have a few
enemies
that's not what I wanted to do I wanted
to import spreadsheet I'll delete this
and I do the shift crop to remove extra
space around it and i'll set the origin
to bottom and apply to whole animation
and i'm going to set the loop to yes and
snail is snail so it can be slow okay
and snail is also like the player
actually right he's he's also a platform
style object and he wants to move around
on the platform and jump off the
platform and all that so let's give him
the platform behavior as well and if we
do this if you run this will note
something funny right so the control is
applied for both the platform objects so
we don't want that so we will remove
this guy as being controlled you know I
do not want to control you and now they
are independent so you can jump it's
nice okay now we have added the snail
and the player is ready and the next
thing obviously is to make a way for
letting the player kill the snail and
the enemy kill the player right so how
do we do that let us do the player on
collision with another object the other
object being should rename it
it's teddy n player on collision with
another object the another object being
enemy okay so this is going to execute
whenever whenever the system detects a
collision with a snail enemy so so we
want to do a couple of things here one
is if the player jumps on the snail
obviously the player wins and if he is
coming into contact with the snail on
the sides the snail wins right so let us
do the first case and I'm going to add a
sub event
and here i am going to say is falling so
if he is falling and he is colliding
with the snail enemy they know when then
we know that the snail should be killed
that's it and the else case means
the else kaise means the snail winds
right in that case we would want to
destroy the player let us not destroy
the player but we will you know will
flash the player saying that okay he's
he's under trouble so for that we have a
behavior called flash which we will add
okay we have the Flash available and we
can make the we can make the player
flash
so it's going to flash for one second
that's it so let us try that so is the
snail skill and when we come into
contact go and when you come into
contact with oh ok oh no ok fine so
you're supposed to be a little bit of a
it's fun ride you can edit your game
yeah now he is flashing so that is what
we want to achieve and you can add some
little bit you know reality some here by
you know having the having the platform
jump a bit when you jump on the snail
that you can achieve by setting some
offset 700 pixels so this will give you
that nice jump effect you see that jump
effect so that is what we would
okay so what else do we need to do ok so
now now the obvious thing next to do is
to add some scoring capabilities to your
game so let's add some scores to the
game now it's a good point to talk about
parallax I don't know if you guys
noticed so if you go to start screen and
if you scroll around the background you
know the stars in the back they scroll a
bit slower than the foreground which
gives you a nice depth effect and this
is the same techniques used in you know
all the popular games like Angry Birds
and all that venue when the bird flies
the backgrounds Scrolls smoothly which
gives you that nice depth effect the
more layers you add the more depth you
would get so let's add some depth to our
game by setting the background to move
little bit slower than the foreground
you have a parallax you can say move
fifty percent slower than the foreground
and we were talking about scores so I am
going to add a layer for scores and call
it heads up display and it's always
going to be on the top and obviously you
want to always see the score right you
don't want I mean your score should be
always in the fixed position either top
left or somewhere right so we will make
the parallax zero which means it's going
to be fixed right so I'm going to add a
text box
and notice how we are placing it on the
HUD layer right and i'm going to call it
score start off with zero and we'll make
something a light color and we'll make
it big and visible I like when I clean
packed font and I'll make it something
big okay so now you can see that we are
going to have the score up here at the
top left and it won't scroll away it
would you just stay there because we
have set the parallax 20 it which is
stay there which is good so how do we
keep track of the score obviously we
declare a variable and initial value is
obviously 0 and you can see that it
appears over here saying that global
number it's a score is zero and I am
sure you can guess the next step so I'm
going to add a score you add 10 to the
score right that's it so you whenever
you kill a snail you get 10 points and
one more thing we have to do is update
the text
i'm going to say score colon
concatenation with score so if i did all
this then we should get 10 points when i
jump on the snake okay so we got 10
points cool so thats that's pretty much
what i wanted to show to give you a
taste on how to you know go about
developing games with construct 2 and
let's move on to the next section where
we wanted to talk about how the plug-in
enables bringing in some of the rich
windows 8 features into concept to write
so for that i will think this is going
to crash okay so i am going to have a
final not final but better version here
to to show some more things which could
be done here so i'm going to play it a
bear to show you you can see that i have
made the snail move around a bit there
are some points to be collected with
this fruit things which are rotating and
and some coins to be collected and your
level is complete so that's that's what
we have as the game right now and let's
try to export this to windows 8 so you
can go to file and export project and it
will give you a bunch of options notice
how when is phone 8 is also present
there so you can export to windows 8 and
let's say what construct 2 is now doing
is it's creating a visual studio 2012
html5 JavaScript project and packing up
all your resources which you are using
in this game and creating a project file
for you so once it's ready we should be
able to hit a fire and it should just
work
so I am going to open the destination
folder and locate my project open it in
visual studio and I just need to do one
thing to choose this test certificate
okay and it's ready to run so you have
your windows 8 game which is you know
pretty much ready to submit your store
so it's it's just exactly the one which
we played in IE and it's it's just that
so at this point I realize that the
constructive gaming environment is
missing out on super cool features which
we introduced in Windows 8 for example
like the settings charm integration with
settings charm roaming settings sensor
support and you know the snap view all
these things so if you think about the
target audience they are they are so
used to programming programming in
constructive with drag and drop and the
way we we showed you for the last 30
minutes which is pretty very simplified
form of gaming game development so I
thought that if we fill in the gap by
bringing in the which features from
windows 8 made available to construct to
ide then more people would start using
the windows 8 features so I went ahead
and wrote a plug-in called Metro which I
don't know why I named that way was cool
at the time and let's see how let's see
how it helps us all right so I showed
you that you can export the game and
it's already available i am going to i'm
going to show you the value ads which
this particular plug-in provides when
you use the plugin so it's just like any
other object for this project construct
to project so i'm going to right click
and insert new object and this is this a
plug-in wish I road we should talk about
and I am going to insert it and just
like any other object it will be
available soonish
and we have the metro object available
right so you can see that I have a bunch
of features over here which we will talk
about it in a while and if we export
this now let us see what features we get
for free so now this is now construct 2
is composing a project but it is also
adding some features which I wrote as a
part of the Metro plug-in and compiling
everything into a JavaScript right so in
fact you should be able to open up the
generator JavaScript and look at
whatever code that is it's all readable
so we go back here and show reload and
I'll do this again
and now let us run this so at the first
look it does not look anything different
obviously I'd I am NOT going to add
special graphics for you just because
you added the plug-in right so the first
thing you would notice is that if you go
to the settings charm I have added the
Preferences help and about by default
right so you get this for free so you
get the audio and sound effects switch
us and everything added for you for free
and you can have your help charm help
page in your settings chum for free and
you can have your about page in your
settings charm for free this is all just
adding the plug-in and once you export
it you get all this for free it saves a
lot of time for you right you don't want
to redo the whole thing I want to do
about Paige then how do I you have to
start learning JavaScript and how do i
integrate it with construct 2 it's all
done for you you just export it with it
and you got it and we know that finna
site supports snap view and most of the
games are designed for you know full
screen plane so this is my default
screen where I can say press full screen
to continue playing and of course the
markers here you can replace it with
whatever you want right so once i click
this you will be taken back to the full
screen so these are some little
conveniences which you get for free if
you do that plug in and it would your
app would feel more natural with windows
8 paradigms okay so that's what you get
for free so what what else can you do
with some more effort
one of the one of my most favorite
features in Windows 8 Windows Store
Windows Store apps is the rooming
storage roaming settings I don't know
how many of you are familiar with it so
it's the concept where if you have your
app installed in computer with Microsoft
account connected and you store
something on that pc windows will take
care of roaming those settings to every
other pc for that user right so which
means that for example in our game
environment it's very easy to store the
high scores in one pc for example you
are playing on surface and you want to
store the high score in surface and when
I launch it in the laptop or some other
pc then it should show the high score
right because they all they all Rome
magically and you don't have to do
anything special right so when I wrote
this plugin I started realizing that in
order to demonstrate all the features
that this plug-in support I need to have
a sample app so that people can look at
what's possible and you know too wet
that this is actually a you know working
plug-in and you can actually use it for
production environment so I kind of
wrote this breakout clone this is this
is an app in the store which I kind of
call it as a sample for my plug-in and I
install this app in this machine for the
first time I haven't played on this and
if I if I go to these levels you can see
that all my high scores and stars and
the level unlocks are all populated here
so if we if I had not played it it would
be you know the lock buttons all the way
but because i am using the roaming
settings I get all this for free and
just storing it in locally and it just
roams and it's available in all my pcs
so i will get back to this app a bit
later when we talk about particular
features so i will show you how to do
the roaming settings here so this is
this is very similar to the one which we
did earlier
it just has some more bells and whistles
with I have created some groups for
nicely organizing the events so let us
say you want to store the score in the
roaming storage how do you do that it is
as simple as you search for rooming set
roaming value and you can specify the
key s high score and you can say save
the score as the high score right so
what this does is behind the scenes when
you generate it generate a windows 8
project this will put in the necessary
binges API which calls into the roaming
API of Windows 8 and then stores your
score into the store right so which
means that this will be available in all
your PC's and let us say for example you
have stored it here and you are
launching it on a fresh pc right so you
want to retrieve whatever you stored so
how do you retrieve that what you can do
is you can say
so during the start of the game what you
can do is let us see I want to populate
the score from previous session which
you played on surface what i can do is i
can do system set value metro dot homing
value high score so this word this word
retrieve the value you stored somewhere
else and make it available to the other
instance so that is very convenient so
thats how i used this is all I I wrote
this particular app so that whenever you
play it does not matter if I if I for
example get a couple of stars in this
and if I go back home my level will be
unlocked and my high score will be
available so that is how you do the
rooming storage and the next thing I
wanted to talk about was so as a part of
the app you also get for example
resetting the data you store so let's
see go to preferences and so this one
were clear of all the settings you have
saved in roaming storage or local
storage so you can click reset and then
do you really want to clear the stores
this will this will clear off all the
unlocked levels and your high scores and
all that so you get all this for free
with with this particular plugin and of
course live tiles so you want to add
support for live tiles from your game
for example whenever you whenever you
detect that the player has crossed a
high score or unlock the level you want
to publish a shout-out saying that hey
you you have cleared a new level
congratulations or whatever right so how
do you do that you can do metro update
lifetime
so that's it so once you do that we'll
take it off the magic how to create the
XML for publishing this and making it
available for the white tile and all
that so this is how you get this
particular you know this particular
message from my app so that's how I
publish this particular message and
another important thing with with
windows 8 which construct 2 doesn't have
a way to tap in is the monetization
model so we have the concept of trial
app we have the concept of in-app
purchases we have the concept of
advertisements right so you can do
something like Metro is in trial mode
and you can expose certain levels and
not expose certain levels you can have
more kind of enemies you can have
superpowers you can have the shooting
special bullets all that based on
whether you are in a trial mode or not
and you can also have in-app purchases
so you can check whether the user has
purchased something special so you can
check is in app purchases no ad you have
to configure this in a special way I
have all the details in my blog but this
is how it works you can say you can
check whether the current running system
has purchased or made a purchase for
this in app then you don't show the ad
so that's what I did for this app so if
you go to charms settings purchase so
it's actually contacting the windows
store and then retrieving the you know
if you want to remove the advertisements
please go ahead and upgrade it for
whatever dollars there and if you click
upgrade this will actually go ahead and
invoke the purchase dialogue and
complete your purchase and once you go
ahead and buy it then you come back you
can check again and then you would know
that oh this guy has purchased no add
experience and you can remove that ad so
that's that's one way to
that is one way to structure your game
and I have written this blog about this
trials and in-app purchases in quite a
decent detail and if you want you can
take a look at that and I also wrote a
yeah this one so this one is a summary
on various somebody was asking a
question today what is the good way to
monetize your game right I do you want
to free app do you want a fully featured
paid a time limit or tile app or feature
limited trial app or in-app purchases or
whatever our in-app advertisements and
everything else so this is kind of a
summary on what are the various options
available for you and how you can go
about doing that so apart from that we i
am from the team which exposed the
sensors api in windows 8 my manager rode
those you know the v naughty API so I
also expose those sensors API is it not
this yeah so you can see here
you can see here that you can say use
the accelerometer gyro meter chano meter
and inclinometer and light sensors and
everything and you can read the lead the
Waterville values that are provided by
the sensors and make it you know the all
the all the cool games which use the
sensors to position position the gamer
and all that so that's also available as
a part of this plugin so apart from that
if you if you have played around with
trial apps and purchasing in-app
experiences then you would know that you
need to stage before submitting to the
store so when you develop the app you
cannot you cannot relay on because your
app is already not in the store when you
issue a request it would fail so you
cannot complete the testing for your app
so that's why they have an elaborate
scheme for making the appt testable with
a local setup so I have taken care of
that as well and when you say purchase
test mode will take care of you know
doing the magic saying oh okay so this
is a testing mode and we would do the
you know the fake message is saying that
okay your app purchase completed
successfully or fail and all that and
whenever you want to really submit to
the store you can turn this to false and
then you're all set so that's it from my
side for today so this is my blog and I
kind of spent I don't know few weeks
over there and I least ten releases of
this plugin every two weeks or something
and covered try to cover all the various
windows 8 features available out there
so that's pretty much from my side today
and hopefully you would feel
yep hopefully that's that's what I
thought and hopefully you feel the same
ok questions how do you handle such fun
and resume so there is this so i have a
the plug-in as a model for pass so you
can you can detect a handle for pause
and then I mean the callback for suspend
and endo pass for a game yes by default
they just freeze the game so for example
in this the game which I wrote right so
let's say I'm here and if i switch away
the game is already frozen Oh
so whenever I switch away from the game
let us say I'm playing the game and
whenever I switch away from the game
like pressing the start screen start
button and when they go back to the game
it's already in the past state because I
handled that by saying that hey we have
received the suspend event just pause
yeah yeah how is the performance of the
framework good question so i have tested
with surface and if for a simple game it
is just fine but when you add a lot of
sprites unless you are doing some
optimizations it can become a little bit
sluggish what's a lot is very fully
allison 16 yes it's one likes a lot of
sprites sprites yeah so this game was
having some issues on surface whatever
i'm showing here though because no this
one had a lot of sprites because i
develop our other this is my first game
so I was not optimizing it properly so
then maybe too many strides in Valle
here yeah yeah so like we talked about
sprite sheet I did not use spreadsheets
I used single image for every break or
whatever so that concept I was not aware
when I was starting on this so that
might help a bit this thing without
yeah good question I should have shown
that so you remember we changed the
layout sides to notice the window size
to 1366 768 so if you make it 1366 768
and set this property full screen in
browser to anything other than any of
the letterbox scale or letterbox integer
scale construct 2 takes care of
magnifying it to that particular
resolution or particular 1669 resolution
so even if you have a you know like a
bigger resolution then your game would
be nicely fitting in that position by
line and just exactly so you that's why
I always say just designed for 1366 768
and you should get everything else for
free and you will get the black bars for
every other vehicle solution yeah this
is support the touch
this way
I haven't tried pinch-to-zoom but it you
get touched for free just like anything
else so I actually have a touch screen
and you can I can touch this and
everything works fine so I haven't
played around with the page to zoom and
all that multi-touch I have not played
but it in fact oh yeah okay yeah concert
two silvers out of that office yeah
doc
so I haven't submitted to any other
platform yet so I don't know the answer
to that question but from looking at
their forums and support aliases it's a
hugely active community and they are
very responsive though so they release
an update every two weeks and they're
very responsive yeah yeah can you repeat
that where did you get your artwork I
did it myself you know did you have
files also yes actually I have audio
files but it's not connected yeah what
you don't know it you know there's like
four what is it elance to get up they do
there's audio files people do audio
files to or their other ways of getting
audio files so far for the whatever
audio which I used for this project when
I purchase the construct to license it
came up with a bunch of music files so I
chose a background music and you know
the ball hitting back music and all that
from their collection that's what was
enough for me but there are a lot of
creative commons libraries out there
where you can get free music or you can
purchase yeah sound effects conservative
also I think tinder on the website you
can buy assets yeah they also sends
packs on the sympathetic on said to that
site Oh like your work
custom parts do they allow you to import
sorry i'm not getting bots custom fonts
custom fonts so you can choose whatever
fonts are installed on that particular
machine that's it as far as I'm
encouraging i am not familiar how to do
that i haven't figured that out so i
just stick to impact because it looked
decent enough yeah but but i see very
very outgoing at but i don't all do that
yep you can add any custom CSS
properties that you want so that you can
go ahead and package your package your
font like you do it
yeah you're setting up we're setting up
for NASA that's etcetera there I'll be a
local activist Burbank Empress of event
is there a limit to lose I you can set
it up neighborhoods person falls off it
is destroying it
you know so for the free edition I think
they have an upper limit of number of
total events to be hundred I think and
for you know licensed version you don't
have any limits yeah you can go out our
ocean I mean whatever complications sure
you can publish games if you are making
it as a free game you cannot have ads
and silly yeah what's often if you used
to so I came across this website 2-d 2-d
game art for developers and inkscape is
see website inkscape is great because
you can do vector graphics so you can
scale it to whatever size you want and
they're in interesting thing to note
here is that so far the you know these
tiles and splash screen and all that for
Windows 8 you have to supply you know
variety of versions for these images one
scale 400 and and the 1 480 and 200 and
something else so that's very easy if
you have a have a program like inkscape
which works with non lossy formats so
that you can scale it and then easily
export it and you're done xscape that's
a free man it's free music present
I'm sorry you're ready to use expression
for that expression blend expression
design visit export formats the side
snap nothing you can actually send you a
graphic artist your visual i have friend
ok we need photoshop or successful
yep it entered above the concert
so because I yeah so debugging through
constructive is not very straightforward
i think but i haven't had a problem
which actually was worth debugging
through constructive but while
developing the plugin i had to obviously
do debug the generated javascript for to
make sure that i am calling into the
right banati api and all that so i
definitely dead debug with visual studio
yeah yeah
physics yeah so they have a physics
behavior I think I can maybe quickly
show
so yeah that is a template you have the
physics over there so it basically uses
box2d
yep so in order to actually change the
code you have to export visual studio
did you find yourself ever have to do
that or is the controls they provide so
good you actually write the entire thing
in there that's right they have
everything which you need pretty much
and in fact I mean because I wrote a
plug-in you can also write a plug-in if
you find something lacking right like
you know I understand that you can do
one day out how to do my paper this is
this site showing a hiding layouts or is
it like meetin ya so there is so this
one right this is one layout this is one
layout so I I transition from this one
to the next layout by calling a system
dot go to layout so they provide this
yeah so you can transition between
layouts and you can have your own state
machine on which layout you are and
based on some numbering scheme you can
say oh he's in late layered one and
seven and then when i click Next you
know skip level then I would know that I
have to go once 18 right that's all
taken
yeah it does your plug-in provide for ad
supporter so my dad asked your game yes
I brethren support me right yeah so I I
do have a way to add the advertisements
I kind of detailed it in this let me see
if I have a post on it yep so I have a
post on it and this will take you
through how to actually add adds to your
game so that's how i did this for for
this game yeah ok let's I give I runa
round of applause</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
