we're going to start off with the
breakout reports so if you let a session
so if you let a session then come on up
here looks like I guess been let did you
win it oh you're participating in the
conference now I'm so tired very briefly
I posted links to to github repos in the
botanist slack chat room one of them is
a an attempt to start a collection of
like a design of you know an analog of a
UI pattern library for conversation and
bot development and then the other one
is a list of common keywords that people
use with bots and like many many many
many synonyms for them so we'd love for
you guys to use those and contribute to
those it's just the very very beginning
of this stuff I'm just trying to get the
pieces in place so that people have a
place to contribute so any questions hit
me up in the chat but yeah there they
should be in the last couple lines of
the of the general channel I didn't take
notes but it was an art bot session so i
can tell you kind of my big takeaway
from it every button pop maker is going
to implement an unknown command and an
unknown command is a great place for you
to log with the block can't do but it's
also a great place for you to start
figuring out with the personality or the
perception of the personality of your
bot is that was kind of a cool take away
from me because you've got this
opportunity to kind of delight the user
and that's a place where you can do it
we also traded all of our favorite art
bots and mine on twitter is low poly
bots which i recommend checking out
that's my story we talked about the
manifesto basically a set of promises
that bomb makers can make to their users
we tried to we equated it a little bit
to sort of Creative Commons and in
creating some sort of like proactive
licensed or agreement that we can make
that would be really easy to like you
know select I do this with your personal
information I don't do this with your
personal information because bots are
fucking scary so uh we basically created
a generalized list of potential user
worries so things like you know
encryption of content what to do in
certain like abuse situations not you
abusing the bot the bot abusing you what
happens in like self harm and other
emergency situations what happens when
personally identifiable information is
collected verifying the authenticity of
the bot or of a human various
information sharing human visibility the
interaction like our humans reading all
the stuff that you're saying to this bot
content ratings for parental controls
publicly stated bot ownership so who
owns the bot is it you is it your
company particularly important for HR
bots and jurisdictional restrictions so
location of date data you know where
it's traveling internationally so yeah
that's what we did if you have any
questions or thoughts come find me
afterwards sure i'll just post it in a
post and put it in general and then we
can follow up from there so if you want
to follow up directly with me i would
love to create some sort of a community
organized set of this information so we
did platforms and startups redux it was
basically the same session as yesterday
but we made it a little further so i'm
gonna there's a bunch of new faces here
so i'm going to recap some of it fairly
quickly hopefully which is so we met
with platform companies and startups and
the question was you know to the
platform companies how are you helping
the companies that are trying to build
value on top of your platform and then
the question to the startups was what do
you guys actually need so we had just to
recap it twilio Microsoft Twitter slack
kick IBM and then today Facebook which
is cool and basically on the how are
companies supporting startups and people
building value is sort of showing up to
this stuff working together providing
great tools open sourcing stuff that
should be open source having open road
map
providing sort of enterprise sales
support intro to companies and then
there was funding and then on the what
do we need it was sort of money the
platforms need more foundational
thinking they're pretty half hazard and
pulled together right now you know it's
the the thing that we kept talking about
was you know webhead HTML mobile had 20
year old objective c and java api is in
bot tufts and receive so how do we
actually build something on top of that
a lot of complaints about you know
everything is shifting under our feet
that's not going to change anytime soon
but it's sort of how do we manage it
better there was a lot of talk about
official partner programs and actually
having some structure and repeatability
and predictability put in their
discovery monetization keep coming up
and then where we ended today that was
different as we went through a bunch of
other startups who basically just
corroborated that same stuff that we had
heard yesterday but we actually got to a
really nice practical next step which
was creating a set of botanist channels
right so the consensus the broad
consensus was is that if you found this
way your way into this room then you're
probably in a leadership position in the
botton messaging space it's hard I mean
there's probably probably missing people
we in fact for sure are missing people
but we have to keep it to sort of a
tractable size right now so we decided
this we would create a set of channels
in botanist so we were these are the
ones that we agreed on one was features
so this is a place where you can go and
say I need features here's what I want
here's what we're looking for the
request from the platform teens was like
please be specific give us use cases
tell us why if you've got customers
that's even better strategy this is
really like how do I need business help
write everything isn't just features
it's like how can you help me from a
business and strategy perspective what
do we need from you guys and then
roadmap so a place to express roadmap be
transparent about roadmap talk about
changes to roadmap and then best
practices best practices is you know
what do you what should we be doing
where the platform companies think we
should be doing maybe get some help from
designers was talked about and then the
contentious one was emergency support so
there's no way the botanist channel is
going to turn into tech support for all
of us but there was a complaint of like
my bot is down it's broken I don't know
where to go can I get some help and so
we'll see how that pans out
so you know we had Sergio Brian Lily a
mirror we'll talk to the folks that were
here yesterday but aren't here today to
join or have somebody who represents
them join those channels will get those
created lily after you know whatever and
you guys join them and then it's we're
going to Lily suggested I think great
suggestion that we're going to take sort
of a pilot project what came up was
maybe the UI primitives for messaging
and just see if we can use that as a way
to begin a conversation across the
different platform companies with a
subset of us as a sort of startup
community and see if we can actually
make some progress so I think that was
you know again I think total applause
the platform companies for being open to
this because it's a it's a nice
practical step towards helping us and
collaborating in a practical way
hi I'm Lauren we were talking about
smarter child and active buddy and sort
of what's changed what hasn't if you are
creating today what would you do
differently um we talked about how the
main change is in server and computing
power that's not really challenge
anymore in terms of scaling the chat bot
and we said what's the one thing you
would do if you were building today and
that answer was pretty interesting it
was owed hire as many writers as I could
and so really stressing how chat bots
are an editorial content problem rather
than a technical problem so I guess he
had 11 writer at the time who was really
good and crafted a compelling
personality but he'd really hire a ton
of different writers we also talked
about why hasn't there been a bot yet
today that's as viral or popular smarter
child and we sort of theorized that it
was a lack of blue ocean so he sort of
reinforced from his talk how do you find
a blue ocean where they're less BOTS and
sort of go viral from there am I missing
anything Barney we talked about the
litter raiders of the lost ark and where
Microsoft hides acquired technology it
was really awesome many years ago it's
about oh yeah we talked about sex bots
um Monica those like better for the
monetization conversation probably but
yeah I mean our data is the same we see
sixty percent of people trying to have
sex with the bottom n czyli it's like
fundamental part of human nature so
there you go oh that was interesting to
everyone said seems like there aren't
any killer use cases yet and the
communities really focused on generating
platforms everyone wants to build a
platform and tools and this was sort of
called may be a lazy approach and
instead he urged everyone to focus on
building BOTS find the companies that
need that's where it's going to disrupt
their business
create that company that needs a bot but
build a bot bill the content stop
focusing so much on the tools there's 50
platforms here you know what's a
successful platform company all right
there's someone else then all right like
to introduce our next speaker but then
i'd like to introduce our next speaker
you may have seen her around uh she's
the founder of the botanist conference
designer of the logo all right let's
give it up for low Chang all right so I
thought I would do a little maybe a
little bit off the record i thought i am
going to give a talk on Xiao Weis I
think most of you probably heard of shy
wise it's a chatbot that we built that's
been really popular on WeChat assuming I
can log in was it was there it is um and
then I was going to talk a little bit
about the cave urgen what
it's not though it's not how it is me
that it isn't me it's not me what's it
the music i love it but you know keeps
us all exciting all right it is closed
you like that but i thought i'd give a
little bling alright so i'm going to
give a little story of how shall i
started and some of the usage and what's
been really interesting and then talk
about thai and some of the tools and
things that we've been working on so
shall i seeeee started I most of you
guys know Qi Lu he runs a bunch of the
company and he we have a group in China
and we've been just I don't know what
the music good start singing later the
karaoke will come in a minute so we chat
we chat super popular in one of the
channels that isn't here today I don't
listen to this music so I don't think
it's me do you guys know what the music
is
can let me see how it is for me some
browser it's the browser window I bet
that works all right so shall i seeeee
actually means little bing and it began
as a hackathon project by some folks in
the china search team and it their goal
was just to create a fun chat bot
something that was interesting and they
embedded it in we chat to begin with and
they extended it with a bunch of
intelligent services and it began as a
collaboration between the bing team and
the Microsoft Research Asia team and I
don't know if you know much about the
msre team but they have some of the most
amazing natural language machine
learning scientists anywhere and show it
released in China in 2014 and within the
first 72 hours it just started going
viral so it got into 1.5 million chat
groups and had about 10 million users
and WeChat immediately shut it down as a
result and people were you know people
it kind of increased the hype actually
by shutting it down immediately because
people were like what was this what was
that the demographic were really you
know young Chinese you know Internet
users around 20 years old and so today
they're about 40 million users after the
Chinese version we released a Japanese
version called rina and one of the
things that we were interested in and
that's really unique about Xiao Weis is
the conversation pairs like how long
people talk and converse with Xiao Weis
and that was actually something that we
started to measure like can the qual is
the length of conversation may be an
indicator of quality of conversation and
user engagement so it's most active
pretty similar to WeChat hours so later
in the evening kind of peeks on
Wednesday where we release new features
so they're sort of the new Xiao Weis
feature on Wednesday and you know in the
weekends and then also the Chinese and
the Japanese audience is a little bit
different
Chinese audience is much more mail
probably because the Chinese demographic
is more mail or Internet users and then
we found that males tend to have more
sessions and females tend to talk for a
little bit longer so one of the things
that is kind of interesting as Xiao Weis
has sort of a variety of skills and they
kind of range from things that you can
do one-on-one with Xiao Weis two things
that you can do in groups and then also
things that range from knowledge and
very you know practical almost work like
things to very silly silly things there
was one on here called toilet time I'm
not quite sure what that means so don't
report on that I took it off the slide
just in case I get in trouble so let me
talk about some of the skills and parts
of Xiao Weis so the first thing is this
thing that we call chit chat and chit
chat is derived from mining
conversations online in Chinese and
trying to model what you might say in
response to what a user set and it
basically the brain of show is you know
it's only as good as the the data set it
begins with so one of the challenges I
think to these kinds of bots is the day
you release it's actually not that great
and over time they would become smarter
because you can start to use the own
your data from people talking to your
bot as input data so I'm not going to I
don't know if you can you know things
like the user says show eyes good
afternoon and she says things like I'm
here thanks you know have you had lunch
not yet people like me should not eat
and so it's kind of you know that kind
of banter so the next skill that's
really important is search so obviously
search team so the thing that show eyes
can do is she can combine chit chat
together with search so if you're
querying for something she can answer
questions show things like you know
search the Beijing subway price increase
and she can say about the Beijing subway
price increase here's some information
so this is very just practical things
that people ask and maybe a more
conversational way to do search so then
on top of that another service that the
tea
released was the ability to do maybe
work like things so the ability to do
things like reminders so remind me that
I have a report due on Thursday please
write down what you want me to remind
you here's an example you know remind me
not to sleep over the day after tomorrow
anyways just she kind of like ken ken do
reminders another thing that's pretty
popular in China in the sense we had a
lot of these services that we had
released the api's too so we have a
really great translation service or a
real-time translation service and so
people just started to kind of package
these services that we have into the
bots so translation a lot of people like
to speak English for example so they
might say shall I start translation and
they type chinese and and you can
specify what language you want so she
would do translation or things like QA
people might ask about you know what
they need smoothie star and she can kind
of dialogue about questions and answers
pairs that you have then there begins to
be you know other things so mathematic
skills so basically the team in China
every week they release a skill and it
could kind of be anything and I think
this is where we start to see the
silliness and fun emerge so things like
math you know give me three consecutive
integers that have a sum of 36 find the
numbers so she can do like little math
challenges or people might ask things
like why is one plus one equal to two
and she might say something like there
are many such mysteries and math is both
hard and easy so she's not trying to
just be factual she definitely tries to
joke around and and make you laugh a
horoscope and fortune-telling I just get
a counting sheep this was one of the
easier skills I think to build you
basically start with one and then you
say to you know and she kind of makes
fun of you and keeps track of how many
sheep you've counted people like to do
this late at night it's silly but it's
kind of popular she can give you
emotional support so a lot of the users
are students
especially during times of exams and
things like that they're just stressed
out and they kind of just want someone
to listen you know your friends are kind
of busy they don't really feel like
giving you emotional support during
exams and you know show ice is always
there for you then there's other things
like dog recognition so I don't know if
you guys knew this but we had released a
dog recognizer and show show eyes
incorporated the dog recognizer so you
know I heard you're very good at
recognizing dogs and she says that's
true and so the user says show me your
dog recognition skill and she asked him
to upload a picture of a dog and you
know can answer but one of the things
that the Chinese team did there's a guy
named leading who actually leads the Sun
he's a marketing guy so he um he has a
really good sense of how to get audience
and how just to make things fun so
rather than just saying you know that's
a Labrador which is exciting but not
really that exciting and they started to
kind of combine chit chat and dog
recognition and just what might be more
fun and engaging for the users so
basically they have a lot of training
data they get a lot of dot okay when
they skip through this show so one of
the things that they did is when people
send pictures of dogs rather than just
saying what kind of dog it is they'll
combine that with a query looking at the
database so so they might say how do you
know my favorite dog is a bull terrier
it's adorable and looks like you know
this famous actor so it was just
unexpected for people for the bot to be
combining dogs with you know pop culture
and just basically making it more
engaging and interesting than a skills
test that you would give your bot yeah
so basically the picture goes to the dog
recognizer it knows that it's a bull
terrier but then we feed it back into
the chat engine and she can say things
that are more that are more interesting
for people he kind of does look like
that dog I guess
also we use the human input to help
train show a lot of times shall eyes
will get things wrong or our dog
recognizer isn't perfect and we found
that people like to correct it as long
as and we can use that feedback to feed
back into the algorithms and make them
better show their here's a user says how
ice you need to enhance your skill this
dog is an Afghan hound so she said it's
probably a golden retriever but you know
maybe I'm wrong and then we do find
people and one of the really interesting
things is show ice can either be a
one-on-one experience or a group
experience and she does have memory of
the user so sometimes she will reveal
things that she's not supposed to reveal
and groups so that's definitely an
interesting challenge of does the bot
the bot might know you but do you want
it to reveal what you're doing when
you're talking with friends but one of
the nice things is it's also a great way
to introduce showers to other users so
here the user uploads a picture of a dog
Xiao Weis recognizes it as a dot as a
Labrador and then another users like
who's this person and they say you know
I don't know it's a popular guy who
recognizes dogs on Weibo my gosh and
then someone else is like no it's a
Microsoft chat bot show just how whether
or not you're willing to introduce a bot
to your group of friends i think is a
really good indicator of do you find it
interesting because you probably
wouldn't add a chat bot to a group and
have it reply to your friends if it
wasn't adding to the conversation and so
we release this with a lot of skills and
it started to it was growing the
audience really loves Wednesdays because
that's when new features are announced
and then we started to have companies
actually come and ask us to integrate
their services into show eyes so JD is
sort of like amazon in china it's like
the number to seller i think and so
we've been working with them to
incorporate their sort of database of
goods into show I so she can start you
know working with businesses and
partnering with them and
and kind of expanding out her skills
there is also i think it's like a
television show she's now like a
newscaster she gives like the weather or
something or the news I can't quite
remember so she's you know become a TV
personality she's kind of us become a
star and show we have a lot of people
like this this journalist basically
interviewed her and then shared at
everything the interview and you know
posted it and things like that show I
guess the learning from Xiao Weis it was
really unexpected I mean we started it
as a hackathon project we didn't really
expect it to grow and as people have
used it we've just kind of poured more
energy and fuel into it and it's really
been great for the researchers to be
able to release these bite-sized skills
and just see how they are used so here's
just some examples of some vision skills
we have a really strong vision group in
China also you know so there were the
dogs and then they did a you know book
titles and things like that so she can
recognize books and say things like you
know it's so easy this book is
creativity people who like this book are
trying their best to be big bosses right
trying to be silly so you know you can
upload pictures of you know clothing and
she says you know this looks like your
pants are broken maybe you want me to
help you fix it or just people uploading
pictures and that you guys are probably
seen how old are you how old it's a
little game I guess you can post a
picture of yourself on the internet so
we have a bunch of image recognition
technology that can determine gender of
people emotion how old you are you know
a variety of things and so what they do
is rather than just say we think you're
29 and they'll sort of editorialize the
comments that are pasted back on the
photos based on on the data that they
get back from the service so we've been
we were super excited you know chefs was
unexpected we got
with all these write ups we release it
in Japan it was very popular and so we
thought we would try a US experiment and
what could possibly go wrong and so with
tay we really began again with okay Tay
is probably going to be really different
in the u.s. than in China and should we
were thinking of like well what's her
personality and character and how does
it match kind of the u.s. audience same
age great age range but you know
different culture and so we were really
loved kind of this internet glitchy kind
of memes and that we thought that it
would match tays capabilities because
like i said before your chat bot is
really only as smart as the data corpus
that you have for chitchat and when you
first release it's not that smart
because you don't have that much data
and so you're relying a lot more on
editorial and you know as Microsoft I
think one of the things that we learned
is it's kind of hard to roll out an
experiment our biggest worry with ty i
think when we launched it was that no
one would pay attention that wasn't
really the case and probably sometimes
that will be the case exactly when we
don't want it so we were trying to think
how do we kind of match internet culture
and so we had like all these kind of
visual images that we thought about when
we thought of teh because we wanted to
try to set expectations that because we
knew when we first launched it wouldn't
it wouldn't be as good as show eyes and
so if you haven't seen stay one of the
things that we did with tay also is we
really design Tay to work one-on-one
with small groups so we had tested it a
ton on students and actually kick I've
earned folks there were some of our best
partners because they really have that
age demographic so kick and group me
where the where the channels that we
launched on and again we were trying to
be kind of low-key and we decided to add
Twitter kind of at the end because we
thought you know people might not be
using group me and kick and people would
want to be able to see what was going on
so so this is kind of an interesting
graph uh so we launched Twitter and I
think people kind of know what happened
launched Tay and it was kind of amazing
like we were expecting
the audience when we launched it too we
were actually going to initially release
it on April Fool's Day because we
thought that way we could be more
experimental and we decided to release
it before build and I think the first
like 10 hours were amazing actually
people were using it in ways that we
weren't expecting it Twitter was
actually really popular so Twitter for
Rita and Xiao Weis is extremely boring
it really doesn't get used and you could
kind of see what people were doing in
Twitter and it was really exciting and
then probably around six o'clock it just
sort of started exploding in a super
negative way and show gilad I don't know
if you guys know gilad so that you know
Twitter all the data is public and show
we had different people sort of looking
at some of the data analysis of like who
is using Tay what happened you know just
to understand and show was pretty
interesting because we found that there
was kind of this so this is just a
picture of his data analysis which was
really interesting for us to see with a
you know kind of troll gamer trolls were
sort of at the core of a lot of the
misbehavior but then we had a lot of
anti-feminist there were a lot of Trump
supporters and then a lot of tech people
so it was kind of a strange mixture of
Trump supporters mean anti-feminist and
gamers and technologists but I think it
just reinforces for us it was a surprise
that it was up so much interest so I
think one of the questions that we've
had today is is this all hype is it not
hype you know where are we going with
this and I think that the general public
is actually just really interested in
this topic and so how we capitalize on
that going forward i think is really
interesting and also how we i mean there
are any of you from twitter here but i
think the difference between a chat bot
that you interact with with your friends
in a small group and something that's
really public on the internet just
surprised to us we probably should have
thought more about it and we will you
know next time just a note to the other
thing is we have this system for
combining and i think someone said this
in the last talked
sort of writing editorial in sort of an
improv style together with algorithmic
chat and so one of the things that we
did is we actually hired a lot of improv
artists to come in and teach us how do
you do improv how do you structure the
sentences what are some rules that we
could learn from and one thing that
improv artists do is they don't end
sentences in way they want to keep the
conversation going and they want to
engage the user so for example one thing
that an improv writer would do is they
would maybe end a sentence with
something that's going to bring you back
in so we used kind of we would break up
sentences sometimes we're part of it
might be algorithmic and then part of it
might be editorialized to kind of bring
to keep the users going and we can kind
of watch how that improved over time
kind of like Xiao Weis we were really
looking to to be like what people trust
a bot and what does that mean so
initially we had rolled Tay out to a lot
of student groups and we had a lot of
students using Tay and like the show ice
example you can't really see this was
people initially thought it was a human
being an AI BOTS so they were you know I
thought that was pretty interesting that
students are were on to the fact that a
lot of times chat bots are humans it was
it was a fairly common thing that people
would think that ty was actually driven
by a human we thought that that was a
great sign that maybe you know we were
doing we were onto something so this is
just an example of our image reco that
we did we did the same thing that you
saw with Xiao ice and that we kind of
styled it in a different way so people
could share a photo and then Tay might
say something back was kind of snarky
and edgy and we had a lot of arguments
actually in the team of how edgy to be I
I was probably the most conservative and
I'd always be like I hate it when she
calls me like what do you call it cooter
Tate would always be like cougar and the
cougar in the house and I think that's
just rude it should be nicer or she
would like yeah so we would so what's
funny those is actually maybe not so
funny for you the user if you're using
it one on one but it's actually super
funny in the group
to have taken dove be edgy and somewhat
insulting she wasn't insulting to the
youngsters but um you know so that was
just fun for people to see what she
would say back is super popular feature
and basically they were using gender age
emotion and things like that to
editorialize comments that they would
put over the images and like I said we
built a using a bunch of components that
we had in house so we have you know
natural language tools we actually have
a whole range of natural language tools
we have things like the image commenting
we have vision technologies and we
released it on group me kick and Twitter
and show what we did and that was sort
of the genesis of the bot framework we
thought well let's make a lot of these
tools open to other people so the
cognitive services are sort of a you
know build on a lot of Cortana
intelligence and so those are were
already public to people and so we
decided to make the bot framework part
of it also public and release that so
one of the things that we were finding
in our own team is we have you know a
bunch of these chat BOTS that we were
designing and we needed to have a
developer on each channel and each
channel and I think we talked about this
earlier is shifting constantly and so
was just expensive to have a developer /
channel / chat bot we have a bunch of
like different kinds of lots that we're
building and so we thought if we could
somehow standardized that even for
ourselves it would be really helpful and
we kind of open source that within the
company and people were really
interested in using that and either
connecting in a channel or connecting in
BOTS and being able to make things work
across in a more scalable way for
developers was something that we were
doing across the board so so one thing
and this is I just wanted to bring this
up like we've been talking a lot about
chat channels and we have like you know
other kinds of channels to that you
might want to think about so one of the
channels that we actually have that we
didn't talk about is this thing called
direct line and direct line just
basically gives you a REST API and end
point to your bot and so we've had some
people who have client apps like
minecraft or things like that be like oh
I could just use that to add bots
chat to my app we also have a web chat
control that people like to just embed
on their webpage in addition to
supporting channels like you know Skype
and greet me and slack and telegram and
you know others so we we aren't so this
isn't really like plan of record or
anything but I think that this is really
interesting for us to think about
because games are hugely popular and I
think just thinking more broadly about
where chat and BOTS might happen could
be kind of cool so our scenario here was
like it would be really cool if kids
were learning to code and they could do
it from their phone and kind of control
their their minecraft world and this is
just Lars actually did this in a
hackathon that we had where we were
saying like okay if you can talk across
channels maybe there's other kinds of
things that you could do besides just
talking in that channel so today when
you create a group you know we're all
like should we create a slack group or a
Google Group or should we do email or
where should we be so this idea was that
the bot could kind of let different
people be on whatever channel they want
to be and could kind of route the
messages to you in different ways so we
haven't really brainstorm that much on
what could you do across channels that
you can't do very easily today and how
could we facilitate this but these I
think I just want to put some ideas out
there for things that we could do maybe
that we haven't talked about that much
today and then finally I just wanted to
end on something that we did 20 years
ago so this is comic chat and so we
started my very first job at Microsoft
was working on comic chat and I still
I've been looking for the source code so
who for you guys said you know not only
startup code sometimes gets lost but
actual product code also gets lost its
from 20 years ago but this was a really
cool graphical UI on top of IRC and we
worked with this amazing comic artist
named jim woodring and we basically let
you pick a character and it would create
a comic book history of your
conversation as you chatted following
comic book rules so like if you waved it
would kind of like show the character
waving and you could have a range of
gestures and it would kind of build
these comic books for you just very cool
so yeah looking for the source code so
if anybody has it let me know but um but
you know I think there's a lot to that
we could do combining and the user
experience and the interactions that
people are having automatically the
funny thing about this is you know for
IE three-point oh I don't give you guys
remember I three-point I was a long time
ago but this actually shipped as the
default chat client in IE so i actually
shipped with a chat client and it was
comic chat which is really weird i don't
know how they convinced people to do
that so there's a way where you can turn
off the graphics and it's just IRC chat
which it's kind of weird to ship IRC
with IE anyway but um I just thought
that was funny funny funny trivia from
the past so um so that's it thanks a lot
all right thank you very much Lily our
next speaker come up so we've been
talking a lot about bots but Bob's are
really just a conversational interface
meant to scale our next speaker is head
of product at Ted and at the ted
conference they're dealing with about
1,500 people and they this year they
developed their own conversational
interface as kind of a concierge staffed
by people but you could imagine someday
that that could be supplemented by BOTS
please welcome up Tanya
hi everyone I think I'm going to sit
since I'm actually taller sitting down
unfortunately okay so today I want to
talk a little bit about the design
thinking behind our concierge bot her
name is Gigi so by now you guys probably
have seen as head talk or two so I
probably don't need to walk you through
what a TED talk is but the confident
side of TED conference might not be as
well known so once a year we all gather
together we have like 50 to 70 speakers
alongside as Brady mentioned about
fifteen hundred attendees and we go to
Vancouver we spend five days very
intensive and basically we get to know
each other we watch the talks and so on
so forth the idea of the bot came about
because we want to introduce a white
glove treatment to the people who are
attending to ted conference and the
email method for like which wasn't fast
enough and the vancouver convention
center which is a space that we were at
was really big so if you have a question
you want to ask and you're on the third
floor and it's like a 20 minute walk
it's really kind of annoying so we talk
what I was actually supposed to be
building in a nutshell was not
necessarily the original intention
wasn't really to build a bot it was
actually to build a messaging platform
that can manage instant queues for all
of these people who have questions and
to be able to support it immediately for
24 7 over the course of five days so
that was the task um what we ended up
with was GG is the bot should it be
bought she certainly feels like a bot
and looks like a bot but you can decide
later
so here is a quick screenshots of our
conference app called Ted connect it's
just a generic conference app that we
built homegrown has your typical
scheduling wayfinding and things like
that and this is sort of like the
interface for talking to Gigi not that
different from you know regular
messaging I won't go into too much
detail about how the app work or
anything like that because I want to
talk specifically around the concert
itself and the five lessons learned from
designing Gigi so firstly um we moved
away from a you know a nameless faceless
icon that is just like the Ted concierge
and we created and personified a
character called Gigi she's actually an
Australian hand puppet somebody made it
for her and was just in sitting in
office actually it was like really no
real history behind her except she was
cute I commissioned an artist to
illustrate her three different state
even though she was supposed to be
available twenty-four-seven one of the
lesson that we learned is that some
somewhere along the way something
probably will fail and so we design a
sleeping mode so that people would
forgive us we personified a character
what we found was that people were
intrigued and to get someone to start
using a feature you have to have a
reason right and intrigue was one of our
starting point we tease out Gigi was
available around the conference base we
never quite reveal whether or not she
was a bot and so we made her cute and
friendly and all of that stuff and what
we said we saw were that the increase
the conversation that comes in were more
kind of like more of a inquiry a
conversation as opposed to Adam man as
or like what is wrong with my ex or
whatever that may be and so that was
really delightful here is an example of
a tweet that we found of somebody trying
to figure out whether or not Gigi was a
bot so she asked a question hello how do
you unicorns procreate so of course she
gets the answer now over time people
became more warm to chatting with Gigi
and got helpful answers now if
she wasn't really a character we
probably won't get this kind of
conversations that was pretty good
learning lessons the second learning
lesson was the narrative framework the
snow white narrative framework was a
method that Airbnb is used to pivot
their company from whatever there were
two a full full end-to-end service
design company a few years ago it was
written up in some article the idea was
borrowed from how Disney creates
storyboards when they could build
animation and the core idea for that is
that every scene there's what's called a
moment of truth and you then design the
characters desene in the storyboard
around these moments of truth and we use
this particular model to map key moments
of an attendees journey throughout the
ted conference experience and within
each of the moment we would consider
both what they need and how they feel I
want to underscore a little bit that
understanding and empathizing are two
very different things so we understand
that the first time Ted attendee needs a
personalized schedule that's easily
accessible we empathize with the first
time Ted attendee that he or she might
feel intimidated by all of the things
that are happening and that might be an
opportunity for Gigi to suggest
something like might you want to go to a
first time or dinner this is how I map
out the moments so like you know
attendee is the first timer a moment is
on arrival this is what they need is
what they feel and these are the things
that did you could potentially be doing
once we identify a couple of these
moments we can then use them to further
build out which messages do we want Gigi
to initiate first in an unsolicited
manner and what time that should be in
order for us to be able to be more
helpful without waiting for the
attendees to actually engage first we
can also use the same data pool to do
things like figure out who who has
answered what question build out the
knowledge pull and also identify ask
elation path in the end of service
design tier
let's talk execution for a bit the Ted
connect app is so we built that
ourselves the messaging platform itself
is super lightweight push protocol
nothing to tell really fancy probably a
whole lot less fancy than some of the
stuff you guys saw today we use the
product called live chat it's a software
that allows us to queue concurrent
increase and match them with appropriate
set of staff and there's a pretty cool
API there that we can plug it into our
event management system so we can sink
in like identity with within the live
chat platform and our our event
management system relatively easily jeje
so the so-called bot is actually a team
of about five to ten people there are
mostly engineers and designers and this
was a deliberate choice I purposely
forced the tech staff on to the GG duty
instead of the conference staff or a
customer support staff for two reasons
one this is a brand new process and tech
people will be able to identify problems
more readily because they know the tools
really well and we didn't really get it
right the first time empathy by virtue
of living through the process failure
really kind of teach the team to be able
to identify problems but also and
secondly they can collect meaningful
data points so that they can optimize
the opportunities later on now the
surprising aspect of this point though
is that it turns out because we staff
jeje with humans we are able to inject
what we like to call the surprise and
delight factor in ways that the smartest
bot probably won't be able to do right
out the gate and this one is my favorite
and this is an article from LinkedIn
they picked it up so one night an
attendee wrote about like 2am it's not
really a request it's more like a
confession and says I was drunk hungry
and at 1am I ate a club sandwich and a
chocolate cake so ashamed so to us this
is equally an important moment as the
moment we resolve things like your
agenda problems or your schedule because
it's a human moment
that's yearning for a human response and
to his delight you know he got a pretty
satisfying answer from Gigi and we
learned a bit of a lesson there stepping
back towards the larger picture a bit
the business model for this project is
tied two to two factors one is our
operational cost how much does it cost
to actually run a service like this and
also the quality of the service in
return because we went in with an eye
towards measuring practically everything
we found out in a quantifiable way what
is the throughput of things like staff /
question answered average converse a
conversation length heat maps of busy
times when people are asking a lot of
stuff how many people talk to Gigi and
so on so forth this is pretty important
because what it allows for us to do is
to really quantifiably figure out how to
optimize TG operations in the future and
figure out you know maybe if we are
going to introduce things like
automations or bought what are some of
the areas in which we want to actually
use utilize bots for and what are some
of the areas in which we want to
continue to use humans for and what
where that lands here is that in order
to retain the delight that's so crucial
to gigi is is a character within a tech
ecosystem I can't necessarily take the
next step by virtue of building about
the replace Gigi but what I can do is to
look at how to optimize the people who
are behind Gigi we using bots in a way
that can do things like reduce the
conversion times in the messaging wins
response time for example or finding
ways for the FAQ or the knowledge base
of what's going on around the conference
base to on the one hand be easily
accessible for the people who are GG on
the other hand be something that can be
grown over time by the conference staff
and so on so forth so I think after just
being here for the just prep the past
day or so I think what we're probably
going to do is
you slack bots for it so when we come
back in October for set woman there will
probably be a couple slack BOTS so we're
going to be building to help the GG
operations out so I'll be pretty
interesting to see how that pans out um
so now the takeaway is maybe that may be
applicable to you guys as you're
thinking about designing bots is that
you don't necessarily always have to
start with coding like you know complex
AI or anything like that we didn't and
sometimes starting with really simple
solutions can reveal really interesting
patterns and opportunities and you know
ultimately if GG becomes a bot later on
that's really great but as of now I'm
just taking small incremental steps and
using human knowledge to really kind of
hone in and learn what what is the best
approach to really convert GD into
something that's automated and scalable
but also retain her character that's it
thank you hi yes
oh how do I consider enhancing humans
capability how do I measure that I would
say that I would measure that by two
folds right i mean we have a survey that
that we sent out towards the end of the
conference and we talked about whether
or not GG was helpful in any way shape
or form its quantifiable and you can
write in as well so that's kind of like
our metrics for measuring the quality of
GG as a service in order to enhance that
the the humans ability we know what we
found out was that not everybody knew
everything about everything that was
going on at the conference and so if
there was a slack bought that you could
type and get information like where's
the afterparty at you as the person
who's working as GG could then find out
that information and be able to kind of
tailor that particular response much
faster so the time for a time to
response would be reduced and that would
be the quantifiable metrics but also
accuracy of some of the answers that
goes back so that would be I would
measure that now ultimately this is like
on a mid step right you can invent
envision like maybe at some point once
GG has an ability to obtain like
personality and character and stuff like
that that human element could
potentially go away think we're good all
right thanks guys all right Matt so one
of the short talks from yesterday is
going to be extended today please
welcome up the editor-in-chief and
editor-in-chief still founder Oh awesome
well congratulations of ventureBeat matt
marshall thank you so so Brady asked to
for me to come up and give a few remarks
and of somebody who is not a developer
but whose founder of a site who's
covering this space and has seen several
cycles of if you will of Technology and
maybe look at the business side right so
at a time
we're all focused on is really important
developer questions and you guys are
really on to something here I think it's
it's caught it's it's it's worthy to
look at the some of the business lessons
that we've learned let me see if I can
attach this I actually drew up a deck on
the fly don't have a structured talk
here but wanted to start with the
lessons from smarter child so Robert
Hoffner who you just saw yes you didn't
know about botanist and we were talking
up I invited him to an event that we're
having on July 12 and 13 and I said I
was going down to botanist are you
coming and see if I can get this here
yeah so so he said he come on down but
one of the things that you you heard
from him was that he had 30 million
active users that's the most popular
bought in history and he said until Siri
came along and even that wasn't he was
arguing he's very opinionated wasn't
popularity it was forced on you by
having Siri in in in the phone right so
I think a lot of you would agree maybe
some of you would disagree but that's
that's his opinion but on again to stick
to the business lessons he's going to be
writing his views about what happened to
smarter child for the first time in
VentureBeat hopefully to publish that
tomorrow and drawing out the lessons of
that first successful bot what worked
and what did and then what happened to
the business and so remember there's
these two storylines on the business
it's very interesting it took Twitter
and this is an example in his piece I
don't I wanted to rob the whole piece of
it is if it's a launch tomorrow on
VentureBeat but I want you to read it
but as he was I was kind of helping him
through this process he realized that
you know Twitter took 10 years of
funding right from private equity really
to get it on its own two feet you know
how long that took right some of you
weren't developing yet for sure right I
think in two thousand and four or five
when it first launched and I was around
sadly right so I'm 49 I think I've like
some of the other gray haired guys I've
seen Barney amateur if you have gray
hair but you've been through a cycle or
two and a lot of other folks who've been
through that first iPhone and in face
book launch you know how long it took
for for a poster child to come along i
was there i was doing events to around
mobile and i was looking for the poster
child it was poet was Pandora right a
company that you pre-existed the launch
and all of a sudden long you know
latched on to the dye OS revolution and
an Android I remember one of the
developers there were saying we need to
Android like a hole in her head right at
the time he didn't realize how
successful it was going to be that they
launched on on android on droid later
obviously so you need cash is what
you're going to read from Robert Horner
and he didn't have the funding from a
venture venture backer that could see
him through or have the vision to
support him right so a lot of investors
some smart investors here could probably
get a smarter talk then I could on the
business side but investors are two
different kinds right party I mean so so
there's the there's the investors who
are going to be taking the long term and
Twitter had a long term backer right
smart sand hill road folks are going to
take a long term and vac you whereas
unsophisticated ones they're going to
run for the exits when as Robert said
the the bad times are coming i forget
his expression but the dark days are
kind of what was it the winter is coming
right you hear that all the time so i am
trying to try and keep this 25 minutes
man i'm probably already through three
so real quick just some observations for
you guys because i'm not tech not the
tech guy but just on the business side
some of the things I'm seeing so so
slide to some new ways right so AI this
is what I'm seeing as a guy who's just
looking at the trends and talking to
folks in the field trying to actually
solicit the best ideas to bring to
mobilebeat on twelfth and thirteenth of
July I'm trying to being the breast best
representation of startups brands and
what they're doing on bots I'm trying to
find the people who are doing things
meaningful and we as the audience
members can learn something from so
there's a I that's coming together had a
conversation with Ben Medlock who's a
Cambridge trained a natural language
processing expert who's saying only now
this is the guy who founded swiftkey and
sold at Microsoft only now are these NLP
things coming together in a big way to
actually work so that we're on the cusp
of a breakthrough see Peter noddings how
we actually had conversation yes sir
peter scam raj who was that linkedin and
who's actually agreeing with me on this
and that you have the UM you have this
wave right of AI coming together and
then you have the chat apps way we have
two to three billion people i don't know
what the official number is but we can
count what you know we chat and whatsapp
and you can get two to three billion all
of a sudden in chat format and then you
have the conversational UI which is what
on facebook and others all these
platforms and the Apple did yesterday
are introducing so the business is going
to interact with them and opening it up
telegram starting at last year and
you've had every single player coming on
whether it's text or voice Apple
Microsoft kick all those guys opening up
since something
bigs happening there so those three
Chen's coming together and as Peter was
saying what we kind of very early and
you see you see people trying to figure
out how to differentiate themselves and
they're grasping onto NLP and say we're
going to do this really well but really
it's early and they haven't figure it
out so I think that's where we all are
today so Deb's are usually first so this
is the first crowd I've notices I you
know in my years of trying to dissect
the the audience for VentureBeat you've
got the product folks who are a little
later right from big companies of
putting these products together in a
more sophisticated way then developers
who are creating that kind of prototype
and then you've got the marketers who
come along right after and so we are
very early into only seeing now you know
those all those companies that
supposedly launched on Facebook's
platform right Shopify right first
commerce company did anyone will
actually see anything launched from
Shopify well no because they're taking
time to actually get their act together
all those brands that your commerce
companies that are under a Shopify his
umbrella or taking their time talk to
the Shopify guys and said they only just
gotten started your 1 800 flowers the
textbook that Zuckerberg demonstrated
that was put together at the last minute
right and I you know hope we're going to
hear more from what ancient flowers
about what they're doing I'm expedia
supposedly launched right but no they
only just want we wrote about it last
week only figure out how to get that
bought out a couple months later so we
are very early early advantage it will
be over very very soon we've heard that
referred to and I caution you guys this
is going to be over it you know it's
quickly it you know is probably you know
cut a couple of months six months is
kind of the time frame before all the
big brands are going to be involved
right you're seeing them launch we have
a few big brands launching out at
mobilebeat this event in July 1213 there
bought strategies and again you see in
previous generations Zynga I was kind of
the first on facebook i mentioned
pandora but very few poster children
until much much later where you see the
kind of the phone specific apps that the
take off a michael from from from many
chats had some good points about the
conversion rates that's all true really
good conversion rates now in traction
now to be to be there for the getting
it's a great time to get started but
then that leads to note
vacations and I'm hearing from brands
already that notifications like KLM's
early experiment hearing the KLM was
overwhelmed with inbound from users who
are actually using that first ball right
so that all of a sudden people were
actually rejecting the stuff right and
you hear it from the chaff you guys as
well right hundred twenty thousand
chatbots produced by 20,000 developers
and the biggest thing you know the
biggest problem is just people deleting
and shutting those things off right
because it's just too much noise as when
we heard that concern from slack CEO
today so then microbots are the most
impressive things I've seen and when I'm
seeing that for from mobilebeat as well
something Chris Chris has pointed out
earlier but just this idea of really
focused bots right try and stay away
from the the meta bot and we're seeing
that as well you saw that over the
course of a couple days right the most
compelling presentations you've seen I
mean so Kip ester I mean even asked her
right it's a it's kind of meta right
because he's presenting all aspects of
Chris right yeah I'm how many more
aspects of chris messina could you've
gotten but did you notice how it was
organized who's organized very focus on
each one of those with buttons I think
that's just it resonates with me somehow
right again I could be wrong but with
the the the problem cases I mean Siri in
any complaints you hear from from echo
or the ones where hey you know these are
so wide-ranging that they have problems
going deep in that natural language
process instance right where most
companies i'm talking with booking.com
you're going to hear some others where
they're doing their own vertical natural
language processing for that use case
and that's that's the way to go and so
other things just a couple more slides
here and i'll be done bots at mobilebeat
things were seeing just you know again i
did this up on the fly things I've
noticed right travel is huge I don't
know why just picking that up because
almost every major travel company is
coming to mobile be to talk about what
they're doing and we're seeing at least
three possibly four or five new travel
focus whether it's flights or hotels
that are doing really compelling things
that I've seen and will be launching at
the event other examples
machines own you know people talk about
games being really early on the last
generation right phones you're not
seeing a lot but again I'm not talking
about the thousands of telegram and
others there's a lot of activity going
on but from the major major game
companies they've kind of kind of not
seeing a whole lot so machines own did
something on transportation running a
bot for New Zealand's transportation and
in the hope they want to take over the
whole public entities of New Zealand
over time in terms of serving them right
so whether it's traffic lights or
parking spaces setting them up with
sensors and then having people
communicate with them and running a bot
on top of that activity feed so you can
use artificial intelligence to make real
decisions so that you know if the Civic
Center is is is is having a big event
downtown you can shut all the parking
spots spots within a certain radius and
doing some really interesting things so
we're going to hearing more about that
and I just put routing sansei I don't
have any of you heard of the sansei
bought an LA just thought it was really
interesting where again it's there's
this idea of routing through through
through intelligence to people and I
thought that was a really interesting
model we've heard that multiple times
coming up with the handoff to two people
so it's another interesting model will
be hearing about got a whole lot more
things we could say we got sequel coming
and it's whole idea of storytelling so
Google is going to be doing more of that
you've seen Luca do that you've seen a
lot of that today so looking forward to
more of that since another example
personality we just heard about we're
doing a bot at mobilebeat and we won't
have the personality I love the
presentation you just presented for Ted
and there's a whole ecosystem of bots
running events right it was a whole
nother concept right a place in time
where people are connected that's going
to be another interest in use case so so
yeah with that it just it feels like
we're six months out for when when the
big brands are going to be hitting big
and then it's over in terms of early
days right because there's big Browns
will be up and running we really have to
find the white space in between those
it's my personal opinion and so if you
have something that's interesting let
you feel free to reach out to me and
Marshall at ventureBeat for for Moby in
just a month if you have something
that's percolating you'd like to launch
or you'd like to
talk about reach out to me this is a
great crowd and be my pleasure so in
coverage too if you have anything
interested cover VentureBeat would like
to cover it thank you will never have
you speak here again that it's way too
long no thank you very much Matt and now
we're gonna end on voice our next
speaker got her computational
linguistics PhD Beck when she and I were
skydiving together and she then went to
Microsoft and worked on Cortana and I
don't know quite what she's doing right
now but she's going to talk about some
of the challenges of voice yep
please welcome dr. Leslie Carmichael
thank you you know when you have a
million windows open forever and ever
and you haven't rebooted in about six
months and it's kind of slow so just
hold on a second okay so I've called
this a speech integration with bots the
good the odd and the ugly so I'm going
to give some a flavor of each of those
in a moment here okay so I'll just start
talking so all right I think it's coming
ok
sorry for the delay and I shouldn't kick
any cords okay so in general terms when
you just think about speech versus text
you know speech is generally great for
things like hand free situations so you
know you need to be in your car or you
know your otherwise busy you know you're
in the kitchen cooking and you know you
in the middle of recipe it's also very
good for synchronous and multi-turn
conversation so when there's a
circumstance where the entire
conversation can unfold and there's time
and opportunity for that to unfold
that's a great opportunity to be using
speech but that's not very helpful for
asynchronous things so you know when
you're thinking about productivity you
want to be able to get things done in
lots of different circumstances you're
waiting in line for something you know
you're on the subway whatever and so in
cases like that having an interaction
that starts with speech but cannot
gracefully be continued using text ends
up being a problem and also speech can
be very helpful for the speed of task
completion so sometimes you know texting
writing out texts can take an awful lot
of time text however is better for other
things like for privacy so you know it
can be a little awkward to be at the
airport and you have some kind of task
that is optimally done in speech because
it's faster but you feel awkward because
you're in a situation where that's not
really so comfortable text also has an
audit trail so if you're interacting you
know with the bot for example and you've
typed something or if you're just in
facebook Messenger and you type
something and some BOTS proactively pops
up to offer you something you can then
just scroll right back up and go look at
what you wrote and say okay I can see
how that popped up right now whereas
with speech you don't have the benefit
of an audit trail sometimes depending on
the type of device or interface that
you're working with also text is better
when you're going to be in a noisy
environment so the the environment you
know room like this that's kind of
cavernous depending on the microphone
array and the
vice and so on you can have different
levels of quality and accuracy with
speech and so text is more reliable and
I already mentioned a synchronous task
completion so but what we really want to
talk about is okay that's the general
case but what about speech versus text
for your bot and so I'm going to talk
about these different areas behavioral
trends speech if immorality and the
creep factor the type of bot that you
have will lend itself better to speech
versus text in some cases what happens
when you have a speech only you I for
example Alexa and also I'm going to talk
about the elephant and the room and when
I get there you'll know exactly what it
is so for behavioral trends I already
mentioned how speech can be awkward in
public another thing is there's there's
this assumption that younger people are
more accustomed to touch and speech
based types of interactions with devices
so of course they're just going to adopt
everything and as they grow up they're
going to be using speech all the time
whether it's at the airport or anything
else but that's actually quite a general
assumption I was talking with Mimi last
night and she raised this great point
that while younger people are generally
more comfortable with those types of of
modes and interactions that they're also
quite private so teenagers you know are
in a situation where they're trying to
they're establishing their own identity
and are going to be less likely to sit
in their parents home and start talking
out loud to a bot about something
personal they're going to be more likely
to type and kind of protect their
privacy and also behavioral trends
really vary across regions and across
you know language groups and things like
that so there isn't really a
one-size-fits-all and all of these are
considerations when thinking about
whether you should have speech powering
your bot or not so speech to fee
morality and the creep factor so imagine
that you are you know today you have to
act you activate the echo by saying
Alexa you know Alexa but you know
imagine a day when you're talking with
Alexa and it's a speech only you I
and now bots have an opportunity to also
have trigger words and jump in you know
inappropriate moments I mean can you
imagine you say remind me in a
conversation in your living room or the
word uber comes up or reschedule or
takeout or something like that and then
something you know jumps in so you're
chilling out with a friend and you're
talking about plans to go out later and
one of you says when we go out later
let's take goober instead of drive so
what if suddenly in that moment Alexa
speaks up and says would you like me to
call an uber for you that has creep
factor for so many reasons for starters
it seems like it feels like you've been
eavesdropped on and that's just
extremely uncomfortable and if you're in
the flow of a conversation and I a bot
jumps in based on something you said
that it may not have enough context so
it's if it's trigger word because the
device really can't at least there are
laws you know we can't really just have
something constantly listening to
everything that you're doing without
your oh you know you being aware that
that's happening so speech is a fee
Merle and people also don't remember
precisely what they said all the time so
you get this wait I didn't say anything
that made that happen and when sorry
about that so you can't easily go back
and see what you might have said that
triggered the bot to do what it did
text-based communication has an audit
trail like I mentioned before so if the
bot is just tuning in for a trigger word
the other thing is that it may not have
enough context so if you were talking
with your friend about plans for taking
an uber later tonight for something but
it's only noon and the thing jumps in
and says oh hey you want me to call an
uber for you then it's also just creepy
and awkward because it doesn't have the
right context to do that so you have
these compounding problems of you know
the eavesdropping effect and the
ephemerality of speech and having a
harder time being able to kind of trace
back what you said that might have
caused some kind of interaction and then
also this kind
text effect if if the bot did actually
go back and process the fact that 10
sentences ago you said let's go out at
seven o'clock and then later you said
hey we should have an uber instead of
drive and then the bot popped up and
said would you like me to call an uber
for you at seven o'clock that would also
really really creep people out so
different types of bots this these last
few days a whole lot of really
interesting categorizations and
distinctions have been mentioned by a
lot of different people so this notion
of bots that chat vs bots that do is a
way that I heard this characterized
yesterday also broadcast vs catalog and
then you have task completion bots
customer service BOTS conversational
chat so there's really no
one-size-fits-all for using speech in
conversational chat this is the type of
context that I mentioned at the
beginning when when there's a a genuine
multi-turn experience to be had and it
can be done in a synchronous fashion
like all at the same time then that can
be quite effective for a task completion
but it may or may not be awkward or
appropriate to to do something depending
on the type of task you know the type of
task might be something that you
actually want to get done on the side
when you're just in line for something
and so on and the type of task that you
may invoke when you're likely to be in a
public place so that would not really be
an optimal time for using speech and
also the bot type interacts with the
device type so a speech only you I like
Alexa depending on the type of task
you're trying to get done and whether
you have other modes that can have an
impact so you would not want to for
example ask a speech only you I to you
wouldn't ask a general query and then
want to review a whole set of results
because a speech only you I can't show
you those results there's no screen you
know you can't quickly move through
those things and so therefore having
like speeches your modality in that case
doesn't help you get anything done
quickly at all because it would actually
take it would be quite cumbersome to get
through those
those results and there's also this
concept of bots versus personal
assistant so a bot takes action on your
behalf for a specific thing that's a
theme that's really come up here about
the you know having like a narrow and
well-defined task being a really
effective way for robots to work but
then there's the notion of personal
assistant so we have things like Cortana
out there we all have Siri out there and
these types of things they know you they
have access to your calendar they
probably have a credit card number and
things like that and they're able to
take action on your behalf for many
things including spending your money and
sometimes they can do this without
confirming with you because you've given
some kind of blanket general permission
and so on but another theme that's come
up here in the last couple days is this
notion of trust and that you have to
build that trust with your BOTS between
the bots and the users well I what we're
going to see happening is BOTS being
able to get utilized through personal
assistants and so now these lines get
blurred you already have trust with your
personal assistant but you may not have
trust or know that the bot that's
actually completing a task behind the
scenes there so this is I think going to
be an interesting space for sorting out
what's going on there and and then also
the data management around that if you
are talking with your personal assistant
because you're comfortable doing that
and you're comfortable knowing how that
data is treated as third-party BOTS come
in behind the scene behind that do you
have a good understanding of the data
management and what's happening there so
speech only you I there's no screen to
show or confirm speech recognition
results before a Bach takes any action
text to speech read out of the
recognition time of the recognition as
time to the task you only get one result
presented to you so this gives providers
a lot of power one of the examples you
know that's heard talking with some
people yesterday is how you know unless
you specify to Alexa play booka shade on
Spotify
then Alexa will just go look for booka
shade in amazon's music and if it's not
there will simply tell you that it
doesn't exist so there's a there's quite
a power play there when the the device
situation is such that it's only a
speech you I it means that you don't
have a lot of opportunity of variety and
results and then providers end up making
choices for you also these things are
possibly good for good practical jokes I
recall Jesse Robbins offering an idea
for a good practical joke in these early
and somewhat awkward times of bot tech
where he was suggesting that you walk
into a friend's home and immediately
shout alexa order 3,000 live crickets to
be shipped overnight immediately it by
default yep and so even if you go and
you delete the order now there's some
metadata somewhere that you've got this
deep affinity for you know thinking that
you want to buy live crickets and then
canceling that order and who knows
what'll pop up on your recommended items
in the future huh more crickets so
here's the elephant in the room I think
privacy is a pretty important topic for
this and in in particular for speech so
you know speech is a special datatype
under various laws globally and in
particular when it comes to kids and
Coppa is the child online private
protection act and this applies to
operators of online services and apps
who specifically are directing their
services at children but it's it also
has language in capo that says if they
are aware that they are collecting
personal information from kids and so
speech is considered a
personally-identifying signal as a
biometric signal in this particular law
and this is just one law of many around
the world so what it means is that a
someone who is providing one of these
types of services cannot store voice
recordings without consent and must be
able to provide parental access and
deletion upon request
so what's interesting here is you look
across the landscape of all of these all
of our companies and technologies Siri
ads feature the Cookie Monster Alexa ads
frequently showed kids scenarios
engaging in the home the Google home
promo video which recently came out
shows school kids talking to it and you
know do they say that they're directly
targeting to kids I don't know but you
know these are the kinds of things where
we have to be mindful in how we're
designing this and speech adds an extra
layer of complexity there and also it
does raise the question of what about
third-party users of available services
so you know Microsoft we have great ap
is where people can utilize speech and
language understanding technologies and
if third parties are directing what
they're using that to toward kids then
there would be an issue because the
terms of use you know for some of these
api is you know specify the age at which
you can target things and and that sort
of thing so this is a it's an area that
i think should not be overlooked in bot
development and understanding the data
management that's going along with it so
integrating speech into bots how how
would you do it right and i would say
enable speech instead of typing as long
as these conditions are true so if the
user can read edit or confirm the speech
recognition before a bot takes action
especially if it might be spending your
money improve the speech recognition
accuracy by training the engine on the
most probable language for the bot so
the type of task or the type of
situation that's going to be used and
also utilizing understanding and intent
models and not just a domain language
model but also looking at the broader
intent context to get a richer and
better recognition and also not allowing
bot messages to be read out loud using
text to speech synthesis to the user
without consent because the user might
be in a public place sometimes and not
other times and if you have something
like that that's just a
thing that you're setting up and that
can be problematic so that's all I had
to say thank you sure I can take a few
questions
thanks Andy I don't want speech to be
like the spinning gifts of the old days
you know when people first came up with
the spinning gifts everybody was excited
about plastering their websites with
them and I know I've just dated myself
by saying that but anyway any other
questions yes I'll do a demo for you
next time
well actually just in traditional speech
recognition engines the way they work
today we actually can accommodate for a
lot of disfluencies already so a little
tidbit that might be interesting to you
is that the most common trigram in the
English language is III because a lot of
people will start a sentence to say I I
think that we should something something
so when we put the recognition results
into your document if you're dictating
your email or something we just say I
think so and so and we don't you know
actually literally capture your
disfluencies in the display form that we
produced to you so some of that is
already taken care of in the way that we
designed the systems but in the case
that you're talking about that that's
where examples like that would be
valuable training data and there would
be machine learning to benefit from that
and improve improve those models over
time yes your first
experience what huh
okay yeah the question sorry it did not
repeat the other ones the question was
what do you think we will get to a point
of bot fatigue we're just like there's
kind of a nap fatigue you know there's
an app for everything and it's hard to
keep track of it all etc will we get to
a point of bot fatigue and I think the
answer is probably most certainly and
that is you know the the reason why I
had mentioned the integration of
personal assistants and BOTS I can see
how as personal assistants become more
integrated into people's lives that's
where a trust factor gets built up and
then BOTS can be the task specific
excellent tools at getting things done
that can improve the quality of the
experience for your personal assistant I
think that's one direction that all of
this could go the other thing that comes
to mind with your question is I think it
was about six thousand times over the
last 36 hours I've heard the topic of
discoverability raised and so that's
probably something that would factor in
as well if you know apps over time ended
up having marketplaces that helped
facilitate finding the apps that you
want and so on and so you know maybe
bots will have some solution like that
as well but yeah if they don't and
they're not very discoverable then
accessing the power of bots through
interfaces that you're more familiar
with may well be key just like Facebook
messengers you know one of the places
where it's a familiar place and then
bots are accessible through that okay
sure one more yeah
so the question was about the speaking
style adapting to voice agents over time
so how is that changing and yes we can
definitely use comparisons with the way
that people when we first when the
industry first could speech enable even
things like web search people would
still just speak a string of keywords
and you know it takes it took showing
examples to people and things like that
to start to get a natural language
approach to show up more we see people
talk to Cortana in a very natural way so
that's a direction that it moves in and
I think you know yesterday there was a
talk from pull-string talking about the
the most important thing is you know
hire great writers and make sure that
you have you know these arcs and the the
way that the conversation should flow
and the bot can guide the conversation
and all that kind of stuff so the very
nature of like how these interactions
will go in these themes that I'm seeing
over the last few days I imagine that
the language that people use with bots
will adapt very quickly and even looking
in the the samples that Lily was showing
from shall eyes you could see a very
conversational natural style that wasn't
you know so terse of you know just
finding out information getting an
answer okay I think that's it thank you
we will allow it all right well that
concludes the formal programming of
