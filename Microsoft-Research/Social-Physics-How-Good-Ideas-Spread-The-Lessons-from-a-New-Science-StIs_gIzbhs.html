hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
thank you for coming I'm Eric Horvitz
the managing director of the Redmond lab
I'm thrilled to welcome sandy Pentland
today to Microsoft Research to the
visiting speaker series sandy is a
friend and a long-term colleague and
he's joining us today as part of his
countrywide book tour on his new book
social physics how good ideas spread the
lessons from a new science
I've known sandy as a pioneering
scientist doing things that are close to
my own own interests and heart he's an
early leader in computer-based
perception and sensory fusion including
pioneering work in vision and also in
the analysis of rich streams of data and
how making inferences from those streams
can give us a sense for human notions of
context as one example of some of his
work several people in research and
maybe many of you in the audience might
know of his work with Mathieu Turk to
develop a methodology called eigenfaces
for face recognition that are that are
used widely now Sandy's publications
have been inspirational
he's also mentored at his years at MIT
many fabulous leaders now renowned
computer scientists in themselves
including several folks who have graced
Microsoft research and Microsoft
Corporation more widely
these include our close colleagues
Matthew Turk I mentioned before on the
eigenfaces and also Nora Oliver who's
now at telefónica after spending a
number of years with us in Microsoft
research over the last 20 years sandy
has moved deeply into an area that's
become to be known as computational
social science and this includes data
centric studies of people and the
networks and the larger organizations
that they compose and he's formulated a
really beautiful and rich research
program in this area at MIT with
multiple projects that help to define
opportunities in this for new
understandings about people in society
that come via sensing and the data
resources that have come available these
such things as mobile devices
and online activities Sandee currently
serves as director of mi t--'s human
dynamics laboratory he also is director
of MIT Media labs entrepreneurial
program I guess is called the
Entrepreneurship program and Co leads
the World Economic Forum big data and
personal data initiatives
his new book social physics comes on the
heels of his prior book honest signals
how they shape our world I just
mentioned team outside that I just
finished that book I have to get front
reading faster I enjoyed it very much
and I look forward to hearing about his
his latest writings please join me and
give sandy a warm welcome good ok so
what I'm going to give you today is a
talk that's actually a sort of general
talk so I'll talk a little bit about the
mathematics a little bit about the
technology but only a little bit because
I think that the audience here is really
quite broad and so if I give something
that sort of a narrow technical talk
that'll cause problems so you have to
forgive me that I'm talking at a sort of
more sort of public popular level I've
created a website it's called social
physics org that has all the original
research and it also has videos of talks
from all of the students that worked on
this and other sorts of resources like
that including several of the world's
biggest richest data sets about human
behavior which are open for no use and I
would encourage you to do that so what
I'm going to talk about today is this
thing called social physics so social
physics has a long history originally
the term came up in the early 1800s when
the idea of sociology first came up
that's science of people and the coiner
of that phrase first started with social
physics you know thinking about it as a
sort of a mechanistic description of
society and quickly sort of figured out
that society is not that way and dropped
it and it came back again in the 1930s
1940s when people like zip
and others discovered these statistical
regularities in human behavior that
looked very much like a lot of sort of
physical type things but those were not
generative processes so they were
interesting descriptives but but they
didn't give you a handle on much to do
so what I'm gonna do is talk about what
happens when modern big data meets
social science and what happens is that
all the things that we know about
political science about economics about
psychology and a lot of medicine are the
result of what are actually very small
data sets and they're very sparse in
terms of time and with the advent of
mobile telephones and credit cards and
cameras and stuff like that you can now
get very rich annotation of people
entire communities for a long period of
time and what that lets you do is that
lets you build really interesting
mathematical descriptions that are
quantitative and predictive of how
communities evolve how ideas change in
communities in a way that was rather
unimaginable previously so that's the
science part of it the other side is the
moment you realize that you can do this
sort of stuff it conjures up all these
you know bad visions and and you realize
very quickly that that Orwell was not a
very creative fellow and we could do an
awful lot more damage than he ever
imagined and so what we ought to think
about is how can we use this new
resource to understand people to build a
better society a more creative society
but also one that's safe for people so
that'll be the second half of the talk
so the first thing I want to do is just
show you this qualitative thing this is
something that along here is duration of
observation and this is something like
number of bits per second or bits per
minute
you know bits isn't quite the right
measurement but but this is the big
thing is is that if you look at most
social science it's down here around 0-0
so what it is is this freshman in cycle
1 billion Oh to serve a couple of bits a
minute short period of time small number
of people over here you get things that
are like the Framingham Heart Study 30
years of tens of thousands of people but
they only talked to the people once
every three years and they collect about
30 numbers so the bit rates about zero
moreover they do it in a way that's a
snowball sampling technique so that you
can't ask what happened to the average
population I mean you get to see this
guy here he has higher cholesterol there
maybe he ain't nothing but Kentucky
Fried Chicken in between but you don't
know okay
because you never collected that most
recently we've had some big data studies
so telcos credit card companies have
given us quote-unquote anonymous data
that lets us look at human behavior so I
might lab for instance we had six years
of credit card data for about a hundred
million Americans think about that and
and you know it was actually behind
firewalls and all of us it was pretty
safe right
never got hacked and we have telco data
like for this we have telco data sort of
calls mobility and credit card records
for several million people in a midsize
country south of us you know so the
incredible things but they're very
narrow because while you get lots of
data points every day you don't know
anything about the person right so it's
hard to know how this really uh this
data is giving you a perspective about
human behavior so what I did is I
started a project to get rich datasets
where it was really sort of the God's
eye view everything we could collect and
I did a variety things we built hardware
that has sensors in it
blue main badges and we would get
everybody in an organization to wear
this for a month and what we would do is
know where they were who they talked to
how their body language was what the
tone of voice was we did not record
content ever okay because people get
freaked out about it and
also a lot of the things that you might
imagine as an operational system in the
real world you wouldn't want to have
content in there so it was trying to
stay away from that so those are some of
these studies here in the middle where
you know we'd look at people for a month
a hundred people for a month and we
could see every single conversation and
we could look at also behavior because
we collect all the electronic stuff and
then other sorts of studies that we do
are with phones so we would give out
phones smart phones to everybody in a
small community so we would do for
instance partment building with 65 young
families give them all phones we would
collect human subjects right so we'd
give them informed consent we would pay
them we'd give them the phone and then
we collect you know where do they go who
do they call who do they spend time with
their Facebook activity their credit
cards even we got things like these EEG
things that Zio's makes so we have their
EEG at night and you discover all sorts
of interesting things but it's much
richer than any of the social science
we've seen before that's the point we
have all these communication channels we
have it densely you know every 16
milliseconds for a year for all the
people and we tried to pick sites where
the social networks were contained so
very insular communities and the part
that's interesting about this of course
is the tan up there is where the world
is heading as things become more and
more digitized the experiments I'm doing
are gonna look a little thin okay
because the world is gonna be so digital
that we're gonna know everything about
everybody potentially and so we want to
ask what is it can be learned what can
we do with it the short-term thing is is
that we can begin using this big data to
build mathematical models of human
behavior that are actually quantitative
predictive verifiable refining so that's
really been the problem with most social
science and most medicine is that you'd
not have enough data over all the
channels all the ways of interaction to
be able to ask what were the causal
connections and the typical sort of
modeling we do which I'm not going to
talk about much is you think about all
these people interacting
all the channels is this huge Markov
model okay except that that's too many
parameters to actually estimate so we do
a slight simplification where the
influence that I have on you is limited
to my state and your state and then
there's a fixed parameter what that does
is gives you log of the number of
parameters and it turns out that you can
use e/m methods to actually solve for
everybody has their own finite state
machine a hidden Markov model and we
have parameters of influence between
them and you can actually do this pretty
real realistically we've done it for an
order of ten percent of all the people
in a mid-sized country looking at their
car patterns for instance so you can
really do this sort of stuff but it
scales halfway reasonably well but the
big thing is is you can actually solve
the equations so what do you find when
you solve the equations well here's the
things that I want you to really pay
attention to because they're things that
we typically get wrong and I think the
people in this room get wrong so one is
as this diagram comes from Danny
Kahneman's Nobel Prize lecture it talks
about having two ways of thinking in
humans there's a fast and a slow it's a
little bit of a cartoon but not much of
a cartoon and he has a Nobel Prize and
you don't so we get to do okay and what
you might ask is okay the slow for those
who haven't read the book is the
rule-based sequential thinking that we
do is the thing that we spend all of our
time we go to college about this and
then the fast is this associational
mechanism it's you know tens if not
hundreds of millions of years old it's
based on experience it's actually
interesting that this is better than
this if you have the right experience
and it's a complicated program problem
if you have lots of variables lots of
trade-offs this is much better it's
basically a sort of a partisan estimate
of a complicated surface this we all
know has some computational complexity
problems and is very unstable with
respect to assumptions and initial
conditions okay so in fact if you look
at people you see that probably this is
90 95 % of
thing we do because it's very fast it's
quite accurate and this is what we use
to catch the bugs okay but another
interesting thing is is you might ask
how do these types of thinking learn
where does their database come from and
this is where we often make a mistake in
the data that we have I call learning in
this system exploration and it's a thing
that's called simple contagion in the
sociological literature so it only takes
one exposure to an idea for it to go
into your conscious thinking rule-based
stuff somebody says oh deez are very
expensive
okay well that's in your head now you
can sort of think about that okay and
we're we're very profligate with us we'd
like to have lots of ideas and so forth
lots of things that we think about and
we know through but what's interesting
is is that this has very little to do
with this it's very hard to get from
here to there you can think about you
know how hard is it to stop smoking even
though I tell you smoking will kill you
right 50 years later people still
smoking right I mean all sorts of habits
are very poorly coupled to what we think
about the habits so and that's perhaps
as it should be when we look at habits
and I'll say a little more of what
counts as a habit it's it's really these
automatic sort of reactions that we have
that's somebody's we're going to call
engagement and it has a different method
of learning the method of learning that
seems to be the thing that describes
this is called complex contagion what
that means is that if you see people
that you interact with so these are
peers experimenting with something and
peering to get good results then you see
them to absorb it without a great deal
of consideration so if everybody around
you suddenly starts you know drinking
skinny lattes right and everyone says oh
this is so great right yeah without
really thinking about it you're very
likely to start doing it skinning a lot
of days there's a bad example but in
general it's those sorts of things so
what we're doing if you think about it
we live in this uncertain world and if I
see people who are like me which means
their knowledge will generalize to me if
I sing them doing things that appear
successful and I see several experiments
of that sort then it's a good strategy
for me to follow that up I get to have
an entire behavior an actionable piece
of information without how all the scar
tissue of trying the bad things okay so
this is probably why we're social
species is because we need to observe
our peers and see the things that are
successful and adopt them and that's in
the title of the book how do good ideas
spread here we can play around with a
lot of stuff because it's tight not
tightly connected to our our actual
habits so okay that's idea flow so
here's an example of the stuff that we
do so this is a German bank it's got
five departments management development
sales support customer service what
they're doing is making a new ad
campaign so it's a creative process you
can't see it but there's the date down
here each frame is one day this is all
the email stuff like that this is all
the face-to-face stuff so we have
everybody wearing these badges for a
month okay and we can see when all the
groups get together the big circle means
this group had a group meeting right all
that other stuff that's in the halls and
around the coffee pot now let's go
through it so let's see you wait till
the end of the month you can't see this
but don't worry about it I'll tell you
beginning a month managers send out lots
of stuff let's have an ad campaign
everybody has meetings right figure out
what we're gonna do you will notice that
nobody talks to customer service the
whole time mmm and then they get the
product and they release it and it's a
disaster and they have all-day meetings
with customer service okay the rich
channels of communication are not
observed in almost any corporation or
any organization in the world but yet
those are the ones that contain a high
value nuanced information now we might
keep track of the email or phone calls
we never keep track of that other stuff
but yet that's where the most valuable
important stuff is so this organization
in response to this move customer
service to sit in the middle of all the
other organizations so that you had to
run into and talk to customer service
and that solved a lot of their problems
but a more interesting thing comes out
of this and this is from study of some
dozens of corporations you can divide
this face-to-face stuff up into two
pieces first of all this pattern doesn't
seem to say much about productivity or
creative output sorry but all that
electronic stuff doesn't seem to do very
much you need enough of it you need to
have different ideas flow under by but
it doesn't affect behavior very much on
the other hand if you look at the
face-to-face stuff you see two things
one is you see engagement which is
within a group does everybody talk to
each other so the mathematical version
of that is if I talk to you and I talk
to you do you guys also talk to each
other so it's a loop construct if all
the loops are closed it's very high
engagement that typically accounts for
30 sometimes 40 percent of the
difference between low productivity
groups and high productivity groups now
you should sit and think about that
because there's no other management
thing you've ever heard that has that
big a percentage of variance you may say
well 40 percent that's not a big deal
right that's only as important as your
genome for instance in Medical Outcomes
are only as important as IQ okay
interesting and then there's another
component to these which is stuff your
boss tells you probably not to do which
is going and talking to the sales guys
in the janitor and everybody else and we
call that exploration so in
organizations when you talk to people
that aren't in the official org chart
your productivity goes up because you
have broader context presumably so what
this is doing is this is passing
implicit tacit knowledge around it's the
stuff that you don't write down it's
stuff that maybe work-life balance stuff
you know there's a variety of things and
we've done interventions this is causal
the interventions could be things like
you make the lunch tables different
or you know you have mixers of various
sorts there's things like that in
creative groups like we do drug
discovery groups this exploration has a
bigger role than the engagement so you
get these these organizations which are
the key profit centers for drug
companies and bunch of PhDs you know
like highly skilled and the biggest
factor in what determines a productive
drug researcher is how much they talk to
the people they're not supposed to talk
to okay how much do they understand no
you can talk about causality here we're
happy to do that I'm not gonna let em
Phasis that but if you intervene you
find that if you get them to talk more
broadly they're rating their
inventiveness that creativity goes up so
it has a causal thing so the bottom line
there is the pattern of social ties
predicts productivity and innovation why
because of social learning right if I
see people doing things and I learn from
it I'm going to be able to do better
decisions in a work group it means that
everybody's on the same page you know
I've seen you seen what you do and maybe
it's not what I thought we were supposed
to do and then I'll ask you a question
about it
okay but I have to see that to be able
to get compatible behaviors between
people and I wrote a paper about this
last year and it won this award paper
the year from Harvard Business Review
and it won in a bet for the year from
the Academy of management and I believe
that's the first time that the Academy
of management and Harvard Business will
have ever agreed so maybe it has some
truth to it so that's in companies now
let's look a little more broadly so this
is a company I co-founded some years ago
these are taxi cabs moving around in San
Francisco it's a proxy for people moving
around it's all anonymous the black dots
here are the most common places that
people go looks like a nicely mixed city
but if you analyze it in terms of
dynamic clustering right so you ask
about these patterns of flow you find
that the flows actually have these sort
of like singularities that they flow
around what that means is that there are
subgroups
that spend most of their time with each
other and not with anybody else they
walk right by the other people but they
don't hang with them that doesn't mean
they know each other it just means
they're this type of person in that type
of person and you can map these onto the
city if you want but what's more
interesting is if you actually now go
and talk to these people you find
interesting things you find that the
fashion sense is different in the
different groups so you'll get these
waves of fashion propagating through
just one of these groups not the other
groups so between one group all the
girls will start wearing red dresses but
not in the other group that walks right
by them and it seems to do something
with learning from each other what seems
to be successful now we've done this on
other things to it we've done this in a
dorm looked at weight gain we've even
done politics if you spend time with
people who are Republican you will tend
to be more right-wing if you spend time
with people who are more democratic
you'll tend to be more democratic it's
not the stuff between your ears it's
this sort of learning and implicit stuff
that you soak up that seems to be the
effect so red dresses that's may be
understandable here's one that's not so
good credit rating is very highly
predictable much more so than
demographics so the FICO score is not so
great but if you know what group the
person is part of you know a lot more
about their risk profile different
groups have different attitudes towards
risk some groups you get more credit
cards all wonderful other groups and
that's so good and then this is one
that's really important as different
groups have different chronic disease
liability or susceptibilities so we
don't know precisely why it's the whoops
way or whether it's some combination of
behaviors that they learn from each
other and adopt that makes them more
susceptible to say diabetes or
alcoholism there's probably some self
selection that goes into that also but
typically you get prevalences of these
chronic diseases that differ by a factor
of five between these groups and that's
important because now you know where to
have a campaign for diabetes or where to
test so that's important so what's going
here again is this idea flora this
cascades of behavior change as a
function of exposure to other people
right remember all these guys read the
same newspapers see the same TV it's not
the information in the sense we usually
think it's something having to do with
the interaction so here's one of the big
things that I want to put out there I
think that we are seeing the beginning
of a really new type of science about
people okay
the science we have today is mostly
cognitive science it's economics and one
of the fundamental things is that you
have individuals I'm not going to argue
about the rational part okay in other
words it's what happens between your
ears that matters to your decisions okay
so I can economics you assume you've got
a bunch of more or less identical people
maybe they have slightly different
utility curves right and then you apply
an incentive and that changes their
behavior and in fact these sorts of
things are underlying markets and
there's this famous quote by Adam Smith
about the invisible hand how many people
know where it's from
what wrong it's Moral Sentiments it does
not appear in the wealth of nations and
despite that there's some nobel prizes
around this it turns out that this
notion that markets distribute things in
the best possible way it's called social
efficiency only happens for market
parameters of major 0 which means that
it's the regulator that makes the
division not at the market itself market
adds an interesting thing but if you
actually read Adam Smith's Moral
Sentiments book he also says things like
this it's human nature to exchange not
only goods but ideas assistance and
favors and it's these exchanges that
guide solutions for the good of the
community in other words it's not the
market it's the fact that we have these
social transactions this exchange
network between us that causes us to
come to compatible norms of behavior and
allocate the resources
in an appropriate way as sort of a
technical ease mildly technically is
version for those few know some some
economics but the the big thing is look
there's a social fabric and we come to
compromise with each other we learn from
each other principally but we also have
social pressure between each other so
that you don't do things that screw me
over and I don't things to screw you so
we have a little fight about it we reach
a compatible norm world's happy and it's
that that's the invisible hand but think
about it when you write programs when
you do the social networks I mean don't
you don't ever think about this stuff
almost nobody does this irritates me to
death I go to places like Davos and
there's all these world leaders and they
use economic metaphors for everything
government is a market right well no
actually we're people and we talk to
each other and we have this social
fabric and the peer of peer effects are
important the peer to peer effects are
where you get fads it's where you get
new political movements it's where you
get financial bubbles if you assume
everybody is iid independent you're not
going to get those things when you can
model this you can go out for them but
to model them you have enormous Lemoore
parameters you need enormous ly more
data guess what we now have enormously
more data so cool social fabric now when
we do incentives thinking the old way
what we would do is we'd give this guy
some money to say become more red okay
or some other sort of approval or
something but he's being fought over by
these other things by this social fabric
and so we see with economic incentives
and other sort of incentives is that
they don't work nearly as well as we
think they ought to in fact when people
get comfortable they don't work reliably
at all and moreover when you remove them
people snap back to their old behavior
because they're embedded in this
exchange network okay but this suggests
another way to incent people instead of
getting people incentives I could give
the social network an incentive so let
me show you some examples this is a very
different way of thinking about things
it's a fundamentally different way
and if you do the math because you can
write down all the equations here and
you can solve for how much of an
incentive is going to cause what amount
of change and you get equations like
this it's fairly standard econometrics
except that it has terms that have to do
with social incentives and the costs of
interaction between people so it
includes terms that have to do with the
social network and if you analyze these
what you find is is that the total war
distributed to peers in this social
incentives are at least twice as at
least half the size of individual
incentives so what that means is we have
a fixed budget you want to change
behavior you can go twice as far with
social incentives as you can with that
in fact it's a lot better than that this
is under fairly general assumptions we
can read the paper let me give you some
examples so here's a really striking one
we took one of the Canton's in
Switzerland they had to save energy
because their hydroelectric primarily
and above a certain level they have to
fire up diesel generators which is not
only expensive but it makes they are
really polluted and up in the mountains
ok and they tried educating people they
tried giving the financial incentives
nothing had much effect and we talked
them into trying social network
incentives so instead of saying if you
save energy I give you a reward let's
imagine you two guys interact ok I'm
gonna give him a reward if you save
energy
ok and if you two guys interact I'm
gonna give him a reward if you save
energy
and what is that going to do well that's
going to cause you to rise to talk
together if you know each other and
interact regularly and I set up that
incentive you guys are going to start
talking about this and it's ok for you
because you get to talk to him about it
right and if he saves energy then you
know you'd come out so we had a budget
of about $0.50 per week per person and
we got a reduction in energy use of 17%
over the population that we signed up
now to give a comparison there have been
places where people have saved 17% of
energy but it required a doubling in the
price of energy
so that gives you a comparison between
the intervention individual incentives
and social incentives that's example one
here's example - I took a community of
young families and I divided them into
two so these are people had given
smartphones - and so they'd signed up as
part of an experiment and the
smartphone's showed them their level of
activity this isn't the fall in Boston
when everybody gets on the blanket and
doesn't come out right and so we wanted
to be more active and what we did is I
gave them reward if they became more
active that was one half of the
community the other part of the
community I gave them a reward if their
buddy became more active okay so I took
people who were either friends or people
who interacted a lot and I set up these
social network things we're not to the
person to the buddy and so what happened
was the buddy rewards were between four
and eight times more effective per
dollar than the individual rewards and
when we ran out of money because we're
just a university the buddy rewards were
far more sticky because what we've done
is sort of stretched the social fabric
out of shape so now being active was a
topic of conversation it was a badge of
sort of social brownie points or
something like that and it persisted for
at least another month or two after that
and you know things change enough so
it's hard to tell but but had the
properties that you want in terms of
actually more long-term influence of
behavior this is what I'm done by James
Fowler so working with Facebook so he in
2010 sent out a get-out-the-vote message
to 61 million Facebook users the message
itself had almost no effect but a few
people did tip and when voted and he
also had a button when you say I voted
and if you said I voted then all your
Facebook friends would see your face and
that had almost no effect - except with
one class of people if your people that
had taken pictures of you together that
were on Flickr so these are people had
face-to-face relationships they enough
so that they had posted a picture with
them together
in that subset of things one person
voting typically tipped two to three
other people if they were just Facebook
friends it had almost no effect so rich
channels of communication matter the
face-to-face stuff and it's the social
pressure here just like the social
pressure there are there that did the
job not the information so so often I
see people talking about well we want to
change behavior we need to give them
more information well good luck okay so
those are some examples now why is a
social network stuff this social
interaction this idea flow between
people work let me give you an example
so this is a network called eToro it's
at this point it was 61 1.6 million
people and they're buying and trading
dollars euros gold ok that can now trade
more things and it's now over 3 million
people and the thing that's unusual
about it is you can see what everybody
does so I can go on there and I can see
what you're buying and selling I can't
see the dollar amounts just your
strategy about it
you're gonna short euros and long
dollars and you're gonna use leverage of
times 50 and I can say well he's a
really smart guy and so I'm gonna take
10% of my money and do just exactly what
he does ok and when that happens you get
a dot so these people are the same
people as these people each dot is a
following so that means we've done some
social learning for real ok and if you
look at the community you see subgroups
that do very little social learning and
you see groups that look like this where
you know I'm following you you're
following him and he's following me
oops same things go round and around
around and then those sort of situations
while the flow of ideas is very good
it's the same ideas over and over again
so they don't get new strategies into
the mix and in the middle you have
people that are very diverse and who
they're following there's sort of an
interview there's no closed loops here
ok so you can actually take the models I
showed at the beginning of this sort of
reduced Markov models we call it
influence model and you can build a
model of these millions of people and
you can actually characterize the
cascade behavior in that model so I can
talk about how the topology of following
changes the cascade distribution within
the Nabi havior change so idea flow if
you would okay so when here there's very
little idea flow you get tiny tiny
little cascades it's very little
following here you get lots of great big
cascades all the time but it's over the
same stuff in here you get a much richer
set of distributions see yeah sorry if
you ignore minute the connection and
just I see what the majority of the
population does here you can only see a
certain number of people is that the
user I see this because that's I have an
in with a guy who runs the platform
most people have to go look at
individuals there's a leader list and so
forth but they can't see what everybody
is doing
but remember everybody here is reading
the same newspapers seeing the same TV
shows they have the same external
information okay and what I can do is I
can build this model that talks about
cascade behavior by looking at the
behavior over time and what you can do
is then is write down this this equation
gives you this so here you get these big
cascades all the time here you get
almost no Cascades in between the middle
size distribution of Cascades each dot
here is the return on investment of all
of the social traders for an entire day
so each dot is hundreds of thousands of
trades okay and this thing is for an
entire year and what happens over time
is the network becomes more congested so
there like an echo chamber and some days
it's very isolated I can talk about that
because there's this trade-off between
the individual thinking and social
thinking so when the markets very
predictable you tend to be more isolated
when it's not predictable you tend to go
up here as a compensation strategy and
this is market adjusted return on
investment it turns out that the isolate
guys guys that are doing it between
their ears right or market neutral it's
not so good and that as you become more
social as you begin more involved in
these distribution of cascades your
return of investment goes up 30% that's
huge you know as you become even more
and you get into the echo chamber it
goes down and what I'm not showing is
that sometimes it goes all the way down
you get crashes so like there's a case
of this one guy in Latvia that had a
long streak winning and he got followers
and more following the followers got
followers and they all thought they were
like you know following lots of
different people but really was this one
guy in Latvia that was the generation of
all of it and then one day history
taught his strategy failed and it wiped
out all these you know tens of thousands
of people ok so that's not in this graph
so what I've said here is that this flow
of ideas when it's correct when it's
sufficiently diverse because that's
really the difference here no isolated
party it's not diverse in the very echo
chamber it's not a diverse in the middle
when it sufficiently diverse you get
better decisions well I can actually map
that in more or less real time in the
real world doing things that are sort of
surprises so this is using self at our
data and dark red means that there are
people from different parts of the
community in the same spot so this is
mixing of different communities
throughout the area of Mexico City and
you can do this in real time pretty much
we do it with about a one day of the lag
and you can compare this to all sorts of
different things so what I've said here
is is that this this mixing of different
communities this flow of ideas by seeing
what other people do is the source of
better decisions and in companies is the
source of great increases in
productivity how generally can we do
this so earlier last year I talked
orange the carrier you
releasing their cell tower data for the
country of the Ivory Coast Ivory Coast
is a poor country but it also had a
civil war about two years ago so for
instance the government cannot go above
about here because they get shot right
but what you can do is you can look at
the behavior of the people in each of
these little micro provinces and you can
estimate their poverty index it turns
out that as people become more wealthy
more comfortable they explore more both
physically and in terms of phone calls
and when you get that greater mixing the
community becomes more wealthy so you
can make a map of poverty and these are
also correlated with things like you
know crime rate and so forth so you say
well that's pretty amazing that you can
do a whole country you know in you know
every day instead of having a
ten-year-old census and of course here
you can't even do the census but is this
generally true so one of my former
students Nathan Eagle published this so
he had got data from UK councils so
these are little administrative units in
the UK and what he looked at was the
social type out instead of personal
components analysis of communication
within these council areas and when you
got councils that were such that the
people there didn't talk to each other
much and they didn't talk outside of the
community very much they were very low
on the socio-economic percentile when
you've got communities that had very
good patterns of idea flow they were
very wealthy now this indicator is a
combination of things like GDP crime
rate life expectancy infant mortality so
from the phone pattern or from the
mobility pattern we can tell you how
many babies died quite accurately it
seems to be a basic property of people
is that healthy communities have healthy
patterns of communication ghettos just
aren't good okay and all these things go
very with that so that's pretty
interesting and here's another thing
that we did
so on the other end of things we
analyzed data from three hundred cities
this data was originally gotten from the
Santa Fe guys
Betancourt folks and what we did is we
use things like Foursquare and cvrs
to look at the amount of face-to-face
interaction within the city and if you
tell me the amount of face-to-face
interaction the pattern of face-to-face
interaction in the city I can tell you
the GDP and if you tell me the GDP I can
tell you the amount and it's about
eighty to ninety percent of the variance
accounted for so what goes into this
well what it turns out that patterns of
interaction in cities follow a fairly
nice law that's an intervening
Opportunities law and it's a function of
density of population how many people
live in area and the transportation
infrastructure which you can quantify as
something like average commute distance
okay so you tell me those two things
about the density and the commuting I
tell you the GDP you tell me the GDP I
can tell you the commuting distance
right it's pretty interest with 300
cities right 89 so what that says is
that there's this story that we've all
heard right banging together different
ideas as people meet and talk and share
our experiences results in innovation
and innovation results in increased and
better outcomes like GDP okay except
we've never had data to prove that and
now we have massive data to get very
very high-quality descriptions of this
but you notice things I did not say here
okay I can predict the GDP without
knowing the educational distribution I
don't know anything about specialization
in the cities I don't know about class
production and access to means of
production if your remarks Marxian not
to say that those things don't exist and
that they're not important but it seems
that the big actor is this flow of ideas
the banging of together of ideas face to
face and incidentally the electronic
stuff doesn't play much of a role at all
it's the face-to-face rich Channel
today's environment that does do the GDP
okay so that's pretty interesting and
that's an example of the sort of things
that you can begin to do when you get
Big Data meeting social science you can
sort through all the stories you've
heard about development and say huh
actually this one's 80% of the variance
and not that that other one isn't a
gating thing or not important but this
is what you ought to do to be able to
get change so let's think about how we
might do that so you can design cities
and that's what we're beginning to do so
this is the traditional way you design
cities this is for Singapore this of
some poor group of people had to carve
out of wood every building in the
central part of Singapore and glue it on
this huge board and that's how they
design cities you want a new building
you'll pull the old piece of wood up you
carve a new building you stick it in
there okay so looks pretty good right to
state-of-the-art urban planning and some
of the buddies with me in the city
science project kept Larsen and Ryan
Chen have come up with a different way
to do it so they build cities out of
Legos and then you have a laser
rangefinder that extracts the 3d
structure and lets you do things like
simulate wind flow or shadowing but we
can also simulate the mixing of the
population so these things that have to
do with creative output or poverty we
can look for places in the city that are
ghettos we can look for places in the
cities that ought to be hotspots that
raise the mixing and the GDP of the
cities so we can design for cities that
have better properties by doea flow and
better social outcomes that's the idea
so let me give you an intuition of what
the equations tell you because there are
classic examples of this so I've
mentioned engagement which is everybody
being in the loop and exploration so a
classic example of engagement or
villages from the Middle Ages so these
are villages north of Zurich so there
everybody knew each other everybody talk
to each other they all had compatible
arms it was a completely boring and
oppressive place right it's good for the
kids because everybody knew what to do
and would support the kids and maybe
good for elders too because you know the
rules are pretty clear and you know
there was a lot of engagement but not
much creativity because the new ideas
didn't come in so how would you take
this thing which has some positive
aspects to it and make it more creative
well what you'd like to do is to get the
ideas from one village to baying against
the ideas of another village right so
here's an example of that this is Paris
lots of little villages they call them
era dismal and then good transportation
that allows all the villages to talk to
each other and that's the same pattern
that you see in Boston same pattern that
you see in London same pattern that you
see in New York City and those studies
are all a little overgrown now
transportation infrastructures creaking
you know there's other things that are
sort of come up but this is an intuition
for what you need so to have that sort
of social support plus the banging
together of ideas there's a little bit
like Jane Jacobs and the sort of battle
between whole communities and Moses and
his putting in big highways in New York
and there's some mixture of those that
actually seems to be the right thing so
well we're doing is we're looking at
different types of infrastructure you
can put in to get the best of both
worlds so at MIT Bill Mitchell started
the folding car electric car and Kent
and Ryan actually built this in Europe
for the city of Paris I'm on the board
of Nissan and we're building the first
commercial autonomous vehicles and it
will be something that addresses these
same sorts of problems I can't talk too
much about it but these are the sorts of
things that you need you need to have
people get around amazingly well and we
can talk more about that if you want the
other thing you need which we need to
talk about is the training of ideas and
information by digital means and of
course you guys would be concerned about
that and
have all these people talking about
personal data personal stories as being
a new old oil of the internet we're
gonna mine it make money right and so
there's a lot of concern and as you've
seen the things that I just talked about
you should be very concerned because if
I can get at this stuff I can influence
you in ways that you're not even aware
of okay so what do we do well I started
a discussion group at Davos about six
years ago now which brings together
people like the chairman of the Federal
Trade Commission the justice
Commissioner the EU people from the
Politburo of China heads of many of the
major companies for telcos and banks and
so forth as well as NGOs or advocacy
bodies to talk about what to do and the
nice thing is is we were looking for a
win win win solution
Craig Bundy was part of this also and
this is from the 2013 version so they
when you when people talk you know these
amazing artists the diagram the
conversation as you go
you can't interpret this don't worry
about it but what's interesting we've
gotten to a place where I think this
broad agreement among regulated
industries among regulators and among a
lot of the advocacy bodies and it
basically is this the same sort of
things that I do when I do an experiment
human subjects law all have to be
generally the case those are the sort of
protections that have so you have to
know when someone's collecting data
about you notification this is a point
of contention they're regulators like
this do not track stuff I think there
are better ways to do it
informed consent everybody agrees about
this that means that you have to
understand and see what the data is and
be able to opt-in something that
provides value to you and you have to be
able to opt out and the data goes away
and in Europe they took this a little
too far this right to forget but you
know they'll come to something
reasonable I think but this sort of
infrastructure with auditing to make
sure when I give permission to use my
data it's used correctly right is the
thing that there seems to be broad
consensus about so what that does is
that lets me know what information there
is about me
lets me evaluate the value proposition
no more of these big EULA's or terms and
conditions so individual value
propositions I can audit that they're
behaving themselves if I share things
and I can get out of it if I don't want
so we've built software to do this it's
not terribly difficult we have some
clever twists that we think that
everybody ought to do and we can talk
more about this in the NSA because this
is actually an interesting thing with
respect to the NSA and also
interestingly the Department of Homeland
Security has approached us about making
this a more broad standard because
they're not so worried about corporation
spying on you they're worried about you
know people from Romania or China going
in and doing bad things so there's a
certain cyber resilience element to and
what we've done with this is we've
deployed it in various places so for
instance in the city of Trento
in Italy which is actually an autonomous
region we've deployed this with Telecom
Italia telefónica of the city
government to be able to ask if you get
people more control over their data and
greater security to audit it and know
where their data is going do you get
better sharing do you get more sharing
or is this something that's actually
dangerous and people do stupid things
with it that's a debate now people argue
about this all the time I'm sick of
arguing I want to actually data on the
ground
all right you actually build the soccer
and see what happens right and this is
what we're gonna do at MIT we've got an
approval to make MIT into a living lab
where all faculty all students all
members of the community will control
data about them and share for greater
services and ideas I might use sort of a
hacker community we're gonna see how
safe it all is right but also that this
is really forward management of big data
in a community where you've got the dual
things so the privacy debate is
misinformed privacy is not the only
value privacy is a value the greater
thing is the pattern of sharing of
information within the society the
pattern of sharing is the source of
innovation it's the source of better
health better wealth more stability
social
integration and so you have to preserve
that that's almost the primary thing but
you also want to preserve protection of
the individual so you have to have some
balance and the the approach that we've
taken that there seems to be broad
agreement about is the way you do that
is essentially a democratic approach
where you give individuals more control
about their data now there's a lot of
asterisks about this that you guys will
be particularly sensitive to for
instance knowing that's too complicated
for the average person yes
and so one envisions that there will be
services that come up people like
reputation calm personal calm is number
startup companies that are helping
people manage their data for them and
trying to have best practice and it's a
vision the competition between these
will come up with really best practice
for the users so that's one example of a
question that comes up is this perfect
no on the other hand what the Snowden
releases show us is that if you have a
system like we have where not only do
you have end and encryption but the ends
are encrypted - that's pretty safe they
have put really significant resources to
be able to crack it moreover it's
modeled after the Swift Network which
you may be familiar with so this is the
interbank transfer Network so you get I
believe it's three trillion dollars a
day going over this network operates in
164 countries has a lot of squirrely
banks in there that are a little
questionable but as far as we know it's
never been hacked which is a little odd
because you know where the bank robbers
go they go where the money is all the
Swift networks where the money is okay
and what do they do well there's a
couple principles one is there's a legal
agreement it's a contract law it's not a
new law because it has to operate in all
these countries that gives joint
liability so if you screw up he gets
hurt so do i we're watching you okay the
other sort of thing is is that you don't
share personal information no bank gives
up its balance sheet it says I promise
to pay this a much money and I have this
much money that's all you know right so
it's minimum information sharing for the
purpose and
perfect but it reduces the
dimensionality of the data and the reuse
of the data dramatically and it makes it
possible to do a lot of things about
data protection so that's the story if
you want to know more about it you can
go there and this is the website so we
have the technical papers and videos of
all my collaborators and students
yakking about the stuff and so forth so
I see everybody people yeah absolutely
so the question is is don't you get
hurting behavior in the sort of privacy
thing so everyone goes and does yeah you
do and and so but that's like banks or
financial bubbles right so we don't do a
good job of managing that now but if you
pay attention to the fact that herding
behavior happens if you actually have a
model of that I didn't mention it but
like for instance in this financial
network we were able to break up herding
behavior with relatively small
incentives so when we saw that the
network was causing these big cascades
we would pick particular people to clip
and and gave them in coupons actually to
pay attention to other people and what
that did is destroy the cascade
structure so you can actually manage
things to be much more much safer from
that point of view he had his hand up
first Hey
the welfare community is changing in the
sky so the question is is okay so I'm
showing all these effects for face to
face what about the digital world and
telepresence and Skype and things like
that right and so in the data we have
which is backwards looking Skype and
telepresence is not so important right
and we see this overwhelming difference
between rich data rich interactions and
more abstract ones in fact we have some
great data that shows if you're having a
really bad day emotionally or a really
good day you stop using the electronic
media and you go for rich media face to
face or phones as you have a more normal
day you use the electronic stuff more so
what happens as you get better video
well that's a richer channel
communication and it ought to be better
but but the trouble with a lot of these
is is that there's no serendipity I have
to set up a contact with you right I
don't run into you in the Skype all I
don't see you when the coffee shop the
Skype coffee shop and so forth
no I think it will get better over time
and it's the case that we know that if
you have rich communication with the
person like you know you spend a day
with them then electronic means are
really good at maintaining that
relationship for a while so so what the
real story here is from a Productivity
point of view or things like that is you
need to mix rich channels of
communication with more abstract and
Skype is towards the rich end but not
completely because you don't get the the
social context as much it doesn't happen
with a serendipity there's a neat story
the people who sell telepresence can I
say this the people who sell
telepresence stuff told me this story
once where their president of the
company gave a big all hand speech and
they set up these telepresence things
all around him and so he would be up
there talking about his stuff and they
said the coolest thing
when he would say something you could
look past him to the telepresence unit
in Bangladesh in Bangalore and you could
see all the guys in Bangalore rolling
their eyes and that told you a lot more
than what the CEO was saying so that
social context that sort of nonverbal
incidental stuff is important in some
cases so I think we're getting there but
we got a long way to go sir I joined
Microsoft last year before I joined that
word a report called conceal or reveal
and described how companies need to
develop a transparency policy and spend
as much time on that as they do on their
privacy policy yeah so I have two parts
my question first which industrial
sectors seem to get it and are sharing
more data on on lies data with their
partners with researchers and since I
live in Washington does government have
a role in yeah absolute transparency
getting this data out there so we can
start so the way that discussion has
gone right is that the consumer privacy
Bill of Rights the data protection acts
the same things in China industry
complains about a lot but actually it's
a hunting license it says if you behave
this way you can use this personal
information with impunity okay and the
way you have to behave is you have to
actually be very transparent about what
the data is of what you're doing it so
that you can get informed consent and so
like prisons I'm on the board for
telefónica because telefónica wants to
use all the data they have but they have
to be very clear about how they do it
okay because they operate in places like
Germany and Brazil okay
same thing with Nissan I'm on their
advisory board also same questions come
up now among other questions so banks
transportation companies telcos medical
why medical we have HIPAA but all of a
sudden you have fitbit's and everything
else and that area is not HIPAA data
that's outside but it has to somehow
integrate with medical records and it
doesn't do it very well now at all so
there has
to be some level of control and privacy
for non-traditional medical data in
order to get maximum advantage of having
those things
so all those regulated industries are
looking at this and say okay well what
the discussion has gotten us to is a
place where we now know what to do to be
able to get into the dative business
serve our customers better make more
money blah blah the why did orange give
up data about the Ivory Coast because
they feel like there's a social tax that
they have to pay they have to help the
society with their data in order to get
the right to monetize the data okay and
so certain data they're more than
willing to give up to start this
conversation about data for good okay
what does government have to do with
this well government is the one that's
holding people's feet to the fire and
setting the rules so that's really
critical and people always ask me about
Facebook and LinkedIn and things like
that and and when I talk to regularly so
this is like you get them late at night
and a couple glasses of water so the
idea is is that they have real control
over regulated industries so they can
hold their feet to the fire and they
want to have best performance out of
that real high bar for privacy and and
personal data control and they think
they can achieve that and industry is
willing to go along for the right to
actually play okay but in the internet
all those guys grew up without any
regulation and there's really no good
way to put that genie back in the bottle
and tell you show that in the regulated
industries these high standards of
privacy work you know if Bank of America
is rising if you know Kaiser Permanente
are all in the data exchange business
and doing things that people approve of
and are safe then a company that's
operating without that level of control
by individuals has no fig leaf and then
you can sort of put the thing back in
the bottle
certain industries there are strict
rules on the reuse of data you can
collected for one purpose get consent
for that that makes it very hard to do
some of the things that people want to
do when there's a new unexpected
relationship so the way you have to
approach it is you have to engage the
customer in a dialogue about what
happens with their data and what are the
values they can get from it so the
trouble is is they've been sort of like
a little coy about it it's like oh click
here and we'll do something for you they
don't really tell you what the data is
or what they're doing very often so
they're very reluctant to go back and
ask can we use this data for something
else and it'll be upfront about it and
say here's the data you know here are
some things that you could choose to do
and you have to offer the customer a
good enough value proposition that
they'll click yes and feel comfortable
about it and that's of course challenge
for them but at the same time it's a
hunting license because now you can go
back and use it for lots of things you
just have to involve a customer so when
we build these living labs we find
people very willing to do that and and
so it's a risk/reward thing if you can
really believe that your data is being
handled safely and that you control it
you're much more willing to share the
moment your trust in that process
decreases
you're not going to share ok so sir ok
we are to a minority it seems like in
this case yeah
rather they're ready but they were
talking about predictable crime right
where they would actually build going to
analyze all this data and say you know
what this person has a 99% probability
that they're gonna commit a crime in the
next 20 so the question is can you know
Minority Report and pre-crime and all
that so if you remember early on I
showed this diagram from Kahneman about
types of thinking so all of this stuff
only works with habits it doesn't work
with conscious decision making you
cannot predict that very well and the
reason is obvious it's a generative
process it's a very high dimensional is
very sensitive to basic assumptions so I
can change one little tiny thing and you
come up with a completely different
level a set of conclusions habits are
much more regular than repeated and
therefore they're predictable so if
somebody is really habitually doing
something that's not good you can
predict that okay
we've actually looked at crime
prediction it turns out you can do a
halfway decent job but not of
individuals
you cannot listed in our data you cannot
predict crime by individuals what you
can do is predict crime by place and an
interesting thing is the way you do it
is you look for change in human behavior
so if you have a plaza and suddenly all
the old people don't go there anymore
something changed and there's a higher
likelihood that they'll be crime there
so the people somehow sensed this was
different and you could see that the
distribution of people is different you
don't know why right but something's
change they made them feel uncomfortable
or uninterested and that's a location
where you're likely to get higher
correct know is that pre-crime no that's
being sensitive to the social situation
I think and is much less problematic
because it's not about the individual
it's about the place and similarly you
know we have not been able to predict
things like those sorts of things on the
individual level and then we looked at
it we're haven't like tried it really
super hard I also don't think it's moral
and not something you want to do on the
other hand if you have an entire
community like these these ghetto
communities
what we're doing there is predicting
crime you know when they have very poor
patterns of idea flow there's very high
levels of crime so I can go in and say
this community high level of crime and
the babies die and they don't live very
long and so forth is that good well I
think that ought to be the sort of thing
that's in the public domain that ought
to be a data Commons so everybody can
look at it and say huh that community's
not very good now what are we gonna do
about it are we gonna just let them die
off or is government gonna take that as
a priority to do something about it
I can't tell you what to do I can tell
you to build better infrastructure for
those people I can tell you there may be
some short-term things that they need
but you know society has to know that
there's a problem before and have that
visible before they take action I think
a lot of what we have today is is a lack
of transparency about that so you know
yeah there are places that are really
poor and really bad nobody's much aware
of it and so they don't get any any help
if you could make that visible you could
at least have a discussion about it good
