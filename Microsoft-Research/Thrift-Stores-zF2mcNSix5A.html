yes or do I know anything concrete about
thrift stores so I have been shopping at
thrift stores and buying most of my
clothes at thrift stores since I was 12
years old when I was a little kid it was
cuz my family didn't have a lot of money
and my mom and I both really liked
clothes and so we would go to the
Salvation Army we would go to yard sales
we would buy all this stuff and didn't
really make me a very popular seventh
and eighth grader to be wearing all
these thrift store clothes but by the
time I got to high school when you know
grunge rock was like the big trend um it
was much more about me trying like
half-assed li duplicate things I saw in
vogue based on stuff I got at my local
Salvation Army so thrifting is very near
and dear to my heart and I just kind of
want to just share a couple things with
you and also show you some of the crazy
stuff I found just basically based all
the pictures that were still on my
camera this is a Foursquare shirt that I
found for five dollars in a store very
near I kind of wish Dennis was here so
you could see it but that's okay um this
is in my office at school it was twenty
bucks so there is a national association
of retail professionals their acronym is
narts for some reason there's no T in
professional there are 25,000 resale
consignment nonprofit and for-profit
stores in the US that's there a 13
billion dollar business about sixteen to
eighteen percent of Americans shop at
thrift stores of which I am a proud
proud one of those numbers and just for
comparison twenty one percent of
Americans shop at regular department
stores and astounding only nineteen
percent of Americans shop at apparel
stores like that just seems insanely low
to me i can't imagine that's right but
anyway this is the way that this kind of
ecosystem works on the left the big red
thing you have donations like you or I
are like oh here's a big ugly bag of
crap we're gonna drop it off at Goodwill
the thrift organization whether it's
goodwill or salvation army or whatever
it is eighty percent of that goes to
textile recycling they take the take top
twenty percent of it and they put it in
the thrift store people buy it and then
the the thrift store then whatever isn't
sold in the thrift store then goes to
the thrift store outlet which
like amazing thrift store outlets do the
greatest thing ever I'll talk about
those in a minute in a minute and then
whatever doesn't get sold goes to
textile recycling so um the amount of
what we're talking about here is kind of
crazy so the average American adult
throws out 68 pounds of clothing per
year and that's five percent of all
landfills are just old clothes so
Americans by 2.5 billion pounds of used
clothing per year from these stores and
these textile recycling businesses are
super interesting there's like 2,000
textile recycling companies in the US
they're almost all really small like
family owned and what they do is they
take some of the textiles and they shred
them into upholstery or insulation and
then a lot of them end up getting
exported overseas and there's a new book
about stuff that talks a little bit more
about the global export business which
is something I know nothing about so i
won't go into that so there's a sort of
hierarchy of resale and I have sampled
all of these in in many ways at the very
top we have the free stuff which is
clothing swaps which are really popular
right now especially among my fashion
bloggers community that some of you have
may have heard me talk about before
basically a bunch of girls it's always
girls show up with a bag full of junk
everything is closed it all gets
basically like tipped out onto tables
and everyone goes absolutely insane it's
like you feel you're gonna be trampled
to death by horses wearing platform
shoes when when they open everything up
there's also free cycle which I'm sure
many of you are familiar with you a post
on freecycle I have an old futon
somebody comes like immediately and gets
it dumpster diving getting stuff off
curbs I'm here in New York the curb
stuff is kind of incredible I must say
I'm slightly less free but still very
cheap craigslist and yard sales then we
have charity shops who just stuff like
salvation army and goodwill where the
ball it's a non-profit and all the stuff
is all the profits are going to charity
for-profit resale which is like value
village and savers where they like
ostensibly donate like a really small
percentage like ten percent to charity
but the rest of it just goes to them and
then of the very highest and we have
consignment shops which is like Tokyo
seven in the east village where you can
buy you know your very own used Chanel
jacket for five hundred dollars if you
should want to right here's a couple of
myths about thrift stores this I really
really wish I'd bought this it's kind of
amazing the first myth about 30 stores
is that they provide clothing for
low-income people this is not actually
true I mean it obviously it is true that
a lot of people shop at the wrist
because they're cheaper but the point of
the thrift does not to provide
low-income clothing for low-income
people it's to sell clothing in whatever
the market will bear so they can then
take that money and use it for whatever
their charitable fund is so if you go to
a good will in a really nice area like
the goodwill here in on H Street and six
ab sweaters are twenty dollars whereas
if you go to a good will in like Wichita
sweaters are like probably like 3 99 499
so they're they're very variable the
second myth is that you're gonna find a
ton of treasures when you walk into a
thruster you're gonna walk in you're
going to see a fabulous Poochie shift
from the 60s know it's gonna be a dollar
that is not true I would say you can
substitute a kabouter / good score at a
thrift store and in my 30 and 20 years
of thrifting that's what I was 25 yeah
thing that's probably what I would say
is about right most of what you see in
thrift stores now is from old navy and
old navy and target Oh target especially
merona and miss emo those are the target
brands third is it their dirty gross and
full of bed bugs I do not think that is
true I'm just saying I do not find them
dirty gross and full of bed bugs I've
never had bedbugs and the final thing is
are they full of hipsters they generally
are not full hipsters either they're
usually just regular people a lot of
times people with kids all right a few
hot tips for thrifting this is one of my
like all-time favorite this is a gift
from one of my thrifting friends first
is have a lot of patience you can't go
into a thrift store and say I need a new
coat you have to go into a thorough
store and say what wonderful thing will
the universe reveal to me today and it
might be something that is totally out
of season it is totally ridiculous that
you didn't even know you wanted that you
know your partner is gonna be pissed cuz
you come home with it and you put it on
the table in your like look at this
wonderful thing and they're like really
really um also you have to go through
all the sizes you have to ignore numbers
one of the things that thrifts teach you
is that clothing sizes are total crap
and that they've changed dramatically in
25 years when I was looking on the nortz
website they were like we recommend
wearing a leotard you can try on clothes
in the aisles and that's you know that's
not bad advice and finally the salvage
an army is anti-gay so don't shop there
they are very rapidly anti-gay so don't
give them your hard-earned thrift money
here's some thrifts in the air way that
that's not actually moving and saying
here's some thrift in the area i can
give you guys a list of these from the
high end stuff which is like the Chanel
for-profit resale buffalo exchange cheap
vintage cheap non-vintage and very cheap
vintage which is this goodwill outlet
store which is sick it's got these giant
blue dumpsters full of all the stuff
from all the other goodwill's in the
entire city and it's a dollar a pound it
is amazing all right and then a couple
last things um this is a shirt yeah and
I can I can actually give you this
information I know I'm Way over my time
this is a shirt that I saw in Florida my
mom lives in the thrift store capital of
the u.s. I think she specifically moved
there because of that this is a clock
this is an entire wall of Star Trek The
Next Generation videos and this is an
owl thank you thank you very much Ellis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
