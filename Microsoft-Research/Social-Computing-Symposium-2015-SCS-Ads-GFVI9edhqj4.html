you
I want to just tell you a little bit
about where you are right now and how we
ended up here so we're in the PCH
building now has anyone here ever
ordered anything from Apple it came
through PCH his facilities in Shenzhen
so pcchips about 10 billion dollars for
the products annually a lot of them are
apples I met Liam the founder and
Irishman back in Beijing probably in
like 2008-2009 and two years ago he
contacted me to see if I want to start a
hardware incubator that is what became
highway one now this is PCHS building
and this first floors you've seen is a
kind of community space this is where
you have highway ones demo days we have
a lot of different community events here
dorkbot hardware meetups hardware
hackathons startup weekend and on the
second floor is actually a full
professional grade machine shop filled
with ex apple and ex I do engineers
making things that you'll see on the
shelves in like a year or two and on the
top floor it's kind of like PCH handling
all the legal and executive functions
there now where we were originally going
to have this is across the parking lot
at highway 1 now hi everyone and forts
when the building is two weeks late I've
been giving tours all morning but that's
where I'm going to be housing my
companies for the next I believe our
lease is for eight years and so
everyone's been around now for a year
and a half we've had 35 companies go
through it and I'll just kind of just to
give you a perspective on what we do and
stuff just show you some real quick
stuff so this is six cents and we took
them from that 3d printed prototype all
the way to kind of this
professional-grade model and what that
was is it's a way to give field
technician workers actual Bluetooth
connected tools so when a plumber comes
to your house they don't have to like
write everything down on paper they can
actually just have the data transmitted
directly to their iPhone we work with
teams for four months and we get them
ready for manufacturing a team that's
currently available for sale to
consumers is up on IndieGoGo right now
this is a Bluetooth button and you can
do a short click a long click or uphold
believe they just crested about half a
million right now it's a Swedish team
about a third of our teams are
international drop was actually first
class they joined a year and a half ago
it's an iPad connected scale and it's
they went from highway 12 Apple Retail
in 10 months and our most successful
company so far as nab d which is a heads
up display for cars they've raised
something like 5 million dollars in
crowdfunding now an interesting tidbit
when you're a hardware company you can't
rely just on crowdfunding you have to if
you're going to go big generally you
need bc and so these guys have raised
more than double that in venture capital
to fund building the company and
building out their lines and preparing
for actually launching with the product
now as I mentioned earlier I'm actually
going to be doing a TV show about
highway 1 and so you'll mind then don't
mind the indulgence I'm just going to
show you a small clip of it now we
haven't actually started filming yet but
they came out a year and a half ago
during my very first week of highway 1
when we were figuring out what we were
doing I just my staff two weeks before
I'd literally signed a lease on the
building five weeks prior when I got
home from burning man and then suddenly
television crews are there and the
premise of the show is basically it's
myself and dave McClure so it's highway
1 and 500 startups the zpc 0.0
productions the guys behind the Anthony
Bourdain show David shanked mind of a
chef are going to come and in bed with
us for 12 weeks this spring starting
februari 16th and film three of our
teams and 3 500 startups teams and then
in the fall on the sci-fi
channel they were going to release 61
our episodes each following one team so
it's really kind of a documentary which
personally I hope shows what it's like
to go from that janky 3d prototype all
the way to a finished product and how
really making hardware making software
is a lot of long nights a lot of
Mountain Dew and a lot of teamwork so
here's just like the last 45 seconds of
this initial clip we selected 11
companies it's in Joyner in computer
program they're going to be here for
four months we have to keep them real
this is the second meeting in a row with
enough friction prototype and it's not
good news we have to help them make sure
that they're actually making something
that people want to buy it's not that
complicated just download it now start
playing around with it luckily I hired a
German to do to do the tough-love aspect
must be a German thing rady is Kirk and
I'm Spock you know I don't know that any
of these companies will become a
billion-dollar company but there are
some teams in there that have the stuff
that it would take Oh team I am the
public face of this if this fails so do
I thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
