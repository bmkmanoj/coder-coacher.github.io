session to lose his advanced features my
name is Alma sue and I'm a software
engineer at Microsoft advanced
technology labs in Cairo in this session
we will talk about advanced features
that Lewis Microsoft's language
understanding intelligence service
provides if you have missed the first
video where we talked about Lewis's
basic features a link to that video will
be provided in the comment section below
with Bill 2016
Lewis has new cool features that are
designed to make your life easier
when creating a conversational
intentions workflow experience for your
apps devices and more Louis now allows
you to respond to intent detection by
firing events or what we call actions
that carry data specific to that intent
you can then capture those actions by
building your own chat bots on
frameworks such as Microsoft bot
framework and slack with just one button
click Lewis also has an all new powerful
dialog engine which enables you to
author and execute conversational
dialogues on any device easily and
quickly so let's go ahead and see those
features in action we continue on our
application from the previous session we
set up action firing and authored a new
dialogue for the book flight intent so
for example consider the utterance book
me a flight naturally a flight would
have a destination but it so happens
that this information is not available
in this utterance Lewis's new dialogue
system detects and advises the user to
provide the missing information which in
this case the destination via the
dialogue question as you can see here
so let's provide the missing information
which in this case the destination
we then see that Lewis replies back
requiring the date and time for the
flight since that as well is missing and
that in short is the new dialog system
that Louis has also note the new actions
section apparent in the JSON response
specific to each intent this highlights
the actions associated with each intent
and the parameters carried by each
action we will be talking about these
fields shortly so let us show you how
you can use those features we'll open
our existing application and in that
application will edit the booking intent
and add a new action an action
represents the behavior that should take
place when this intent is triggered on
an utterance each action can have
multiple action parameters action
parameters are pieces of information
that are considered arguments for this
action now each parameter has its
requirement setting name entity type
value and corresponding dialogue prompt
for an action to fire all required
action parameters should be detected in
this utterance meaning that all entity
types should also be detected in the
utterance let's start creating our first
parameter our booking intent requires a
destination and date and time for the
flight so let's create action parameters
for the two entities - location and date
time we'll go ahead and add a
destination parameter we'll choose the
two location entity and we'll add the
corresponding prompt question for when
that parameter is missing
we repeat the same steps to add the date
parameter
a parameters prompt is the question that
appears the endpoint if that parameter
is required and was not detected in the
utterance so if the to location
parameter was not detected in an
utterance we would want our application
to ask the user to where and the same
applies for the date/time parameter when
note that the order of the parameters
defines the order of appearance of the
questions in the endpoint if multiple
required parameters are missing finally
you can choose a phrase list for each
parameters first list work what the
parameters the same way to work with
utterances they're considered features
to improve the detection accuracy of the
parameters in the utterances let's go
ahead and republish our application and
after successful publish let's try a new
utterance with the missing destination
parameter such as book me a flight
as you can see the input automatically
asks the prompt question to where that
was set for the destination parameter as
we mentioned before lewis has a new
feature that enables the user to capture
action firing events using bot
frameworks such as slack to do this
lewis provides a set of pre-built
actions that can be directly used with
bot frameworks let's go ahead and enable
one of these pre-built actions on our
git weather intent and then we'll
integrate it with a slack bot we created
beforehand we'll add a new action for
this intent and we'll check the
fulfillment option this opens up the
list of available pre-built actions in
their different domains in our example
we will choose the gate current weather
pre-built action each pre-built action
has its own set of settings to be filled
using one or more of the action
parameters these setting values are sent
to our slack bot from the endpoint at
the time when the action is fired so
let's go ahead and create the action
parameter that the setting will get its
data from in our case the setting
required is the location so let's go
ahead and create it so in summary when
the user enters an utterance that
triggers the get weather intent it's
action is fired if the location entity
is detected the value detected is then
injected in the settings field of the
pre-built action the settings value is
then sent to our slack bot so for
example if the user enters what's the
weather like in Cairo the entity Cairo
is detected as location and is sent to
the slack bot the bot will respond in
the slack interface with the current
weather in Cairo so let's see this in
action we save our intent and we go
ahead and republish our application and
will enable slack integration we'll find
that we need to fill in the client ID
and client secret key for our slack
application these are obtained when
creating your slack bot you can check
this link for more detail
on how to create your slack bot and
retrieve these values we've already
created our slack bot so we'll go ahead
and paste our ID and key here now we'll
publish our application now all we need
to do now is to copy this endpoint URL
and paste it in our slack app in the
redirect URI segment we're ready to go
let's go ahead and test our bot you have
a chat room setup here with our bot in
it when I enter any phrase it is sent to
our loose end point and if it triggers
the gate weather intent our slack bot
should reply back with about their
details so let's try that out what is
the weather like in Cairo
and we see that our bot has answered
with the current weather in Cairo that's
it for our series we hope you enjoyed it
and we're waiting to see your fantastic
applications for more information please
