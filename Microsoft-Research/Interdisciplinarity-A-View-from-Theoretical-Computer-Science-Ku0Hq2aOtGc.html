here I think by now it's pretty
generally agreed that interdisciplinary
research is going to be a very important
aspect of scientific research in many
fields and what I would like to do today
is to give you a perspective about
interdisciplinarity from the perspective
of theoretical computer science and and
I believe that to some extent it also
reflects the general features of
interdisciplinary research so the
question we really want to think about
is that what is interdisciplinarity and
how how does it become interdisciplinary
so let's begin from the history of
theoretical computer science as a
subfield in computer science and to some
extent that the array the computer
science like many other matures
scientific views itself is a result of
evolution from a little for many
disciplines so in sum to some degree it
is always interdisciplinary in nature
and so let's look at the story of theory
computer science can be regarded as a
tree and at the roots is the effort by
Alan Turing and other pioneers in a
theory of computation they ask the
question what does it mean to be to
compute what's the meaning of computing
and so
what they focus on is the question
what's the mathematical model of
computation and now so this is really
the core of theoretical computer science
in its original form and the third in
many many years the the 60 70 years of
development week we have many important
developments including for example the
theory of np-completeness by a cooked
carp living and etc in however a
theoretical computer science is not just
this line of thinking about what does it
mean what's the model of computation and
there are many inputs in subsequent
years from other disciplines and each
time it brings in new problems a new
perspective and most importantly new
talents that at first at some stage one
might as well say that it's a
interdisciplinary area of research but
gradually it mature and really has now
become an integral part of theoretical
puter sign so for example Don Knuth
bringing the question that involved the
more practical side of computing and
emphasizing the study of algorithms and
data structures and the famous como
gaurav and bring the idea of algorithmic
information and so it's not just the
subject the concept that's bringing by
this great scientist but it's also they
have / do some very important students
who have made a difference in the field
so como gaurav for example living I end
up
raspar off they all have become really
pillars of the field that come from the
coma gaurav school and now I think that
everyone knows the poor dish and brings
the Hungarian combinatorics the whole
school there are many many talented
Hungarians who came into the field and
solved many of the unsolved problems in
theoretical computer science and have
since become the standard tools in
theoretical computer science and of
course the club Shannon did the the
information theory has a big influence
on theoretical Peter science and now we
are coming to more recent times in the
last 30 years and the interaction
between computer science and information
theory and a community printing the idea
of merging the Shannons information
theory and lnsurance computation theory
and created the field of modern
cryptography and the the the influence
of biology manifested about 20 years ago
because computers are become more and
more important for solving biological
problems and then the quantum computing
makes a quantum information
interdisciplinary between physics and
computers and the algorithmic game
theory as it's a very important active
field interdisciplinary between econ
econ economics and computer science etc
and so the the last three I think that
one might really caught an
interdisciplinary area and my hope is
and I and I believe that over time they
would become such an integral part of
theoretical computer science then then I
don't mean that we would own this area
so that it's not part of physics or
biology but I mean that it would
p you'll be just as common as people who
work in kinetics and in theoretical
computer science and now stepping back
and thinking about this pattern from a
more general view that now how does the
computer science itself was the story of
computer science and we all know that
computer science in some sense it's has
always been interdisciplinary starting
from the very beginning we know that
computer science has important
applications to physics and biology and
engineering and but usually what it
means is that in those applications in
those disciplines they need to solve
their problems using computers merely as
a tool they would like to get numbers
and so one might schematically draw that
in the earlier years those deals if you
look at their core they the core areas
don't intersect it's just that that they
need to use computers and however one
thing that dramatic changes is that we
have found especially in theory of
computing science in recent years that
this course for one reason or another
have found each other so there is a
significant interception in some parts
of the core of those disciplines with
computer science and therefore to bring
out to solve their problems it's not
just enough to tell them what the best
algorithm is for solving the problem but
actually in many cases the
collaborations between computer
scientists and these other videos are
become an integral part of the progress
of the field so that all sounds very
address 0 so that for the rest of talk
what I would like to do is to give some
examples and now before show
you the examples let me first set some
benchmarks so how do you how do we know
the results of in in a certain research
is interdisciplinary I'm just going to
focus on three indications the first one
is that it would involve researchers
from computer science and from the other
discipline so looking at co-authorship
and second is that they would be
published at least from the serial
computer science point of view the
results are published in non-core
theoretical computer science journals or
conferences and the third thing is that
getting published is not enough that do
they are they of real significance to
computer science and other fields so I'm
going to to keep in mind there are three
benchmarks and I think I say as a crude
first cut at differentiating research
which merely involves computers and
something that that is deeper so i would
like to look at the three examples one
is involved the Computer Science in
economics one involves computer science
and physics and more generally there are
topics that are so Universal and there
are not just computer science in one
discipline but actually a even
philosophy so let me first look at the
case of auctions which is about the
interaction between computer science and
economics I suppose you have an odd you
have an item for sale suppose you have
an apple and the problem is that that
how much are people willing to pay and
so we can certainly ask people I mean
how much would you pay for it and the
baby they will probably lie they will
they will try to get the best price they
can so the theory auction is that
how do we design the rules how do we ask
them so that people have any incentive
to reveal their true values and so this
is the auction theory really is a
subfield of something called met in the
design so for the market you make a
design on how the market will operate
and so this really says that under this
paradigm is actually economists are
engineers so you would like to design an
option so that the in equilibrium we get
a result that we want and so the goes
off of the auction the seller which is
at the auctioneer may have several
different goals the most common goals
one is to maximize the social welfare
and so what it means is that we will
like the item to go to the person who
value it most so this is it's a from a
global point of view that's the maximum
efficiency or from the sellers point of
view maybe I just want to maximize the
revenue as the prophet and let's just
look at two very simple auctions and
let's consider you have and you have one
item you have an apple to sell and there
are many buyers each one of them would
see you there bits and so when when the
when the seller opens the envelope he
sees all the bits and then how do you
decide who to give it to at what price
and and that the obvious natural
solution is to to do it called the first
price namely that you look at the
maximum bids and you sell it to this guy
and at the price that the person is
willing to pay as stated there and now
that's a seems to be a fair solution but
but but unfortunately it's very easy to
cheat because if I think that all the
other bidders
probably have a lower valuation than
mine then why should I reveal my true
value I should lower my value by a few
dollars so that I can still get the item
back to the lower price so therefore the
first price auction is not an auction
that is truthful so in other words
people are not have don't have an
incentive to tell the truth and another
seemingly a natural way of doing it is
called second price or it called a
victory and and don't underestimate it
as no prize in it and and so what this
does is to award the item still to the
person who value it who claimed that the
he valued most but charging at the price
only at the second highest price so now
you can see that the second price
auction has a distinct merit namely that
is truthful because if I value at
something and I know that even though I
I know that all the other bidders have a
have a lower price there's no reason for
me to put in a lower bid because you
know if I get the if I lower it I was
still pay the same price so the price
doesn't depend on my action at this time
so the second price auction has a
distinction being firstly it's truthful
and secondly it also says maximize the
social welfare because the person who
deserves it most actually get the price
and so let's think about this definition
of a truthful mechanism and this turns
out to be a very profound concept and
and so what what is a good great piece
of work what is great research and the
it depends that you have one or more
really critically deep concept
that are very important in applications
or aesthetics and seems to be very
natural but it's not very easy to
completely characterize so truthful
mechanism turns out to be this so this
is very similar to let's say the idea of
the the concept of computability what
does it mean for something to beacon to
be computable and now even though and
something that can be said pretty simply
but it actually nobody has exhausted the
idea of computability because
computability makes computer science
what it is it has at least one unique
idea that is absent in all the other
sciences and it turns out that the idea
of a truthful mechanism also has this
character the more you read about it the
more you do research in it the more you
are fascinated by it because it's a it's
a very turns out to be a really deep
concept and I and now so this solved the
problem when you try to maximize the
social welfare with the truthful
mechanism but how about in other models
for example suppose you want to achieve
revenue you want to maximize the revenue
using a truthful mechanisms is there
something simple that you can do it's
just like the the second bit and it
turns out the revenue maximization
problem in some cases it easy but in
some cases it's very deep so suppose you
want to sell instead of one item but you
have K items to umpires end up now the
decay to the one the single item case
Myerson gave a complete solution to the
problem and it's also a Nobel Prize
worked it's a very beautiful work and I
cannot help but think about 1981 and i
remember in 1981 I
I was at Berkeley and and at that time
cryptography was the rage of the time at
least in our field and there are some
really wonderful concept in cryptography
and and so little did I know that at
that time that the economists have come
up with something that's really profound
and and and and arguably have even more
important than then the computer science
work that that was fashionable at that
time and I mentioned this because this
is a case if you if you read the auction
theory if you read marcin's paper it's
exactly the kind of problem that we
would love to solve it formulated it
it's exactly a theory the computer
science department so there are cases I
think how does things become
interdisciplinary in some cases it's a
gradual merge because you need the other
discipline to make your things work but
this is a case where they are the same
even from the very beginning the
motivation may be different but but the
actually is exactly the type of question
and for if you have more than one option
if an apple and orange you want to sell
then the problem is really an open and
there are Sigma mechanisms such as you
just do it separately or you can sell
them a single bundle as a bundle the
idea is just that you can either get
both items or you get none at a certain
price so silly one items the seller has
one item and has a partial knowledge of
the buyers interest and how does it
maximize the revenue so if you set the
price at P then the expected revenue is
P times the probability that the buyer
would accept it so therefore this is the
expected value and so all you need to do
in this very simple case just one item
one buyer is just you should set the
price that maximizes this
expression okay but even for once one
but one buyer if you want to sell two
items then it's it's difficult even if
these two items are our have a similar
characteristics so the natural ways to
say that I just sell each item optimally
and however you don't you don't get the
best algorithm so forth for example if
you have item values which have it each
item has a equal probability to have to
do to be worth one dollar and two
dollars to to the buyer if you sell them
separately then the optimal value is
going to be equal to one you can set the
price to be to be to be to be either one
or two you get the same expected revenue
however if you sell it as a bundle you
say that that you either by both the
apple and orange at price three dollars
or you're not going to get any if you do
the calculation you can see the revenue
it is bigger then if you sell it
separately and now actually things are
much more complex if you look at some
simple examples let me just go to the
very last one if you if the distribution
is so that its probability 16 to be one
dollar it's worth two dollars with
property that I have and to be worth
four dollars at property or third then
the optimal solution is a very complex
combination it says that i would offer
the buyer two alternatives either you
can get the lottery to get one single
item for one dollar but but the lottery
has only one half of the probability to
succeed and the second alternative is
that you can get both for four dollars
if so this is a at the unique solution
that works optimally for this so that
all is in the case
this truthful mechanism is a very
profound concept and and even now we
really don't fully understand how to
sell with to one seller and with just
two items and but let me show you how
the how the added value that the input
from computer science can get you okay
so let me just look right down the
notation the maximum revenue is from
selling from items in a set and so the
question is so you can ask fundamental
questions like this saying that how much
is it better if you have an option where
you sell both items at the same time
compared with just selling them
separately and and it's a it's a
question that's very natural and very
simple to ask but the answer is it's not
it's not obvious and now in 2012 heart
and Nissan show that what you would
expect that that you can you can make
more money but not too much more than
sitting then separately end up the heart
and nisa also show that if you certain
separately and you sell them as a bundle
there are some there are some
mathematics that you can analyze it and
how much does it differ from the optimal
and a follow-up paper by balagan Yao
actually pin down those ratios and very
recently Bobby off from by the way from
microsoft research that they had a
wonderful result they showed that
actually if you sell separately and you
sell a bundle and you you you look at
the better mechanism of this too then
you actually achieve they might be the
best optimal value to within a constant
and a very soon there is a quite a
general extension and
study the general case with the Empire
and K item and and come up with a lot of
insight into the problem kind of
following some of the leads that were
presented in the previous papers and in
particularly this shows that the optimal
revenue under the patient or dominant
strategy they are equivalent up to a
constant factor so this may not make
sense but these are the type of question
that economists have been asking and I
think but it's only really by putting
some of the computer science methodology
that is possible to get this and and and
and it's not important exactly what
these results are I just want to
highlight on the benchmark that I said
earlier heart and Nissan and heart is an
economist and Nissan is a computer
scientist so are they together they
initiate this very fruitful line of
research in recent years and they and
they published the paper in a conference
called you see and it is a conference
that's it's designed to be cross
discipline if you look at the the
program committee members and it is they
come from both economists and computer
scientists and now the publication
avenue of the follow-up paper is in the
Proceedings of na s so it's not a really
a theory computer science journal and
also if you look at the most reason the
last result on the other page here I
think this results are I think the
economists will be very interested in
knowing results of this kind so the
second question I like to example it's
quantum information and now replicating
you from information such as making
Xerox copy of digital documents has
diverse applications now the question is
that is it possible to have a Xerox
machine that can make a copy of not
digital documents but actually quantum
documents and quantum objects and now we
know that it's not possible to do
district copying and so there's a no
cloning theorem which says that if you
if you want to design a quantum machine
that would take an input state fee and
and you want to produce two copies of it
then this is not allowed because of the
the constraint in quantum mechanics and
this is an important insight because
this really is the basis for the
security of quantum cryptography but in
in the physics community for 20 years
they are very interested in how do you
get around the no cloning theorem is it
possible to clone a quantum object
approximately or probabilistically and
many cases special cases have been
studying but what about the general
rules is a general theorem that tells
you what limits how many really good
copies you can get for a quantum state
what are the ultimate limit and it turns
out that there is a quite good elegant
solution to it so let's just imagine you
have a process that would you take n
copies and you would make an extra Delta
n copies and so you will not be the
replication to be reliable so that the
copies are nearly very nearly perfect
and the one can a recent result shows
that for a set of states under certain
continuous symmetry then the replication
we know exactly what the limit how many
how many extra reliable copies you can
yet and if you restrict yourself to
disturb deterministic processes the
extra copies you can produce is sub
linear in the original copy in other
words you can produce a large number of
extra copies that are that that are very
faithful and now however if you allow
yourself a probabilistic process and
then it's obeys something called the
Heisenberg limit and and it turns out
that is possible to produce it's quite
counterintuitive you can produce nearly
a quadratic number of copies and that
actually is the best you can do you
cannot do anything better than that and
this is a paper published by three
authors and Scioscia bella is a
physicist in our Institute en is a
student of his and so and at the end and
so it's a collaboration between the
physicist physicist in computer
scientist and its publishing I journal
Nature communication so it's not a waste
a journal of theoretical puter science
and now how does this look at computer
science ha kwak why is it that computer
science actually computer scientists
actually would also be very at home with
the this question that physicists are
interested in because the cloning of
photons can be modeled as a
computational geometry problem in a
high-dimensional place and also this
problem is very similar to generating
almost identical keys in in cryptography
and now so those are two examples of
marrying computer science with economics
and physics and now let me find more
partners for computer science so this
one is really have a I think people are
interested in from very ancient times
and that now it's very important as a
report in New York Times that in 2012
the researchers found a fraction of the
public keys in the database
is they are not readily generate
generated so even though we we advise
them to Jenny Wren Denis but actually in
fact people don't generate those keys
randomly so you'll be possible for
someone to figure out the secret key and
decode sensitive online informations and
and so the question of random is it's
something that that have been interested
but I think that starting with
philosophers asking it's a university
random and and now as a science
statistiche in' have been interested in
for a long time and they it's a it's a
statistical test base and in the 1980s
because of cryptography computer
scientists become interested and put it
on using a different foundation so it
becomes really important for the
progress of cryptography and now in the
last 15 years the physicist Arthur got
interested in this question so the
question is that that that if you are
allowed to use quantum processes can you
get much better much stronger randomness
and so that if the physicists generate
using a certain device generate to you a
certain string of random claimed to be
random numbers can you actually can you
actually certify can you be certified
that's really truly random without any
complexity assumptions so this would be
empirical and if you assume the nature
to be quantum and now so that goes
beyond just the philosophical questions
and also the application of generate
cryptographic key and a hot topic in a
quantum cryptography among the physics
community is about device-independent
quantum cryptography what it means is
that is that in clinical photography
you'll have to use physical devices made
by some companies and suppose you don't
trust the company
is there a way so that you don't have to
trust the company if it works not as
specified you have an easy way to know
that it doesn't work as specified and
now the concept of the device
independent contractor photography was
raised in a computer science theory
computer science conference in 1998 and
but it's up it became very fashionable
in the indle in the in the last 10 years
and eventually a group of computer
scientists and I think anger probably is
a physicist end up they have made great
progress on this problem so eventually
after the paper people have found ways
to solve Department completely so they
published a paper in Nature last year
and the idea is to make use of the
certification process the quantum based
certification and made it possible for
people to design device independent
quantum cryptography so to conclude
where you think about all these examples
we think one can conclude that the
reason that it's possible for different
fields to have a chance to work together
in many ways is because they have
certain things in karma and for example
the sciences generally has a methodology
you observe the phenomenon you develop
theory you test them and you refine the
theory and further tests and so on and
now for many years computer science
looks more like mathematics and
therefore by this criteria it doesn't
satisfy the to be a size in but however
in recent years especially with the
emergence of internet phenomenon and
it's important to observe the traffic
and the characteristic of the network
and so computer science gradually has a
wing that would need to adopt this
methodology in order to make progress
you have to observe what the patterns of
traffic's are you have to use them you
have the develop theory of the Uslan so
that you can design efficient networks
and you have to test your theory etc and
the yep concretely this methodology they
all use a lot of mathematics and the
algorithms and at some of the key
concepts that are that are shared by all
Sciences involve probability complexity
approximations and there's another
reason that one can have subject of
common interest is because the common
abstraction actually if you look at some
of the hottest problem in different
fields they actually are the same
problem that with the same abstraction
that there are just different
manifestations and they have different
aspects that one want to emphasize so
for example the many-body systems as
undoubtedly this is the this is the
trend of development and the hardest
subject facing everybody so in physics
people are interested in in in the
condensed matter physics which is the
many-body system and that you'll have to
you like to to understand how things
behave under different laws and under
under the natural law and in in in in
computer science people like to
understand what's the behavior of social
networks and in economics people want to
understand if you have the economic
incentive how to a large economic system
behave so all these are terribly
important problems and they are calm
obstruction
I think that the four I think a full
interaction between all these
researchers they're going to lead to
progress in each other's views and
finally there are universal topics that
are independent of any utility the
concept of what it means to be random
what is the nature of information these
are the things that would be forever
investigated and foam possibility of
collaboration between different fields
and so now in theoretical computer
science actually in recent years it's
starting to take shape in the sense that
interdisciplinary research has began to
be recognized and end up just share an
example that the Summer Institute at
Berkeley is a Institute that is
constructed explicitly for applying
theory of computation to different
disciplines and here is a anatomy of the
program on how they are ready and they
have designed their space in a very
efficient manner so enable people to
interact among different views and now
I'm putting an ad for our Institute and
we have started established actually
three years ago and we're starting from
three faculty and now we have 20 and we
have kinds and we have physics and I
think that we are one of the few
computer science Institute's that
actually have physics labs so i think
that the fit they do the net worth of
our physics lab is at least 10 * of the
SS of our or our computer facilities and
so we so here is a a of our laboratory
and we have just got some new space in
two floors in simple so I think
interdisciplinarity it's certainly I
think that
that that it has come of age I think
that certainly in China it also starting
to take shape thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
