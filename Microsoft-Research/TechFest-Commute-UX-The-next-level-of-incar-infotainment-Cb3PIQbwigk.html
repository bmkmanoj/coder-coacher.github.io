crowd-pleaser is car toys we love our
cards and our toys and this is why see
Mike and I Vaughn who are going to talk
to us about commute UX give me an
overview what is it so community X is
about improving the driver experience
people carry in their cars cell phones
media players they want to work with
them to listen music to music to hear in
the news and because driving his eyes
busy and hands busy task what's left is
spoken language and in most of the
existing systems drivers are required to
remember a complex set of menus to
remember the exact name of the song what
we design here is set of technologies
which low flat say anything anytime mini
structure and it's a heightened speech
recognition yes besides after the speech
recognizer actually we have a set of
very complex technology technologies
which include information retrieval in
recognition of the drivers intent which
allow us to guess from partial names in
less more than fifty percent of the time
actually drivers ask for in completely
clean complete names like I know I want
to hear Madonna but I don't remember the
name of the song exactly and we have a
technology to find that is the best
candidates and we'll all the driver
cookie to disambiguate which song
exactly he or she wants to hear now is
it just it for like music and radio is
there any other commands can it do with
it can even phone calls of course the
calling somebody from your phone book is
one of the relatively easy tasks but
what we have in addition actually is
something which we haven't seen and this
is a voice enabled user may know but I
think my can tell us a little bit more
Mike you're on the spot here you want to
tell us a little bit more sure so so I
found one of the most complicated things
that I find is it sifting through the
user manual with your car trying to
figure out how to change a tire or how
to put in your baby's car seat and it
turns out that if you actually read that
thing well you need to baby's car seat
you know just sat in the glove box yeah
well my wife you know did prefer I not
make that part up so so it turns out
that we can actually crawl all that
information and then have a very
accessible by voice which means you can
basically make a single query and the
manual page will pop right up I could
say how do i turn on my hazard lights
exactly Oh me show me let's take it out
we got a little bit of a we got a
forward here one of things that most
people you know cannot do is remember
the exact name of the song as it exists
in their player so you can say partial
things like for example play set them
free so it turns out the actual song
name is if you love somebody set them
free but the part he says the most is
set them free that's what people are
going to ask for so then this happens
all the time for example you know a lot
of times users will say multiple things
like I know I want to play my greatest
hits album but I have a bunch of em so I
don't know which one I want to say so i
can say play greatest hits by ABBA cut a
lot of Abbot there well so what we have
here is actually three different
greatest hits in my collection and I
know that Abba gold is actually the one
I want so now i can select that one and
we get the album and so what was
offering was all the greatest hits in my
collection and with the highest priority
given the one by ABBA because that's
what I specified and finally you can say
things that are completely out of the
context of the song where it's you know
very small party that's why my favorites
is play sex machine the actual title of
the song have to contain at least one of
the words what if I just know the chorus
of a song so currently the technology
you have to have at least i would say at
least one of the words right and the
more words right the better but if it's
buried among a bunch of other words
we'll still have a high probability of
giving you the answer did anything else
I should know about this for example on
the phone calls we can basically have
one shot all dialing without having to
do a bunch of redundant menu structure
so for example call Constantine at home
so it turns out that i only have one
constant in my phonebook I don't need to
make a bunch of redundant promise back
to the system right one shot I get all
the answer to the to the end now we're
talking a little bit about the manual
certainly so let me show you a little
bit there so here I have the car I don't
know what I need to get my oil changed I
can say something like maintenance
schedule and boom the maintence schedule
pops right up or let's say for example
this is a rental car I just hit a
pothole I don't know I need to change my
tire I first I don't even had to wear
the trunk latch is so I can say
open the trunk and here's a latch and
now I need to change the tire I can say
how do I change a flat tire and right
away the instructions pop up for
changing a flat tire is so handy so you
know this is our system we're pretty
happy with it and you know there's lots
of things you can do oh now we have an
incoming SMS iris needs a ride what
messaging system is that using is it
something you've created uh just a text
message select it's an incoming text
message and the idea is that we can
reply to it you want to keep again eyes
on the road hamster wheel so you can
reply to the incoming message with voice
and basically we'll find a good text
message template for that and send that
back to the user so for as so that we
can do another another case amy wants a
ride to reply not yet at four-thirty
send it and now you can see that it
actually didn't take my exact words but
actually sent them right that is so
awesome because I personally it drives
me crazy when people text and drive at
the same time it's just so not safe
that's right exactly elves that problem
exactly especially the more laws are
being passed about this stuff so we need
to still you know when users are still
no matter what we'd say users are still
going to use their devices so we need to
basically enable them to do it in a safe
way and how far are we from having this
in my actual vehicle um well we're
working on the underlying technologies
and they're progressing and we're
definitely in communication with some of
our product group partners to see to see
how it goes and actually why she's been
working with a lot of those guys more
closely so he can probably tell you a
little bit about why she step on over
here let's wrap this up why don't you
tell me when we're gonna have it in our
hands what have you been doing oh we
have done something I used to be nice
naughty two weeks ago all of the
subjects terrorists they want to have
these things a car but they also told us
at the same time they want our system to
to be able to handle more situations you
know so actually I think that would keep
us busy for they want it now and they
want it better yes you a little bit of
work to do uh-huh all right well thank
you very much it's called commute UX and
I'll hopefully soon you'll all have it
in your cars safe driving thank you all
right
