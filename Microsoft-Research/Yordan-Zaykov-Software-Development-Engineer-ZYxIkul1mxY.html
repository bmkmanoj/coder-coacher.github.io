somewhere between research and
development connecting the two and this
can be either very close to research
when I work with a researcher on a
prototype for a paper or it can be just
pure development when I work on
integrating some new technology into a
Microsoft product while researchers read
and write papers the day-to-day job of
the developers is to write code so we
would write the software infrastructure
we would make things run at scale will
run experiments will make sure that all
of the prototypes that the researchers
had developed work on all possible types
of data sets in inputs as an engineer at
Microsoft Research I'm obviously
involved in many tech transfers with the
product side of Microsoft one of them
includes a collaboration with our
machine learning cloud service in Azure
this was really amazing because it tries
to comprise all of the machine learning
in Microsoft into one single product so
this was about about a two-year
challenge which required taking some
really prototype e ideas that the
researchers had and bringing them up to
the product level my proudest
achievement whilst here at Microsoft
Research I think was the shipment of the
office 365 declutter feature this is a
feature in outlook which uses machine
learning to automatically predict if an
incoming message to your inbox will be
classified as clutter or not and that's
personalized with user the cool thing
about it is that is now used by millions
of people and it builds on a framework
called in for dotnet which was developed
here at MSR Cambridge
each year microsoft research helps
of influential speakers from around the
world including leading scientists
renowned experts in technology book
authors and leading academics and makes
videos of these lectures freely
available
