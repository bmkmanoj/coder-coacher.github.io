working on user interaction and
basically what we are looking at is how
to use large display and how you want to
use those large displays with different
devices like phones so as an example
when you have large display basically
one of the issue is that if the display
is very long you'd have to work to
actually reach the bezel so fine sense
if you want to reach the bezel you would
have to do a long distance or if the
display is very high actually you might
have to actually jump to get to the to a
fixed menu so in order to look at that
what we have done is use a palette that
appellant next to your finger so if you
put your finger down you have a palette
next to it and then it's like a palette
of a painter so I can change color and
so on I can also have other type of
menus so fun santafe expand that I can
have other type of functions but then
what we have been looking at is how to
expand this experience with actually the
phone so now Jason is going to come to
my office when Jason comes close to my
display connect recognize the distance
and actually show a tag and now Jason
calc a register with the display and now
Jason sees a palette and now can
interact with the display we can even
attract both together at the same time
if Jason actually now step away from the
display what we could have is connecting
forming the phone and the UI on the
phone changing based on that from here
we're going to launch the keyboard and
go into the Windows Start screen we're
going to launch the maps application by
typing in M&amp;amp;A and then we're going to go
to the mouse control and just kind of
move the screen around so you can see
I'm controlling the machine so another
advantage of having the phone is Jason
can remotely access his machine and
filed on his machine and seamlessly move
down to the
display show recent files
now we'll go ahead and run it and then
we can navigate to the next slide so in
conclusion we have been looking at how
to use the strengths of the large
display the strength of the phone and
combine them together as a society of
appliances</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
