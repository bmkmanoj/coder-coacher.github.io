quality such as the concentration of PM
2.5 is of great importance to protecting
people's air from the damage of air
pollution in reality however there are
only a limited number of air quality
monitoring station that have been built
by garments experienced such kind of
system is very expensive in terms of
land use money and human resource for
taking care of it
unfortunately air quality were roused by
location significantly and it's highly
skewed City as we can see for example
this is map of Beijing which I can
stands for one air quality monument
station that has been viewed by garments
now the problem is we don't really know
the air quality of a location without a
station for it ah what's air corner of
this location so to address this issue
we infer the fan green and real-time air
quality throughout entire city by using
two pair of data so one is a historical
and real-time air quality data from
existing systems and another with file
additional data sources we observe the
city by using machine learning and data
mining algorithm we build a network
between the data we observe in a
location and air quality of the location
so in the future given the data of the
one location we can infer the air
quality of the location based on the
model so this is the Orang data we have
and this is water we can infer so the
system connects cloud with clans the
cloud continuous collect real-time data
such as meteorology in the air call it
data and processing data and provide a
user with a real-time service and user
can access air quality data that use
either a mobile clan or website so let's
take a look at website first so this is
a website that is public available by
using this website you can check air
quality of any location by just clicking
on the map so you can see the air
quality index of different kinds of air
pollutants and they can also check - air
quality in region or the air quality
in town city and we also have a mobile
clan that allows user to check air
quality at anytime anywhere
so this is a user interface of the app
and each banner stands for one location
and the user can add additional location
by long-pressing the map so you find a
new location area and you can also check
the trend of air quality of different
curtains as we know many countries are
suffering from air pollution this
technology can be applied up globally
urban air inversed a real-time and a fan
green air quality through our entire
city by using a variety of big data it
combines cows with mobile cans to allow
users to check air quality anytime
anywhere
