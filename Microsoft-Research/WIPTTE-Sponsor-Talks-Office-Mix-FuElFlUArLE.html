you
our next presentation will be given by
anoop Gupta distinguished scientist at
Microsoft two important things about
anoop gupta 1 is he hired me here 16 and
a half years ago and the second one is
because of that I know that he has an
intense interest in education he hired
me to work on education he's been he
started an education vertical here he's
been focused on education for for most
of his time at Microsoft nope Thank You
Jonathan wonderful to be here sorry for
the glitches and we had to recycle the
projector to get it all going wonderful
to be here with an audience who is
focused on not one but several of my
passions in fact I am you know very
passionate about education I used to be
a professor at Stanford for 11 years I
taught there and since coming one way or
the other I focused around education a
second thing for me is also within
Microsoft I have tried and dude my best
play the role of champion for pan and
stylus and what we can do in terms of
improving the interfaces but also at a
business in strategy level where we go
and invest to make it a make it a
reality you know lots of studies from
what latency and touch and many of the
questions being asked maybe in the Q&amp;amp;A
we can go there today I wanted to focus
on one of my latest projects that I have
a lot of passion around which is
involves education involves pan involves
touch which is around how do we make
interactive online presentations very
simple if you look at some of the
changes that are taking place on the
education side we are moving from a
world which is around you know much
or an industrial age world of everybody
learning in lockstep much more a lecture
oriented environment versus blended
online moving towards mastery and
personalized learning and pathways as we
go much more project-based learning and
interactive learning much more
continuous assessment that is their
online lessons that are created are
forming a big part of it they're not a
you know exclusive things if you whether
you think about you know what is
happening because they are a lot of
higher-end people here in terms of MOOCs
and sparks and I an online learning you
know flipped learning is a big thing in
K through 12 as you look at what is the
best use of face-to-face time limited
face-to-face time that we have its
students it's that's not used as just
you know lecturing but interacting so we
think of a lot of different users of
making these online presentations very
very simple to create reddits for
educational blended learning as i talked
about online learning MOOCs but since we
have a lot of researchers hair i'll talk
about an interesting use case that i
haven't seen this tool we spend a lot of
time energy money doing research okay
and we spend a lot of time preparing
presentations that we go to conferences
and get there's some number of people
who attend and then it is lost then we
travel to the next place may be together
but we never captured them as
presentation those students are trying
to do presentation so there's a lot of
users if you look at it for students you
know it could be project reports it
could be storytelling it is how you're
practicing you're going to give you a
research presentation if it was really
really easy to do all of those use cases
come around and then if you look at it
much more administrators for the K to 12
then professional development you know
leadership communications all of those
are very important Peter Gary Gail
Harris from the Manteca school district
and a good friend of ours then
push him a lot on how all of the
professional development is being done
so most of my talk actually are very few
slides supposed to fiddle actually be
demos oh really that I'll do so
challenge is that it's difficult to
author often it becomes you know using
some kind of screen recording software
and then using video to editing tools to
you know bring it together if you bring
them together it's very hard to add
quizzes polls exercises and you know if
you do it create such a rich thing you
say we are not going to publish it and
if you figure out where you're going to
publish it then you say you know I want
to see I shared it what happened it's
very hard to get that particular data so
what office makes is one is it's an
extension to powerpoint ok forget adding
or whatever that means it's an extension
to powerpoint that makes it easy to
create lessons that have full animations
that allow you to inc you can have your
audio video narration that allow you to
put quizzes and polls that allow you to
put simulations all of those things can
be very easily pieced together i'll
create a lesson in front of you right
now it's a free web portal so there's a
client side piece and then there's a
cloud service piece support away you can
it's me that's the you tube like thing
you know where you can publish you can
share and you can get the Alex
associated with that the tag thing is
you know in any such thing you need a
player equivalent to the video player in
some sense so there's a player
associated with it that is totally
cross-platform okay and finally what we
give you is not a fixed thing it is an
extensible thing where people can go and
create lots and lots of stuff so with
that is the introduction slides I'm
going to spend a fair bit of time trying
to create this is publicly available you
can go download it you know all of you
with pen I see many many surfaces
Microsoft machines you can download this
start creating when you go home now
there are three pieces
to office mix okay the first piece is
that I'll show and I'll show you this
order the first pieces around what is
the user and user experience so if your
student is taking your door your
colleague you know you've created
something and published what are the
kinds of things they can do I'll show
that the second thing is i'll show you
how to create some such things and then
the third thing i'll show you is talk a
little bit more about the portal and
analytics so the place where you get
everything from is this URL mixed office
com you can download it right after the
session in the evening and start
creating from there what you do is you
get to download the adhan from there
this extends your part 1 2013 to allow
you to do a bunch of her fun things ok
so what I'm going to take you to is a
gallery ok well I'll show you a variety
of lessons that people have created you
know interactive presentations and these
can get very fancy or these can be very
very simple that regular people creates
so here is one on owns law ok so you can
see there's a REO there's inking so the
key thing is actually it is power point
in the back so this is not a video
although it seems like a video this is
not a video this Israeli power point in
the back and only the audio and the ink
is getting stressed on this thing so you
get all the fancy animations but these
are all just PowerPoint animations it's
not anything fancy that we are doing ok
you get all of the ink etc that is
associated with it so you know that all
works you have a very nice visual table
of contents associated with it because
when i'll show you authoring you know
everything is like centric instead of
video timeline centric the whole
authoring experience and the consumption
so you know I have this thing and I can
go and jump around back to the slide if
that's what I want
to do and then you can also embed videos
right inside just like in PowerPoint so
this is a oh you know high school video
I mean it excites them to do such things
you know the actually the learning is
better if any more of your senses are
engaged as everybody knows ride mean and
so this is Ohm's law simulator that is
there and if you were to go you know
here's the quizzes and I can try and
take it and it'll tell me it's wrong and
this is the right answer now every
interaction that I'm trying to do with
this in the client piece is recorded in
the cloud and that'll give you the
analytics so you don't have to do
anything you know right out of the box
this will allow you to do that next
maybe let me try and show you something
very simple ah you know that a teacher
dead so this is AK through 12 scenario
if I can just go and click here so do
you know this is a math teacher she's
just creating something and you know
sure she sets up the lesson objectives
and using simple animations so much
simpler thing than the Ohm's law and you
know here you can see how she uses
animation and in king okay so it might
look fancy you know but again she has a
quiz embedded right inside and again you
have a visual table of contents
associated with it you can also create
so you know that this is something I
created which talks a little bit about
so one of the again are difficult things
and videos if you create is how do you
get hyperlinks and all those kinds of
rich things there so again here because
its power point base if you have hyper
lately you know you can do internal and
external links so they just were so if i
come here this is my table of contents
come here I can jump back to online i
can go to summary and getting started so
all of these very hyper linked lessons
etc can be very very easily created ah
in the experience that you have and i'll
show you one more and then we can you
know and people don't use it just for
science there's a lot of music things
and other kinds of things that are there
inside so let me see and did I hit
return i wanna i will go and create
something like the one that i'm showing
you right now you know yeah you know
this is just showing you the different
kinds of features that we have inside
but i want to show you just you know so
you've already seen a quiz you can
insert Khan Academy videos inside so you
know those those are all possible I
muting rather than you can have Khan
Academy exercises so I'm just showing
you a lot of interactable that you can
do inside you can check answer you can
say show hence everything just works you
know you can do complex simulations i
will insert one and show you later on
that you can do you can have you know
fluid matt inking based stuff that you
know you can move around and you can do
that stuff you can put in you know
programming labs and put in simulations
so there's just a lot of different kind
of stuff that you can bring in into a
lesson so you'll say okay you know
pretty fancy how do i create one okay so
let's go into the creation part of it so
this is PowerPoint okay this is just a
very simple deck similar to the 1i have
it has three animations and then it is
just blank okay so that there's nothing
fancy about this deck when i install mix
i get this thing called mix tab okay
mixed tab is the thing that gives me the
ability to add audio video inc quizzes
video
is screen captures and allows me to both
export the video but what we will talk
about is uploading to mix which is this
cloud service and the fancy things that
it allows you to do so let's go and
record slide so here I have just you
know selected a camera which is using
this one and that is the audio let me
just use to do audio too okay so we have
some audio and video that we are
capturing I have some choose colors pen
thicknesses and I just hit this you can
see you know office makes a quick tour
of features I can come here you know
things that teachers can do things that
students can do things that
administrators can do and then here are
all the features that are available
inside office mix so I come and do this
so what it does is it takes my linear
video actually n divides it on a per
slide basis okay so i can go and play
this I can go and I can actually delete
this slide turn the camera off because I
want to do an audio only audio only here
are all the features that are available
inside office mix so you know suddenly
what you have is now an audio only
version of this slide so you get a lot
of per slide editing capability okay the
other thing i want to show you in terms
of creation is that all of these things
because its power points what is
leveraging raley's all the beauty of
PowerPoint I could move this around here
I could make it smaller in size and put
it right here you know this one is too
big I can go here and make it smaller I
don't know I'm going to just put it here
I can go and reorder slides so basically
the final video is assembled just as
your sequence of slides the way you
would normally do and how the decks you
can share and this is you know resides
on your file I can come
here i can say i'm on an attic quiz and
i can say multiple response bowl and I
can you know add so i can go and say who
is that the tea and i can have some
handy van damme spelling it whatever i
won't try and connect his you know I
don't know buxton his hair we can add
foo and turns out you know so you can
create something like that it is you
know check too old you know our hair and
then you go to an upload and publish
process so i will come here i'm going to
just check so this is the part where it
is taking the presentation and taking it
to the cloud okay and this is where you
are putting it on a website so i simply
come here and we sign in and as I create
and basically within 30 seconds I am
going to have a mix that I could share
with 20 people in my class or I could
share with 2,000 on the internet or two
million in some sense you know on the
internet so the deck is getting uploaded
once the debt gets uploaded a lot of
fancy things happen to make it be
totally scalable so let's go and see
okay so this is show me my first mix I
clicked on this or not so if i go here
you know this is where i can play this
is what we just created hey i change the
sequence of slides if you remember and
then an audio only version
and then we had gone this was a blank
slide and then we head out at a quiz
slide and I can you know select and
submit whatever things I had chosen how
to do so it's a very very simple model
to create another thing to think about
is that your deck in some sense is your
source code for the video presentation
that you are trying to create so at any
point you can go and come here add
another slide add another drawing so
instead of showing you just inserting
more kinds of things i will just go and
draw out here you know here's my very
very crude elephant if i draw it you
know when I close it now this is part of
the slide deck in if I wanted to appear
hair boom publish it it's going to
appear hair so if you're trying to share
with other people what you have created
they can take in you know just the way
we take a few slides from somebody
copied over you can do all of this kind
of stuff right inside it and as I was
showing you here there are a lot of
different kinds of applications that are
available to you by default and these
things you know there's a store so this
is the general office store that is
there and these things can be extensible
in lots of ways to go and republish and
manage that I won't go into a lot more
actually one quick thing i want to show
you before we go into a few other slides
and that is that so if i go to my mixes
okay so this is where i manage the mixes
that I create so I'm just going to my
mixes and there's a variety of things
that I have think i will go to page
three i wanted to show you the analytics
the data then so let's see i had created
MX which so basically we give you a lot
of per slide analytics we tell you how
much time people
spent on each of the slides oh so you
know hold on for that so here let me
take you so here is a slide you know
this is a short deck that I did so this
is the x slides analytics by visitors
analytic and by exercises so for each
slide it tells me how many visitors how
many views average time spent things
like that it gives me information each
individual what they did and then I can
click on any individual and understand
what they did I can also automatically
go by exercises and I can see how they
answered each of the questions that is
there and all of this is exportable 2x2
excel so all of these analytics are
automatically you know visible to you so
let me go back here and talk a few
things so you know again the key thing
is simple familiar if you know how to do
PowerPoint you can now start creating
these things lessons don't start from
scratch start from the existing tags
adding interactivity it's really as
simple as clip hard to go and do the
things Sharon easily and it's best of
all it's so free a couple of other
things so two kinds of extensions here
so one is this set of apps that you saw
these are totally extensible so we can
get the larger community you know
whether it's college students high
school students all it takes is
basically html5 JavaScript skills to go
and create these apps that can then be
embedded and we working with lots of
partners to do it but you can do that
the second is the player itself is very
flexibly controlled and skinned as you
are trying to embed it in fact you know
the whole thing is an embeddable so our
notion is not that you necessarily come
to our portal just like YouTube is there
you know you can take a youtube embedded
video and put it in your portal anywhere
else we support LTI embed Leo in bed so
there are thousands of places beyond
Facebook Twitter
sharepoint Moodle let X you can you know
New York Times you can go and embed
these mixes inside those sites to do
that one other quick thing I wanted to
just share about in this a little bit in
tons of the directions we're going in so
we can leave so we're also looking at so
it showed you one creation process right
there i am in front recording my video
whatever else we do with the slides and
in king to create an interesting thing
if you're also working on this thing
called that they call post mixing the
post mixing is that you get some studio
videos so just like there is a camera in
the back that is not linked to the
powerpoint presentation i'm doing with
the video corresponds to that i might
want to merge those together okay to
create a mix like structure where I get
the analytics where people can jump
around people can pick slides and do
things and then light mixing is that
what I'm doing right now itself gets
recorded into so like mixing is further
away but i'll show you a quick example
of post mix there's this huge conference
going on right now that Microsoft is
doing called build okay and so
yesterday's keynote will also be
available as a mix so you know normally
what we do is you just take the video
and you embed the video that is there
once you do it as MX you know you have
but you also have a big you know table
of contents that is there and so you
know here you can say Satya is going
away he's inviting so there's a very
nice kind of index that you have
throughout and you know or you can say
oh you know the fun things for me are
the xbox thing so you know here alex is
talking about how hollow lens and
holographic can
so you know he talks about how you can
study any things like that so I wanted
to show you just that they do many many
extensions that are possible as you go
in with this and and so finally we'll
all I would say this is freely publicly
available you guys have the stylists you
guys have windows you know get
PowerPoint 2030 probably most of you
have you can start creating you can
start sharing get your graduate students
to do it when the practice and they have
to go to conference and they say in our
practice meant oxidase let's send it to
me as a mix just don't send me the
blanks likes you know corresponding to
it even when you're sharing just simply
PowerPoint decks you can take a blank
deck without any audio video this is a
very nice feel for it and where you can
share a read-only copy off the deck with
your colleagues do you flipped
classrooms blended lessons MOOCs is this
this also allows you to do video so we
will love for you to try it out there's
a lot of excitement around it and people
who are creating it and give us feedback
okay so we look to your feedback and
we're a very agile team to be able to
respond to it and make it much much more
useful to you thank you so much
Thank You anup we have time for a couple
questions I think the office mix
features really cool it's made me use
PowerPoint a lot more than I have in the
last couple years um I really like that
the screen recordings now now baked into
it i find that feature really useful
thank you it would be really neat if I
could also annotate the screen recording
so if I could take another app yeah load
the video in and then annotate that
video it make an even more dynamic tool
now thank you so much we really
appreciate the feedback you know that is
something we are definitely looking into
it but one of the design points that we
have had for this and it's not an excuse
in any way is we are very inclusive so
if you use Camtasia let's say to do is
something you can put the Camtasia our
video inside and we'll work totally
smoothly with the rest of it so you know
where we are not perfect or we haven't
you know so far in our young life I
haven't been able to do that work you
know please use other tools and we
partner with those other tools yes so I
might miss this but for the quiz part
does that like all get collected
somewhere and then so if I am hosting
the slides and they're my kids take the
quizzes do I cielo vs yes yes you see
the responses the person who authors and
shares they are the owner and they see
the responses of the students you can
sort them out you can get them out in
Excel and look at them there yeah yes
please yeah two questions does this work
both with 32 and 64-bit PowerPoint yes
please and second can you use your
office 365 accounts for the students to
log into the mix just to my classes
so the way you are control your sharing
is you have the link okay fees and with
the link you can make additional
requirements like you know you have to
login to do it so you get the names etc
or you can make it anonymous you just
send it to the people who you wanted to
and it they'll respond in fact if
somebody outside did group responds you
would see their name and he's now
something funny's happening they
shouldn't have shared the link okay
let's thank anup again for very concise
