you
right good afternoon everyone we're
delighted to have a van boo who was a
postdoc here a long time ago and we're
happy for that for many reasons
particular when we ever we want to hire
a postdoc we tell them well look how
people here end up it's all because of
being here anyway and van is now a
talking about the also one of your
favorite subject for many of us say
roots of random polynomials please very
much so as the ongoing work with Terence
Tao and Oh angry Annette Ohio State and
my student wing Lee Annette Hill so yes
so let me just go right into the after
the matter so I I windstar well it will
be there will be many other things in it
but let us start with the simplest
questions that we want to determine the
number of reducible polynomial I will of
course in the talk there would be things
about complex rotoscoping just a like
this we have a polynomial with Riaan
coefficients like an Asian questions we
want to know this and there are a lot of
things for instance in high school know
many of us learned the class root of
size 400 years ago that if you look at
the number of sign changes in the
coefficients so how many's time is sweet
switch from negative to positive or vice
versa and that is an upper bound on the
number of positive roots and you can use
a similar trick to about the number of
negative roots as well okay so for this
audience we will now we talk about the
general case when we have a random
polynomial it was random well by which
we understand that the coefficient a
sample
chosen randomly by some law and it was
first look at by worrying int so in the
18th century that he proves something
like this the probability of a root a
complex divided by the probability that
this they saw the stick two cases voted
by two now of course in this setting in
the old time it allows us investor also
look at it later it's the P in the book
of Thoth hunters in hundred years ago is
one of the first textbook in probability
now but of course in toast I'm
probability distribution were not
determine rigorously so you can change
this number two by two any other
constant if you choose the right
distribution for coefficients ah yeah
but just for the sake of history I
mentioned that ok so the matter we will
talk about in the modern language is
that we look at this random polynomial
when the coefficient cir I ID is the
copies of some random variable C and we
denote by m capital and the number of
real roots of this so this is sometimes
referred to as a cat polynomial of
course there are other models with which
if i have time i will mention later when
the things are not necessarily iid
moleste with this one why so the first
Rizzo in this direction was obtained by
block employer in 1932 when they look at
the matter when the coefficient uniform
0 plus minus 1 and then they proved that
with probability tending to one the
number of green dude is bounded by
square root n now it is much better than
the root of sorry you see that we put
plus minus one day and the number of
sign changes would be linearly
but they managed to prove square root
and I by the following idea that you
multiply the the polynomial with some
function which is always positive and by
that you can change the number of side
changing so it is a very nice
combinatorial idea and it works for
other distribution as well if you have
plus minus 1 it worked the same way
don't need 20 there and that is poya
block has no picture that I can fine
unfortunately I think he is famous of
the timing in the hospital and
communicated by mail and whenever he
wrote a male he died did April first no
matter when he wrote it ah so there is
the the the research pick up with the
famous work of little hood and awkward
living analyst in England in the 1940s
so he's yes what mentioned Nestor
folding work of Oxford make him famous
and so in the series of three papers in
it 38 to 43 they show that if you take a
seat to be bad newly so it's plus minus
one then the number of renewed with high
probability is bounded between almost
look analog square root n and and thy
side at the same proof hole for other
distribution like I've seen in uniform
and that's with easy to check to be the
case so it must paper they focus on the
plus minus one case and it was surprised
yeah it was sort of surprising for the
Mac community at that time i sir as
people guessed at the number of real
wood is more than luck but his numbers
really small the water one may expect
her yet so during the tim same time
there's another important group by cuts
he actually observe a general formula
for the expectation of the number of
inputs so he can write out an explicit
formula for this
one drawback of this is that it's all
easy to evaluate in the Gaussian case
although you can write it formally for
any crisis even plus minus one but but
only in the Gaussian k is sort of easy
to evaluate and eternal subtle
expectation is is asymptotically to over
by the way actually kak was very
enthusiastic when he wrote his first
paper and proved this for Gaussian
anything that it it should be the same
for a rather random variable which have
say mean 0 and variance 1 and about five
years six years later he bro another
paper saying it okay I'm little bit
wrong I can only do this for uniform but
maybe result with general and and then
and then there are Stevens he can show
this for Smoot random variables can even
somehow they manage they evaluate cuts
formula now if we go to the plus minus
one case it took a wife rum cask paper
is the Easter quite a famous quote
operation up for in 56 when they proved
again the number is asymptotically 2
over pi loca and with the arrow term is
like looking into the tutor and actually
this proof is quite fascinating is it's
due the following yin and it's very hard
to imagine that why it works so what
they do is they they pick a bunch of
boys a capo on the real I let me just
prove the low bow bow sake is a roughly
2 over pi lo pan and they look at the
value of the curve of p.m. at this point
right so the function at this point I
say that with decent probability say
probably quite close to one the the
value of the function will change from
one point to the other um the size of
the value of the function yes so if you
pick this to poi close to each other
and they managed to show that is this
negative is positive and off sorry this
positive is negative and so on say yeah
the nice thing is that they pick this
point advance they are fixed boy and
then they say that with high probability
most of the consecutive pair we have
side changes and then you have the logo
bar for the number of roots yeah yeah of
course you have to make some arrow to
him somewhere you deliver yeah the Lord
Louis give evil / bar with the right
constant and then they have to do some
other things that they're saying that a
really very rich it is and then later on
Ibrahim oh and Marshall over generalize
approve of evolution of Ferdinand for
other Oh other were random variable with
mean 0 and variance 1 in and get
asymptotic formula and if you go into
the Provost is even more complicated in
the equation up for them and optimize
everything probably you will get the
Arab term of order square root logo for
the expectation now on the other hand
from the cuts formula there's something
interesting from that that you can
evaluate things very exactly I think
Cass formula in the Gaussian case give
something like this the density function
is equal 1 over pi is totally explicit
square root or sum over 0 / km minus K
squared X to the 2n plus 2 K minus 2
it is totally explicit function and if
you in to integrate this function from
minus infinity to infinity you will get
exactly 2 over pi love em and the next
term is the it's not Lily lower block
and by the explicit constant which is
asymptotically 4625 and the next arrow
term is actually over 1 over N and there
are people i think in paper Willis even
earlier than alderman and Gosselin they
even work out all the title expansion of
this next term is one some constant time
over N and the next one is another
constant over n square and so on it can
be computed very busy yeah I want to
describe a little bit the the document
of alderman and Gosselin not for the the
explicit computation but how you you get
the 2 over pi how it is for this for
this formula because yeah you can ask
well why the pie has anything to do here
this sort of nice argument in worker in
quite a general case not only discussed
so what they do is the following if the
see a Gaussian this Gaussian random
variable then you normalize it it would
get a normal either coordinate vector um
no more I the coefficient vector you get
a unit vector on the sphere unit sphere
now you look at the moment curve with
coordinates one accent up to X to the N
right and then the value of the
polynomial is actually the inner product
of this boy in the moment curve with
this vector right and then this inner
product is zero namely that you have a
root at X if and only if this vector is
orthogonal to this vector right so the
number of real roots is the number of
intersection this should be intersection
Oh
the projection of this curve on to the
sphere and random red circle right
that's just so much chica human yeah so
it looks like this and so you have some
curve here which is exactly it is
explicit curve is the projection of the
moment cup on to the sphere and and now
you look at the grey circle random
gresser go and see that how how many boy
did the sack yeah and now if you look at
this curve now this cop is complicated
but let's look at a very simple case
when you have a simpler scope which is
another great circle then you have
exactly two intersection now you take a
small piece of this then you will have
to time the length of this in
expectation and then they just break
this cup into small pieces so you win
what you get is just the 2 over pi time
the length of the cup and you can
compute a curve by this formula ah ok ah
ok so now I'm the Rizzo I want to
present now is the following that we can
prove that for any random variable with
mean 0 and variance 1 and say about it 2
plus epsilon woman the num the
expectation is 2 over pi plus a constant
another constant blossom mouth at Big O
of 1 and this big o is I think have to
depend on the on the random variable so
it may not be the same constant
everywhere well we don't know it is a
constant or not it just found it I me on
your own your own advance
oh no it can depend on epsilon 2 so it
depend on see this dependency and
epsilon is the information of C but it
only depends on your boundaries you
concepts on mon depend on epsilon needed
doesn't depend on how small would that
be oh how big that is
but so
yeah but um yeah and I sustained a few
questions related to this Rizzo but I
the main thing is I i like to use it as
a bite actually to present something
more significant behind it's a proof is
actually more interest interesting dinda
you so we say although this is already
surprising that you can get to this
preciseness okay um well asking what if
for a fixed Saigon and fixed volume to
pacify the moment but various different
variables sign does your one as you're
able to i'll change I see probably not
but i i i i don't yeah i did not
yeah so let me tell you the ideas behind
the proof which actually based on quite
a general technique okay so first of all
this this thing is standard for people
doing random functions but let me go
over it anyway so if you we start with a
polynomial is right and if we look at
another polynomial the file I this in
turn we just reverse the order of the
coefficient and it go from X to 1 over X
so that met the spectrum from 0 1 2 1
infinity so that means that we can
restrict ourselves to the number of
recruits in 0 1 and if we know the
number of bring booze here we multiply a
factor of four we get everywhere from 0
1 is the same way from 0 1 to infinity
and the other side of the spectrum is by
symmetry okay so first we start with a
small this is where the big o
come from that if you fix any small
Delta a delta is the one over a thousand
then with high probability the number of
renewed is valid as a function of Delta
this is no from the liklihood of foot
paper where they they didn't study this
but is inside the argument so yes so the
spittoon we look at it from 0 to 1 and
actually if i go to even boy 99 I here i
have only say a thousand root here that
I say it's a big Oso the main the main
the ballpark of the spectrum is very
close to one not very good maybe soon
because now you put all the roots near
one before they were spread out he never
spent a symmetry no I know I'm just
saying that like you're saying all the
roots are here yes little done man if
you to go transmission
stay no way I have a soft one just okay
with us going over no I mean this is joe
metrics users yeah you think of this guy
cns the plus minus 1 by it will be
nominated by one term it is far from
what is it what is it fits 4 into 1
verse ok so the rain part of the probe
is I say we say look at the bulk of the
spectrum and what we prove there is and
sort of a universality result namely
that the expectation of the number of
real dutra doesn't really depend on the
choice of the atom variable so if it
replaces SI SE plus from plus minus one
to two gaussian then we lose all your
small error which go to 0 with delta so
what I say that here so this part
actually the number of windows in
expectation are exactly more less the
same and then we just make the aerodrome
in this and if you have a different
approach to estimate the error term here
precisely and then we have a precise but
because for Gaussian everything can be
computed very exact um yeah ah
yes oh yes oh it's the nice thing is
that in the bowl you don't see the
influence of the distribution of Sierra
so every see behave the same and on the
other hand we cannot cite the same thing
for the edge right in this interval
because if we take from this interval
from 0 to half we know that the plus
minus one guy don't have any root so if
you take random polynomial with plus
minus 1 coefficient every route should
have absolute value watch it in half on
the other hand the Gaussian can have
worked with you it's less than half so
so they are not supposed to behave the
same way at the edge that's why i think
that the constant error term would be
different from time to time ah okay so
yeah so let me go over the main ideas of
this it is actually the proof about
something some more general universality
a phenomenon not only not only the
expectation other things as well so yeah
so the step one in this work is that we
prove the universality ho but for small
Delta which is not no longer one over a
thousand one over million but say a
small power of M small- Paulo answer we
go even so though even to hear is like 1
minus n to the minus a thousand
um
and then we prove that that is actually
where eighty percent of the work is and
then we extend this use a different
trick to extend the first result 20
small Delta yeah so now let me because
in order to prove this universality I
need to understand the distribution of
all routes not only the the real one and
and here's a few experiment some picture
which are copy from joan baez web page
if you look at the set of all roots of
complex andrew together there will be n
of the mob bosses it is ground know that
the limiting distribution they go to the
unit circle so it is sort of the picture
I don't know he make a lot of
experiments with high degree polynomial
and get this so there's some via thing
you see here there somehow you see near
the boy 1 and minus 16 1 and minus 1 and
there's a fractal of the boundary that I
don't know if anyone understand it here
and there's also some black hole on on
the circle and this convergence was
proof long time ago that we know that is
converge to this by these people yeah
now let me zoom in the reno aces when we
really care about yes so we see a bunch
of roots on the Reno Aces but we also
see something very nice or something
very remarkable here that's a sump
repulsion between the real truth and the
complex so when you have the rindels
actually we have we see some hole there
that a complex root do not get in
we don't do it for me they give you the
same picture and actually we prove that
they were in the same picture not at the
level of the same fractal interest
Hollies is a correlation is a level 1 of
1 over them it is a rug level is a
universality at the local ah yeah so
yeah so that's what I just mentioned to
you vote that we look at the local limit
now so ah yes we have this picture
yeah so a huge circle and now we look at
just a small region right so near this
circle we expect to see n boots and now
we look at some region D which is really
small when we expect in expectation we
see say one root right so that's what I
just and we are going to prove that if
in the Gaussian guys we expect to see in
the one root then you replace Gaussian
by same annually we will have more let
the same expectation and this is going
to be true not only for the first
correlation function is true for any
fixed correlation but i don't i would
not mention that ah now but what is the
point if now this take care of the old
kind of root ringing and complex alike
but if you go to the let me to be close
to the real line then we know that then
by refusing it we have a reroute Evans
naoko black fruit so actually if in this
guide we expect to see one day in route
to the gaussian guys we also expect to
see wondering root in the other case as
well because there's just no complex
root by repulsion well we have to prove
that as a repulsion the same proportion
in the gaussian guys and and and and the
plus minus one guy so that's also part
of the universality
yeah so basically the thing we really
proof with Terry is that we probe local
River universality 40 correlation
function that gives you the density the
to boycott repulsion and so on and so
forth that will take care of step 1 and
2 I am NOT going to defy correlation
function because it's sort of technical
but but I I will be glad to discuss more
later yeah okay so there's some
technical requirement here that's why we
need this condition is that we have to
be close to one namely that we need the
center of d must be reasonable to the
unit circle so it cannot be like at
least an one over a thousand from one it
had to be Oh boom negative polynomial
distance okay so the idea behind this
let me give you the ally through a very
simple example and then then we will go
to the the key of the vision of the key
new idea so let me introduce this linen
both switching idea which is very useful
and for proving limiting distribution of
universality of the limiting
distribution so the way I understanding
the versatility is something like this
you heard a word a few times but let me
define what I think about so let me have
a black box here and then there's a
sequence of inputs I see one up to CN
they are IID random variable and and the
black box give you some function and
this guy have some limiting distribution
now there's some other sequence c 1
prime of CN prime coming in and you have
another sequence coming out
and my universality I'm is that if now
if we cannot differentiate the C 1 and C
1 prime I looking at the output they
wouldn't have the same limiting
distribution and one case we know very
well is a case when you put in the side
of black box you just take the sum of
the CIA no more live by square root n
which give you the central limit theorem
right so no matter what a very end and
variable with mean 0 and very once you
take you take the summer normalize it by
square root and you get the same
limiting distribution let me prove it
here for you by what they are several
proof essential limit theorem but the
linear linden linden but ones is what we
try to imitate later so it goes like
this yeah so we have to care about the
limiting distribution of this guy acts
which is just some and if we want to
control the distribution of this is
small as enough to control the
distribution of the expectation of a
test function on ax a so we can take the
test function to be an ed the threshold
function ok so now in order to consider
the X prime we can do the following or
linear but is the following trick that
he switched c to c prime or c2 de one at
a time so sorry this guy should be see
as well so first you switch the first
one to see Tudor in the second step you
switch the second one and so on so after
end step you will get from X to X tilde
and we just try by this thing by
triangle inequality when one at a time
we see how much how much is the the fact
in one switching and even one switching
we we conditioned on everything except
the pair that we
we are switching then you look at the
difference between the two lie and you
can use Taylor expansion here so you
condition on everything else which give
you this X I bar the first is not yeah
nice so excite my eyes what me he
happily subtract which we need to
subtract yes you are yeah but yeah with
the right definition of X I bad and then
by taylor expansion you have this but
now if we take the expectation and we
know that CI and CI by have the same
mean in the same variance the first two
term disappear so we can have the totem
which quite magically have the end to
the three of what okay it have n 3 half
here and a queen q of the fact of
something in terms so you would have a
narrow term which go to 0 and you can
even happen yeah you can have a error
term which is negative power of air oh
okay so does the main idea behind a
linear switching yeah i'm now of course
we in order to do this we cannot take
out to be the threshold function we have
to smoothen it to take the derivative
and the method was very well for
explicit variable axial if have the way
to ride out access some explicit
function in the sea for instance if not
a linear form but higher polynomial in
seed and then for instance there's a
guacamole we're all that deal with such
a crisis have application in computer
science to ah ok so but what we care
about here is some function which is
very implicit right because what we care
is this function x which is the number
of brought in a region D so some Richard
is given near the circle now shut it is
a function in hermosa
Adam variable C 102cm but it is not an
explicit function light some more the
polynomial or any way you cannot right
now in any way and and so here's the
idea actually which I really like took
us a while to find it for once you find
it is it worked quite similar in a
simple way that you convert this
conversion from implicit to explicit
yeah so what you do is that you look at
the root of the polynomial and let F be
the function you care about say it is
the indicator of this region right so
the number would we care about it's just
the sum of the indicator right so the
indicator will give us one it takes root
and zero otherwise no of course you have
to smooth this function a little bit to
take derivative and the key is that this
is green formula let's say that if you
have a nice function f and f can be no
it's a good the same green in calculus
have can be f zero can be written at
this way right so this is something that
actually in calculus quick we learn but
now we just plug it in and ship
everything right so FZ i should be local
z minus z i times the laplacian and
which we sum up the right-hand side then
basically we sum up the lot namely we
take the love of the product but the
product of z minus Zi Zi at the root of
the variable of the polynomial so it
actually it is the polynomial its shell
normalized by the first coefficient safe
so this thing we really care about the
number of root is now on the explicit
function is completely explicit it's
just the interval okay so that's the
first part of the conversion the second
part is that now although we have this
integration we can prove it we
can estimate it by sampling we can stamp
well if we have an integration we can
take em random pool inside the region
and take them being that in principle
have to give us a good approximation of
this number now okay so now after we
take this sample boy y 1 up to YN and
fix them then now these functions acts
which car the number of root is an
explicit function of those gy1 up to g
ym and now you can use the linnean back
here to prove the universality of this
vector very the same well now it 30
purchase I in his behaviour they can
become very natural except the last
episode and surprised with this open
sampling here just add error you need a
can't you that work you do the same
method review replacement of the
integral example because I need this guy
to bring fix ah and here M will be a
small power of M directly the
replacement in people and shortly thank
you
I don't know how to do maybe that's a
better
yes yeah and and if there is a simpler
way to do that that would be nice but
yes service ok and then so in order to
prove that the sampling is give you the
right thing then we have to buy the
variance and so on and so that this part
is it is a technical tune we need to
borrow the variance here that say
because we want the sample to make the
rice tomates so we have to say that ok
the variance of this guy's mo and
basically spoiled out to say that the
lock the function is not too large for
must Posey and and that part you have to
be with so so why this thing is is is
not entirely trivial we won the lock is
not to be large now the value of p.m. it
sounds very easy to borrow from above
Rebecca with some of enterman and they
are random variable with valid variance
0 so from a bow it is not too bad but
one thing is there which is less trivial
that you need to borrow it from below
that it is not too small and that is not
entirely trivial that how you use it
because it can be sometimes small if you
look at a value of some special value of
Z then the value of the polynomial
evaluated as it can be can be really
zero for instance if you look at Z to be
say the cubic root of unity right and
then now you look at this guy
a w w square so this guy could be one
and I now rip you up w to the fort would
be w + and so on right so actually if
you have to some this guy up then they
they they are periodic I so if you then
you can rewrite your polynomial like
this the periodic with Perry okay ah but
yeah but now this guy can be zero with
some decent probability now yeah so if
we split our things it will be right it
will be write it as a polynomial in w's
of the free coefficient is this and it's
a sum of n over K terms the max
coefficient of sources some of an
evaporator and each of this guy have a
decent chance to be 0 did have a chance
of square root 1 over square root n
chance to to be 0 so the probability
equals 0 is not small it can be like n
to the minus K over 2 so it can be n to
the minus one half n to the minus 2 3
half so on and this cannot be ignored
totally and so the lemma we really have
to prove is that actually this K root of
unity I the only trouble some point if
we can avoid get a little bit far away
from the curry root of unity then then
the probability that your our polynomial
is small ways very small and it is
something that I built we built in the
last few years so called the theory of
inverse lynnwood offered which deal with
the following question is can be thinner
than an antique concentration result
that the the main question is that we
have a linear form like this
and we want to know that how much mass
can it pick up at zero or any point for
that reason right so the classical is a
little wooded hope for saying the say
that eat the AI are nonzero then this
probability equals 0 cannot be more than
one over square root n now let's see
that if we are not satisfied with 1 over
square root and we ask that what happens
if I want the probability to be as small
as 1 over n cube what can you do that ok
so now we look for reason that make this
concentration probability to be large
say and the trivial one is the following
let imagine that other a ir integer and
they are integer in the small interval
of some long end to the three say then
by the central limit theorem we know
that with affections say at least point
nine it should be in the square root and
blow up of this interval right so the
probability the probability that x
equals 0 by pigeonhole principle is the
reciprocal of the length of the interval
you have a short interval and the mass
is in there so they would be the poison
when you pick up more mass and just a
reciprocal of the Langan if you take the
line to be polynomial then then the
probability can be polynomially large
you can general I this to a higher
dimension if you take a I to be boy in a
min scoffs minkowski sum of the
arithmetic progression and with volume n
to the seed and then you will have
similar bar which is right here so what
is enough to keep it this is the first
question my what we really proved in
this direction is that if we assume the
inverse on namely that we assume this
bow in advance that
probability yeah if have a mass boy with
mass at least this much then actually
most of the coefficient III has to be in
an arithmetic progression of the right
like that's okay but if we look at go
back to the problem that we had before
is that we have the sum of the AI AM
some of the CI WTF to the eye and we
care about this probability zero say
that this probability is large this is
only the troika is because what we
really care about this probability smoke
not only 0 but let me take the strikers
then my eye I could be this so if I say
that this probability is last time in my
eye I have to be on a shorter admitting
progression and a yeah he has echo de Zi
to the eye oh and that will imply that
the Z should be an algebraic number with
low degree and this somehow give you a
now you have a fueling that wider the
say the cubic root of unity will be the
only only met example that so that this
comes from the fact that you really work
with and your economic of low degree and
somehow you can go to that okay so that
that part plus the universality project
sort of take care of the first part of
the argument when we can have
universality from 1 to 1 minus some
polynomial function of N and by the way
the reason that we this has a long
history that why we come to this idea
because and it started a long time ago
when when we we started to work on
universality up
of random matrices so the the key
problem there is to poop universality of
the correlation function and and there's
two group working on that Terry and I
and then a division Yau and their
quarter and we work a lot on on random
and hermitian matrices wrestle is either
complex or real and symmetric calm black
and her mission and real and symmetric
so in this guy's we know that the
eigenvalues are in number and and and
the problem here was South quite a
successfully for the complex case and
and partially south for the ribcage so
we have good without their on the other
hand another model popular and then the
matrix theory just take iid with no
symmetry so if you have n square random
bit in the matrices now the eigen value
will not be real they are mostly complex
and the correlation function question
makes sense the same way as before and
the the original the first methods that
Terry and I and also the method that
that yow an address develop easy doesn't
work for these guys at all because it's
real I very much on the fact that that
hermitian matrices are not do not react
to two small perturbation on the other
hand we know that a small perturbation
to an own ambition matrices can and
change the spectrum quite a bit so we
have to find a new method to deal with
this and then actually this method was
sort of invented to do with the I I
decrease and then we realize that it
work for polynomial as well so and you
can also use it for the origin of
setting of course it doesn't need lead
to any news result but it is sort of
give
a common approach to to deal with the
random processes right so now the last
part of the puzzle is that we have to go
from this we have to go from the
universality very close to 12
universality not so close to one so yeah
so we know that we get Rizzo from here
for PN but I will go is that we want to
go to one minus Delta for some small
Delta so we need to extend that range
and and this point out to understanding
something from numerical analysis and
then this is another question which is
interesting by it all namely that how
often does a random polynomial have a
double root or even near double root in
some say for instance if you want to run
like the most popular method to compute
is the newton algorithm then the running
time is very crucially dependent on the
existence of double boot if the yeah so
you don't have double root and the
running time improved exponentially okay
so what we can show is that
we can have well it is actually not zero
we can have yeah if you look at the
interval from 1 minus Delta 2 1 minus L
I love n square over n then you are not
going to have a double root actually not
even going to have a new double root
namely that the root and the derivative
is not zero but very small then we don't
even have this case it's not zero he is
like point 99 ah and so let me tell you
why this is helping our our course of
extending this universality the thing is
that I try to cheat here a little bit so
Evie week yeah so given p.m. I can go
from 1 to 1 minus and to the minus Delta
and now we have to go from here to the
next one say 1 minus from arrow to the
minus Delta and now I can look at the
foursome l which is a some small power
of n instead of PM i look at p.m. so
it's a polynomial of degree m and i'm
saying that in this interval actually pn
+ BM and the roots in this interval I'm
all at the same because if you look at
PM is like this see and PM is exactly
this and now you add term ladies in
there
there is not truly more booze yeah of
course that's why that's why we need to
put the non-existent that would that's
right yeah that's the beginning that's a
beginning of how I try to expand it if I
even if I can have something like this
then actually i can replace pm-2 p.m. by
some smaller em and then i say that
instead of n to the minus delta i can
take em to the minus delta an iterator
now this only work if if F and G did
sell they don't have double root and
that is exactly the dilemma yeah and so
if they don't have double root and then
the number of roots differ by very Dylan
I don't make any mistake when I do this
trick yeah so that's why we need this
near the board not only double would but
near w so the root are separated and the
root of a bar and the root of G are
close to each other so they have the
same number boot ok so that is about the
main idea um yes so there is a bunch of
questions yeah so that's a simple that's
another big sur ah right yeah so we do
this and iterate yeah so that's
basically the main ideas HIV cure and
here's some other things that we can do
with this technique that we mentioned so
yeah so we can prove correlation
function of this and yeah we can look at
more other model of random polynomials
when the variance of the CI are
different so there are classes which are
popular in the literature like we can
look at polynomial of this type
it's called of a polynomial and
polynomial of this type may be square
root on I don't remember it's called the
binomial polynomial and so you van had a
book about the case when we don't look a
polynomial but look at the infinite
extension the series and you there's a
lot of interesting properties of the
series random series anyone we can
extend the random series two and as I
mentioned bradham polynomial independent
coefficients can also be considered the
the only case we consider here was the
characteristic function of random
matrices so basically we do this
correlation for eigenvalues and yes so
there's many other interesting case that
may come my one interesting questions
that I don't know how to sow is that
what is a constant in the Big O so we
know the the very first result I
mentioned which I started with is at E
and C and equal to 0 pi n and now we
know the arrow term which is about it ah
well there are two questions actually
first of all does it tend to a limit
that's a question I mentioned in Atlanta
last week we know this for the plus
minus 1 carissa and of course it was no
for the Gaussian case otherwise we don't
know and even when it handed a limit we
don't know what the limit is we have no
reasonable bail for this we know that
it's less than 10 to the million but
that's about it and and it is ultimately
connected to the existence of
double root from c0 2.99 the question I
mentioned last time so thank you very
much
so
and so what what all the guests so been
so so going to be the same concept right
now we have experiment I have I
numerical experiment that it shows may
be off by 43 awesome it's bigger smaller
smaller
that's what we don't move yeah but I
don't know it is bounded by a million
not now maybe proved about slicing the
media new you mean the concert for
plasma yeah but what matters when I
don't know it it is less than a million
i know it is there and what experiment
is right before
for further distributions still problem
show low orbit of having a double zero
yeah I'll back we haven't try very much
actually their recent development here
the father attribution I'd advanced case
I'm sorry for the way polynomial now we
managed to actually prove universality
closer to the origin so you know me to
be polynomially bounded away actual is
not to be an important available then
that already these the Big O 02 yeah but
yeah the bigger business office on on
the info button next to the new one who
have very good control right yes I guess
there is no this yellow is like one of
the lame yes but then with this Delta
prostitution what you get to the hotel
naturally yeah well from there what is
the GD stir from there Pam if I fix the
Delta I can tell you the real term here
depending on their time by nicely I
don't know what down times somebody
applies 1 over 10 to the million
surprise so the number of rhodamine the
love of that which is a million so we go
we don't have a good balance out if you
have a good arm Delta there i would
estimate for the number
you know to what might a sport
okay thanks that again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
