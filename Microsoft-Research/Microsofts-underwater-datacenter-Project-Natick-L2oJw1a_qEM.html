how we deploy data centers basically
what we're doing is we're taking green
data centers deploying in the ocean off
the coast
the overall goal here is deploy data
centers at scale anywhere in the world
from decision to power on within 90 days
half the world's population lives within
200 kilometers of the sea so moving data
centers to the ocean made a great amount
of sense to be able to make the actual
cable to our customers as short as
possible
the server's our standard type servers
you would find that any data center that
have been modified for this particular
environment since it's in a marine
situation and then server has the
coolant system attached to the outside
there's all the control electronics that
live on the outside of the rack and then
as you move further out you get to the
steel shell from the steel shell outside
we have all the heat exchangers that are
attached to that show as well as the
outputs for all of our cabling to go
back to the surface it's kind of like
launching a satellite to space once
you've built it and you hand it to the
guys with the rocket in this case our
case a crane you can't do anything about
it if it screws up
puff is up okay comes up clips which
send the divers in he's dropping let's
do it is everything is stable now
everything is stable on what's our power
consumption 27 kilowatts all right
Pineda could have a lot of impact both
currently hand into the future it's not
like a moonshot in the sense that it's
just some outlandish thing it's actually
a viable product that we could make</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
