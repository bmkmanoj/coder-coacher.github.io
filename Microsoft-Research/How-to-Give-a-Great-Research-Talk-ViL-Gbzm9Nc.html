you
you
alright so your paper has been accepted
for the conference and there you are
preparing your slides or maybe sitting
there in the front row thinking ah my
talk is coming up so this is just a
little bit about Chung know kind of what
you might think about what to put in
your talk and a bit about how to present
it so there's a little bit of overlap
with what I said this morning so I'm
going to go quickly through that but
this potluck that isn't as well the good
news here is that quite a lot of talks
are not so great so there's plenty of
opportunity for you to shine like a star
in the firmament so that out of the
mornings talk yours is the one that
everybody remembers wouldn't that be
good right and it's also worth member i
was telling about the those referees who
are doing you the service of giving you
their time every time you give a talk
there's an audience of you know five or
fifty people who are giving you again
their most priceless commodity their
attention so you know don't make make
good use of it and when i say make good
use of it to me don't use it to try to
impress your audience by they have
better things to do with their lives and
be impressed by you as i said they're
not particularly interested in you
personally at all nor can you tell them
everything you know about this topic
they don't want to know everything you
know about the topic nor can you tell
them all the technical details what do
they want to know from this morning the
idea good you've got the idea yes so you
know what you want them to walk away
with is if not all the gory details if
your idea you'd like everybody to leave
with a kind of intuitive insight into
the idea that you have given them and in
fact you like to sort of engage and
excite and provoke them so much that
they're kind of you know they're filming
with eNOS they can't wait to get their
hands on the paper to get the details
all right you've got a so that that's
your goal to get them hooked I'll make
them so making them glad them came is
it's a baking them glad they came is
kind of important criterion right if
they're glad they came to your talk well
come to the
next one they'll go read your paper now
but of course it's not all that easy to
do with that with an audience and like
this is the audience that it might be
easy to do that with right this is the
audience that was read all your previous
papers they came to the conference
specifically to hear you speak right and
they know all about the technical
background that you're about to present
so they're kind of poised right ready to
hear all that you have to say for them
also they're there alert you know it's
it's ten o'clock in the morning they've
been for their morning run and the gym
their satin is usually now they're ready
but actually this is the audience that
you've been you actually get you know
they've never heard of you they don't
have the technical background and
they're sleepy so what you're gone your
goal is to wake them up right your goal
is to make them unable to read to read
their email on their laptop because what
is going on at the fun is so exciting
and engaging why you've got because you
and you have a very short time to do
that in you got it and I've hooked them
up in the first kind of twenty first two
minutes right you at the beginning
you've got a technical talk anyway you
have a kind of couple of minutes which
people will give you a bit of grace
they'll pay attention to you for a
little while and then they'll start to
read their email right this didn't used
to be a problem before wireless networks
but now it's a big problem right so so
you've got that two minutes to get them
hooked so what are you two saying your
talk well so this bitch is about what to
put in your talk the things that the
output in is well you want to get to
your key idea that's the main thing you
after but you have to give them some
motivation to begin with you want to
start with a bit of motivation then lead
up quickly to your key idea and really
there's nothing else you want to do
talks typically I don't know some 10
minutes 15 minutes 20 minutes half an
hour you know if you get a full
departmental seminar and out so then you
have a room for some more technical
detail but anything up to half an hour
you don't really have time to do more
than just these two things alright
though it is so now you have to prune
rather ruthlessly right so in the
motivation part you want to try to
articulate what the problem you're
trying to solve why it's an interesting
problem and something about why it's an
unsolved problem right and why it will
be worthwhile to be able to solve it so
here's a kind of example a couple of
examples
right you know java class stars a large
they get sent up the network can we use
language or where data compression so
you're saying well maybe rather than
using generic data compression
algorithms perhaps I could use something
that knows that it's compressing Java
and perhaps I could do a much better job
oh and by the way I have managed to do
what a much better job I've you know I
get a fifty percent better result than
the best generic zipping technology so
in those you know in that 20 seconds
you've managed to get a quick idea of
the basic idea something to do with
language specific compression a quick
idea that it worked well and a vague
idea of the motivation well I've got
this network in the way do you see the
kind of thing that I mean and you have
to you've got to think can I do that in
in two minutes the two minutes that I
had before they go back to their email
okay it's not easy to achieve this I've
gone you but that's that's your goal
okay so that's a sort of the motivation
that's right then for the key idea but
it's very much the same as so that is in
a paper you must know what your key idea
is you have got a ruthlessly prune your
talk so that you trim away everything
there's not contributing to that key
idea and you need to be specific about
what the key idea is right so when you
get to the slide that says you know
here's the moment you want to jump up
and down and say if you remember no
other slide this is the one this is the
moment of which I'm telling you the bit
that you want to be even even if they're
reading ml they'll wake up at that point
right so you got you so so so don't
leave them in any time you know jump
stand on the table or something to say
this is the visit the slide you get this
one right right now there's a trade-off
in talks right that sometimes you think
well the audience don't know in any
great detail about my technical area so
maybe I should be be broad and shallow I
should say a little about quite a lot of
things but I found those sort of talked
very unsatisfying because they're always
they sit a little bit about stuff and I
haven't understood any particular thing
in any depth I preferred talks that have
some meat right some sort of red sari
vegetarians and red meat right so and
that means you may have to do a little
bit of this so
of context setting stuff what is the
problem what is the general area i'm
working with but sort of zoom in pretty
quickly st. you can say i'm zooming in
you say i'm just going to study one
particular sub problem here and try to
take you through that and then at the
end you can you can then say actually
the paper doesn't just deal with that
narrows subproblem it deals with this
and this but of course it doesn't deal
with that nut so you can by the end of
the talk you may be able to broaden out
of it again but but i think it's it's
helpful to be too even if it means
leaving out half your paper right to cap
to carry out something in enough detail
that you know your audience can come
with you on some some just carried you
into intuition through for an example
you said I mean so that the general the
general picture here is go deep but go
deep in enough detail that you can be
follows not just go deep and become
highly technical so that nobody can
understand you okay that's my idea here
so and of course if you're going to go
deep are you just going to provide lots
of fancy theorems no of course you're
not you're going to primarily do this by
showing examples and I would try to test
this repeatedly so i won't i won't
stress it anymore now except to say that
in a talk like you may never get to the
general case in the paper you probably
could a paper that consists only of two
or three examples and a claim that you
have a general solution won't get
accepted a talk that gives two or three
general examples and says go read the
paper for the general case that's okay
it's quite nice if you can give some
indication of how the generality works
out but it's even that it's not
essential you just have to give a sense
of how you went about it a sense of why
your solution works and then then
they'll go to read the paper that make
sense sometimes examples are also good
not just to convey the intuition but
also to show where the corner cases are
you can have sort of you know weird
examples that say here's something you
might not really do this but it but it
but it shows where you know when my
system breaks or somebody else's system
breaks that but little examples even if
they're contrived can serve to
illustrate corner cases in a way that
you know a general theorem just doesn't
so here's an example of an example from
a talk that I gave a few years ago so
here's the general statement this is
about exception handling in a lazy
functional language right so what do
exceptions mean in a lazy language so I
started off with a very brief general
statement usually in an imperative
language you think of exceptions is
being to do with control flow you throw
an exception and you peel or stack fades
until you get to a catch frame right
it's rather a control flow kind of
operation in a lazy functional language
we don't really have control flow in the
same way so what are we to do answer we
won't do that at all will it will
express exceptions in the form of data
right so rather than a function throwing
an exception it returns a data value
here's a data type declaration that says
either I this is a this either a value
of type maybe a is nothing or it's just
carrying a value and the lookup function
instead of filling an exception if the
address isn't in the dictionary returns
either nothing to say it's not there or
just X to say it is there and it's
called X alright so I've kind of I've I
haven't delayed too much stress on the
general stuff I'm immediately
illustrated with an example and then you
can go back to the generality some
extensors as a general plan a notice
here I probably wouldn't even say this
in a talk this is to do with related
work I might give a citation on the
slide that said that makes the point
that this particular bit is no is
derived directly from somebody else's
work and so again you're just as it were
giving a nod to somebody else saying
cool work that I've got time to even
vocalize it but no it is and go read the
paper you'll find more details see you
fine ok any observation so far persona
grata that's all about what to put in
some ways the bits the opportunity in
the easy bits is what to leave out it's
a bit harder so far so good all right
what about what to leave out well here
is my first candidate for what to leave
out the outline right how many talks
have you seen let's start like this and
they give you a list of things and
fun particularly with well some speakers
will then put up a slide like this and
will then spend three or four minutes on
it they'll sort of weed out the titles
and say but for each one they'll say a
little bit about it and remember at this
stage this is the moment this is that
vital two minutes in which the audience
is paying attention and you give them a
kind of chapter of contents for your
talk in which you say a little bit about
each that nobody can understand because
they haven't heard the talk yet all
right so it's it's it's almost
self-defeating you're using your your
golden moments for something that is
hard to understand so it could be useful
to have signposts during a talk so
that's what i was doing here right i was
just giving a little sign poster said
end of one section beginning of another
and sometimes people then put up a
little sort of contents list on the
signposts slide that says kind of where
you've got to but um putting this up at
the beginning particularly and then
sneaking to it is a disaster putting it
up at the beginning for ten seconds just
about maybe but barely worth it all
right but definitely don't speak to this
at any length that make sense and you
can think of your own experience and
listening to other people's talks and
whether you found this this title slide
this sort of sort of structure slide
helpful yeah oh yeah sometimes people
have at the top of the slide one of
these some of these slide preparing
software have a of a kind of the
contents at the top with a highlighting
one where you are that if it's sort of
not too obtrusive that's just fine but
don't put numbers on your slides right
at least don't put numbers on your
slides that say you know the ones that
say eight out of 63 right and the
audience is thinking eight out of 63
half an hour to get half an hour gone
right 56 slides to go that's taking us
until dinnertime right and they become
fixated on it they look eight out of 63
you know oh well up to twelve out of 63
it's a huge distraction like so don't if
you the number is not so bad number can
be quite useful but then an audience can
say could you go back to slide 12 they
might remember a question attached to a
slide number but do not put the total
and that's the only disadvantage of the
breadcrumb things is that you can see
how long we've still got to go before we
get to have our lunch that's but but
it's not as bad as the numbers the
numbers are terrible and I did once see
somebody who had a counter a timer on
there on the thing at the bottom it said
how long they've been speaking for and
the audience they just looked at they
you know this part they pay no further
attention I don't know what happens
moving pictures it grabs me where anyway
don't do that all right so don't put up
an outline but do do give signposts all
right so it's fine to do an outline that
you briefly flash up between things
that's with a highlighted thing about
the next section or the big picture like
I had that's good that Orient's people
that gives them a chance to say oh I
wanted to ask a question but I was
waiting to see whether he'd say
something about it and he didn't so
now's my chance to ask just didn't mean
that so that's another good reason for
so i'm posting but not a big thing okay
right related work similar to papers but
even more so right you do not want to
have a and this this is not such a
prevalent it's not such a common problem
as the title slide thing people do
occasionally spend a chunk of time in a
talk talking about related work it's
ghastly at the beginning it's not so
great even at the end because remember
your audience is a broader one that will
have read your paper and they're really
not interested in a discussion of
related work at that stage which is not
to say that you can get away without
knowing the related work firstly it must
be in your paper as we discuss this
morning secondly it's worth citing sort
of just a tiny bit of soundtrack or in
the corner of your slide if it's
particularly relevant to a slide and if
somebody asks you a question you must
you must know the related work so
absolutely yes you know what Allah did
that in nineteen nineteen eighty we are
body building on that you know the paper
discusses that so there's no excuse for
not knowing or not giving credit to
people it's just that you don't want to
spend when you have only have 25 minutes
in front of an audience you do
not want to spend five of it listing
related work unless that contributes in
the critical evaluation since you are
describing earlier unless it contributes
an understanding of the idea okay yeah
solutions to some roses some problems
right and yeah and if you don't tell
that maybe just even in one slide then
people keep thinking about oh you know
this doesn't know yeah exactly the
question answer session is all about
that yeah you could probably get away
with no you're quite right so when there
is a kind of obvious solution it's
rather like we were saying this morning
if there's an obvious dead end or dead
end if there's an obvious path that
turns out to be there or just turns out
to be different right then it's
certainly worth mentioning yeah if you
think it's going to distract my audience
if I don't mention it then say so right
but if you're just thinking uh-huh if
I'm going to do the full scholarly thing
I've got to tell about that don't do
that Thanks yeah okay so i said this
right acknowledged yes and yes make them
say nice things as you go along now well
we're talking about things to leave out
the title slide the related work section
and technical detail right what happens
when you put up a slide like this it's
all it's almost the physical thing you
can see the audience go right this is
not to say you should leave all
technical detail out so quite often when
there is a figure like this in my paper
I might do one of two things I might
show this slide to say don't look at the
details I just want to show you that all
the detail is in this one then this one
figure in the paper right it fits it
fits in one figure that's useful
information you don't pause another
thing I sometimes do I take one of these
rules and blow it up to full screen and
say I'm going to take you through this
rule because the other ones are in the
paper and you can work Matt in more
detail right but what you can't do is to
put this up and kind of expect people to
absorb it they're just going to feel
depressed and stupid and you don't want
your audience to feel depressed and
stupid so the difficulty here of course
is that the technical detail is what you
have worked for what it feels like if
you
present that material it feels like
you're not giving them the thing that
costs you the most pain right but sadly
your audience is not interesting in your
pain you got to give them the bits that
they need so sometimes of course people
will ask about some technical questions
so it's not a bad idea to have some
specifics I mean a slide like this
another reason of having a slide like
this sort of available maybe even you
know after your conclusion slide is so
that you can flick to it if somebody
asks you a deeper technical question you
can say oh yes that's handled here it's
in the you know the second rule up here
and I'll just explain it to you now
that's not a bad plan okay yeah this is
quite hard because you you because the
technical detail its kind of often so
important to you but you got to put
yourself in the position of all your
audience but remember the narrow but
deep thing I really think you want to
present some technical detail about some
narrow aspect just not everything if you
present no technical detail then you
leave well at least the kind of audience
is that I dress feeling unfed and
unsatisfied know like like a sort of
starving children who are just shown
given you Arobin as a beautiful you know
of tasty things but not actually given
any of them so don't do that all right
so much about content what's put in what
to leave out all right anybody got any
other observations about what to put in
or what to leave out yeah it's really
important to understand who is your
audience because sometimes can be
someone is really an effort may be more
interested interesting for them and
sometimes give a general audience like
and then you want to stress more on the
ID in a more abstract kind of way and we
go to the results so ability
this isn't because a venti god for the
lecture was so specific because he used
to give lectures to very to experts yeah
and the audience was very general and
from different disciplines and for
different areas in computer science to
be exact and no one understood what he
was talking about yeah yeah you're
totally like so you cannot expect a
single talk to work for every audience
and in the end you have to adjust your
talk for your audience and talk to your
own research group in your own narrow
subdomain is quite a different talk than
you would give to a conference audience
in your in the general area all still
less to him general tits you absolutely
right no two ways about it you just need
to make write a new talk but I hope that
the same general principles will apply
by regardless of which audience Eve even
for your highly technical audience still
need to give them you know the now
Abbott eat thing still limited for time
and for your general audience even the
broadest general audience you want to
give them some meat right it's just that
the meat is less chewy okay anybody else
yeah some people recently do a lot of
like they have the idea of takes the
less slide so you have no text oh my
sort of a slide that just says infinity
on it and then a slide that says you
know one one word or one picture yes
personally I don't find that a very
engaging presentational style because
it's so difficult to present any
technical material that way so for me a
talk that is a series of 12 pictures of
beautiful landscapes or strange Greek
figures doesn't do it for me I know it's
a style that some people adopt and it
can be quite at least it can be quite
nice change but I would never I wouldn't
say that I've ever been to a talk when
it really worked for me yeah
this woman's text can be distracting and
not good or you're not sure if you want
to listen to the person or or you keep
reading what is written yeah and i think
that the balance is really important but
too much text i don't know yeah there's
no good p.m. you'll get plenty of advice
like this from your from your university
so the presentation guide you know that
they'll say users font of a big enough
size so even this they probably think
had too much text right so you
definitely don't want to present the
sort of very dense slides of people
sometimes produce but I think it's a
foot for me something like something
like this is fine but I and I didn't
actually read out oh don't read out your
slides obviously you want to and
sometimes I just miss out whole things
because I think my audience is actually
capable of reading quite quickly and and
it if it's a point it up it doesn't seem
you know in the end that there isn't
worth vocalizing I just let it go by but
yeah you don't put too much information
on one slide you right that's part of
the omit details part but the two little
end you know just the big picture or the
other yes I don't people are giant font
and they kept saying virtually nothing I
think why using slides at all okay so I
want to say a little bit about
presenting physically presenting a talk
and so if your main weapon of the
content is examples your main weapon for
presentation is enthusiasm right if you
go to a talk then you sometimes do when
people stand on the lectern they do this
so they're sort of pinned behind here
okay give a person well it is very
boring talk none of you will be
interested in it I'm not really
interested in it but I suppose we got to
get through it somehow so let's slide
what let's see how do we go I got it
that make you feel excited you have to
convey such a wave of excitement about
your work that you cannot that you know
you can't imagine how anybody could not
be equally fascinated either you want to
convey that sort of sense of powerful
enthusiasm and then I tell you it's kind
of like it has an effect on audiences
that is like you know whether those
pictures of sunflowers like Sun comes
out in sunflower sort of follow the Sun
so if you project a sense of excitement
about your work you will watch your
audience's faces kind of open up like
sunflowers and they'll smile at you and
they'll start nodding and they'll know
at least they'll appreciate that you
care right they may not care but they
will like it that you care right and
maybe even you can make them care so I
know that this is not something this is
that this is a personality thing I know
that some people find it very difficult
to project that kind of enthusiasm to
other people with their just naturally
shy types i think extrovert types have a
deeply unfair advantage in from a
presentational point of view because
they find it easier to f of s with
enthusiasm but even if you're sort of
introverted shy kind of person you have
to train yourself to pretend to be an
extrovert right you've got to pretend i
mean you are the thing is you are
excited about your ideas presumably
right let's just let's assume that you
are like then even if you're shy person
you have to think i'm going to pretend
to be not a shy person so that i can
convey the enthusiasm that's in my heart
all right just do that i'm sorry i don't
know any other way to say and some
people have an unfair advantage but
there you go that's a you've got to do
and so here we are oh and the last thing
about being enthusiastic is if you are
enthusiastic and you you can't not gonna
move around the room and that makes that
makes you much more much easier so if
you're pinned in one space and and
looking at your feet your whole sort of
body language conveys a sense of anxiety
as well and that's that's not good so it
was if your duty asking about something
you cannot not move around just
impossible alright so that's about just
about getting started by enthusiasm next
thing you need to do need to know what
your talk is going to say and one way to
know what you're talking to say is to
invite it not very long before right
I've said the night before but that's
perhaps it a bit ambitious but make sure
that the night before you go right
through and you're still making changes
and polishing actually it's rather cool
as you sit in the mornings talk and
somebody says something like I think
that's a quite a nice quote or you can
actually modify your slides to refer
back to an earlier talk that keeps you
away can engage with the previous talks
and and their make too much of it yes oh
never do that no just say no it looks
like you say i just say i haven't
written them yet right and i'm not going
to write i mean if you're giving this
speech the united nations the whole
united nations may be right but this is
not a problem you're likely to have any
time soon right so it's resist resist
people who try to get you to put gives
the other slides in advance right say
i'll bring it on a USB stick right and
that most and you can be doing that just
before though yeah one other thing about
sort of enthusiasm presentation is not
apologizing like if you some people
start their talks by saying well I'm not
really a very clever person and I'm only
a PhD student and I got here late in my
our top bloke and my slides don't work
and you know it's not very interesting
work anyway and you know all they say
something that conveys this this kind of
sense they start with an apology now it
may be that you're indeed you know that
the main old people in the audience who
are cleverer than you it's it's it seems
entirely plausible indeed it's on almost
universal truth but um but it doesn't
help your audience to tell them that
right they didn't give up their time to
listen to you apologize they just want
to hear you idea so cut to the chase why
don't apologize now okay so I call this
the jelly effect because when you're
sitting there waiting for your talk and
the previous speaker is very capably you
know handling questions and seems
confident to completely in control and
you're sitting there thinking I'm not
sure that I can physically stand up I
can feel that my legs are kind of
rubbery and I think if I stand up I'm
gonna fall over do have you experienced
this feeling
it's quite scary isn't it because you
think there are a hundred people or you
know 50 people sitting in them who are
going to be looking at you and you're
going to sort of fall over like a jelly
so is very very seldom actually happens
when you stand up that you do the jelly
thing but it is very alarming feeling so
but the thing to realize is that
everybody feels like this not just PhD
students people have been giving talks
for years still feel like this
particularly with an audience that they
do not know why or a new setting which
will happen more often to you than to
more experienced people believe it
believe me even people have been giving
talks for you know a decade or two still
feel very nervous in a new setting I was
giving a talk in Canterbury in on monday
and i felt quite nervous before I didn't
I thought I would be able to stand up
but I was anxious everybody is anxious
so don't worry about it like it's not
that you're a wimp right everybody feels
this way and it's actually not in the
end typically a problem what you've got
to do is just the standing up it's
usually okay you must a good thing to
remember is to try to script your first
few lines so that that moment of which
their eyes like sort of lasers lock onto
you right that is the moment which your
mind can go black so having a script for
your first few sentences is very helpful
if you must have a script for the whole
talk then you must but I would urge you
not to write it's much better if you can
manage without a script and and if you
do have a script try not to read it very
visibly you know try to practically
memorize it but it's much better if you
don't have a script but memorize your
first sentence or two all right okay
that's we got to do now and then when
you'll interact with the audience make
sure that you can sort of see them and
be heard if you even if you've got a
microphone speak as if you did so I'm
speaking to the the back row mostly and
I think even if I didn't have a
microphone you could hear me in a bigger
room that's harder we have to try to
pitch your voice as if you did not have
a microphone don't assume that the
microphone will work one one thing about
audience is too is that often will be
one or two people in the audience who
for some reason instinctively not
when they are listening so even some
people will be in look at their laptops
or reading their email quite a lot of
people will be looking at you hopefully
but some of them look like like what's
your name it's Juhi right surgery here
it's a great nada like is very
reassuring but once you find a nada and
the audience you can even kind of look
at her occasionally and if she stopped
nodding you know something's gone wrong
right you got so you know she's got lost
or something so is it so it's so don't
be ambassadors very helpful Trey
incidentally to a speaker and you should
encourage it in yourself to you know so
that when you win your speaker looks
around you should sort of no just give
them a little thumbs up as it were with
it with a nod to say I'm I'm with you
I'm engaged by it's because love that
and the other good reason for looking at
your audience rather than looking at the
floor or your laptop is that that
audiences can tell whether you're
engaging with them right if they think
you're reading your speech and you're
really in your own little world you're
just acting like a sort of a CD player
they're going to not engage with you
right if you actively engage with them
they will engage with you rights and and
they'll at least listen and so I put
questions here in conference talks is
often different difficult to take
questions during the talk but settings
like this or departmental seminars in
fact anytime you can taking questions is
good during the talk that's a sort of
sense of engagement to think I that in
fact I think I've got something about
this yes so when people start to ask
questions during your talk it's a kind
of golden opportunity to find out you
know our people following it is it all
making sense for them and also to build
a sense of rapper war with the audience
so we had a little bit of trouble
starting off this morning right when you
a bit a bit a bit quiet to begin with
right then finally one of you is brave
enough to ask questions it's that we've
had a great time I'm enjoyed myself much
more since that first question right so
as a speaker encourage your audience if
that's usually if you have if you unless
it's prohibited by your chair right say
to your audience I would love you to ask
questions during the talk right and try
to give pauses in which they can do so
in which our we've done a little bit
this time
and it will be there supposed to be a
little bit difficult because you say has
anybody got any questions and typically
nothing happens right and then the urges
oh I better move on so it takes a bit of
nerve to hold that silence right when
your nerve break before there's does
right so happy if thought it's got of
easier after the first one you you can
plant somebody that can be good right
well aren't somebody to ask a question
kind of break the ice make it an easy
one okay now then of course questions
are two edged sword because if you get a
lot of questions you get a lot of
interaction then you may not finish your
talk is this a bad thing not necessarily
right if you have a really good to and
fro with an audience we're not just with
one person right but with a range of
people that suggests that something
interesting is going on it may not
matter that you miss out part of your
talk that's not completely true like
there might be the main payload you
might never get to the main payload
because you're going into digression
after digression about other people's
work or something that wasn't really the
point so you may have to cut things off
right it's a judgment call but on the
whole I would urge you to Iran the side
of following the questions even if it
means emitting some material just keep
track of what the core material that you
really want to get over is yeah because
first of all that really opens the door
to hecklers yes it's really I mean there
are people that come in sometimes livin
with an agenda like they've heard about
the topic and they've written a paper
similar to it and they have an ego
problem and then
mmm you know really openly attack you at
the first chance you give them and I
mean I've seen a tablet-like not just
once or twice and that's that's one
thing and like another thing is that it
could also kind of focus your talk on
kind of one or two people and the rest
completely loves yes yes watch it so
guardian and so you got to use your
judgment like so one thing is it's true
that hecklers of the kind you described
exists but there are my experience where
you know one talking ten on talking 20
maybe but certainly not one talking to
occasion with me like so it's so it's a
danger I agree but it's like saying if
you cross the road you might get run
over by a car right do you not cross the
road no you just toss it carefully and
you sort of accept that there is you
know in every activity there may be some
danger we trade them all across each
other but i think the trade is a good
one here are being open to questions if
you do get a persistent person you have
to just be brave and shut them up you
say great questions we'd love to talk to
you afterwards but if we carry on with
this i'm not going to get to the main
point of the talk and so i'm going to
carry on now and and if they continue
after that point your chair should shut
them up right so you start looking
pointedly at your chair person if that
happens okay likewise if it's a very
small number of people asking a lot of
questions you again have to say it's
been great having this discussion but
but you know but I'm afraid that we're
going to get too deep into it into a
corner you have to manage it it's your
talk right so it's your talk but the
engagement is key so if you can broaden
that to ask them so if you're watching
for somebody no keeping out the order
that you got so they're somebody who's
just very tentatively you say Oh
question over there that's good right so
or even even even ask somebody's not
moving at all did you have a question
yeah but dangerous but a good danger a
very good danger urge you not to say
somebody did this to me a week and a
half ago I asked a question they said no
I'm not an answer that question I just
want to give the talk save it to the end
oh what a negative message terrible
message so convey to order though do
that ok so much like questions a little
of quick things about sort of actual
content presentation or very obvious I
find these little wireless presentation
gizmos very helpful because they they
disconnect you from your technology is
very very useful the obvious things like
don't just approach the machine for the
first time with your laptop right there
in the one minute before you at all so
many times I've seen people sweating
buckets because the the projector does
not work and if only they come along
half an hour before in the previous
break or the previous day and just
checked it it would have been fine it's
very stressful if your technology does
not work at the time test it in advance
even then it won't work at the time but
testing it in advance means at least you
insane I did test it you know 20 minutes
ago right about sort of slidy things
please don't do this I hate this I some
people like it but but it to me it's um
it tells to me as an audience member
that the speaker doesn't trust me to pay
attention unless he sort of babies me
along one little dribble it at a time ah
it's less distracting for me just to see
the slide sometimes there's a punch line
like you want to reveal something you
say you want to ask a question and say
what do you think and have a little
dilation then you put up the answer so
that's okay it's almost like a fresh
slide but I would the Sun Sun slide
where has a default setting that says
every list of things ever even list the
bullets will that one more time oh I
don't do that and don't do this either
he's very very annoying so you could
have a very very good reason like you
know you're trying to show a linked list
algorithm and you've got arrows that are
moving around that's okay but not just
yeah anyway and last thing about some
presenting it is you must finish on time
right have you been to talks at which
you're kind of getting to the end of the
time in it and the and the speaker kind
of thinks they first thing they start to
speed up because the you know the chairs
and then finally this doesn't happen so
much in conferences but departmental
talks I said umm actually I've just got
just got another five slides would that
be okay and they look at the program
chair and the audience is going good
I've got to go right and the chair is
sort of pinned between the audience who
who's wants to leave and the speaker so
it says yeah of course we'd love that
and so many good another 15 minutes it's
a disaster right because you've lost
your audience by then somehow audience
is psychologically expect that they have
a set up about when they expect the talk
to end you better know what that
expectation is and if you miss that
expectation they will stop absorbing
stuff all they'll absorb it very very
much less well so it's ineffective to
carry on so simply truncate you have to
find yourself ways you know just if you
if you're not at the end you just have
to say it's tough you know have a
summary slide that summarize I say the
details are in the paper but what you
cannot do is just go on in conference
settings you will not be allowed to go
on in other settings it's simply
impolite and ineffective too so it's
very important well fortunately today
we're in good shape because we're in
plenty of time because yes because this
is what this is it that my last slide I
just want to be kind of be encouraging
about this since you couldn't start
doing this now as you go to talks you
can mark them out of 10 along some of
these criteria think I get to better
than that getting to all right the
content really cool you know interesting
technical content clever idea but
presentation
funny didn't make me feel like I'd like
to come back what would I have done if i
was presenting this to do it differently
you can be kind of reflective not only
about your own talks or your own papers
but about other people's talks and
papers any other observations or
questions or suggestions yes yes like
excellent my friend um it's all the the
site were you talking about you know
just showing highlighting one bullet
point at a time supposing it was not
bullets supposing you want to talk about
the seven steps of your approach or
something oh and and you want to walk
the audience through the steps as you
speak like like wouldn't you want to use
the slides to support your talk rather
than showing the thing and then you
supporting the slides and I don't know
yeah so I think if you are thoughtful
about it right if you have a specific
purpose to revealing things one at a
time go right ahead it's just that as a
default you know for every slide in
every list it's not a good plan I think
so though none of these are cast iron
rules do absolutely right yeah do you
have a golden way of exercising
preparing actually for your presentation
so you mean how do I prepare for yeah
for example prepare like exercise in
front of your colleagues like dates
before a week before whatsoever what's
like your golden way to do that do you
mean by preparing the contact like the
slides you don't mean like you're going
for a run before Andy dog oh okay so
well so what so what if I do though you
usually it is a few days before I'm
usually out I try to I try not to start
preparing the talk itself too long in
advance if it's a month in advance you
can spend a whole month obsessing about
the size it so that absorbs an almost
infinite amount of time but this is a
task that has no completion moment until
the talk itself so again this depends a
bit about how often you given a talk
like this before but typically I would
stop and preparing a talk whose content
I was reasonably confident i knew was
sound to like what i had a paper
so I knew that the content was okay was
just a question of presenting it I might
start a couple of days before three or
four days before usually I sort of just
sit down for a morning and start to
write slides kind of in it in the spirit
of and just trying to explain this to
somebody then I might some I try to find
a colleague and say and just sort of
walk them through and see this is it's
hard to get colleagues who will really
be critical they're mostly just say
that's in great so if you can really
train them to be critical that can be
helpful occasionally people give
practice talks to a small audience but I
think that's most helpful just for
building your confidence and also the
confidence about the time scale how long
will it take to present this is that so
that can be something this bit a bit
difficult to be sure that in advance but
you don't need an audience for that part
you could just you know presented in a
empty room just to be sure that you're
the amount of material you have will fit
in the time slot that you've got yeah
but not too long in advance some
presentation courses you do you are
often encouraged your kind of video
yourself and and look at yourself etc do
you encourage that actually I think that
can be quite interesting yes yes it's a
bit scary actually but but I think if
you can get somebody to video you just
while you're giving a live talk with the
live audience that that can be quite yes
you sometimes you he said did I really
do that yes I just want to add to what
the first I said there was a really good
tip that I received in we had a curse in
Cambridge for research skills and one of
the things that one of the tips was to
first write down what you're going to
say it doesn't have to be the actual
lyrics but before opening PowerPoint or
whatever just write it down and I
actually tried it afterwards for a talk
I gave and it was really really useful
because a lot of times your your ideas
are messed up because you're trying to
work on the presentation so first have
like a really clear view of what you're
going to say I actually write it I wrote
it down
and then it gives you ideas on how to
visualize that so I found that really
really so kind of the written outline
for the talk it just sequence of ideas
yeah just yeah you can or you can go
even more different than that but just
before opening any presentation yeah
that's a really good idea yes yeah he's
got the idea just vote um so haven't
been to like many conferences but been
to a few and in that sample i would say
that in academic talks something like
ninety percent of the talks i saw i
would say pretty bad probably about five
more percent were very bad and then I
like maybe if I were ok so I wondered as
somebody because I really enjoyed this
tour and I thought everything you said
made a lot of sense and you've obviously
done this quite a lot and I wondered
like despy it was such a such great
advice why isn't this working like why
why your eyes I kill you I don't you a
few coach students go out and give
fantastic towards ok is this a Tiffany
iceberg Bay we all go to conferences and
listen to an incredible amount of really
terrible boring talks and that's a shave
isn't it as real shame so how can this
change just just just follow some simple
suggestions I don't know how to change
for the world I don't know which is just
change it for yourself that would be a
good example but the young I think
probably the dominant thing that makes
academic talks not so good is the the
feeling of it you've got to ram too much
material into it right and they're
weldon convey d the intuition feeling
this is a sophisticated highly technical
audience and we have to impress them
don't think that just convey the idea
simple idea know who is a question here
as well yeah it's more about you should
just shout for now oh yeah yeah so
they're born in here love yeah I'm the
one one one rule of thumb that I use
how good it is in general but is I you I
kind of say one minute per slide if I'm
limit and a limit kind of the material I
give by just literally the number of
slides I'm allowed to locking myself
which I found kind of a very useful way
of doing it and another thing is for
kind of I don't know me it's small but
it might help like I when I get that
little freakout moment before I start
talking I usually like i usually have a
little bottle of water just like just
one think of what are some a basically
it sounds really stupid but it really
should vital Disney small displacement
activity is abstract you and all in one
are things about the eye contact is um I
agree that you need to look at specific
people in the audience but one thing I
would be careful about them it might
happen is looking at one person too much
yes even if they're not they get a sort
of persecution contrary my comeback
company yes you and the others will feel
so short chaser what if you never look
at them make sure you have a few of them
peace yeah yeah you need sort of
strategically placed thank you good guy
the check shirt yeah how do you think
our clothes should be the contents of
the talk so what'd you say in the
contents of the slides because some
people say that they expect it to be
pretty close but then there are lots of
examples of great dogs were like the the
contents what the speaker says and the
slider connected for a loosely so what's
your opinion and that oh so generally
our the what I think it's made a mistake
to just read what's on the slide so
that's a very tight coupling right
that's an extreme for example saying or
like speaking out what is in the slides
not a meeting any point from the slides
for example yeah so typically about it
so more or less if you're going to put
something on the slide you probably put
it there because you want to say
something about it otherwise why did you
put it there so I said earlier I mean
you know the pressure of time you might
you might leave some things out but
typically you you don't wanna put
something on the side that
is irrelevant to the talk but just don't
read it that's very important it's very
dull if somebody literally beats their
slides particularly since in order to
read them they usually put their back to
the audience and that's not very
engaging either yeah so how do you deal
with the with trivial or silly questions
I like this one or or even with we like
non questions I honest and someone says
something mean it tone of a question I
expect you to save some something and
what do you do well so my default we
actually is not is to try to find value
in it right somebody you know would
assume that they are engaging with you
and with your talk and that it wasn't
really attribute they're actually trying
to say something so I might ask a
clarifying question if it appeared to be
trivial you know say so it's you know
that sounds like sounds straightforward
you know the answers this but you
probably meant something deeper than
that you know kind of said in a positive
way it's very seldom that you get people
really trying to disrupt your talk by
just making random comments I think and
if you do then we have to go back to
what we're saying earlier we just shut
them down but it's not a big problem
usually my experience whereas a much
bigger problem usually is lack of
engagement with the audience so you know
the needles over here I just want to
drag it a bit back here the course if
you go yeah one sees happen to me right
away was even throwing a conference
something just ask something with no
answer just basically telling your 700
I'm sorry I'm sorry I can't answer that
no I can't connect to another better
carry on you just want to look at you
get help from your chair if you need it
yeah bad things can happen yeah
sometimes things go wrong right thank
you very much that's not at all yeah I
think we'll wrap up here thank you very
much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
