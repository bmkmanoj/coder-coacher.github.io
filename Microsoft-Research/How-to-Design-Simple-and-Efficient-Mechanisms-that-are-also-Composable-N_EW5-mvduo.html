a todos so it's a pleasure to be here
and great to talk to all of you it's
great to have an audience this is all
really interested in computing and
technology so let me try to get to it
and try to tell you a little bit of the
kind of research i do and the kind of
questions that i try to address some in
my work so i guess i started to think
about but usually turn the game theory
or the effect of selfishness and the
context of the internet so when you
think about the internet it is a tour
miracle that it works at all like
somehow the Builder system originally
called ARPANET and was built for a small
set of users who you know shared
projects and cooperated and for some
reason it's managed to expand it to most
of the Harvard using it many many
millions of people many many millions of
corporations and different interests
it's not a network that someone manages
it's a network whose components and
parts different people manage and they
try to manage it to make that part or
they they experience as good as can be
as it can be they selfishly try to
actually take advantage of the
internet and yet it somehow verse for
all of us there are other systems like
this and I guess one that I'm going to
maybe talk a little bit about this the
main advertisements are placed and so on
all of these are shared the property
that surface users who want to take
advantage of a system for the own
interest can participate and in a good
case cooperate to get some single done
and in unlucky case is actually somehow
ruin or or destroyer system so because
what I do for my research is algorithms
and I guess theory of computing I like
thinking of this so very simple
theoretical model so I wonder start with
telling you sort of what the issue is in
a very simple common example for the
tragedy of the Commons so treasure the
commons goes that there is a little
petrol green grass may be capable of you
know feeding some number of cows so that
they you know stay healthy and have milk
and all that and in this village you
should imagine every every farmer owns a
cow and it can all put the account is
grass the calculate the grass and get me
okay and everyone is happy except
unfortunately there are too many farmers
and selfishness claims or says that
every farmers think that you know if I
only put my cat on the grass that's
early morn extra cow true there might
not be so much grass but learn extra
cargo make a difference so they owe
cancer and they care to the grass and at
the end there's so many crafts not the
way it looks on a picture but instead or
standing on barely any grass left and
unfortunately none of the cows can get
grass because there isn't any left and
in fact a patch of grass that was
capable of maybe maybe Mel feeding a
hundred two hundred cows got ruined
because there are too many cows standing
up standing on the grass now this is a
unfortunate by-product of selfishness
that's actually very hard in this
particular context to mediate like you
sometimes you fight to put out some feel
calm the number of cows but at the end
the extra person who's carries none on
the grass is very much interested in
putting his or her cat also on the grass
there's not much you can do about this
so a more in a theoretical model you can
set up a model but it's sort of easy to
imagine that whatever you're thinking
it's like the value of feeding a cow is
decreasing that they're more cast around
so connection is bad for the cows and at
the end there's no value left for anyone
so I'm going to start by telling you a
sort of positive story that's more
internet related and then I'm going to
tell you that morale we learn in a
different context in sort of selling
door or billing for advertisement so a
good example is that I started to work
on my researchers have to do with
traffic crossing and depends whether you
want to think of the common Indian
experience of overly congested roads or
you want to think of technology and the
internet and package delays either way
it's a reasonable mathematical model of
what's going on is that you're sending
loss and gives you their cars or packets
on some pass and if there are a lot of
other other cities around there are too
many cars or too many packets then there
are incredible delays and build ups can
happen and it might get traffic might
get really slow so this is one of those
cases where every packet or every car
driver would like to go and get his
packet or his car to destination as fast
as possible and it's not interested in
an overall system performance it's
interested in just you know me I want to
go home and I want to get there fast or
my package should get the destination
fast my browser
download on my truck it's fast so first
thing I want to tell you that there are
dangerous you let me use the car example
because that's a clean and nice example
so imagine there are this highways that
you see here and you should imagine that
those big long roads in orange or big
white I this eve even with already in
the end congestion they just never got
congested maybe this doesn't happen in
India but some places occasionally
people built on days that are just too
wide and there isn't enough traffic so
maybe they take an hour to travel but
its independence of congestion for the
simplicity of the example in contrast
those more roadsters are more typical
Indian roads and say again for a very
simple mathematical model it takes you
10 minutes to travel there if you're
alone but every car that you shared all
these will add an extra minute again
it's a little simple so you know ten
cars will fit 20 minutes 20 cards will
fix 30 minutes the more congested it
gets the slower you get across a very
simple example and there is 50 cars now
what would happen here normally you
would expect that the 50 cars nicely
divided up 25 25 from both directions
generate an unfortunate congestion of 25
25 cars on each of these roads and in
total takes an hour and 35 minutes to
get across ok so what I set up here is a
very simple mathematical model of how
you model congestion and that applies
both in car traffic and actually has
been used in civil engineering since the
early 60s as a standard model of of
traffic engineering but also applies to
some extent or almost identically to
packet traffic similarly packet co
gestione is a function or delays is of
course a function of congestion I'm
using a very very simple function like a
linear function 10 minutes plus the
number of cars but you can imagine that
more complex functions actually prevail
describe what's happening in sending
packet across here is the unfortunate
fact maybe some nice person wants to
take
effer can make it better and put them
this super speed highway in blue the
SuperSpeed funnel 60 minutes it's
instantaneous it's a tunnel under some
big hill you just get across in 0
minutes and now you should think about
what events the traffic and something
really unfortunate is happening everyone
all 50 of them you want to use this pass
so in particular let me get back to my
day doing this the new traffic pattern
we have doubled the congestion on every
edge and in fact has increased oil delay
remember it's 10 minutes plus congestion
so all 50 cars go on the fast that takes
60 minutes to get across this
unfortunate blue pass and they have to
pass two of them so another 60 minutes
plus another 60 minutes that's two hours
as opposed to an hour and 50 minutes
that we are in 30 minutes we had before
and somehow there is no much like in the
tragedy of the Commons with the cows
there's not much you can do about this
because every single car traveling this
rn rn tours they could instead try to go
back to the original passes no no no
help them so what happened here which
called the brace paradox braces a German
scientist who realize this paradox that
someone put in an extra road and traffic
got worse not because then is anyone
being stupid I guess we're globally
stupid as a society k this brace paradox
has been around for a long time in fact
has been observed in traffic pattern in
different big cities like Los Angeles
for example it does happen occasionally
you have to be careful and try to be
careful to avoid it and what I want to
think about it is a computer scientist
and I actually going away / car traffic
and thinking about packet traffic what
you're supposed to do about this and
actually how bad is this is this like a
fetch tragedy of the Commons where it's
completely going to ruin your experience
or is it instead you know it's a little
bit worse if you can avoid putting in
super speed fibers at the wrong place
that would be
of course cooler but maybe it's not that
bad so what I'm is supposed to think
about so what I've been learning from
this base paradox we certainly learned
that there's dangers out there if you
put highlights in the wrong place like
can get worse rather than getting better
a very simplistic and maybe traditional
algorithmic you would be that we should
direct traffic you should tell traffic
which way to go and in the car contacts
this just doesn't occur to anyone I
can't monitor there and tell you that if
you want to drive to Bangalore please
you need to go on this road and not this
other row that's just not physically an
option in the history of the internet it
did occur to people to try to apply this
message to Internet traffic not very
successfully so they come on messages is
just not viable this is two giant and
optimization problem and controlling
people of other either cars or packets
to actually do this kind of control is
just not the right message we can't do
that so once we accept it's not an
alternative then it turns out it's
really handy that actually going back to
my previous message is that maybe this
paradox is not so bad after all I've got
a little better verse but maybe there is
a natural simple way we can mediate this
and here is again a mathematical model
with a paper I wrote with tim roth
garden by now actually more than 10
years ago which says that one way to
mediate this is to design a network to
carry double the traffic now in current
traffic this is kind of hard making your
highways twice as big I understand that
storm is a big problem in a city but an
internet example viable and in fact
that's the right internet conclusion and
that's how we have been building the
internet so successfully if you put
enough price down the ground the surface
business is no big deal so what this
message says that if we have enough
capacity around enough capacity that
will be
with traffic which I promise you
everyone actually do because even carry
twice as much traffic as what we have
today then the fact that mediates the
brace products the fact that people are
driving selfishly and possibly ruining
things then one could that be that bad
okay so this is a very nice kids wear
some engineering lee doable or carrier
both act of putting down more capacity
did help mediate the bad effect of
selfishness again it's more viable and
internet traffic and much less viable in
culture so this message that something
simple that one can do is a better
remedy than central optimization is much
more broad than car traffic or packet
traffic and what i want to do as a more
recent piece of thing that I and some
other people in a community have been
working a research community of
embarking on is trying to apply this to
the other example of my opening slide is
selling advertisement so as you all know
the Internet is free and there is no
such thing as free lunch so I Sunday
another of your paying for this
differently than paying for the internet
and the way they're paying for this is
we're watching advertisements an
effective way of selling and displaying
advertisement has been a big deal and
that's sort of what but but face for a
lot of the internet services there's a
lot of advantages to selling advertise
or for advertising over the internet
because you can target your
advertisement infinitely better than in
a newspaper or a billboard but this only
works if you have good way to actually
help people put the advertisement very
its most effective so let me start with
again a simple example that maybe many
of you have seen around is the classical
beautiful example of how you not
traditionally still sell something is a
single item action called the Vickrey
auction or maybe second price auction
and the Vagos and in my example
yes you're auctioning of this Apple and
I guess it's a very valuable expensive
at all people value it at multiple
dollars value just for silliness of the
example and these numbers i have on the
slide are supposed to be the values
people have for this but unfortunately
of course you rather get the app or
cheaper if possible so maybe they won't
want to tell you the values and the
classical story ghost and what you're
supposed to do it's handy opposed to the
person that value see that most which is
a seven dollar in my example but don't
make him pay his actual value make him
pay let's call the second prize the
second highest value that means he's
going to extract some bigger utility for
this he valued it a seven dollar but you
only had to pay five so gets a value of
two we handle it to the right guy that
wanted there for the most and it has
these nice properties where the key one
that usually gets emphasized that it's
truthful now truthful here means it's in
your interest to admit your real value
and you can think about it for a second
and it does sound good like if your
value is actually not seven but then and
maybe you try to what's called shade
your value say a lower value so as to
pay less price it's not helping you
you're not actually have to pay what you
named as price you have to pay the
second prize if you shave your value too
badly it might even hurt you so there's
no harm here in admitting your true
value if you're the highest you're going
to get it and you don't have to pay that
and if you're not the highest you don't
get it on yeah so this is usually the
sort of classical benchmark or beauty of
function theory and there are all kinds
of extensions to very complicated
setting I guess this thing called
combinatorial auction where instead of
manipur you want all kinds of fruits and
people have values for package packages
of fruits and again the same system
people are asked to tell their values
for different things and then some
central melanism assigns it to the
everyone to the package so as to
maximize every month overall value and
then there is a complicated formula for
paying the price
I flush this up but i certainly don't
necessarily want you to read this so
this is sort of the classical design of
how people think about auctions and what
I'm going to want to convince you in the
next couple of slides that this is a
really bad way for the internet this is
not caveat to celtics in the internet
and before I do that let me actually
open this by despite this beautiful
theory it's not passing star swords not
even in the internet but not even in
other things like for example the
certain airports using actions to send
lamp spell sell landing spots to
Airlines they even they don't use it so
this theory has certain gaps and I'm
guessing basically claiming that was
truthful and it sounded good when we did
simple item actions this more
complicated truthful things is actually
not what we need so first to start with
X having people announced they
complicate the value system for every
subset of fruits of how much dollars
they value it that's very complicated
it's an awful lot of communication it's
a lot of work for these companies to
figure out how much they value it
actually even worse than that users tend
not to know how much they value even a
single item in fact if I asked you guys
how much you value a basket or beautiful
figs some of you might say yeah fix
would be cool i'm hungry i would like to
eat some pics but you can't actually
usually put a number on how much you
value those pics so that's a hard
exercise to know how much you value
something leads to man is instead rather
complicated which is the previous slide
was trying to indicate to you much just
flashing it up and actually you may be
worse than worse than this is this thing
really truth is it really good idea to
admit your value so remember I actually
went through the mathematics at least
sketching it convincing you that it's
okay but it's okay only if your sole
purpose in life is to either not eat
that Apple if the only thing you ever do
is that Apple if your life is more
complex than that and you're going to do
other things on this example
house if you're going to do other things
than that there might not be true might
not be a good idea so for example before
you buy in your house you might actually
you know in case you didn't actually
been discuss you probably still on a
half so you're not going to be the
mother house afterwards licking your
value does all this guy is really rich
we better if I give him a big price may
or may not be a good idea for you it's
not even good if either if there are
simultaneously multiple auctions going
on there are two classes you're bidding
on boss telling your real value can
actually be really problematic so one
day I would express this that is
truthful the concept of truthfulness is
only in isolation when we try to compose
it with multiple since we do in our
lives it's not working so truthfulness
seems like maybe not the right kind of
thing and again remember on the internet
these advertisements advertisers sell
ads you know at Milian's a second so
there lot of them and a lot of
compositions going on so what does econ
tell us if you took a class like what in
the US would often be called econ 101
then they will tell you that there is a
clear solution to this what you're
supposed to do is price everything has a
price and I just can't tell the users
when they show that that hey guys you're
the prices please tell us what you want
to buy this works very well then you
know the price and I guess it works
beautifully when you note what the
prices are and in fact there was this
beautiful serum out there that says that
if you set the price is right and the
market clears now what does it mean the
market clears there means two things one
is that everyone when he saw the prices
they figured out what they wanted and
there wasn't a shortage Gabe market
didn't clear if the prices were low
every woman in the store they all wanted
to or not in the store in this case
money to buy houses you all said you
wanted that blue house then the market
didn't clear because there was a
congestion on the blue house which I
wasn't enough in contrast mark is also
then clearing the prices were too high
because then
everyone went to the store and says no I
don't want anything this is very
expensive that's also not good mike is
clears if everything sold exactly month
which is kind of a magic kind of prices
I have to slide to convince you it is
the only maybe more mathematical slide I
had that if you found these prices than
the market clears that can be beautiful
it has the property that the baby
allocated the good is it optimizes
social welfare optimizes everyone's
happiness so the way the proof cause
suppose you had this market clearing
prices then everyone could get the
socially optimal product they might not
if they don't they must be getting
something that's even better for
themselves you add this up over all the
users and most magically use the fact
that the mark is cleared so the sum of
the price is in this summation nicely
canceled and what you get is the Vegas
got allocated is at least as good as the
optimal that is it is actually optimal
so prices are indeed beautiful and in
fact we use it all the time in our life
if you go in the store that's what you
do you could have prices and you buy
them and the stores are in fact living
on that this is mark is clearing if the
store isn't much the prices iron market
clearing either it tracks up on the
shelf and over wanted or there's
constantly empty shop there but in the
internet contest this heart these prices
are really hard to find so I don't know
how to find market clearing prices it's
easier to do it on standard products
like bread and miracle which we have a
lot of it's really hard to do it on
advertisement an advertisement isn't
actually your eyeball watching this but
it has to do with who you are are you
someone who buys a lot of stuff on the
internet what time of day there is it
the kind of time of day that pizza might
be really something for you is it not
that kind of day geographic data are you
living are you a university student near
you
versity or are you in some place else
are you in the US or are you in India
all kinds of things about you that is
every time they wanna sell an
advertisement more precise we might
understand you're able for virtually
advertisement it's a different selling
item and it's very hard to press all
this stuff and actually because I'm a
theoretician I felt obliged to put this
down here at the last point market
clearing prices is not guaranteed to
exist when they exist and when we can
find them very beautiful but they tend
not to exist and even when they exist
they really have to find so here is what
I am proposing and that's actually a
much more recent research with the
student of mine is certain natural
mechanisms price based or breathing
based mechanisms create approximately
market securing prices they don't care
if exactly market clearing prices for
two reasons first of all because they
might not exist and second of all
because the man is ms not we don't know
as vigorous or participants in this
system you don't know enough to create
the exact market Faren prices but they
create approximately market clearing
prices and what's going to be nice about
this that when you approximately markets
living then you are approximately
optimal which is kind of nice given a
system and our general sensibility at
least on the internet and this
approximately minimizing time
approximately minimizing cost is a
simple enough nihilism is probably what
we wanted to any help okay so what do I
mean by approximately market clearing as
a reminder the real market clearing the
main important part in the proof was
that there are set of prices and that
every participant if you want on this
prices can grab his optimal set of items
paying this set of current set of prices
and on the market fear instead of this
in at this requirement I want to require
something that the player can do
something with something or make make a
bid or do something that gets his
benefit not exactly as high as what I
had in the micro curing process
approximately the tie and i put in too
much factors getting not quite as value
and paying a little bit more than the
price you should imagine that lambda is
less than 1 and use a bummer you pay a
little bit above but you should have
paid and you get a value little bit less
but you could have gotten but something
approximately the same and the main
theorem here so for example just to get
you a example of what kind of man isn't
can have this approximately market
clearing property to very surprisingly
an auction system that maybe not that
great already has this clearing property
the single a single item the first price
auction so first price is a variant of
what I showed you is a second price when
you pay your price what you named is
what your prize a lot of things I saw
the contracts are usually sold on first
price you bid and then a best best bid
you take it that's the contract single
price is not true for which is why it
makes a good example and I can do it on
a single item so here is the simple
example yes I tell you it's supposed to
be tough your value now what does it
mean you beat half your value well if
you pick a few value there are two
things that can happen either you win
the item and because you be the only
half your valuable the other half is
left for yourself you shaded you'll be
properly it was first prize everything
your real value would have been dumb of
you or you don't in which case the price
was high enough and either way my funny
and equality is true so either you win
in which case you your utility godfrey
high or you didn't win but then the
price that someone else pretty must have
been high enough so this is a simple
example of something that approximately
have this market clearing property so
our serum is my student is that if
something else is approximately markets
doing property then it's also
approximately optimal I didn't write the
proof down here but it's virtually
identical to market clearing proof the
only thing I'm losing is because they
have this watch factors the results will
have the fudge factors that is not
exactly optimal like it was for market
clearing its approximately off
but what's nice about this that unlike
the market-clearing which had to be only
true if you actually find those
marketing prices this actually is very
flexible it's not only true if you find
an equilibrium which unfortunately might
be equally problematic to file but
instead it's true if people be learn or
reach a non-region equilibrium in a
natural kind of repeated play so that's
maybe the last thing I want to tell you
a little bit of bad is so what do I mean
by it's true even without reaching an
equilibrium so here is how bidding
really works they're just companies who
wouldn't want to sell things and you
know they start learning you are a low
company little mom-and-pop store you
decide to start advertising on Dave on
your other coolest you put in some bids
you see what happens you get some sort
of outcome you run the auction you get
the outcome they two against something
happens you run the auction day three
day four and so on the idea is that the
beginning you were clueless you didn't
know what's going on and in all honesty
there many beginnings because even very
experienced companies like Microsoft
something sometimes changes the virtue
in jizz some interesting thing happens
and somehow everything behaves
differently any of your just but
whatever you adjusting to hopefully
after a while you have a good idea and
you start being better now what do I
mean by being better but I mean by being
better if I want you to have the
following very simple property which I
think most people are a good enough and
certainly algorithms are good enough to
reach this to watch if there was a
strategy behind side that would have
been really good all the time and do it
you don't have to be super good you can
change your bid you can change your
behavior but if there is a wise strategy
this hand side then please watch and be
at least as good as that show that you
would have been in fact you can be a lot
better than this it could be the case
bidding only in the mornings is much
wiser than we didn't go all the time and
the afternoon skip death this is a
product that people only by in the
morning that might be even better but at
least we beat frisbee us and smart if
there is a single strategy that would
have worked beautifully do it in fact in
a context of the first price I even can
tell you what the strategy is you can do
whatever you want shade you'd with more
than half the value are less than half
their value but I give you a strategy
that is half your value if that strategy
is better than what you're doing you
wouldn't must you were pretty non smart
in your bidding I told you what to do
you don't have to do it but if my advice
is a lot better than your behavior
you're not very smart yes so this is the
standard I'm on I'm on it in many cases
I can do what you're doing here in first
price auction I can name the strategy
you don't have to do it I just give you
advice and I'm assuming in my serum sir
my analysis that your behavior was at
least as good as my advice that is with
their level there's a low loftiness of
error factor there my your behavior
wasn't much worse than my advice again
you're not obliged to follow my advice
but you have this advice in front of you
on a computer screen and if your outcome
is longer than the advice soonerlater
wake up to this and follow the advice
and service and if you do do that again
the same quality losses view over lambda
so again it applies them learning
outcomes and what's nice about this and
I won't go into the details this
actually has the beautiful benefit that
unlike truthfulness is composed if you
participate in one kind of auction in
one hand and you know buying a house in
one hand and go shopping for your fruits
on the other hand and they both have
this property than the compasses will
preserve this property so this has the
nice property which is something the old
bond is that anywhere from economic
activity we all do in our life whether
it's selling advertise
or driving to work we never do any of
those in isolation we all do this as
part of our bigger life and what's nice
about this notion of approximately
market clearing mechanisms that they do
compose that is they have this nice
property preserve this property when
you're participating in multiple options
there are a bunch of this kind of
management's around and I guess I gave
you the example of first price auction
which was a simple example to use I
should have made first price auction is
first price auction is actually better
than I this half half that I used is a
silly number silly simple numbers to use
you can do better if your little careful
the generalized generalized auction that
internet advertisement usually so don't
also has this property all kinds of
public good action bandits allocation
may be an interesting example I've also
spend a second on that also has this
property is not usually called all pay
auction so all pay auction the typical
two or three action is the name says
everyone pays and the guy who plays the
most wins reward it's a very painful
kind of auction the common example of
all pay option is crowdsourcing contact
contest gave a new crowd sourcing like
you know you're doing a competition for
who's going to design the logo for this
University I don't know if university
would like or the hotel would like a
trap sourcing for t-mobile but usually
they do is the NASA contest to have a
logo contest for the hotel and the guys
whose logo they adopt it's going to get
some bigger board and everyone else gets
up nothing now no one paid anything but
you paid with your sweat all the
participants who submit logos spend
effort and energy which is sort of money
in participating in a context that's a
typical kind of opie action there's one
winner who won the price and the rest of
them with nothing and effort and food
energy so all say action also has this
property of approximately
market clearing and remember there were
two parameters which I put on this slide
so in conclusion but I try to convince
you of is that life around us is foolish
places than me Lord apartment humankind
participates in a shared activity from
actual markets from the internet from
traffic routing and in many many of
these cases the shared activity we all
participates in order to extract some
good for ourselves so here I'm thinking
of examples only-- where your goal is to
make one good for you you're not I'm not
trying to win any of my examples I
wasn't trying to hurt the other
participants I'm just trying to help
myself but even this can lead to what's
called the tragedy of the Commons that
is it's possible and in fact not
uncommon if you're not careful that it
leads to a design set up there everyone
loved it optimizing for themselves
really hurt the comic alerts to come on
good and you end up with a ruined
society whether it's the you know a park
that's not usable because everyone left
one piece of dirt in there and it's now
a mass or the grass that's not usable
because there were too many cows honest
but but I mostly did with my technical
part of the talk is try to tell you that
in many setups with low care and careful
design and thinking about the principle
we can design things so that selfish the
effect of selfish shoes get mitigated
with the right kind of design so i give
this in the context of the internet by
having enough cable and a contest of of
selling sinks or markets this is
approximately markets leaving Starman
isms that have the property that the
right thing will happen without exerting
so much control we don't collect all the
values we don't have a sit essential
entity dividing out the goods it's all a
natural bidding and you get everyone
between different items a distributed
kind of property it's easy to
image and let and then the less the
outcome is reasonably good in most of
these cases in both cases that i showed
you reasonably good humans you lost a
factor and make a factor of two if both
of my examples you're only half as
efficient and you have to have twice as
much cable but in many contexts means
especially when money when time is what
we're talking about in context of
internet and technology a factor of 2
loss is very paid for by the efficiency
of a simple to manage system there is no
central control and it's simple to
manage and and I'm going to stop here
