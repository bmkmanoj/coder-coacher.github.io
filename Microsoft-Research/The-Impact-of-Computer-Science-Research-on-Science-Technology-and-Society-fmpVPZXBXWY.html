I it's it's so exciting to see the sea
of faces the students the young faculty
because what I see in front of me is the
future the future of computer science
the future of computing so thank you for
having me here I am going to I am going
to try to keep you awake and actually
what I want to talk about is what I
believe are the ways in which we think
about research and computing and related
disciplines what kind of impact we have
on science society and technology I like
to talk about the drivers of computer
science research what drives us to ask a
particular question that we work on in
research I like to talk about the
science drivers deep questions that we
ask ourselves in computer science that
keep driving us as a field I like to
talk about the technology drivers as
technology advances we ask new questions
because of new technology we ask old
questions and get new answers because of
advances in technology but most
importantly I like to talk about
societal drivers people we have high
expectations of our computing and
information technology and also societal
Grand Challenges can benefit from the
advances that we make in computer
science but the these drivers I talk
about are initiate the kind of research
questions we ask science questions
technology questions and societal
questions so science technology and
society are also ways for us to look at
the impact
of our research so what I'm going to do
in my talk is give you four short
stories a science impact story a
technology impact story a society impact
story and one story that goes through
the whole cycle before I do that I
wanted to remind you of the mission of
Microsoft Research that Rick rash had
shared with all of you this morning
advancing the state-of-the-art
technology transfer and ensuring the
future I very much believe in this
mission of Microsoft Research and it's
so nicely Maps onto the science
technology and society drivers and
measures of research impact so I believe
that Microsoft Research is a unique
research enterprise that really
subscribes to doing fundamental basic
open research where researchers are
driven by these kinds of questions and
have impact on science technology and
society and all of us who do research in
computing can have this kind of impact
so let's start with impact on science
and this story all the stories by the
way are results from that I'm reporting
on from 2013 just this year so these are
very current research results that I'm
reporting this one is a breakthrough
results in theoretical computer science
that happens to have a profound
implication on quantum mechanics so
that's why I call it computer science
meets quantum mechanics it's actually
the question of splitting a quadratic
form in half technically that's what
it's going on and so let me just walk
through very briefly and simply the idea
the theorem they prove so imagine it
have a set of short vectors here that
you see it turns out that it's possible
to partition this set of short vectors
into red vectors and blue vectors such
that in any test Direction half of the
energy comes from the red vectors and
half of the energy in that direction
comes from the blue vectors so that's
intuitively what it means to split a
quadratic form in half now I talked
about test directions and energy so let
me just walk through those concepts a
little more slowly
look let's consider these four vectors
in two-dimensional space I can compute
the energy along any test direction for
instance along this test direction I'm
pointing along the x axis I can compute
the energy it's about 1 + and that's
because the vector lie on the x axis
contributes its energy if you will but
the three vectors are THOG and all don't
contribute as much if I looked at the
test direction along the y axis it's got
more energy so I hope you get that
intuition it turns out that what you can
do is you can draw an ellipsoid around
these vectors whose radius is equal to
the energy in that direction and a
quadratic form is just such an ellipsoid
and now I can state the theorem the
theorem that Microsoft Research of
Microsoft researcher proved along with
two colleagues from Yale University says
that if you are given a set of
sufficiently short vectors such that in
each test Direction the energy is equal
to 1 then it's possible to partition
this set of
sufficiently short factors into two
parts the red vectors and the blue
vectors such that each part has energy
close to half in each direction it
sounds like a simple theorem but it was
actually quite hard and if you look at
the proof it's quite sophisticated why
am I telling you about quadratics and
energy it turns out that you can encode
many many structures in actually many
from many different disciplines as
quadratic forms for instance in computer
science we work with graphs all the time
large social graphs for instance and a
typical computer science question is
taken to take a large graph and to break
it into smaller graphs sub graphs such
that each sub graph shares a property of
the original graph so for instance in
the graph sparse of occasion problem I
take a big graph and I divide it into
sub graphs each sub graph has the same
number of nodes but fewer edges and it
turns out that you can do this and
preserve the cut property of the
original graph and this kind of
decomposition that we do in computer
science occurs over and over again it's
a way that we can then run an algorithms
for instance on the smaller graphs and
run those algorithms much more
efficiently than if we were to have to
do it on the larger graph this encoding
of other structures is quadratic forms
also shows up in signal processing on in
terms of the discrete Fourier
coefficients such that it under
underlines the classical uncertainty
principle in signal processing that says
a signal cannot be localized easily in
both the time domain
and the frequency domain but probably
most exciting to the world when this
breakthrough theoretical computer
science result was published just in
June this year was that it proved an
outstanding conjecture the Canson singer
conjecture that has been outstanding for
54 years and this theorem that was
proved implies that the conjecture is
indeed true and why it took so long to
prove this conjecture is that people
didn't think it was true and so this is
a very surprising result and this result
actually speaks to the mathematical
foundations of quantum mechanics and has
other implications to mathematical
physics and functional analysis so that
was my science story let me turn to
something completely different impact on
technology and this story comes out of
Microsoft Research Asia some work done
that was published in this year SIGGRAPH
on video stabilization the problem is
this everyone has a cell phone a tablet
some kind of portable mobile device with
the camera on it and we take pictures or
videos and what usually comes out pretty
shaky because our hands move around and
we move around and this is what you get
now would it be nice is if we if we
could use in software if we could do in
software if we can use software to
actually stabilize this video and the
technique I'm going to show you does
exactly this and so we can get rid of
tripods and other physical devices
because we can do the stabilization in
software so I'm just going to very
quickly walk through the method that's
used to affect this video stabilization
the
typical pipeline and video stabilization
is to take successive frames in a video
and to compute a single camera path from
frame to frame to frame so you get a
single camera path for the video and
then you smooth out the path and then
along each point in this smooth path you
actually warp the image appropriately to
get a smoother video so this is a
typical pipeline that is used for video
stabilization and the technique I'm
going to show you
beats existing competitors in in along
many properties that I'm going to show
you by using two different techniques
two different ideas
the first idea is instead of computing a
single camera path through successive
frames in the video we're gonna compute
multiple camera paths by taking each
frame and dividing it into a 2d grid
mesh and then treating each grid in that
mesh as a little video and then from
frame to frame to frame we will compute
multiple camera paths so that's the
first idea the second idea is to use
what's called adaptive filtering in
current techniques low-pass filtering
like Gaussian filters are used to to
smooth out the video but if the camera
moves rapidly then you get these black
areas and you get cropped videos and so
on doesn't look so pretty the technique
out of Microsoft Research Asia uses
what's called anisotropic filtering
adaptive filtering and you can see that
it's a much smoother path and it doesn't
have those black areas and it doesn't
have as much cropping so with combining
these two ideas together
we get better parallax handling so what
I'm going to show you now is the
original video on top and the best
competing algorithm on the lower left
and our algorithm on the lower right so
you can see when a video has different
when you're looking at a picture and the
the perspective of what you're looking
at depends on the direction you're
looking at because of the anisotropic
filtering we get better parallax
handling the second advantage of our
approach is less geometry distortion so
when you look at the lower left
competiting competing technique look at
where the red arrows are and you'll see
that there's a lot of global skewing and
global shearing and other local
distortions see that that tree looks
bent there also there's less cropping
with our technique again if you think
about these rapid camera motions you can
see how our technique does much better
and finally in cell phones right now
with CMOS technology there's what's
called a rolling shutter problem because
images are stored aligned by line and so
we can actually correct for this rolling
shutter problem and you can see the
difference between a competitive
approach and our approaches our approach
is a lot less jerky and here are just a
few more examples of some input videos
and then if we wait a little bit we'll
see our technique the video
stabilization technique I'm smoothing
what you see we can do people too
good
so now let me talk about a story on
research also published this year that
has the potential for great impact on
society in fact great impact on China
it's called you where in the grander
scheme of a new emerging area which I
like to call and others like to call
urban computing this was work published
in this year's conference at KT D so the
problem is not unfamiliar to many of you
in China and that is bad air quality and
so bad air quality is bad for society I
believe that so the question is then
what can we do about that well if you
look at Beijing Beijing has 22 air
quality monitoring stations and they're
in fixed locations and what that's fine
if you're near that one of those 22 air
quality monitoring stations you'd
actually know how bad the air is but
most of us don't live near one of those
22 stations and we don't work
necessarily near one of those stations
so what we'd really like to know is
where I am where I'm living where I'm
working where I'm eating at a restaurant
where I walk you through the park I'd
like to know what the air quality is
where I am now and so that's the problem
that these researchers are trying to
address and what's so timely is this
technique that I'm going to explain to
you takes into consideration the
multiple data sources that are around us
and these streams of data are then going
to be used to create a model from which
we can actually answer that question
what is the air quality where I am now
and there are different kinds of data
sources their temporal sources and
spatial sources so in particular in this
technique we're going to use
meteorological data about the weather
air pressure so on traffic data current
where the cars are right now we're going
to use where people are by monitoring
the GPS on their cell phones and then of
course there's those are this temple
data sources and then of course we might
as well use spatial data where parks are
where restaurants are where the
buildings are the points of interest in
a city and of course we also have the
roads the network of roads they also
don't move but they're very important
because they let us know where cars
might go we also will actually of course
use historical data from the air quality
monitoring stations and real-time data
as the 22 stations are reporting their
numbers in real-time and then what we're
going to do is actually take Beijing and
divide it into a big grid and then
compute through a model what the air
quality is where I am right now
so the methodology is to partition a
city into disjoint grids and to extract
features for each grid from its
impacting region which is just think of
it as where I am plus the eight
neighboring regions around me and the
features are going to be as I mentioned
in the previous slide and then what you
yujeong does in his and his colleagues
do in this work is to create a
semi-supervised learning model that
takes into consideration both temporal
and spatial data and this is going to
allow us to predict the air quality
index for any grid
in that region and they do it for a
nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide PM 2.5
and PM 10 and so just to show you that
the features that they extract actually
correlate intuitively with respect to
each other I'll just show you this one
result here that plots for
meteorological features temperature
humidity pressure and wind speed and
basically the way to read this is to say
well look one-one results basically says
when it's windy out the error is good so
green dots are good and purple dots are
bad and that intuitively makes sense cuz
when the wind comes it blows all the bad
air away similarly you can read this
plot to show to say that when the
humidity is high the air is bad and
that's also intuitive so what they do is
they create this semi-supervised
learning model and basically what that
means is you have some label data that
label data comes from the 22 monitoring
stations you feed that label data into
two separate classifiers one is your
temporal classifier and one is your
spatial classifier and then you use
inference to infer labels on the
unlabeled data you take that newly label
data feed it back into your training set
and can iterate and so then you can
create this code coach training
semi-supervised learning model they
evaluated this model on four different
data sets for different cities in China
Beijing Shanghai Shenzhen and Wuhan and
they got very good results in comparison
to other kinds of learning models so the
black bars are the results from the
model I just explained to you and so if
you're interested you can actually go to
this website
and find out in real time in one of
their neighborhoods in one of these four
cities what the air quality is so if you
had Joel your surface Pro's out or your
laptop out you could actually do this
right now okay let me now talk about one
last story on the impact of science
technology and society and I like this
story because it relates to a question
that Rick Rasheed was asked this morning
about does everything people do in
Microsoft Research have something to do
with the company and in a basic research
organization of the answer is no
remember the first mission statement of
the Microsoft Research is advanced the
state of the art in in whatever area you
choose to do research so I'm going to
start with the story about how
fundamental research in visualizing data
for astronomers ended up in Excel
technology that Microsoft produces and
sells and how this circle can be closed
by this visualization technology having
a potential for policymakers to make
decisions about their local region about
their city for instance so we start with
this astronomers how many years ago a
bulk astronomers for centuries have been
collecting data and of course most
recently astronomers have been using
very sophisticated scientific
instruments like the Hubble Space
Telescope you see on the left and the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey you see on the
right collect collecting lots and lots
of images of the universe and their
multiple such telescopes on the ground
and the sky and so on and years ago
Microsoft research along with
researchers at Johns Hopkins University
ask the question why don't we try to
visualize the data that all of these
instruments are collecting and that led
to what's called the world wide
telescope it's a way in which you and I
can visualize the universe in fact it's
a way that you and I can take a virtual
tour through the universe and I'm gonna
show you an example soon before I get to
the tour I do want to say that the world
wide telescope is in use in China there
is a the first world wide telescope dome
is in the Chongqing
planetarium and there was an event last
week that showcased the worldwide
telescope there so now let's look at a
kind of tour that one can take through
the universe using the data visualized
through the world wide telescope whoops
oh how do I go back thank you okay I
think it's playing so we're now we're
taking a trip to the solar system to our
solar system through many galaxies there
are millions of galaxies we just went
through there's a in each galaxy
contains billions of stars and what
we're gonna zoom in on pretty soon is
we're going to come to our own galaxy
the Milky Way and we will see our solar
system in one of the spiral arms of the
Milky Way as we approach as we're there
we go and then if we continue zooming in
we'll pass by our planets better near
the earth
for instance here's Saturn coming up and
you can imagine all the different
telescopes collecting all these
different images and then we through the
worldwide telescope have been able to
stitch together everything so that we
can enjoy this tour to earth together
well this was pure research it was about
astronomy wasn't even about computer
science and in fact the worldwide
telescope is used by citizen scientists
around the world many many users and one
the the AHA was why not you know point
this telescope that's looking at the sky
to the earth
and why not do this similar kind of data
visualization from all the data that we
have about the earth about countries
about cities and so on and that was what
brought us to taking this pure research
a pure scientific research work into
Microsoft technology in particular in
Excel 2013 there's a button you can
press called power map and it basically
allows you to visualize any data that's
represented in an Excel spreadsheet and
so let's look at some data from the from
China's 2008 Beijing Olympics we're
going to look at where in China the
medals were won whoops okay so hopefully
this will play oh here we go
okay we're gonna zoom in and we'll see
first of all China 174 gold medals but
now let's look at where which provinces
one metals gold silver and bronze medals
and we can see that almost every
province can brag about having won
medals will see that I have to read this
we all named won the most medals but if
we look at a breakdown of the gold
silver bronze medals will actually see
that
jungsoo won a proportionally larger on a
number of gold medals we can even look
at a breakdown of the kind of sport
where these medals are one so you'll see
Shanghai has a lot of water sports
medals and who Bay has a lot of
gymnastics medals so this is the kind of
visualization you can do once you have
data the next example I want to show has
more to do with so what you look at this
data is not pretty but in the end you
want to make a decision about the day to
get visualizing about the information
that you're seeing that's much easier
you can make these kinds of policy
decisions because you can more easily
see the data and so this is an example
from Seattle which it's about traffic
accidents in Seattle and you'll see as
we zoom in here let's see if this works
oops oops back play back no back it
should when you look at the black screen
it should be just play okay this that's
the black screen just okay break let's
we'll get this yet
okay playing no it's not really that
exciting okay here we go and you'll see
over this two-year period
the traffic accidents we're gonna zoom
in on four places where there are high
numbers of traffic accidents one one
here in this play field one in a very
busy intersection in downtown Seattle
and one coming up in near a community
college and when coming up also near a
mall and it turns out that we should
when we show this data to the local
neighborhoods in fact at the Community
College and in the mall they put in
traffic lights to once they had this
data they made a policy decision so this
is fairly new it's only in Excel 2013
but already oil and gas companies and
finance companies are using power map to
make these kinds of corporate level
decisions so this is my science
technology Society story but now let me
move on looking to the future and I was
very gratified to hear the questions
from this morning from the students and
the faculty who wanted to know about
where's computing going for the future
and what I'm going to do is to share
with you some trends that I see let me
start with the science questions these
are not trends these are outstanding
questions that kind of underlie our
field I wrote a little paper it's only
three pages long to address each of
these science questions so I'm not going
to go through each of these one by one
but probably the most fundamental
question in computer science is what is
computable what problems can we solve
with a computer and what problems can we
not solve and what's interesting about
that question is you'd think that we
know this answer but if you listen to
faster Joseph's if offices talk this
morning I'm our whole notion of what a
computer is a model of computation is
changing you know so if we might know
the answer to this question with respect
to a Turing machine but says suppose we
open up our thinking and think about
humans and machines working together as
a computer and then all of a sudden
asking the questions what if answering
the question what it's computable is
very difficult let me look at some
technology drivers or trends so let's
just look at machines and devices at one
end we've got exascale computing coming
and in between we've got multiple kinds
of devices that people wear um people
carry and then at the very extreme end
we've got nano computing coming
we've got bio computing coming where
people are using molecules to program
functions computable functions and now
think of imagine putting bio nano and
info together and I think the real tease
out there is of course quantum computing
so the future is there's there's a huge
future ahead of us because we can hardly
scratch the surface on all of these in
terms of technology trends of scale and
intelligence well we talked a lot about
big data we're drowning in data and I
think what's more interesting to be
asking is not how do we extract
knowledge from data but how do we make
decisions or take action based on the
knowledge that we extract from the data
and the worldwide telescope our math
example gives us a hint of what's to
come of course there's the cell plus the
cloud and again professor joseph sifakas
talked about cyber-physical systems this
morning or smart X well this is another
trend to expect when we've got computing
interacting with the physical world
robots are coming and I very much liked
Roz's talked about thinking about what's
going on in the brain I think
computational neuroscience is a new
emerging area with the with lots of
research questions to answer and finally
I've already hinted at this notion of a
computer where you've got humans and
machines working together in fact
networks of humans and machines working
together to solve problems that neither
can solve alone and finally let's look
at societal drivers and the kind of
impact we in computer science would like
to have on society we have trends like
all of us having high expectations of
computing and information technology we
expect everything to be 24 by 7 usable
by anyone we want access to anything at
anytime from anywhere and in reality we
don't quite have that where our systems
are still unreliable our connectivity
can be down servers can go down we still
get blue screens and so on so we have a
long way to go there as well another
societal trend is of course all our
computing technology is really useful
and used by everyone in society from the
old and the young the rich in the poor
the literate and illiterate the able and
disabled and another trend is of course
highly personal personal personalized
computing personalization and I think
this is going to happen with the use of
big data techniques like machine
learning and so on let me close now we
thought with what I think are truly our
Grand Challenges and my hope and wish
that
the young people in this audience who
still have long research careers ahead
of them will think about addressing
because I do believe that these societal
grand challenges like energy the
environment climate change food water
health care education like MOOCs
transportation and safety its security
these societal grand challenges will be
helped by advances in computing and
computing technology thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
