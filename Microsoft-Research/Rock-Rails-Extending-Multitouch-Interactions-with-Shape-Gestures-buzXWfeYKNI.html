a lightweight method of achieving fluid
high precision direct manipulation on a
multi-touch display traditional direct
touch methods enable fluid manipulations
of on-screen objects while appropriate
for coarse transformations the technique
does not support finer grained
operations further it is extremely
difficult to isolate a transformation
users may want to only translate the
object but invariably they also rotate
and resize as well occlusion also can
increase the difficulty of performing
manipulations the rock and rails
technique provides an augmentation to
the set of standard multi-touch
manipulations achieving the aims of
reduced occlusion transform isolation
and increased precision to accomplish
this we segment the language into finger
points and shapes the original fingertip
base manipulations are not altered in
our technique shape gestures are
recognized but do not manipulate
on-screen content they serve only to
apply constraints to the manipulations
performed by the fingertips by
augmenting the existing set of
manipulation gestures classic
multi-touch interaction is maintained
with no reduction the expressiveness of
the language and without adding
on-screen you I users remember the
simple rule touches manipulate shapes
constrained rock and rails is comprised
of just three shaped gestures rock rail
and curved rail applying a rail to an
object constrains it to resize only
perpendicular to the rail applying a
rock to an object constrains it's a
uniform resize this constraint frees the
user to make off access movements to
adjust gained increasing precision
applying a curved rail to an object
constrains it to rotation again off axis
movements are now ignored allowing for
increased precision applying a rail to
the background creates
ruler active rulers service collision
points for moving objects allowing quick
alignment or translation along the ruler
applying a fist to the background
creates a proxy any on-screen object can
be linked to any proxy manipulations to
the proxy are applied to all linked
objects this reduces occlusion while
allowing the user to apply identical
manipulations to multiple objects
objects can be linked to more than one
proxy creating de facto overlapping
groupings with the addition of this
small set of shaped gestures to the
standard set of direct manipulations
users are able to perform rapid
occlusion free high precision
manipulations of one or more transforms
without interfering with traditional
multi-touch interaction or adding
on-screen you I we believe the rock and
rails technique serves as a worthy
augmentation to a widely used gesture
language
