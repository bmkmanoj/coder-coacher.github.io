hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
i'm going to give you first a little bit
of context the kinds of things that
we've been doing I'm just going to play
a quick video in this video is kind of
old notes about three years old them but
it gives you the basic idea of the stuff
that we've been working on on the left
hand side you see a phone app here that
pops up on your on your tablet computer
or your phone and when a person walks
into the room he turns on the light
switch you see a little light switch pop
up here you see a black icon follow him
into that first room and then when he
turns the check but pushes the button on
the remote control the television pops
up in the screen the second person walks
in and you see that that purple icon
follows him into that first room too he
walks through the first German into the
back room and the purple icon follows
him again and so the key here is that
the system somehow knows the the first
person is still sitting in that first
room whereas the second person has gone
on into the back room and I can
differentiate these two people now that
people aren't wearing any RFID tags
aren't wearing any art RF transmitters
it can figure them out figure out who's
who without them actually carrying or
participating are participating in
anything it also monitors some the you
saw water fixture turned on light
fixture turn on now you see a microwave
turn on and as this person walks out of
the room and out of the field of view in
fact of the camera you can still see in
that screen over there you walked out
into the hallway through into the
bathroom turn the light on flush the
toilet and yes you washed his hands now
he's going to leave the bathroom turn
off all those fixtures so the basic idea
here is to monitor who's in the house
which room they're in and then what
they're doing in terms of electrical
appliances and water fixtures let me cut
this video short just a little bit the
basic idea and explain how that how that
video is actually made so the basic idea
is you walk into a house and you deploy
a bunch of these what we call doorway
sensors door jamb sensors at the top of
the doorways and basically that's all
you need to do there's no configuration
required you walk out of the house when
you come back in you can open your phone
and there's the app that you just saw so
it automatically figures out the floor
plan figures out the people identities
and
where the fixtures are and what fixtures
are going to be used so what's actually
in this door jamb sensor there are a
number of things here one is a motion
sensor pretty simple there's one on each
side of the door to monitor motion in
both doors in both directions and
there's also a door latch sensor so it
can tell for those doorways that have
doors at least whether the doors open or
closed inside this enclosure and our
current version on which you'll see a
little bit later today there's a
temperature sensor a light to light
sensors one in each direction and a
magnetometer and the last and most
important sensor here is a ultrasound
sensor that points down it's actually an
ultrasonic range finder points down into
the bottom of the doorway and the reason
for that is to figure out who's actually
walking through the door so you can
imagine a conical sensing region of this
ultrasonic range finder when the person
walks onto the door the distance
measured at first measure points to the
floor so about seven feet plus or minus
when the person walks through you get a
shorter distance the distance from the
door jamb to the top of the person's
head and that can tell you roughly the
height of the person the difference
between those two readings and you can
measure you can identify which is the
position where the person walked
directly under the door hopefully
because that's the shortest distance
that you measure now that doesn't tell
you that tells you who walked in the
door more or less differentiating
between the people in a household at a
household scale where you have four to
five people living there and it doesn't
tell you which direction the person went
and so you don't know which room they
went into but if you just take that
ultrasonic range finder and tilt it a
little bit now you have an asymmetric
sensing region and that generates an
asymmetric response so if the person is
walking this direction in the doorway
along with a cone the law the shortest
distance you get is right away where is
that they walked the opposite direction
you get the shortest distance at the
very end of your measurement so that
tells you who the person is roughly and
which direction they went so which room
they went into and based on that but I
won't go into the details of how we
generate this floor plan but we can
generate the floor plan based on that
information and then identify where the
people are moving throughout the house
and then we take that information which
is just tracking just tracking
information and fuse that with data that
hopefully is already being collected at
the house water mains data and power
mains theta so over time
just walked into this room here over
time you're you're also collecting
electrical mains data and water mains
data and you might see that when the
person walks into this room you often
see some some usage on the water mains
and that usage happens to look kind of
like a toilet so you might assume that
there's a toilet in this room and maybe
you see some more water means data being
used in it might assume there's a sink
because that looks like a sink profile
so now you can identify what kinds of
fixtures are in each kind each one of
these rooms person might leave that room
go into a different room and in this
case maybe you see some electrical mains
data that looks like a light bulb and it
also looks like a television you can
assume that room has all I pulled in a
television in it and from that
information we repeat that for all of
the electrical and water fixtures over
time learn this profile and then based
on the kinds of appliances and fixtures
that you have in each room also try to
figure out which room is which so any
room that has for example a toilet in it
it's probably a bathroom it's certainly
not a bedroom if the room has a stove or
an oven in it it's probably a kitchen
and so based on just these doorway
sensors along with the power means and
water mains data we hope to identify the
floor plan of the house which people are
in the in house which rooms are in and
what they're doing in terms of
electrical and water usage and once we
have that information as somebody walks
around the house and they turn on for
example a light switch turn the light on
or change the heat or whatever they do
turn on the television we can monitor
what they're doing over time and assign
let's say those usage events to that
individual person usage of electrical
water heat whatever it might be and one
goal of that could be to turn that
around and Jen and use it for feedback
so you might generate a graph that looks
kind of like this where you know instead
of saying something like you know this
household uses so much energy compared
to their neighbors you can say this
person uses this much energy compared to
their spouse or their children I mean
you can break that down by person and
also break that down by fixture and so
we can say you know it might happen to
be that um you know dad takes really
long showers and mom uses more lights in
a house
and we can also hopefully identify what
kind of waste so this is you know we
haven't we're not generating these
graphs right now this is our goal we can
identify waste for example you know mom
does use more lights in the kitchen but
it might also be true that she's not
actually in the kitchen when she turns
lights on so that's waste we knowed it
and in the same for a bathroom or
bedroom so hopefully identify the
difference between usage and waste as
well so this is some of the stuff that
we've been doing and are trying to do it
as we go on to do that we basically need
three kinds of sensors shown up here on
the left side top left there's a doorway
sensor which goes into each door and
then there's power means data and water
mains data and those sensors are being
deployed already across the across the
country and across the world in total
this is about 15 sensors so the average
house has you know 10 to 13 doors plus
two main sensor so about 15 sensors we
also had before we we did that we did a
bunch of exploratory studies so for
example it took several different kinds
of motion sensors and place them in
different locations in every room on the
walls on the doors above the windows to
see where we would actually get the best
motion sensor data same thing for
temperature sensors put them on the
exterior walls into your interior walls
in the early wood doors near the windows
and like sensors also same thing so in
our exploratory studies we had to
actually deploy about almost 200 sensors
per house in some cases and then we also
while we're doing our studies have to
collect data on the actual fixtures we
use what we call ground truth sensors
like this one here that actually has you
know this is actually a contact reefs
which that detects when that handles
move so you know when the fixture is
being used that way we can check whether
our estimates of the fixture usage are
correct or wrong and so per house we
need to monitor every light switch every
appliance every water fixture and so
that's about another hundred sensors per
house so you can see that in total there
are pretty large number of sensors on
the order of 300 or more sensors per
home and of course this can't be done
just in one home because if you do a
study on one home it doesn't mean much
when it could be a fluke result so you
need to deploy this entire system into
multiple homes and in the end after
doing these studies
we ended up deploying over 1,200 sensors
in 20 homes for up to a year sometimes
more than a year at a time so this is
one of the main challenges scaling up
these deployments to do the kinds of
studies that we've been doing now I come
from the field of what we call wireless
sensor networks then one of the main
goals of that research area is to get
large-scale deployments working reliably
in extremely harsh environments in fact
people in that community would probably
say it's not even a hard deployment if
it doesn't take snowshoes and a pickaxe
to deploy it so when we came into this
research we thought you know deploying
sensors in a house would be pretty much
as difficult as taking a nap on a couch
and in many ways that's actually true
there's a huge variety of off-the-shelf
sensors you can buy they work turnkey
more or less but it also turned out that
there were a large number of challenges
especially when we got to scale so we
found that the difficulty of these
deployments shown here on the y-axis
increases dramatically as we move along
this x-axis of scale so for example and
there's there are specific thresholds
where it became very difficult shown
here in yellow so for example as we
increase the number of sensors per house
you know small deploying a small number
of sensors is pretty easy but as the
number of sensors grew larger than the
number of power outlets in the house
things got really difficult deploying in
a small number of homes was pretty easy
right just to plug them into the walls
but as the number of homes outgrew the
number of researchers in our group then
it became very difficult and also
deploying for a small number of days was
fairly easy but as the number of days
grew to about more than about a month of
time then things became more difficult
as well and this graph here this little
yellow region the phenomenon that I call
a phase transition where things go from
being fairly easy to all of a sudden
being very hard that phase transition is
kind of one of the things that makes me
a big believer in a lot of things that I
guess you hear about later today and so
this is what I want to talk about I'm
going to go into each one of these three
and
a bit more detail question it turns out
that you had the month well i'm
estimating here there's a lot of there
are a lot of reasons why but one one
thing that that starts to kicking around
a month is is participant fatigue that
actually is true yes that is basically
what happens they'll start to unplug the
sensors for example yeah well it depends
on the study I'm gonna actually I have a
whole slide on that in terms of
participant fatigue what do they have to
do that's a good question because you
can see from the early description i
gave of our short of general vision the
goal is not to have the user participate
at all but in but you know users are
very useful in terms of generating
information and so we'd like to engage
them in these studies if we can and the
question is what can we get them to do
so i'm going to go into that in a few
minutes so let me go into each of these
three and detail number of sensors what
happens when you scale that up number of
homes as you scale that up in the number
of days as a scale at up so a number of
sensors it was the first thing that we
found because we did it in one house and
one of the one of the main challenges we
found was with powering sensors so the
main difference between deploying out in
a mountain top or a volcano or a desert
and deploying in a house is that houses
have one AC power so that makes a lot of
things much easier but but it doesn't
make all of your power problems
disappear and one of the things that we
found to be to be a challenge is that
there are only about 30 or 40 powerless
in a house and we always thought there
was plenty of power pretty much
everywhere but we didn't think about
then counting the number of outlets I
mean one deployment we did you know over
300 sensors we only had 30 or 40 power
outlets that means most by far the vast
majority of our sensors did not have
power they couldn't use power so we're
still in in the paradigm of
battery-powered low-power sensing we
also found that even if we did want to
use these these these receptacles we
often had to run long wires so you don't
have power for example on the middle of
the wall or top of the door or the top
of a window or in the places where you
want to deploy your sensors
in one house we had over 250 feet of
wire just should power 13 sensors
running these running these wires is
very costly of course we also found that
the sensors that we plugged into the
walls ended up having actually 2.3 times
more downtime than the battery sensors
and there are a number of reasons for
this one is what you said earlier people
kicking the sensors over in fact
unplugging them people would unplug the
sensor in order to plug their hair dryer
or their vacuum cleaner or something
else into the wall there would also be
wireless connections if you're running
long wires it's likely to get snagged
it's very hard to conceal wires
perfectly and mobile objects people
moving around or rumbas or things like
that on children animals so even after
in one in this in one deployment even
with expansion adapters we ended up in
one house to put up occupying all of the
free receptacles besides six we left six
for the users not really thinking that
the users would actually need power and
that's earned out to be a big mistake a
lot of those a lot of those sensors
became unplugged so so the fact that we
have 30 to 48 power outlets in a house
doesn't really mean we have free power
everywhere and of course the wire is
also would get unplugged and turns out
that we had more maintenance calls /
plug sensor than we had maintenance call
for battery-powered sensor and the
reason for that is that if you've got a
sensing subsystem and you have one
sensor in that system running out of
batteries you can be pretty sure the
rest are about to run out of batteries
and so you change all the batteries for
all these sensors but the the plugged in
sensors fail independently they're
unplugged in different places for
different reasons and every time one is
unplugged you need to go back and do a
service for only that one sensor there's
no way to prevent the other sensors from
becoming unplugged later on so homes
weren't the power panacea that we
thought they'd be we also found that
they are not the connectivity penisy
that we thought they'd be of course
getting connectivity across mountains or
across fields is very difficult and we
thought a small house you know Wi-Fi
works and houses laptops working houses
we thought connectivity in houses would
be pretty easy it turns out that it is
for laptops on your couch but it's not
so easy when you start taking sensors
and deploying them all over the house
like for example in middle air ducts or
in
metal junction boxes or on masonry walls
and we had one house that had copper
siding so it was basically a Faraday
cage concrete floors so it's separated
every room every floor into it into a
different wireless network so wireless
connectivity and houses was pretty easy
for people but not so easy for sensors
that are placed in obscure places that
weren't weren't great for for wireless
transmission one alternative to wireless
is power line communication so we
thought well if we can't use wireless
well at least youth power line
communication that'll solve all
connectivity problems but power line
communication only works for those
sensors that can be plugged in and I
already explained why it's hard to plug
in most of your sensors and so if you
can't plug it in and can't use power
line the the off-the-shelf power line
modems that you can buy at staples or
work pretty well but often they're more
expensive than the sensors we're trying
to have communicate by several times and
it turns out that studies have shown the
sort of low-cost power line modems that
people use for low power sensing don't
necessarily give you a very high data
rate and they also give you pretty high
latency because of the noise on that
signal so it's very hard to get power
line communication to work too so Holmes
turned out not to be the power of
panacea or the energy powered panacea
that we were talking about and they
start to look a lot more like these
remote sensing environments one of the
benefits of working in-house is that
there's a whole industry the home
automation interview the industry that's
been working on these problems for a
long time and they there's sell lots of
off-the-shelf parts and but it's not
just the number of sensors we have where
the plate number of places we need to
deploy them but also the number of types
of sensors that we have to deploy and we
have to start buying products from lots
of different companies and if this is
just your basic home home monitoring
infrastructure we've got a router
connected to the internet and a real a
machine every time you want to deploy
sensors to do a different task need to
buy a different kind of sensor and each
one of these sensors sensor types comes
with a whole new set of data and
connectivity paths and hardware gateways
and relays and software stacks and so
deploying 10 different networks in one
house is very similar to deploying 10
different sensor networks in 10
environments because they each have
their own
set of independent risks and failures
and so multiplying the number of types
of sensors multiplies your probability
of failure pretty quickly the the
calculus of mean time to failure applies
to sensors in the house just as it does
sensors outside in the remote
environment right small probability of
failure on a small on one sensor
translates to a large probability of
high frequency of failure for the whole
system so that's those are some of the
challenges we found when scaling the
number of sensors up we also found it's
hard to scale the number of homes up and
particular like I said as the number of
homes becomes larger than the number of
researchers because it's easy to flip
deploy in your own home but once you
start deploying in somebody else's home
it's a very different story the
participants in a study make a big
commitment to your study and they might
be willing to say we want you're willing
to have your sensors in our house all
the time but they're probably not
willing to have you in their house all
the time and if you want to go to the
house to fix something or kalestin data
you need to make an appointment even for
just a 10-minute stop and if you stop
for four hours that's now disrupting for
four hours or more you're now disrupting
their meals and their daily schedule and
the number of times you're going to get
a whole day to do a deployment is really
really limited so we went through large
efforts to try to minimize our time in
that in the homes for example we'd go to
the house once scout it out identify
exactly which sensors we needed where
they would go mark that down on a map
what types they are if there are wires
how long are they going to be so we can
cut them and prefab that in the lab if
there are doors we need to measure the
width if there are pipes we need to
figure out how big the opening is to get
to that pipe how far we know how small
of a person we need to get through that
crawlspace basically think of everything
in events manufacture everything in the
lab if we could so pre manufacture pre
label mark all that down on on on some
floor plans that we had drawn out and
finally when I already go back and
deploy and of course we needed to bring
a checklist to make sure we had
everything there including spare parts
spare batteries flashlights garbage bags
vacuum cleaner anything we needed and if
we forgot one thing that cost you an
hour because it dried
out go get it and come back and you only
have what's like four hours so doing
these deployments themselves was very
difficult and maintaining them was very
difficult and so scaling up to a large
number of houses was hard and you can
imagine where I'm going with this this
is one of the reasons why people don't
want to deploy hundreds or thousands or
hundreds of thousands of homes that are
required in some studies you know as a
single researcher and then finally we
found that scaling up the number of days
was hard and so this is one of the
things a couple of questions already
come out on this and I'll explain I'll
explain why one of the things was on
user participation that exhausted itself
pretty quickly I'm so nice in a typical
wireless sensor and deployment we have a
battery and we want to figure out
exactly how what to do with that battery
we can either use it very intensely for
a short period of time or very slowly
for a long period of time and turns out
that we thought our we found our
participants to be very similar they
would do for example on push a button
when they walk into a room they'd do
that for for a couple of let's say a
couple of hours they might wear a
wearable device to track them around
maybe for a couple of days they might
self-report so report on what they've
been doing or where they're located but
they might do that for a couple of weeks
and they might take surveys they might
do that for a couple of months but we
can't get them for example to push a
button every time they walk into a room
for a couple of months question that
would be a very interesting study but
the question is if you pay them do you
do can you recharge this battery so so
we found our users are very much like a
sensor in the sense that they've got a
battery and they've got a finite energy
supply and we can either use that very
quickly or use it slowly over a long
period of time if you pay them do you
increase this I'm not really sure that
would be a really interesting study to
do sorry what was that yeah so the
farther down on that scale we get the
longer we can get users to participate
often the information we needed to
burned out about them we've burned our
batteries after about a month
maintenance is also a problem right if
the sensors are breaking all the time
people have to come in you're exhausting
their their time commitment
your time commitment with them so okay
good question so how does that
distribute with age groups and and
families with kids or not I think if you
have a single experimenter my single
research are living in their own home
then they might have a bigger battery
like bigger lifetime but what we found
is that this this general trend is true
even for researchers and as I found out
myself even if you're a researcher then
you have part you have participants in
your home like spouse or children who
don't necessarily want have the same
incentives that you do so in a lot of
homes you will have a limited limited
let's come with a limited battery no
matter what so I think this work applies
even for even for participants and
especially in the mentioned children and
other kinds of commitments like this you
know one of the reasons why we found
this to be true is because people have
in a house I think participating in a
study like this is much different from
participating in your office right then
house you have life to live and you
can't just stop everything you're doing
in order to participate in a study where
as in an office you can kind of trade
off some of your tasks right if work
anyway so so oops so in addition to user
participation we also found that over
time as time increases aesthetics become
much more important so in our early
studies we had wires and circuit boards
and sort of all over the place and you
can see here exposed circuit boards over
here we've got a light switch with a
little sensor on it and every time you
try to flip the light switch you snag
that wire so this kind of became very
very much of a challenge and our next
generations of work based on feedback
from our participants was to make all
these sensors disappear into the
woodwork so what we found is that is
that the aesthetics of the of the system
is not just not just a superficial
concern it's actually a fundamental
constraint on the lifetime of the system
ugly or unusable systems are not viable
over the long term so it's a threat to
the lifetime of the system are
hour later systems that what we call
disappear into the woodwork so we've got
a sensor here that looks like a regular
light switch we've got these other
sensors that couldn't sort of what we
call disappear into the into the
woodwork of look they look kind of like
a door jamb on the sensor on the door
besides the sensors disappearing so
people didn't see them and the wires
hopefully hiding we also found that it's
important to make sure that our sensors
disappear even after we remove them so
for example duck to you know tape on the
walls will peel your tape if you put
other solutions like putty on the walls
or staples staples the lines of holes
putty doesn't necessarily stay very long
we've had one house with several hundred
sensors where this you know the sensors
because of the temperature rise and fall
the putty would have hardened and then
we'd get sensors falling off every you
know four to six hours somewhere in the
house there be a sense of crashing to
the floor so after the sensors come off
they also need to be aesthetically
aesthetically sufficient and another
problem is LEDs at night so we all know
that LEDs at night you know on your
television or on your alarm clock that's
a that's a problem it's annoying you
know sometimes in a room you might have
a television or a VCR but when you start
to have hundreds of LEDs across your
house it becomes a showstopper it's no
longer just an aesthetic concern so we
estimate that one of our deployments
caused 150 LEDs that would be deployed
in one house and you know at during
deployment at during the day it's
actually not obvious we can't see them
at all but at night the users complained
about being a laser light show or a
circus in the house and turning the
lights off didn't make a difference
because it didn't get any darker so this
turned out to be a big challenge and
these are the things that you know over
overtime of deploying these are the
things that caused major major issues in
our deployments we also found that noise
is a big problem so for example in one
house for reliability recently deployed
at UPS we didn't have a laptop so we
deployed a desktop with a UPS and five
thirty in the morning the power goes out
and of course this thing is beeping
incessantly all of this plugs got pulled
out while they're trying to figure out
how to stop the beeping go back to sleep
then we of course have to make an
appointment to go back and put it all
back together that took several days get
in all the systems back up and running
turns out that our system we actually
lost more data
because of the UPS then we would have if
we had not installed the UPS at all so
like I was trying to say earlier the
aesthetics matter and not just because
they matter to people but because they
matter for the lifetime and the data
integrity of your system yeah okay and
and last over the number of days we
found that hazards in houses start to
become I'm income important as well so
in a remote sensing environment like a
mountaintop you might have extreme
weather or wild animals that that
interfere with your with your deployment
but in a house we also found that there
are a number of unexpected things that
cause your sensors to fail and like I
said that the cap the calculus of mean
time to failure applies here if you have
a small number of things that cause
failures your system is going to fail
pretty frequently so for example
children turn out to be a big problem
this looks like a pretty reliable
well-built sensor when you plug it into
the wall but to a child this kind of
kind of like a toy right it looks like a
space shuttle or something long-term
you'll probably before have before
manufacturing this have built a screw
hole to screw it into the wall we're
screwed into that receptacle we also
found things like mobile objects brooms
would pull the wires out or mobile
vacuum cleaners that would go around
periodically on a weekly basis to unplug
all of our sensors we also have sensors
that were deployed and somewhat carious
ways because it's hard to really affixed
sensors to things in the house they're
not built with sensing in mind and you
can't really rely on teaching the people
who live in the house how did how to use
this right so if you deployed this or if
you lived in this house you could
probably do things without breaking it
turns out that most of the time it was
the guests or the cleaning service or
something else that would cause these
sensors to fail and those are people we
don't have access to for training so
small number of hazards like this would
cost failures on a on a daily sometimes
weekly sometimes daily sometimes
multiple times a day basis so just to
summarize on things I talked about we
found that AC power is it does not mean
we abundant and reliable power in homes
wireless connectivity in houses isn't
as good as we had expected it to be
Cotts devices commercial off-the-shelf
devices our double-edged sword they save
you designed time but they don't
necessarily save you a deployment or
maintenance time houses are kind of like
remote environments especially when you
don't own them or know people who or
live in them yourself user participation
is limited we can't rely on the users to
be the sensors in the long term the
aesthetics are important they're
actually vital to the to the survival of
the of the deployment and we have a
bunch of environmental hazards in a
house so things that we thought we
wouldn't see outside of the remote
forest and mountain tops so these are
some of the things that we found to be
challenges in homes and this is
basically what's made me a like i said
earlier a believer in the lab of thing
something that would allow me to deploy
a small number of deployments and also
maybe share deployments with somebody
else who's doing similar things in order
to multiply our our benefits from our
efforts so I just want to thank many of
the students and other researchers who
participated in this work and I'll take
questions can you take the microphone
please yeah so it looks like part of the
reason you have such challenges is
because of the sheer number of sensors
in the home have you looked at trying to
create or define a minimal set of
sensors for a particular application
that might somewhat simplify things yes
we have looked at in minimal set and
part of the sensing that we've done is
is actually what i call exploratory
sensing so taking lots of sensors and
deploying them in different places at
the same time and then analyzing them
post facto it to find out which subsets
are essential and that's actually how we
ended up coming up with a doorway sensor
that has all these things integrated but
it took several hundred sensors in many
homes come to that point in the first
place and I think that study of course
isn't conclusive as people start to try
to find other things out of the house
they're going to need to do the same
kind of exploratory studies so I have a
question about so you're trying to
minimize the number of sensors
but as you've pointed out when you start
putting these technologies into people's
homes there's a lot of issues around how
they affect the living experience and
what we found out in the two homes that
we worked with is that now we have to
consider adding additional sensors to be
able to mitigate the impact of the
technology so light sensors that mean
that we adapt the displays to the
appropriate level of lumens in the room
that they that they go off when there
are things that when they go off and
they should be off word things that
change according to proximity and I'm
wondering if you've thought about how
these integrate into the larger pictures
so that you kind of get this optimal set
of what's the data that we need to be
able to find out what people are doing
in the house and then what's the sensing
information that we need to be able to
do to minimize the intrusion of the data
collecting apparatus that we've got in
the first place so who pleases the
police that's an interesting question
and we haven't really thought about that
that's an interesting question it would
be the last question please yeah I
understand that you started with the
kind of technical issues so and actually
all of the problems that you you listed
our technical problems but what's the
benefit for the user I mean what are you
waiting from this platform for the from
the user point of view that would be a
whole nother talk so I could go in to
the first couple slides that I gave just
to give some context of why we're doing
this and I could give you another hour
on that but I want the other it's not
very clear the kind of new experience I
can leave as a user in such a house why
would a user want an instrumented how
instruments at home is that question
well you can get feedback about what
you're doing you could give people
feedback about their energy usage their
medical their their health status or
potentially help you know mitigate
shared resources in a home like a car or
coordinate dinners there I think there
are a lot of reasons why people would
want sensor data in the house and less
pushin see some a European I would like
to know if the NSC will know what I'm
doing it myself
if you would know Oh unity and shaky NEC
okay it's a good question privacy is a
big big concern for this kind of system
and I think it would be for anybody
who's doing you know sensing at homes
and you know what our data is not going
to the NSA yet they haven't subpoenaed
us yet so if this were deployed in a
commercial product is that a question I
think the the goal would be to not send
a data out of the house and to leave it
all in the house so there's something
like a central control unit the class
the data processes it actuates if it
needs to discard the rest of the data
that's not necessary I think there are
you know could be it could be secured
there are still of course privacy
attacks and we've done some work on you
know inferring what people are doing
just from encrypted data that's flying
around the house so it's a big it's a
big problem and I think some that's a
big aspect of the kinds of stuff that
we're trying to do i this is up for
debate but some would argue that that's
not going to stop the technology I'm not
qualified to answer that question but I
do think it's an important concern and
you know hopefully all of us are looking
at that thank you very much coming
