warren a friendly guide for managers and
a friendly guide and manager for
freelancers
hi good afternoon my name is ja this is
we roam FY and pay you and we're for
creative technologies from NYU ITP and
this is Warren Warren it's a friendly
guiding manager for freelancers but
before I tell you more about Warren I
want to tell you a little bit more about
us so Leah and I just recently graduated
from ITP before graduation we talked to
a lot of a lot of our classmates and a
lot of people are talking about what
we're what we're going to do next and
this kept on coming up freelance as both
the goal and as necessity so as creative
young people we really crave freedom and
control over our own work and at the
same time a lot of traditional full-time
jobs have become independent contract
work anyway we're not alone four million
people graduate every year more and more
becoming freelancers joining 53 million
freelancers in this country that's a
third of the workforce and by the year
twenty twenty forty percent would become
freelancers yeah a lot of students are
not prepared for what entails to be a
freelancer these are some of the common
words that comes up a lot what did they
actually like to be a freelancer the
best thing is you get to set your own
schedule you get to choose who you work
for and what you work on but the worst
thing is you can often feel like you're
totally alone with no one to guide you
you might you might have basic questions
like how much you charge your clients
and just not being sure about a lot of
things there are tons of software out
there for two dues project management or
for invoicing here are four tools that
some more experienced freelancers are
already using but many freelancers
actually don't use any management
software that's because none of these
software alone addresses the challenges
that you need to young freelancers they
don't provide guidance and they don't
provide emotional support which a
conversational user interface can
actually come in handy now let's in
let's bring back our warrant our
solution Warren is the guide and manager
for young freelancers he is able to
interact with
freelancers via SMS email and facebook
Messenger he's personalized for each
individual freelancer he provides
guidance answers questions and thus
management within platforms freelancers
are already using he aims to make the
business side of freelancing simple and
maybe even a little bit fun but
providing a conversation or user
interface approach to this application
and there are three components in war on
the managers core software that includes
managing and scheduling client
communications as well as keeping track
of expenses and invoices the guide helps
the freelancers through in the entire
workflow answers personalized questions
and provide project tips and suggestions
and also Warren provides daily
inspiration support for freelancers to
help motivate them the more freelancers
talk to Warren the battery warren
becomes as you gathers more and more
information one gets to know the
freelancers like where they are based
how much experience they've had their
work style and personality as well as
their rates and one draws knowledge from
existing sources train them into playful
conversations if the existing sources
don't exist it will be handled by a
human agent and now let's see it in
action
you
is also interested in knowing the start
date and also the end date and last but
not least the rate of the project as we
can see judges replies and here's what
Warren needs to note and a week later
let's see what happens
all right after the social coup de
morais it was actually behind the world
then it's a whole system diagram of the
warden looks like in the front end
Warren has ability to transfer same
content into different format in order
to have the ability to conversation with
users into deep in the press platforms
and after the natural language
understanding process Warren will get
understand what the actual user want and
it extract some answers from our
existing sauce if just no existing
answers our human agency will come up to
answer the question and such a which
parts were added to the library and
Warren also has ability to help the user
to manage it at home and doing schedule
time scheduling work by directly taking
usage of the soda party aap is and this
is there are also integrations we
already implemented we want you warrant
who has ability to have a user to manage
their email and SMS so that we use the
poster marker facebook Messenger and
trivial and in the back end we use a
Google Calendar to manage a time Thrax
father for our human agency to answer
perching online and we really hope to
use increasingly in future and you know
design process we started with general
idea of who leases for and nail down our
target user based on interviews we had
initially planned to focus on financial
management and interview the CPA from as
an emperor you have asked a lot of
insight into how young people manually
of finance and work and we also the long
interviews with students who plan to
freelance independent artists and
experience real answers in different
disciplines relentless different people
have different kind of challenges and
questions but they all share the same
common workflow so we started
diagramming their workflow starting from
top of relenza most often get landfill
email records and then they get to know
each other negotiator
then they finalized laughs relationship
with a signed agreement once I start
walking let manager layer expenses and
invoices finally they schedule a debrief
so what are our next steps we have a
working prototype where user testing
right now and based on that iterating
the products as well as the tone of
Warren and plan to beta launch with
limited users so we're part of our camp
and we're inspired about cam it started
by beta works it's a top VC firm and
based out of New York City we were told
by an experienced typographer that a
gray independent talent must be great at
the art of business so we want to help
all freelancers do what they love while
conquering the art of business thank you
so I mean I it wasn't abundantly clear
until somebody said we'd already
finished integrating it into a list of
forms that this is real yeah so I mean
and then you finished obviously by
saying you're approaching beta and all
of that but so maybe you could give me
some sense of sort of the limitations of
where you're at in terms of what are the
challenges you've had getting to this
point what's the roadblock now from a
technology point of view I mean it's
it's amazing that you're this far along
this your head and shoulders above
everybody else in terms of getting this
to be a real thing and I'm sort of
curious where your way your block now so
that maybe you could ask so one of the
block well first from the design
perspective there's a blog of figuring
out exactly what is the workflow that
can be personalized for each person and
based on what kind of work they do for
instance a photographer works very
differently like their work scope is
very different from an illustrator so
figuring out how to generalize that and
tweaking the prototype is one challenge
in terms of technology there are
actually a lot of free tools work for
like doing a now you and Microsoft
provides a lot of tools as well like the
bot framework and so using some of the
existing platforms out there we were
able to prototype fairly quickly and in
terms of actually scaling up I think
that's something that we can worry about
once people actually do you like it or
use it yeah congratulations on like
building something and going so far with
it i will say like one of the things
that immediately jumped out to me is
that this use case for chat bots
actually makes a ton of sense insofar as
like there really is an interaction
problem with all of these different
tools that you use to manage workflow
and you sort of is if when you get put
into the freelance life you have to
manage all these different inputs
basically so i actually see the use case
that are being really compelling and
this is like an
since where you can actually take a lot
of complexity out of the system by just
creating one natural interface for all
these different things the thing that I
wonder about further down the line
though is that chat BOTS tend to be a
little bit restrictive in terms of how
they view the flow of information right
they're not yet able to handle something
handle a process that's messy or
different every time it very much has to
draw you through like this flow of life
you do ABC then d right and then the
question then is like for a user as a
human user who's process may or may not
fit into that flow every time like what
I do think could actually keep you
interacting with this thing is actually
if it handles a lot of stuff that you
would just rather never have it a handle
like integrations with doing your taxes
things like that and so like to me
that's like where the rubber meets the
road in terms of real use cases like
whether or not you can actually dissolve
a lot of that complexity further down
the line that will make me willing to
adjust my workflow to the to the
limitations of the chat bot yeah I um I
have a Warren named Jane and she's based
in New York right now and I'm in
Portland and our interaction is very
similar to what you described there and
I love that I mean for me Jane you know
like a lot of creative people I really
hate dealing with money and Jane like
Warren is sort of um I think the the
warmth and the you know lack of judgment
and them and the support our there's
such important features for this I
commend you for sort of making that a
top priority and then all sorts of
questions I'd be happy by the way to
share my Jane experiences if you can't
eat any more input for Warren interested
in you know yeah is it connected to your
bank account will it take out what you
need for taxes and all that's a
so it seems like something you know many
of us could take advantage of and
congratulations uh two quick questions
then one is sort of what did you reach
fusion like um when did you start using
Warren yourself and have you and if so
what does Warren tell you about how to
monetize this so the first question was
the idea really came up because of this
anxiety that crept over a lot of us I
think when since we were last semester
in grad school and trying to figure out
you know next up and we want to be
independent and I had done a lot of
freelancing myself before and this was a
big pain point and just thinking about
that and talking to a classmate who said
how her friend hates spreadsheets just
like oh she can't do all this stuff
because she hates spreadsheet and that
got me really nervous and I started a
panic attack because I hated spreadsheet
to and so I was like if only this thing
is this and I can just you know let it
handle that for me so that was I would
definitely use one that's answering
given where you said you were the
project I would have the impression that
you would actually be using it now to
manage your the project itself the
bootstrap and I'm just curious are you
doing that no I'm not doing that right
now yeah it's not is not ready for the
whole workflow right now but we're
testing with people and part of it is
using me and somebody else who are
acting as human agents in the back end
to really figuring out like you said
like how do customize the design for
their workflow so if i use it will be me
and pasion question and me yeah
answering yeah and then the second
question was more efficient oh I think
that's a really good question yes so I
guess that would be what I'll figure out
in ba camp it's 10 weeks so hopefully by
the end I'll have an answer to that
question
