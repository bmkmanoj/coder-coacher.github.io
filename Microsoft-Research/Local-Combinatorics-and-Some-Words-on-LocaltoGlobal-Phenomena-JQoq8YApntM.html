you
we're delighted to have Natalie Niall
from the Hebrew University thank you
okay hey I think there's enough of you
who've helped me preach in the past so
as always feel free if you have any
questions comments anything don't wait
at the end just okay so where it's silly
subject that I'm very excited about and
the subject that attached to pound some
times in the past and I'm coming back to
because they there are lots of new
discoveries that are relevant and there
is a quite a bit that tells me that the
subject is in fact say even more
significant than I'd realized before so
I think it's worthwhile coming back to
it so I want to start from a question
that when even in Microsoft I can say
this is is a frail practical importance
great particle importance a which is a
then that's that's a good spot to start
this a hell to read large glass
so I on this issue I don't have that
much to offer except to explain to you
what the problem is and why it's so
important and so on and so forth but it
will serve as I think and it is a major
source of motivation for the things that
I will tell you later so I the area of
science in which I see this on a regular
basis is by informatics which is
something that they do but it's it's an
extremely general question of relevance
to anything in machine learning in fact
a I would even dare to say that this is
should be a next step in in areas such
as statistics and machine learning and
so on and so forth so let me start from
from the concrete lots of data so i will
stick with with bioinformatics just
because it's subject I know something
about but such such examples are all
over the place in any areas you know big
data is of course the popular buzzword
these days but in so to stick with with
the two bioinformatics for example when
you collect data about in large-scale
biological experiments one of the things
that you find out is something which can
be described in terms of what's called
the protein-protein interaction
so what is it a there is some organism
with which you you're dealing you don't
need to know anything about anything
significant about biology to to know
that proteins are the little machines
that do anything in any living organism
and these molecules can be in
interaction I mean this is really how
things take place but not there it's
it's limited so you can create a graph
in which the vertices are the proteins
of the organism in question just to give
you a scale it really so how many
proteins are there let's say in our body
it's it's a matter of there are
different ways to count it which which
makes sense but it any number between I
don't know 20,000 and a quarter million
would would make sense according to so
that's the the scale of the graph it has
edges and there it is so of course this
is a very meaningful source of
information this big graph but how do
you read it I mean what maybe what is it
that you want to look at in a graph like
me so for example I give you this
graphic of a human or this graph of a
right or of abid opsys whatever any any
of the model organism that how do you
compare between them how how do you tell
anything so this is really a major
question and and I must say for the best
to the best of my knowledge this is
there is really no good answer for this
at the moment so it's a major question
and as you'll see it motivates much of
what they do today I'll tell you today
so a what what do people do a some of
the time so had a heated argument with
my wife we become this morning who's a
biologist and those of those of you who
know me better can understand how
critical I was about stuff that people
do in this area and she defended her way
terrain her colleagues so
either agree okay so some of these
people perhaps do things which are not
completely stupid but so for example
that we start on the positive side in
biology in systems biology Zyzz is the
field in which they so what they do is
they they would for example introduce
some modification so perhaps feed the
organism something different oh it cause
a mutation or whatever and redraw the
graph and understand what the
differences are that that's that's very
meaningful for their purposes so that's
one thing but on a general level people
usually count degrees of the vertices in
yr degree is being accounted for well as
far as I can tell for me one good reason
that it's easy let's Dion but it really
provides very little information so how
do you so this is a major major problem
and what I want to to tell you is is a
some background a 44 the following
approach which says count small circles
so I'm not claiming that this is a not
even close to an alternate a answer to
this question at least it's a meaningful
and and possibly useful a please partial
answer to this but I before I go to this
and I explain where this is coming and
first of all I have to say again in
defense of biologists system biologists
that this is something that biologists
do carry out to some extent that you'll
see this idea in by informatics papers
but even what to do with these numbers
even that is not so so clear but let's
back up and again stay with this
extremely important question and ask
ourselves you know really what should be
done about me so
my I mean I think the good place to
start is really what the statistics dude
really let's let's go back to ancient
history with the field just started so
you're flooded with some large number of
with lots of numbers and what do you do
okay that we already know all of us know
what to do with this right a bit perhaps
you'll see that the numbers come in
clusters perhaps you'll recognize that
it looks like a distribution that you
know and okay perhaps no you are now
able to estimate good estimates for the
defining parameters of the design and so
on and so forth and I can imagine
something like this in this context as
well so a possible general approach
would be a come up so in analogy with
what I just come up with a family
hopefully not too big of generative
models can people still this year old
today you're still awake generative
models of gloves
and recover so somehow it's it's strange
for us too I mean we have I mean if you
understand if you really understand the
bottom port a new direction for human
you've really made huge progress in
biology we don't just don't understand
exactly what what this means but for
example one thing you could say okay let
me come up with with some simple models
this is like the standard distributions
that the other in analogy with the
standard distributions that we consider
in probability in statistics and then
let me find out what what the defining
parameters are for this graph so that's
an approach now I want to mostly
concentrate when they so a good reason
to look at you into these problems and
one of my main motivation for coming
back to discussion is this theory a pro
large extent developed a regional Hill
mostly by lab syllabus and coworkers
anyone here please women who I don't
think so birthday so he has I should
have brought it down a he has a
beautiful book on large networks
and gough limits which to a large extent
tells you to some extent tells you that
if you understand the count of small sub
graphs in a big graph it really puts you
a I mean it really carries you some some
way along what I wrote you that it
really tells you a if the graph comes
form from is is a sample from a big
distribution of gloves then gives you a
good hint of what what this a limit
distribution is so just to I I don't
want to even I mean I certainly don't
have time to develop this whole thing
and it takes many hours to easily this
is already by now a subject for easily a
one-semester cross I'll I'm not going to
try this but if you never saw this
nothing just give you one very important
theorem from even though I want even
formulate it precisely but i'll just
give you a hint on on what this main
theorem is main theorem in this area a
you would like somehow everything that
we do here today is asymptotic in nature
we only speak about very large gloves
they have a sequence of graphs and you'd
like to have a notion of what it means
for the sequence of graphs to tend to
limit now as you all know if you have a
metric then it's possible to speak about
limits if there is a metric on whatever
object because then at least you can
speak about Cauchy sequences and then
pets understand more water alone so how
do you need a metric among gloves how do
you compare gloves well it's easier to
think of a graph is is just a symmetric
01 nitric so if you want a mapping in 20
mind of the integers think of this is
black and white dots are mapping in 20
and so instead let's let's explain what
is what is the metric between two
functions symmetric functions from 0 1
into 0 1 when I allow you to rearrange
in a symmetric fashion apply measure
preserving map on the unit interval and
then I take these two functions when I
take their l1 difference something like
me so this there is a good notion of of
distance among graphs and so the theorem
says that a sequence and this is called
the square will cut metric so a sequence
of gloves
has a limit in this sense if and only if
for every fixed graph H GN e the
frequency at which H is found in GN
tensor limit so you have two notions of
limit limits here and the theorem tells
us that they coincide one notion comes
from this way of comparing or measuring
distance we want graphs in the other
comes from this concept of counting
small circles so you fix a glove age and
you ask how often do I find this graph H
in GA ok I'll be more accurate with the
details a bit later and if this tends to
limit for every graph H then this it
makes sense to to say that the sequence
it goes to limit the two concepts
coincide ok these two notions of so in
particular that the what I'm trying to
read out of this in the call in the
context of this very general question is
that if you understand the frequency at
which you you see small sub graphs in a
big round then this tells you what the
limit object is there is a lot of
additional stuff and go phones and
whatnot it's it's a as I say there by
now already a big theory but that's at
least a good motivation for way ok let
me say two more things about what they
said at this very general layer context
a first of all this is also very closely
related but I will not develop these say
this local approach so the notion of
local which appears in my title is
exactly this and I'll
so much more about so a property testing
for those who know what they are is very
closely related that's another way to
understand or to view the local
structure of big graphs a is related e
we are also also going to talk about the
other combinatorial structures not just
I will mostly focus on on graphs but we
will also see just briefly at least two
other types one is tournaments a
tournament is just an orientation of the
complete graph and again you can look at
small subsets and ask how often do I see
everything that they see and i will also
speak about permutations any general any
any large community object that you can
think of you can also associate with it
lokan theory so I have to explain I what
is the local structure of a permutation
so application think of the permutation
is in SN is the numbers from 1 to n
written in some open and then let's say
I want to understand the five profile of
this that's an expression i will
introduce in a minute so i'm looking at
some five locations here i see here a
five top it has in order there is an
older this is bigger than that and
smaller than that and so on so it gives
you a permutation induces a permutation
on five element so unless five so this
is also have a local profile so so let's
say so this is one comment the other
thing is there is more to local in the
sense of looking at neighborhoods
that's also very interesting but i'm not
going to to get into into this at all
you could also ask instead of saying i'm
looking at let's say five element sets
or something like this i'm looking at
the vertex and i'm looking at what the
five neighborhood of that vertex look
like that's also very interesting but
i'm not getting into that at all a those
of you who helped me ask a question
about about the earth in lunch that
question can be when belongs very
naturally in into into this area okay so
so what do we do we are going to have a
large graph we are going to look at it
so most of the time as I said I would
speak about graphs we're going to look
at K element subsets so this is called
the K profile of a graph so G is a large
graph k is an integer the K profile of G
is this you're looking at all the K
element subsets of purposes each element
subset spends a cave vertex graph so
this induces a distribution on kvar
exams this distribution is the capo file
of G ok good a in what do we want to to
to look it a there is a whole array a
not too many but there are several
possible behaviors are all key
properties of the of the profile that we
so let inside line let me already start
with one very concrete and very
difficult question we about which we
know still very very little and I will
try to tell you a few of the things that
we know that so here is what i view as a
very basic question what are possible k
profiles
just very concrete question so let me be
even more concrete just to bring home to
you the notion that these are very basic
questions and at the moment we
understand them very very poorly let's
start with k equals 3 okay just get
coulis fig so what are possible graphs
on three vertices there is this is this
and there is this and let's say I call
this probability p0 p1 p2 and p3 so if
this is G then so this is P of G this
whole vector is pitching and I'm not
interested in what happens with small
graphs I'm only interesting in the
asymptotic so in particular I'd like to
understand this set this
four-dimensional set which consists of
all the excess in alpha such that for
every positive epsilon and every large
end there exists an end vertex G such
that P of G minus X is less Annette so
then don't let this confuse you
basically which pho topples am i
interested in those which are realizable
almost into realizable I'm error
allowing an epsilon L by arbitrarily
large curves so think about it this is a
four dimensional set in fact it only
three dimensional because of course the
coordinates are more negative in sum to
1 what is this set I mean are we able to
describe it the answer is no we are
still unable to describe even this this
very simple this first case of the
general public will tell you a few
things that that we know about this e
and s as I try to impress on on you a
while this is still I mean it's
conceivable that this is you know if we
really wanted anyone who's interested in
this would now be working on this
problem and would like to understand
this set the case of K equals 3 perhaps
is manageable but when you go up to k
equals for the situation at the moment
is is really bad we really don't
understand the thing at all so let me
try and day is why you
no more awake enough in my i'll try to
make it quick let's see can we do this
ok a
okay so now let me try and give you an
impression on E so here is a very
well-known and old fact good man's
inequality from 64 says that p0 plus p3
is at least a quarter so let me just be
accurate about this I actually should be
writing minus little oh fun but because
I'm dealing with this I'm suppressing
such terms now let it let me prove this
to you so at least we will prove
something it's really very easy and
instead of speaking about p0 and p3 let
me instead think of any spare instead of
speaking about graph what I do is I I
color the complete graph on n vertices
the edges I carlin blue and red ok
instead of edges and non edges and and
so first of all before we prove this
let's see that this makes sense if i do
the coloring at random or if i take a GN
one-half graph the chance for this is a
nice the chance for this is an eight so
pleased to have equality here and how do
you prove this it's really very easy so
let's sum this expression and the one
hand this is maximized of course these
two numbers add two and minus 1 so this
is less than n times n minus 1 squared
over 4 which would be the case if each
one of those is n minus 1 over 2 on the
other hand I I can work yeah yeah sorry
yeah
guess correctly a and but there is
another way to interpret this you see
let's instead now throw things like this
can indicate color you see every
triangle like this contributes 02 these
every triangle like this could rib ute
to to these so this is 2 times n choose
three times p1 plus p2 and now we just
move things we know it's it's just high
school algebra and in you and you get
this conclusion okay very good so way
this nice observation of this fact has
been known as you see for almost 50
years so what about if you will go up to
24 Bell pieces okay let's ask the same
question for four vertices and let's see
what we know that will give you an
indication of what the situation is with
okay so way for want of a better name
let me call them q 0 and Q six so this
is the probability that I get for
voltage has with no edges and this is
the probability that I get all six of
course there is more than 70 in fact 11
different they so often graphical
classes for graphs info box so in view
of what we saw here and the fact that
equality had exactly in GN 1 half this
made a dash conjecture let Q 0 plus q 6
is at least 1 in 32 let's just go with
the calculation engine one half the
probability of this is one in 64 1 in 64
point this is not 0 it was refuted by
Andrew Tolleson
and there is a so he wrote about this
more than one paper and there is also a
red alert students also found
counter-examples and the point is so one
of the one of the main these
observations that really motivate my my
work on this is the fact look in any
mathematical field your understanding
depends very much on examples that we
know there are really very very few
examples that that we know have been
concrete classes of graphs that we
understand there is so the answer is
smaller than this eh not much smaller
one in 33 or so but no one has any guess
on where the minimum is so what is this
a hiding i will tell you later about
more about what's known here and a one
reason why this is more you know then I
side anecdotes oh okay there was this
question the conjecture the natural
conjecture is not true is that think of
very fundamental questions like a
Ramsay's theorem the quantitative ramsey
spirit so you know I'll KL is the
listing to j subject if i take the
complete gopher on this number of
vertices and I color everything blue and
red and either I get a blue k click or
read and click and what do we know about
these numbers so let's speak mostly
about our and end the asymptotics here
is something like fall to the end and
here it's
root 2 to the N so it's a 4th power and
the lower bound the best lower bound
that we know for Ramsey numbers comes
from Jim one-half and to me this
suggests that perhaps this is not the
right place to look for the solution
that there are graphs which have better
behavior in this respect that the nandam
graphs so this suggests to me that there
is a really new continent to discover
there is a whole class of the in fact at
the moment no one even has a guess of
where this is I mean granted the
difference here is not so big it's
really okay so we know now lower bounds
I forget perhaps one in thirty-four
something release the gap is not so big
but the point is no one even has a
complete gasps own where the what what
the optimal construction is so we we
know so it's like the you know the
famous story about the elephant there is
an elephant in the room we've touched it
somewhere but we don't understand you
know what shape it is what size it is
where it goes and so on so this is an
indication that there is an elephant to
to discover it by the way well what what
is the situation about timing how when
should I for what okay good so we're
okay so let me then a try and give you
one more indication on how poorly we
understand these things and what other
continents there are to discover so here
is a very interesting and basic notion
thats related to all of this and this is
invisibility so what's so we're fixing a
golf edge and this is
the largest frequency with which we can
find an induced age from a little sloppy
here with my definition but I think you
understand so you take a lot you fix a
nature take a large graph and you want
the probability let's say that h is the
case that looks rough I want graph a big
graph in which they I have the highest
probability that if i pick cave out this
is what they see is an H okay and there
are certain there are certain graphs for
which we know this but mostly we don't
so here is a nice example I don't know
how much I will be able to cover the
details of this but let's say H is a c5
okay and get you doing something what's
which graph has the most induced c5's
among all big gloves what would you do
what would you guess
blow up of a/c fun okay excellent first
guess still no final so that's a blow-up
of c-5 just to those who don't know the
terminology so you take you replace each
vertex of a c5 by an independent set of
size n and you connect with the complete
by paragraph how likely are you to find
the AC five-year well a you'll find it
precisely if all the five vertices each
vertex falls in a different block which
means that the probability is five
factorial over five to the five which is
24 over 625 well anyone willing to raise
the bets anything better than this it's
a good start i mean the solution is not
so far off what can you do to improve it
even locally
what if they all fall in the same block
now we are getting nothing for this so
just three kills Raquel silicas you just
do the same thing and if and if you do
this you get 1 over 26 so the
invisibility of c-5 is at least one okay
what do we know so I forget the exact
number but this is what we know the
moment hey so hey I don't know how much
time i will have to to tell you about
this let me only say two words to
explain this this comes from flag
eligibles so if you know what these are
then you know if not i hope to be able
to say something this is a beautiful
method that was bob has invented a few
years ago it's a it's has a theory and
and finally you go to the computer and
compute you have to solve some large
growing and growing a semi definite
programs at some point of course they
machine gives up and this is a what the
solution that's the best we're able to
do so so the barrier hill is just a
computational power of foam machine and
sometimes in situations like these
people have managed to be clever enough
in throw away the dead part and actually
fat in short you know it's
mathematicians we don't know the answers
human beings of course we know the
answer that's the answer okay so perhaps
it's not perfectly satisfying but a but
let me show you the following
embarrassing thing what is the
invisibility of this
no one has a goose in terms of numbers
the numbers are not so the upper and the
lower body remember what they are it's
also important for the moment the upper
and the lower bound are not so different
from each other but no one has a guess
again so for me that's that's a close
cousin of these things so it's a game
and indication that there is a whole
family of graphs that should be very
interesting this sounds like a fairly
basic property of a girl you know you
want that's by the way self
complimentary so the complement of this
is the same graph how how can you gain
in induced copies of this guy no one has
a clue okay so somehow I thought ahead
botana prepared modest Patel for a whole
semester calls so I I I knew I was not
going to cover everything hey so let me
see what would I tell you on what will I
skip a ok now let me say a few words ok
there are few important ideas that they
still want to to get through so in terms
of this local structure of God first of
all this whole thing is very closely
related to vary
highly developed part of communal XML
graph theory next to the graph theory a
you mostly asked questions such as a
graph is such and such density with so
many edges it doesn't have to contain
this in this glove so I think you
presumably all know to one's theorem
which says that if the density of G is
bigger than our minus two over r minus 1
then G contains a que out ok then the
first example e is this the complete
bipartite graph with two equal sides
doesn't have a try doesn't contain a
triangle and that's the graphs with the
highest density which doesn't contain
which doesn't contain a triangle you
want one that doesn't contain k4 take
three equal parts and that has the
highest density and so a this local
theory of of graphs this kind of stuff a
contains I mean this is a huge extension
off of this basic question because here
we're only counting density and here we
want to understand the full view so it
is of course a lot of material in in
extremal graph theory that's highly
relevant but this really takes a much
broader view of a graph theory from
extremer perspective and day let me let
me say worried about flag algebra and so
on so this is of course a very basic
very basic theorem of graph theory in
this say has led to two various
questions one for example if you know
the Saudis then this is still a famous
one of the most famous open problems in
in computers to ann's problem
for three graphs so question what is the
highest so it's the analog of this
theorem a what is the highest density of
a three uniform hi progga so collection
of triples that does not contain
okay for three so it doesn't contain
four vertices in order for two percent
that's fine that that has been open for
many years there is a there is a
concrete conjecture which I would not
say but that has been open for many many
years one of the most famous problems in
and we fell in order to attack this
question attack another question in this
area so here in particular that was
already known to two-month also intelius
a predecessor of trans theorem says that
a graph I'm just repeating what I wrote
here a graph with density bigger than
one-half contains a triangle and the
bound is tight so the question that
remained here is a if the density of G
is G bigger than one-half what how small
can p 3 be so what's the smallest
density of China so in order to attack
these two questions it was both invented
his theory of Fay of flag algebras which
I will not say have time to explain to
you conceptually it's it's quite simple
but very powerful and I already
explained a little bit about how you
work with it eventually you have to
solve some going and going semi definite
programs and with this he was able to
completely this was completely resolved
by res bow of using flag algebras in
here he he made the most progress but
this is still hope
so that's a very powerful tool that we
are able to use in this whole area but
as I said still many many things they
remain open so what I'd like to do in
the last day part of my well haven't
gotten even to tell you anything about
our results but nevermind that's not so
important a let me let me let me say a
little about local to global okay so I
think having given you the impression
that the local theory of a of
combinatorial objects is how deep
interesting II what's perhaps even more
exciting is the local to global feeling
so my main question so far has been what
does the K profile of large graph look
like what can we say about this and as I
said with K equals free well there is
perhaps still hope I didn't tell you
some sort of the theorems that we were
able to pull but we were making progress
therefore seems at the moment getting a
full description of the four events she
seems in the moment completely out of
reach but then there is another kind of
theory that you could ask yourself so
let's suppose I'm telling you the capo
file of a growth what you can you
conclude globally so here there is a
beautiful conjecture by Elder shanghai
now
okay so let me start with the definition
there are several general properties
that you can consider an interesting
about about profiles
okay there is a 11 class which is very
interesting and again worthy of separate
lecture which is quazy when an object
can share properties with with a random
graph and there is a very beautiful
theory a bubbly scene graphs and so on
in permutations a place they should
mention the name of chunk and will so
who developed such a theory for graphs
and then more recent work on parameters
and so on so that is something that we
have a fairly decent understanding of
there is another property of generosity
which is much weaker which is
universality come universality you say
that G is a universal if it has a full
Cape offered so everything is there so
that's another very interesting property
to to consider and this is what the
other channel conjecture is fixable and
it's really an amazing conjecture e so
here here it is for every age fixed rate
there exists an epsilon positive such
rate if G is an end vertex cough so n is
large
and its independence number so the
largest independent set and its clique
number or less then enter the epsilon
sorry I'm drunk that is H free then
alpha of G and Omega of G are bigger
than n to the action so let's let's look
at this and understand so this is a
graph which is not universal it's some
level if you're looking at their local
profile there is something missing there
is no H induced right H framing doesn't
contain an induced copy of which now in
general I mentioned to you before the
Ramsey theorem if you reverse the way
that I told you before then every graph
on n vertices has either a clique of
size log n or an aunty clique of size no
game and the boundary start it's
attained in a random graph if you only
emit this one object there is no H in it
then the numbers jump from the very
ethnic 222 polynomial to functional poll
a in fact in their paper
they prove exponential in root log n so
that is known but then to Apollo is open
e the first case which is unknown is a H
equals C 5 we don't know this this how
to pull this over filters for 4c fun and
just to give you a sense of faith they
said that I would mention tournament
circulation mentioned them once
so alone parking so mushy proved the
tediz hang on for graphs is equivalent
to elder shinin for two lines requires
some some exploration so what it means
for a tournament to miss something you
understand let's say we're dealing with
the seven profile so there is some
tournament on seven vertices which you
cannot find any will what replaces this
the analog of this is the largest
transitive sub tournament
so every that's very easy every n vertex
tournament if you never saw this then
that's a good exercise why do shallow
something every end vertex tournament
has a transitive sad tournament
on at least log base two of n vertices
the bound is tied up to a constant here
okay so these two theorems these two
statements are equivalent and they're
both open and let me just stay to give
you pets and finish with that a let me
tell you at least I will mention one
small thing that we did
it's a different way of of stating the
other channel conjecture that's a
restatement of the container which is
nothing I'm just manipulating simple
things it says for every K he exists an
epsilon positive such that a if alpha of
G and Omega of G the bigger the length
of the epsilon smaller than M for the
epsilon sorry then G is a universal so
we're wondering if there is a right this
is something of the sort that you you
know it's it's a weak version of what
you expect to see in a random graph ok
and so we were wondering if there is
anything like this instead of saying
that there are no large clicks and no
large article experts if the counts of
smooth so here is a very simple thing
which I mean it's just it's simple in
the sense that it's just work there are
no really any ideas necessary so
composition that approved with other
Morgenstern
so coming back to to the triple
statistics if b 0 and p 3 less than
point 15 done then G is for universal
the bound is tight for example and we
know that this does not imply 5
universality we don't know whether it
implies for universality and this is a
new type of question that's very recent
a in this area so let me just say so why
let me just say one more thing about why
I finally say conjecture so so exciting
II really lots of things in particular
think of it's not the right time to do
this at the last minutes of a talk but
you know think about what we know in
physics in physics all we know is really
all we have to start with this is his
local information right how particles
interact and we'd like to conclude for
it a big picture of the big view of the
in this I think I did this is why I find
this a conjecture so so exciting that
all we are saying is that if you look at
the repertoire of the small size sub
graphs of this big of this has this huge
effect on the overall structure of the
graph and with this i will stop
which in the province
so
I'm living
one hundred and fifty dollars it was won
a few months ago which my understanding
has been found to be I don't think it
was so big so perhaps if you knew how
long do you remember the name of I ok so
there was I am aware of a paper form a
few months ago which claimed to with
movies and I I didn't read it but I
checked with you know one person that he
the author thanked was this guy janusz
park so I checked with John ocean so my
understanding is that question is still
quite solidly open</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
