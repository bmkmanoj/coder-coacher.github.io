you
my name is Daniel and I listen I lived
it a science group elance odesk in so
like let me start by I was listening the
conversation before and so hate the word
crowdsourcing at a little and so this
because it's it's not because so like
the magnet departments like doesn't like
its negative connotations more because
we think it's not where the future for
languages and so we're trying to build
that others is like the online workplace
and for four things began crowdsourcing
and so let me start by giving a quick
overview of of all this candy land's
recently merged and it's like I'll
discuss some of the data science
problems right we tried tacular so all
the studied from two founders quick guys
one of them was in Silicon Valley one of
them was back in athens and the two were
classmates back at the rather guard so
like it the whole project side as a way
for them to start working convince their
their bows to start working together
they're both wasn't copies that he can
have somebody work remotely and so they
thought there must be a better way so
that's how they started building the
infrastructure behind what became others
so kindly about two million businesses
hiring and the platform eight million
freelancers and recently we crossed the
1 billion dollar select revenue growth
going through the bathroom so we're
talking about like notes like the
regular Mechanical Turk work more of IT
design all kinds of long-term
relationships there are more than 2.4
million jobs posted annually there are
several more than traded calendars for
job where the client has to choose from
and and more than twenty-five percent of
the jobs are filled with in an hour so
there's a momentum now it's not
something that happens every second or a
minute but these are complex jobs in
takes f an hour so about the date to be
filled clients go through regular
interviewing process with their
candidates it's more of an irregular
select interview process where you look
at people youtube user profiles you can
talk to them and then you can site
whether it's the summer that fits your
profile
the type of clients who have are all
sorts of people from small startups that
does like trying to expand their team in
a flexible way to mid-sized companies
series a series b comedies and lads
illogical bunnies that many of them
actually bringing their independent
contractors in the platform to manage
them in a better way again the type of
freelancers is also various across there
are more agencies that are groups of
people working together to provide their
services there are people like Hannah
who's our designer that's like have a
regular job and they want to expand
their salaries and work overnight and
there are high-end people that decided
to work for home and live a day job just
to work online because it would serve
their schedule better the typos and the
type of jobs are here again vast
majority of them is 18 programming
engineers developers and you have all
kinds of categories we've recently
starting managing our categories
actively so we can expand but most of
them grow organically and again it's a
it's a global marketplace so there are
clients and freelancers all over the
world most of the clients are coming
from north america canada saranya and
most of the freelancers are Asia and
Europe and so as data scientists the
amazing thing with eel and soda is the
data we have there so it's it's we have
the biggest closed-loop data set of
online online labor and this includes
resumes it includes Chapo's applications
with all the information the cover
letters that people write their beads we
have messages exchanged throughout the
interview process and after the contact
starts so throughout the the contract
people communicate using our internal
tools and we have all these data sets we
also have hiring decisions and the
hiring process of the client is going
through so how he interviews which
people he interviews which people he
decides to
skip and all the activity around a
contract the feedback that people even
decide both freelancers around around
clients and clients are freelancers plus
the money the money transactions which
is very unique so I'm going to skip
through a quickly some of the data
products and we're building there so
freelancer search is one of them so in
general we'll trying to optimize the
matching process and so this includes
helping clients find freelancers and so
we have freelancers we have tools like
more like these similar freelancers and
so like recommendations so that we can
practically surfers people that we think
are aligned to the freelance to the
client we also help freelancer find jobs
in a similar matters who have job
recommendations will have job search and
similar jobs were built machine learning
modules for and then we also help
clients go through the applicants in
this bad way so we try to arrange their
applicants based on who we think has a
higher probability of a good outcome if
they if they choose to hire and we also
try to filter some of the things that
our friends so we're discussing about
filter people that's like spamming with
applications each other now just to
illustrate why how this is different
from so like regular shirts or regular
recommendations if you think of if you
take for example a query for Gangnam
style video Google versus and iOS
developer career at all this google can
always all the same video whereas we
have a few thousand of iOS developers
the difference is that Google can afford
it so a billion dollar billion times the
same video we can because each
contractor has limited availability and
so we have taken account who is
available we have to be able to select
calculate that both for implicit signals
forex produced signals and let me just
give it so like some of the findings
around predicting outcomes and then i'll
stop here and the questions but here the
problem set up is have a job have a
client and have a bunch of applicants
and want to
decide which the witch of the applicants
are likely to get hired and produce a
good outcome and one of one of the
surprising result will find here is we
build three different classifiers one
that uses freelancer features only one I
use this client and job features and run
that combines all of them and as you can
see the surprising thing is that just by
looking at the client the second
classifier we could get a better
prediction about what the outcome of the
job is compared to using the freelancer
formation and so this is a huge finding
four atoms like starting to take
advantage of these around around the
importance of client education so people
because they have this cup abilities now
to hire people easier doesn't mean that
they're good managers they are good
people at screening people and so it
becomes more and more important to help
clients and help people to educate them
how to post and how to hire people in
line so I'll stop here integrations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
