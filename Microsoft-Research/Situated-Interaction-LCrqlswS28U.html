we work with computers and interact with
them will change dramatically
computation will be overlaid in new
kinds of ways and present in our daily
lives one of our core projects were
studying the feature of human-computer
interaction is called situated
interaction this project is looking at
giving computers new kinds of reasoning
abilities to understand the pace of
conversation how engagement between
people occur the receptionist project is
a specific instantiation of this
long-term vision that were pursuing the
parts that were looking at have to do
with how do you manage conversation
engagement attention floor and grounding
so how do you manage how do you relate
all these different concepts and create
a system that's able to engage in an
interaction that's free flowing you know
and follow the natural pace of human
conversation hi my name is Laura and
today I'm here to help the reception at
with shuttle reservations what's your
name i'm dan and this is eric nice to
meet you do you need a shuttle so what
you see noticing is that the system is
able to detect multiple participants in
the scene it's able to track their poses
here it knows I'm oriented towards the
system and eric is oriented towards me
it's composing that with information
from the microphone array which tells us
the direction that speech is coming from
at any given moment and with an analysis
of the torsos of a different actors
basically of the clothing that we're
wearing and based on that we infer a
number of variables about the actor then
we go on level up in this analysis and
gather information about the tasks that
are active here so the system analyzes
the relationships between the different
actors and you first up here most likely
Eric and I are in a group together and
we're engaging as an active task to the
system in our current goal is to get a
shuttle we believe that it's a very good
platform for for doing that kind of work
which building are you going to I forget
where are we going I think it's building
nine you sure yes
so you're going to nine right yes and
this is for both of you right yes i'm
making a shuttle reservation for
building 9 42 people in case you want to
correct anything say or press start over
so are you visiting someone yes I'll
help me register in just a moment we
learn the most when we pick projects
that are at the edge of do ability
they're almost impossible but we see a
glimmer of the way to do something we
pursue that terrain and this is the best
way we learn about the future excuse me
sir yes you will be on shuttle 53 it
should be here any second all right
thank you bye-bye I you know work we're
also exploring the notions of
complementarity between people and
computing systems people won't go away
they'll always be with us but we're
trying to study the best way to use
computers and people together
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
