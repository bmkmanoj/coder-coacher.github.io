photos from your collection let
auto-tagging search my photos a
universal app for Windows 8.1 do the
work for you in the rest of the video I
will refer to this app as auto tag or
detect leverages all the collective
tagging done by you and your social
graph on facebook to learn faces of your
friends and family
once learned the app can automatically
tag your entire personal collection
thereby making it searchable on first
launch you log in with your Facebook ID
here I've logged in and you can see that
auto tag learns my strong connections
starting with me and my family
comprising of my husband younger
daughter Leela and twin da does mya and
Tara I'll stop learning when my family
is done and next art attack will start
tagging all photos in my pictures
library starting with the most recent
ones this is a new surface pro so I have
no pictures taken yet but I'm going to
start by including my camera roll
containing all photos taken from my
windows phone in my pictures library as
well as some other photo folders on
onedrive i'll also connect my camera and
copy the photos from a few trips on to
buy surface auto tag detects the photos
added and start tagging but let me stop
or the tagging and explore a bit
auto tag scans the new photos and
displays a people-centric view of my
photos on the home page you can see
tiles of the five of us without facebook
profile pictures you also see an
additional tile tagged lela which I'll
talk about later my camera has pictures
from our india trip and a california
trip for people not on facebook i can
create a tag name as i'm doing for
grandpa with the name madras tata as my
daughter's refer to him
I can find him on the autocomplete box
and tagged him in additional photos but
instead let me auto attack the folder
and when that's done look at the confirm
auto tags view to tag him in one swoop
he now has a face model which will be
used to tag him for future photos
to improve the accuracy of tagging I can
scope the tagging to any set of people
as I'm doing for the pictures from our
California trip
tagging accuracy will get better as you
interact with the app and edit and
confirm tags
heart attack maintains an inventory of
all faces it couldn't recognize for
example here is my dad she knew who has
no face model yet as there weren't any
tag photos on Facebook that the app
could leverage
I can tap on unidentified faces and tag
him to improve his face model my
daughter had want to the family photo so
let me search on photos containing all
of us that's a nice picture and I want
to share it on Facebook it's one simple
click and the photo along with the tags
is shared on Facebook either to an
existing album or to a new album I can
also browse photos edit tags and create
new tags for faces that auto tag was
unable to detect
I can merge a facebook profile or a user
created profile with tags detected on
photos possibly tagged in other photo
applications Here I am merging the
external tag name Leela with her
facebook profile leveraging previously
tagged photos on one drive to improve
her face model I hope you can have fun
reliving the moments with auto tag and
search my photos be sure to rate us on
the App Store and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
