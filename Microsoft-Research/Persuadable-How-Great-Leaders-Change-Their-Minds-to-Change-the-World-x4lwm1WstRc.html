thank you so much for coming I am thanks
for coming to Microsoft Research
visiting speaker series my name is Amy
Draves and I'm pleased to welcome alpat
pitam poly who's here to discuss his new
book persuadable how great leaders
change their minds to change the world
changing your mind or in politics
flip-flopping can be perceived as a
weakness it shouldn't be in a world
that's changing faster than ever having
a genuine willingness to seek new
perspectives and be open to changing
your mind is the ultimate competitive
advantage al is an author and business
consultant his first book read this
before our next meeting is a best-seller
he founded the modern meeting company to
help organizations transform meetings
make decisions and coordinate complex
teams he speaks in blogs on making
revolutionary change happen please join
me in giving him a very warm welcome so
the date is March 14 2011 the president
and his War Cabinet are meeting in the
White House and they're discussing how
to attack the Pakistani compound
allegedly housing Osama bin Laden so at
first the discussion is all about coming
in from the air they're talking about
firing a small missile from an unmanned
drone or dropping a large bomb from a be
too but there's a couple problems if you
fire a small missile you might miss if
you drop a large bomb there's a high
risk of civilian casualties and in
either case hard to really know if you
got the guy that's when the
administration and the president began
for the first time to discuss the
possibility of a special operations rate
a ground rate and in many ways this was
the risk of strategy of all because what
if the raid team while helicoptering
into the Pakistani compound the airspace
was was detected what if the Pakistani
military which was stationed dangerously
close to the compound engaged the raid
team in a
firefight what if troops were injured or
killed these were frightening questions
that require answers so in order to
answer those questions the president
consulted the man would ultimately be
tapped to lead the mission a man by the
name of Admiral William McRaven so I'm
William McRaven is actually one of the
most successful military commanders
probably in history he's the leader of
JSOC Joint Special Operations Command
and he's responsible for the capture of
Saddam Hussein the rescue of Captain
Phillips from Somali pirates along with
many classified accomplishments still
unreleased and the guy certainly looks
the part you can probably see right here
he's 6 foot 1 he's got this impeccable
posture he's got this domineering
presidency four-star general and he's
the kind of guy that you want to put
your faith in right he looks that way
especially in such a daring mission but
there was one thing about the guy that
the administration didn't expect
something that was atypical of military
brass McRaven was humble he was modest
open to suggestion unusually willing to
change his mind so for the very
beginning he admitted he didn't have all
the answers in fact the first time he
presented his plan to the president he
said mr. president we haven't we haven't
thoroughly tested this out yet we don't
know if we can do it but when we do
we'll tell you straight up and still
even after he tested the plan he was
unusually cautious and reminded everyone
of his FAL ability over the course of
many meetings McRaven the president and
his administration actually started
grilling McRaven challenging his plans
second-guessing his thinking but McRaven
didn't seem to mind he approached the
scrutiny without ego and in fact in
response to a really good question he
would say you know what I haven't
thought about that but I need to and he
wasn't just paying lip service he was
making substantial changes to his plans
in the face of criticism for example he
had proposed having backup Chinook
helicopter station on the
afghan-pakistani border you know this
would make sure that the team wasn't
infringing on Pakistani sovereignty but
the President does
read he said he wanted those helicopters
closer to the compound in case the SEAL
Teams need to get the hell out of there
McRaven was persuaded so this the
helicopters will be flown deep into
Pakistan near the compound ready to move
on April 29th 2011 after a careful
deliberation process with his team
President Obama officially ordered the
SEAL Team six raid overseen by Admiral
William McRaven why afterwards years
later people would ask him why did you
choose that and he would say it's
because of McRaven the guy just never
seemed surprised by anything remember
that because that's exactly what
happened during the raid one of the
Black Hawk helicopters went down the
white house which is watching via secure
link started to panic they were
blindsided one of the people on the call
one of the administration felt like he
might throw up is what he said but not
McRaven McRaven was calm he was
expressionless and he simply said we had
a contingency plan we executed that
contingency plan and we continued on
with the mission and that's what they
did they continued on with the mission
and completed one of the most successful
military operations in united states
history ladies and gentlemen my name is
alpha nepali i'm the author of a book
called persuadable and i'm here to talk
to you about what i think is the most
critical leadership skill for modern
leaders and that's what i call persuade
ability persuade ability or being
persuadable is the genuine willingness
to change your mind in the face of
evidence it means rejecting absolute
certainty it means treating your beliefs
as temporary and acknowledging the fact
that no matter how confident you are
about any particular opinion you could
be wrong now you might say to yourself
well you know that's great I already
know that open-mindedness is good right
of course leader should be open-minded
but we're not just talking about being
open-minded because open-mindedness is
like a passive thing we're talking about
with jonathan baron who's a professor of
psychology at university of pennsylvania
calls actively open-minded which means
not just waiting for information to come
to you means actively going out to prove
yourself wrong and that'll be one of the
themes of this presentation
but just the whole idea of talking about
the genuine willingness to change your
mind in the face of evidence as a
leadership skill can seem a little bit
strange because in many ways the the
leadership that we believe is strong in
our culture is the opposite right I mean
just think about the the language of
successful leaders right we talk about
when we talk about strong leaders the
best leaders they stay the course they
prove others wrong they stand firm in
their convictions they defy the odds
right and what about leaders who do
change their mind we think of them as
week we think of them is indecisive
especially in politics right we call
them flip-floppers or pushovers this is
kind of the way I thought of leadership
my entire life right i mean you know
anybody who watches the movies gets
indoctrinated with this kind of cultural
idea of what i call the 3 c's confidence
conviction and consistency just think of
any movie that you're you've watched in
the recent years right like look at
Hunger Games or Katniss Everdeen is
resisting the attempts to be persuaded
by the capital or you got concussion
where you got dr. Bennet Omalu who is
resisting the attempts of the NFL to
pressure him and discard his research or
you have Star Wars obviously you got all
these strong-willed Jedi's that are
resisting attempts by the dart by their
enemies to convert them to the dark side
right so I've always believed that this
is what leadership is it's the strong
conviction consistency and confidence
but for three years now I've been
studying the most successful leaders in
the world and what I've been finding is
that many of them buck the traditional
leadership archetype more and more the
most successful leaders in business and
politics and philanthropies and science
are changing the way that they lead
instead of this decisive form of
leadership they're moving to what I call
persuade ability that's what I want to
talk to you about today I want to talk
to you about why that is what is the
persuadable advantage what is we know
what the costs are right people might
call you a flip flopper right but what
are the advantages and then I want to
talk to you a little bit about how to be
persuadable okay so let's start with the
persuadable advantage okay what exactly
are the advantages of being persuadable
the first one is agility
so let's revisit the raid Admiral
William McRaven rate of the abad about
compound to find out okay so the thing
about the abad about raid which you have
to understand is it was a special
operations mission and special
operations are well special right it
means they're constantly evolving
they're changing there's new information
coming up and all the time the enemy is
unconventional right and so they're
constantly adapting and when you think
about this kind of environment right
when the world is simple and static this
decisive form of leadership right these
three C's make a lot of sense it's like
you have a target and the goal is to
persistently with resolve go after that
target until you reach it but what
happens when the world changes what
happens when the world is complex and
fast changing then this decisive march
towards the target is actually a march
towards the oblivion right it's in this
fast changing environment that the
leaders who are able to change their
mind and to adapt to changing
circumstances are the ones that win now
we know why President Obama had so much
confidence in McRaven he said he's never
surprised by anything now leaders who /
to think they have all the answers right
we look at them and they look like have
all the answers that looks really
seductive right we want to put our faith
in them we want to trust them because
confidence is really magnetic but those
guys are very surprised about when
things change they're called blindsided
no the only way to be unsurprising is
actually to admit you don't have all the
answers and to be ready when the world
changes the second benefit of being
persuadable is accuracy all right and in
order for for me to demonstrate this I
want you to I want to tell you the story
about this guy the guy his name is
anybody know who this is ray dalio who's
they've had the founder of Bridgewater
investments the largest hedge fund in
the world so story of Ray Dalio is in
2007 he goes to the White House a lot of
my stories revolve around the White
House some reason goes to the White
House and he has this dire warning for
the administration he says the economy
is headed towards
taffy and he wasn't just talking about
some regular downturn he was talking
about a global deep recession the
economic staffers of the Bush
administration completely ignored value
that day that would turn out to be a big
mistake because a year later the economy
went into freefall the government and
dahlias competitors were blindsided they
were all losing their shirts but da Leo
was prepared he actually set up some
early warning indicators in his trading
system and he programmed them to tell
him when he should pull out of certain
investments one day the one of his
trading and one of his indicators told
him he should pull out of certain banks
including Bear Stearns a week later Bear
Stearns collapsed this is Ray Dalio some
people call him the da Vinci of
investing some people think he's dealing
in black magic people want to know how
the heck he gets things right all the
time John Cassidy of The New Yorker says
he has an uncanny ability to anticipate
market trends and everybody's tearing
their hair out asking how does he do it
what does he know that we don't that's
the wrong question he doesn't know
anything that we don't it's not what he
knows is how he thinks let me explain
what I mean by this so there's a famous
study you may have heard of it operated
by a guy named Philip tetlock so Philip
tetlock is an academic juggernaut he's
at the University of Pennsylvania 30
years ago he had this conundrum do
experts really know what they're talking
about how many times you go on CNN and
you see these pundits making all these
predictions about who's going to win the
election and whether intervening in
Syria is a good idea the problem with
those predictions is when judgment a
judgment day ultimately comes there's no
reckoning right we lose track of the
present predictions that we never know
whether or not these guys actually know
what they're talking about dahlia
couldn't or deadlock could not live with
this he found it intolerable so he said
you know what I'm gonna find out once
and for all these guys know what they're
talking about so for two decades he
meticulously followed the predictions of
284 experts we're talking about 82,000
predictions in total and he followed
them meticulously to find out if they
actually came true or not and what he
found made huge headline
turns out it wasn't very good for the
expert the experts performed abysmally
on average but there was one silver
lining that didn't get much headlines
and that is there was a subset of
experts that actually did do fairly well
they did better than average they did
significantly better than everyone else
and so dolly was very curious on what
made these people so much better and it
turns out like dolly oh it had less to
do with what they knew and it said well
how they fought so the unsuccessful
forecasters had these theories about the
world grand theories about the world
that they used to guide their forecasts
and when an event would happen or an
information would come up that
contradicted their theories instead of
throwing out the theory they would throw
out the information but the successful
forecasters he called them foxes were
much more flexible thinkers what they
would have theories but they were just
way more skeptical of them and when
information contradicted their theory
they would just change the theory this
ladies and gentlemen is the simple
secret of Ray Dalio when the world
presents him with evidence that he's
wrong that he is an inaccurate
understanding the world he just changes
it for 30 years now he's been writing
down every single prediction that he's
made every trade and he follows the
trade see if it's successful or not and
if it is he he celebrates but if it's
not he asked himself what did I get
wrong why was my world of my
understanding of the world so inaccurate
that it caused me to make this bad
prediction and then he would change his
mind that is my friends is the secret of
Dre dahlia like accuracy the third so we
have agility and accuracy the third
advantage of being persuadable is growth
so in 1974 I'm going to tell you another
story a guy by the name of Alan Rick's
went on this study he was following up
with a group of patients that were
highly disturbed as kids all of these
patients had had gone undergone
treatment with psychotherapist and he
wanted to follow up to see how they were
doing as adults
what he found was that there was only a
few unfortunately a few adults that were
actually doing well but what was most
fascinating was that there was all of
those those subset as those just a small
group of boys were treated by the same
provider Rick's came to the conclusion
that in the field of psychotherapy there
are a few therapists who are achieving
exceptional results compared to their
peers he called these high performing
therapists super shrinks now at the time
Rix's discovery gained little attention
right because the whole field was much
more concerned with what makes for good
therapies not what made for good
therapist until this guy Scott Miller
who was the head of a research team
called the international center for
clinical excellence came across Rick's
is finding and he was fascinated by he
wanted to go one step beyond Rick's he
wanted to find out what made super
shrinks so super and so he luckily he
had access to lots of data right lots of
data apt to come data from like
thousands of patients and tens of
thousands of practitioners and what he
would do is he would made it make a list
of all the attributes that you would
think of that might separate the good
therapist from the great you have you
know the mode of therapy you have level
of experience level of education and one
by one they would compare the this their
attributes to the data to see if they
got found a match they kept striking out
in fact they struck out so often that
they decided to throw in the towel they
said super shrinks don't exist just
noise in the data but two years later
this guy Scott Miller was on a plane and
he was reading an article by
psychologists who you guys might be
familiar with his name is under his k
erickson honors k erickson you might be
familiar with because he's the one who's
the father of the concept of deliberate
practice honest Erickson followed lots
of experts from chess players to via two
violinists lots of wide-ranging
cognitively complex skills and what he
found was that the quantity of practice
is important in determining whether or
not these people became experts but
which is what is way more important is
the quality of practice they underwent a
very specific type of practice which is
called deliberate practice
this is practice that paid close
attention to feedback right so what
these practitioners did these these
deliberate practitioners is they really
paid close attention to their weaknesses
right because that was the only way they
would know what they needed to improve
and so instead of just practicing over
and over again they would continue to
practice differently each and every time
this was the Eureka moment for Scott
Miller what he realized I am there's k
Erickson his insight he went back into
the date and he looked at his super
shrinks and what he found was the same
thing was true of super shrinks the
secret of super shrinks is that pay pay
very close attention to negative
feedback they are obsessively concerned
with evaluating accurately their own
performance see there's a there's a
thing that stands in the way of our
growth and every everyone is
experiencing this it's called a loooser
e superiority right this is in lay terms
the better than average effect we all
want to believe that we're better than
we actually are at everything right we
want to leave we're more intelligent
than we actually are more honest more
attractive better drivers than we
actually are and this is something that
shows up in the research over and over
and over again and this is what gets in
the way of our ability to engage in
deliberate practice right because in
order to grow we need to be able to see
our weaknesses but loose or superiority
is this confounding thing that makes us
not want to see your own weaknesses but
there is this fascinating insight from
the research which is that even though
we're really bad at assessing our own
weaknesses it turns out we're really
good at assessing other people
weaknesses so for anybody who wants to
become an expert anyone who wants to
become a master there's this obvious
conclusion allow other people to point
out your weaknesses for you and that was
the secret of super shrinks super
shrinks would constantly go to their
patients and ask them for negative
feedback right patients are so used to
getting the feedback but this time they
were actually asked tell me feedback
they would ask so how am i doing right
how empathetic am I being did we talk
about today what you wanted to talk
about all these questions gave them the
feedback that they needed in order to
improve at an accelerated rate but they
didn't just listen to the
that they were persuadable to it they
actually changed in line so now that we
know the persuadable advantages accuracy
agility and growth I want to talk about
how to be persuadable right because we
all have this concept of how to be more
persuasive right the way I position my
book all the time is like there's a mitt
you go to the bookstore there's a
million books on how to be more
persuasive right there's how to win
friends and influence people get anyone
to do anything and my personal favorite
is a book it's called how to persuade
people who don't want to be persuaded I
as a culture I think we're obsessed with
being persuasive persuasiveness books
are like the new diet books is kind of
how I think about it but if I'm right
and I hope I am but I'm persuadable that
being persuadable is a competitive
advantage in business and in life then
we need to take changing our mind very
seriously right and that's what I found
the most successful leaders do they're
not just again open minded saying oh
yeah you know I'll be I'll be ready for
information that changes my mind no they
actively seek it out and so what I want
to talk about is a recipe for how to
actually be this actively open minded
leader on anything when it comes to the
opinions beliefs and decisions so
there's a four-pronged my book I outline
the seven practices of persuadable
leaders we don't have time for that but
there's four steps that will put get you
moving in the right direction here so
step one is recalling your moment of
opacity so here's what I want you to do
right now this is kind of interactive
portion here I want you to think about
something that you're really sure about
okay something in your life that right
now you're you're you have absolute
certainty in right I mean it could be
something like a decision you've made
that you thought was a great idea it
could be the idea that your spouse
really loves you or it could be the idea
that you know you know that your add
your address is a certain address
whatever it is it doesn't matter think
about that right now it's got to be
something that you have conviction and
something that you feel very strongly
that right the feeling that you're
experiencing right now is what dr.
Robert burden calls the feeling of
knowing right it's that strong sensation
that we know
that makes us know that whatever it is
we're thinking right now is true the
problem with the feeling of knowing is
it's completely unreliable sometimes
it's right sometimes it's wrong it turns
out that that feeling of knowing we want
to believe that it comes after rational
evaluation but that feeling actually
arises out of mechanisms in the brain
that are independent of reason and
they're involuntary right the feeling of
knowing happens to us we don't make it
happen right we don't make it happen
just like we don't make love happen love
happens to us anger happens to us we
don't actually choose it and so this
feeling of knowing actually gets in the
way of our ability to make accurate
decisions to be persuadable right
because the first step of being
persuadable is to be humble it's to
recognize that you could be wrong and
the feeling of knowing doesn't want to
help to make us recognize that we could
be wrong so here's the key we can't make
the feeling of knowing going what go
away but we can learn to distrust it and
so that's why I have this strategy call
the moment of opacity we all know what a
moment of clarity is right it's
something that happens to you that
instantly it's as if you have a new
profound understanding of the world
right it's like everything just makes
sense in that moment a moment of opacity
is the opposite right it's a moment in
time it's an experience in where you
were so sure that you got something
wrong or that that you were going to get
something right and then it happened to
be wrong right every political pundit
that predicted that Donald Trump
wouldn't make it past the first primary
we're never made to the primary had
should have had a moment of opacity
where they realized hopefully was last
night where they realized wow I was very
wrong about this now here's the thing in
that moment there was a great gift that
occurred which is you have this
relationship to that feeling of knowing
where you began to distrust it the
problem is and you'll see with these
political pundit two seconds later they
forget about it they say yeah you know
none of them we want to the next
prediction and be just as certain about
it great leaders the most persuadable
leaders right now never forget their
moment of opacity so what you think that
it take that moment of opacity keep it
in your pocket and next time you have
this feeling of knowing when you're
about to make an important decision or
when you have this strong sensation
remind yourself the second
step to being persuadable is to argue
with others arguing with others is the
gold standard for getting closer to the
truth so think about our justice system
our justice system is the one area in
which we most want as a society to get
to the truth right nobody in society
wants an innocent person to go to jail
for the rest of the life for something
that they didn't commit right so what do
we do as a society how did we design our
justice system we didn't you know assign
a group of people to go out there on a
fact finding mission and come back to us
with a result no we we created this
adversarial system where you have a
defense and a prosecute and a prosecutor
argue with each other right because this
exchange of ideas you know the
confirmation bias often leads us astray
right when we're buy or sell but when
we're arguing with somebody else who's
got an opposing confirmation bias those
two forces actually balance each other
out and it makes it more likely that the
best idea will prevail but you have to
find people who are willing to disagree
with you honestly disagree with you
right and people don't like to disagree
people hate conflict but you have to
find them you got to seek them out and
you got to be willing to make sure they
understand that that you want the truth
right you want to be second-guessed okay
but there's a different way we have to
argue because usually we argue to win
and that is not the kind of arguing that
actually leads to the better idea the
really the kind of argue that i'm
talking about is arguing to improve the
accuracy of your beliefs okay and i have
a metaphor for this is step number three
it's called arguing with your hand on
the dial instead of your hand on the gun
ok so my metaphor for how people
actually argue is skeet shooting alright
everyone know what skeet shooting is
it's where clay targets are flung into
the air and you try to shoot them down
that's what we do when we argue think
about the last argument you've been in
whether it's been you know with a spouse
or with a colleague or with your uncle
over some political which you what
you're trying what the way we do it is
it's almost as if we have this position
and when somebody makes a good point
it's like a clay target flung into the
air that we automatically shoot down as
quickly as we can write and we're
obsessive about it there's like five
good points and we're just trying to
shoot them all down and we only win if
we shoot all of them down that's the
goal of our that's our goal in arguing
and again if you want to argue to win
maybe that's a good goal but if you want
to argue to improve the accuracy of your
believes to get closer to the truth to
be persuadable leader that's the exact
opposite of how you want to argue so I
have a different metaphor for arguing
and that is imagine first of all the
reason why we argue like that one of the
reasons is because we fall into the trap
of dichotomous thinking right we believe
we want to believe in absolute certainty
right whether it's a decision an opinion
you want to believe that you're a
hundred percent certain on something
right and you can either be totally
right or totally wrong either LeBron
James is the best basketball player in
the world or is not either the decision
to go into Iraq was either a terrible
idea or wasn't right the problem is the
logic goes if you believe in black and
white right and somebody makes a good
point unless you're unless your belief
is totally defended well that means you
must be wrong so we need to let go of
this black and white thinking and
realize the world is in shades of grey
right and we need to realize that we
need to make decisions based on
probability assessments inherent
uncertainties so here's what you do
right next time you're in an argument
think about whatever position you're
trying to defend right think about your
opinion your belief maybe it's a certain
feature of a product that you think is
going to be great for users right I want
you to think about a radio down right in
front of you or if you turn the dial all
the way to the right that means you have
a hundred percent confidence in your
belief if you if you turn the dial all
the way to the left that means you have
zero confidence in your belief when
somebody makes it when you argue with
somebody who's a thoughtful disagree or
when you're arguing with them don't
worry about shooting their points down
just worry about turning the dial that's
your focus if they make a good point
then turn your dial a little bit to the
left meaning you're a little bit less
confident if you make a good point or
evidence surfaces you know bolstering
your position then turn your down a
little bit to the right by the end of
your argument if your dial is to the
left or to the right of where once was
congratulations
just learn something and finally my
final piece of advice which i think is
the the boldest advice is what I call
kill your darlings and it's not my
expression this comes from the writing
community anybody hear about this this
expression before kill your darlings God
you guys must be writers so in the
writing community there's this
expression see the problem with writers
is we're very neurotic lunch and so we
get we fall in love with our ideas very
quickly so when you're writing something
you know you're you you start to love
every paragraph every sentence every
chapter and if your editor somebody
points out that you know maybe this
sentence isn't the best maybe there's
another one that could be better you
you're you bought right you snarl at
them because every single sentence feels
like it's your baby and almost it feels
like to let go of your baby is to kind
of abandon your own offspring that's how
it feels right to writer and so there's
always been this indispensable piece of
wisdom that's given to writers which is
kill your darlings right which means
don't wait for your editor to drag your
sentences from you write with tears
running down your cheeks grab the knife
and take matters into your own hands now
it's a really crass expression I get it
but that's why it's so effective because
it acknowledges how painful this process
is how unholy how twisted it can feel
and this isn't just good advice advice
for writers this is good advice for all
leaders right anybody who has opinions
and beliefs right we need to go out of
our way to kill our darlings when you
can turn your little knob all you want
for the rest of your life but at some
point you're going to have to take a
stand right whether it's a political
position whether it's whether you want
to stay with your you know your
boyfriend or the person you're dating or
whether it's a decision on whether to
abandon a product or a feature at some
point you're gonna have to take a stand
and instead of just waiting forever
dragging your heels right slowly
evolving which is what politicians
always do kill your darlings take a
stand and the whole reason why I'm
advising you to kill your darlings isn't
just for you it's for me right it's for
all of us because the argument that I
make with this book
is that being persuadable as an
advantage right that was the theme of
this talk it's an advantage and accuracy
agility and growth for the individual
but there's another advantage and that's
the collective advantage being
persuadable makes it more likely that
the best ideas in a society prevail
right so think about it we have this
great marketplace of ideas the
marketplace of ideas is a brilliant
beautiful thing and what it says is that
if we're willing to engage with each
other if we're willing to exchange ideas
buy and sell ideas then the best ideas
are the ones that rise to the top right
and that's a beautiful thing for
solutions for societal solutions for
ideas for social movements for progress
we want the best ideas to rise to the
top but we have a broken marketplace of
ideas right now in the business world in
the scientific world but most
importantly in the political and social
world it's as if everybody wants to sell
their ideas we have plenty of sellers
but we have very few buyers you're very
few people who are willing to actually
enable the chain and if we look when we
look at every social movement in history
every bit of social progress we always
see these great persuaders right we see
Martin Luther King we see Muhammad
Mahatma Gandhi we see susan b anthony
these people who miraculously compelled
people who won hearts and minds and were
able to achieve change right now they're
important of course we owe them a great
debt but there's a missing part to the
story it doesn't tell the whole story
because in order for them to have soul
changed there were other people that
needed to buy there were lots of people
who along the way actually change their
mind and conceded that maybe I'm wrong
about this and maybe I need to change
their mind and it's only when this
critical mass of people that actually
change their mind that allows social
progress to occur so that's why I say
that one of the best ways to change your
world to change the world because
everybody wants to change the world is
just to change your own mind it sounds
really cliche and it sounds kumbaya but
the truth is the ability to change your
mind on an issue has ripple effects and
has an impact on the people around you
beyond what you think it does so that's
why I'm asking you today is so i hope
you apply these ideas to your business
obviously an organizational life but I
hope you apply these ideas to the most
purse the issues that you care deeply
about to keep the issues that you're
that are most personal to you the moral
your moral beliefs your political
beliefs your religious believes anything
right and everything because those are
the ones that change society and so to
leave you with this little monster I
think that people you know when you talk
about the traditional leadership
archetype that I started with this these
three C's this being this confident
persuasive leader the mantra that we're
constantly telling ourselves is let my
idea prevail what I want you to do is
replace that with a different mantra the
spirit the true spirit of persuade
ability which is let the best idea
prevail thank you very much so this is
my favorite time here the of the event
which is where I get to answer questions
so at this moment I'm happy to field any
questions whatsoever about the
presentation or anything related to the
talk yes so I was unclear we had a thing
that's something we're certain about and
then you talk about the moment of
opacity you should go back to that but
we really think about the opacity we're
thinking about the time of your fault
humor sure that's a really good question
so let's do that right now okay so I
want you to think of a time where you
you felt like you were so right about
something and then it turned out you
were wrong okay maybe it was the the you
know again the fact that you thought
your sports team was going to win the
pennant and then your baseball team and
then you found out that that you were
wrong or there was like a certain
decision you may that you thought was so
sure as the right decision and then
later you found it you found out it was
wrong I think about something like that
and hopefully that comes to mind pretty
quickly because we're wrong a lot and so
that's a very paint it's often very
painful experience for people but that's
what's so powerful that's why you should
pick a painful experience because if you
can kind of bottle that up and keep that
bottle with you at all time it's a real
gift it's a real tool that you can use
so anytime you're too overconfident or
anytime you know you go into a meeting
thinking that you're certain
something well then you can remind
yourself of this moment of opacity and
basically the logic as you say well I'm
sure that this is right now but I was
also sure i was right back then and i
was wrong so maybe i'm wrong now to that
make sense yes so but the start you said
about the leaders so that they want them
to be in a short time right but what's
the muscle to be changeable so it sounds
like there is this you want to be
shortened in some high-level wolf you be
flexible in the means like this Admiral
you give an example have the glorious
winning in this war wait and operation
is the mean to it and then details
preparation are the means to the means
yes so that's a really good question
which yeah the question is it seems like
there's this recipe emerging to be
flexible when it comes to the tactics or
the strategy but to be fairly certain
about the vision or the goal is that and
I think that's usually a good recipe and
that's what some of the best leaders do
right there they're very certain an
optimistic and confident in the goal but
they are very much open to suggestion
when it comes to the way to get to the
goal but I would just argue that
sometimes we need to abandon the goal to
right we need to be persuadable often on
the vision or the destination as well so
the reality is there's this tension
happening right like on and I dedicate a
whole chapter to this we can't be we
can't be too persuadable right at times
right leadership is also about certainty
to write like the way I think about it
is there's dissension between persuade
ability and decisiveness right persuade
ability says we should be open-minded we
should take our time and evaluate and
really try to make the best decision
decisiveness is a saying all right we
don't have time or we just need to make
a decision let's go with it both are
important my the argument I'm and
actually my first book which is called
read this before next meeting was really
a manifesto about more decisive
leadership but the argument that I'm
making is that as leaders we know we
need to be decisive and I
a lot of times leaders feel like they
need to be to decisive and what I'm
trying to do is give leaders permission
to be persuadable when necessary and I
think you know when it comes to
decisions that need to be let's put it
this way being persuadable again one of
the benefits of being persuadable is
accuracy right if you are persuadable
you all the decision-making research
shows that you are more likely to make
better decisions you know more precise
judgments if you're you know car is
headed off of a cliff and you got and
you've got three passengers with you
right you're going to be able to come up
with a great better decision or better
plan by consulting everyone but you
don't have time to consult everyone
right you just need to turn as quickly
as possible so sometimes a good enough
decision is good enough and therefore go
ahead and be decisive but other times
when the stakes are high when there's
more time to evaluate you need to be
persuadable and the most important
decisions the most important issues the
most important topics that we deal with
an organizational life in your personal
life and your business life it pays to
be persuadable so if i have to throw in
my leadership mindset or you know
throwing my money with one of those i'm
going to be a persuadable leader that's
often decisive versus a decisive leader
that is sometimes persuadable yes yeah
it's just sort of building off that I me
I like the balance you put in there
because the thing that I was thinking
about is if you look at successful
entrepreneurs or people changing
companies often a lot of it is also
about overcoming maybe old paradigms
right and so people are in a certain
mindset and so if you spend a lot of
time kind of like having those
discussions those arguments it might
distract you so when you see with a lot
of entrepreneurs are actually sometimes
even a little single mind or obsessed
some people would say about you know
where we need to go and so the tricky
thing is sort of feels like it's
balancing that like trying to get to the
right answer but at the same time
knowing you want to go somewhere else so
maybe that vision versus the path to get
there is what yeah I think you raise a
good point in to kind of hopefully
rephrase your your question or two kind
of reiterate it there's this sense that
if we continue to evaluate things for
ever over and over again we can never
make any progress right we can never get
anything done if we're to persuadable
all the time like for example in
businesses that solve a problem and they
find a really good way to solve a
problem and then they're making money
off of it it's becoming successful and
people are constantly trying to change
again they're trying to innovate they're
trying to over invite constantly
constantly to try to find better ways to
solve the problem sometimes that's a
great idea other times that can be lead
you to kind of paralysis of analysis
right this this often happens in science
by the way and there's this problem in
science which is people really love to
use this expression which is that the
debate is settled right it's over we
know we know exactly what's going on and
the truth of the matter is the debate is
never settled right maybe the
probability that something that we've
gone something wrong is small but
there's always the probability now for
all intents and purposes we have to say
listen we've evaluated this to death
there's a consensus in the scientific
community that we think this this is the
case and so therefore in order to make
sure our resources are well spent we're
going to spend our time over here that's
fine but at some point along the way we
lose sight of that and we just think we
again we have this feeling of knowing we
basically just presume that something is
true or that's a fact you can never do
that not in science and not in business
not if you're an entrepreneur or
anything so if you want to consider any
issue settled fine but make sure you're
consciously acknowledging that and not
convincing yourself as you're a hundred
percent certain about something because
you'd be wrong use the word attention a
lot and I'm just kind of there's the the
external tension of this is my ideas and
has an organization we're going to come
together and I'm going to stand up make
a decision or not or whatever but then
there's that internal debate and so
where does like conviction and standing
up for certain truths that you have fit
into this I think that so the question
was about conviction and when is it
appropriate to kind of stand up for what
you believe in so I think the best kind
of
Jeff Bezos has a great quote on this I'm
not sure he was the origin of it but
it's it's it's not that we don't have a
strong point of view it's that we treat
that strong that point of view is
temporary right so it's totally fine
conviction is a strong word and I tent
and I hesitate to use it because I think
when people have conviction they
essentially stop evaluating new
information they kind of treat it as
true so that's a little bit too strong
for me but am am i confident about
things all the time sure you know I have
very high confidence in certain things
right a very high confidence that
gravity exists right that's that's a
real thing is there is there and so I'm
very happy to stand up here and actually
be very kind of confident in that with
you guys right because that's what
because that's the truth of things and
so what I think is really important is
that we separate these two concepts
which is confidence in calibration
everybody wants more confidence these
days you can see tons and tons of book
about being confident confidence is
neither good nor bad it just represents
certainty in any particular proposition
write what you want is calibration not
confident you want to be properly
calibrated and one of the best investors
the best leaders the best entrepreneurs
on the world are calibrated which means
if there's a lot of evidence for
something that means you should have
high confidence why you should be very
confident about something if there's not
a lot of evidence for something you
should have low confidence there's no
good or bad about that they're there
just is so of course so conviction if
you want to call it or high confidence
is often a fine thing as long as you
have a sufficient evidence to justify
that confidence so just ask yourself the
next time you're really confident about
something just say is it my feeling of
knowing that's making me feel that way
or do I have really good reasons for
believing that and if you do go ahead
you know you have every right to be
confident yes question online about as a
leader and if you decide to change your
mind what do you recommend is cute
practices on how to how to lead your
team into your new idea because it is
often seen as being weak a weakness
that's a really good question so so the
answer the question is about when you
change your mind
how do you actually kind of communicate
that change of position and how do you
kind of lead your team and that's a
really great question and i'll answer it
this way because this is a very common
thing you have to give people a sense of
your process and not just the outcome
right so focus on the process and not
just the outcome so just kind of imagine
this scenario which probably happens to
everyone or has had happened to a lot of
people which is somebody gives you you
want somebody's feedback on a decision
right maybe I don't know what it is you
know there's a should I move or should I
buy a car so you could solve somebody
you get your friend you say hey you know
I'm about to make this decision I want
your advice they give you the advice and
then you end up ignoring their advice
right you take the other path you take
the path that you were going on to begin
with are they upset with you yes
sometimes they are upset with you right
they they it made you it it made them
feel because we've probably all been on
the other end of that too that you
didn't listen to their advice you didn't
care about it see being persuadable
something that happens inside your head
right so people don't know you could
have been persuadable to their advice
and yet just not have been persuaded
right like they gave you advice and you
said you know that's interesting advice
but I'm going to go in this direction
anyway and the problem is we're not
giving people a sense of our process
right so imagine now take this other
scenario which is before I go to
somebody and I asked for their advice
let's say I am making decisions by my
car I tell them my process which is as
can be as simple as this hey Joe I'm
making a decision to buy my car and I
want your advice so first I want to ask
your advice and I'm getting you know two
or other people's opinions and then
later I'm going to make the decision
right that keyword is I here which means
that they're not part of the
decision-making process your I'm either
part of the decision-making process but
they're not good to say they're not one
of the deciders right so now when you
give them a sense oh ok I'm just
contributing to their to this guy's
decision now people know where they fit
in their process and there's actually an
entire field which is called procedural
justice which basically says that the
upshot is that
people are way more interested in a fair
process often than a fair outcome so you
can make a decision that they didn't
like but if they thought the process was
fair that you treated them with respect
and that you went to them the right way
they'll actually be fine they'll be much
happier with that they might not love
the outcome but so so when we talk about
changing our mind we always have to do
all ways have to figure out okay how am
i treating this person and do are they
aware of my process and if they are it's
more likely that there are going to be
amenable to any change of mine or not
changing your mind yes so up here at
microsoft word there's been this for
cultural imperative around a growth
mindset which i think is inspired by
carol black and i'm wondering what
you're arguing for persuaded Billy how
that might relate or not relate to that
area yeah Carol Dweck's growth mindset
is phenomenal and people should read her
book because I think it's very
fascinating and yeah it's there's a lot
of correlates between growth mindset and
persuade ability I mean you know when
you talk about I think Carol Dweck's
mindset is basically her book mindset is
basically we should treat intelligence
as not a fixed rate but a very malleable
tray right so she kind of what she found
really famously was that if you take
kids and you just analyze them you say
okay we'll ask them questions like so
you know what do you think about
intelligence right is it something
you're born with or is this something
that you acquire over time if the kid
says no you know I kind of have this
amount of telligence and I'm kind of
born with it and there's nothing I can
do about it versus another kid that says
no you know I think intelligence is
something that is is it evolves and
changes over time the kids who have that
ladder answer have a growth mindset and
way outperform their their peers right
they do really great in a whole range of
different metrics so what I'm talking
about what persuade ability is just a
little bit of broader scope than that
I'm saying let's treat all of our
beliefs not just our beliefs
intelligence let's treat all of our
beliefs as temporary and valuable right
our political beliefs our morality are
you know religious beliefs all of those
things we should see as not fixed as
things that we can grow in that we can
evolve in and those people who have that
mindset that persuadable mindset have
the ability not just to become smarter
but become more agile or become faster
or become better scientists or doctors
or whatever it is so basically I'm
trying to apply that principle across
the spectrum on a whole wide range of
beliefs yes there's mission about
argument and un certo said that is
arguing differently right and he's
visibly is saying because successful
people are entrepreneurs believe
believed and agreed mostly there is no
winner productive results from an
arguments I'm not sure maybe you just
talk about argument a little bit more
yeah so I would say that there's a
difference between an argument and a
quarrel so most of the arguing arguing
gets a bad rap because we confuse it
with quarreling quarreling is the kind
of thing that you see on you know
political debates and you know family
reunions and that kind of thing we're
people are just bickering back and forth
and it's there's this adversarial thing
that's happening where this person is
defending this position and this person
is defending this position and there's
almost nothing that comes out of it
except for bad feelings bruised egos and
sell a winner and a loser right what I'm
talking about is true arguing right
arguing in its real sense and strict
sense is about providing reasons to
believe any particular proposition right
so I give you reasons on why I believe
my thing and you give me reasons on why
you believe your thing and then we can
compare the reasons we can evaluate the
reasons and the whole point of that
exchange is to figure out who's got
better reasons because I want true
beliefs I want accurate beliefs right
I'm operating this world I want to be in
the know if I'm wrong about something
then I want to know about it so that's
the whole when you approach arguing from
that perspective you realize that the
goal is not to win it's to improve the
accuracy of your belief the problem is
it's so it sounds so great when I
explain it like that right when its
content free but now start to insert the
contents start to think about your
political beliefs think about your
religious beliefs think about you know
certain interests you have financial
interests and all those kinds of things
that once you get to that once you have
a stake in it it becomes very hard to
kind of argue just to improve the
accuracy of your beliefs and that's what
I'm talking about though I think that it
takes a lot of courage and it takes a
lot of awareness and takes a lot more
energy to do it that way but the
advantages are extraordinary I think
some of the best leaders in the world
right now and that's that's what my book
is about it's about a change in the
landscape some of the best leaders in
the world are approaching the world
differently they're changing their mind
they're going out of their way to prove
themselves wrong and they're arguing
with people with the willingness to
concede points and that's my invitation
for you to is to to do the same one last
question no okay so one of the other the
kind of books with we've been trying to
read is about how do we change cultures
and within within this company in
particular just in general and so this
book by Jillian GFI thing called silos
which speaks about how their social
grooming takes place that people get
used to a certain way of working in
groups whether it's in a business group
or quadruple even in society by ethnic
looks like you're in stick to each other
one of this way people across different
groups you know you have some ideas on
how we can race you know bring people up
or start to have that conversation from
a change yes that's a great question so
the question was about cultures and how
do we kind of apply this persuade
ability mindset to these different
cultural silos that often our current
organizations and the word I use is
often tribes right so we're all a part
of tribes right that have our own
cultures right so you might be
the Microsoft tribe outside of you are
you might be part of the sales chart
above the marketing tribe or the
computer program you try to the Democrat
tribe or the Republican drive or the
toastmasters drive or the Detroit
Pistons drive so there's all these
tribes that actually govern our beliefs
right a lot of times we don't believe
things because there's good reasons we
just believe it because everybody else
believes believes it in our little silo
all right that's a very dangerous thing
because that means that lots of people
can be believin completely the wrong
thing oh it just because everybody else
is believed you so one of the things
that happens and this happens in the
political world all the time is that
people are so focused focused on
changing their own are changing another
tribe right another culture they're
saying you know you're wrong you guys
over there are wrong right how effective
is that does that ever work has there
ever been a Democrat in the history of
this country to stand up at the RNC
convex convention and say hey you guys
are wrong and actually live to tell
about it no it ever happens so that's
why I one of my chapters is called take
on your own tribe which means that
instead of using the expression you're
wrong a much more persuasive message is
we are wrong so that means actually
looking to your own tribe you have this
great benefit in your own tribe which is
that if an outsider tells you guys you
know if somebody from a competitor tells
you guys you guys are wrong about
something we could really forget you
guys I mean forget you I don't want it
you know you're my enemy but if one of
you guys stands up and says hey we're
wrong people are going to give you
leniency right it's called leniency
contract in psychology so you want to
take advantage of that right you have
power to change your own tribe and with
great power comes great responsibility
so when we talk about these cultural
silos whether it's within an
organization or its interorganizational
anybody can talk about you know
something wrong being in another tribe
but what I want you to think very deeply
about is where are we wrong right if
it's if it's one silo in the
organization what's something that we
can change because that's the
opportunity that's available the
persuadable leaders that's how you're
going to change culture and all
really an organization and beyond that
of society</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
