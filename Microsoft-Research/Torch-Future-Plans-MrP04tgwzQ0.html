you
okay I don't have slice I don't have
much of a plan either well this is
mostly because as I said like torch
started as like people wanting to do
particular kind of research and that
wasn't much around and we created and it
has been growing like that and one thing
that we found really useful that has
been happening is rather than putting
more stuff in we actually chop things
into pieces and then they grow
organically so torch used to be a big
monolithic software that had like the
interface to the plus and at the same
library on top of it the interface to
lua and then on top of it interface to
the neural network stuff plus the
interface to the plotting plus the
interface to this and that and then as
more people started using it more people
have specific needs and and requirements
for specific parts what we did was we
started using the advantage of having a
system that has a package mechanism just
like python has and then we started
chipping everything into separate pieces
and this helped all of those pieces
actually grow one thing that became a
problem at that moment is I how do you
make sure that everything works together
and then we rely on testing systems for
that so let me make sure that everything
runs nicely but other than that we
basically I mean by making everything in
the packages if someone has a
modification on something basically
anyone can do anything they want then
it's a package and if it is actually
helpful it's going to be used and if it
is something really orthogonal then that
package stays as it is and everyone uses
it the packages that we use in torch
day-to-day are not actually so we have a
we have a common place named get hub /
torch it's a project page and in there I
think there are something like 10 22 any
packages but those are really core
algorithms and anyone who's using torch
using many more packages from from from
other places like i did my personal
github or someone else's personal github
and those packages we rely on the fact
that people people keep good care of
them
if people don't and someone folks them
and they actually get used nicely and if
there's something important that we
think and we want it in towards
sometimes you fork it and put it in
torch and then we take care of it that
is also fine but in the end what is
important is need has to come from the
community rather than like I have
personal needs about what what what kind
of research I want to do and what kind
of packages I want i can I can talk
about those like I want to integrate
more distributed stuff into torch it can
be used in distributed environments
easily but there is no distributed
learning algorithm in touch but I mean
since we are interested in deep burning
it's a research topic by itself so I was
just thinking about that actually like
I've been thinking about this for a long
while since you could low-power rabbit I
checked already this is something that
we should actually make available I know
but it is like a fixed thing that comes
with wallpaper but it has to be I think
something that is just all reduce just
oh really okay so that I missed so then
we didn't use it and then there are
multiple like um parallel computing and
trading packages that we have that lets
you implement the logic of all videos I
think in the end that's what also
Clement it like we have a library where
you can do this like the tree structure
like you can push computation into those
and then get the gradients and such bag
and then they are implemented such that
you can pass any torture object so
whatever you want to do in any of those
you can do but still I mean these
doesn't solve the problem of how do you
do distribute to deep deep learning and
this is not a software project it's a
small like a research project and
whenever this happens of course it's
going to pop up as a package but I see
that this is one of the big questions
right now because with deep learning one
thing that has been proven itself as a
bigger is always better and faster is
always better because more data is
always better so we need to we need to
be able to scale these things up to up
to that regime and that's what that's
what we try to do so there's a paper
coming out
that I cats could make a speech ok press
conference about parallel training of
deep whatevers for speech so there's
there's multiple models there are
multiple models and I think we need to
go we need to implement them maybe and
get them but many of those require
specific systems that particular when I
don't know what it is so I'll read about
that do you okay so this is something
that also like I know that pretty much
any big lab that uses torch also has a
system where they use multiple GPUs at
the same time however none of those is
open source because at some point these
things become important for whoever
created them that like you don't have
much more realm incentive to make it
open source so I'm hoping people in
academia are actually if they use torch
and if they develop something like this
they would make open source because we
can't sort of i mean i have two heads
right yes i work in a company but when
it comes to torch it's a different thing
i can force anyone to actually make
anything open source so that is that is
pretty much as far as it goes about the
plants it's basically whatever people
want to do it's going to be there and if
there is actually some interesting idea
i think the only thing that sort of
anyone can put like by looking at the
history but i can say is if someone has
an interesting idea and once implemented
there has always been help on how to do
that and that we can definitely do and
we will do if someone has an interesting
idea then i'll put time into it to make
it work yes but in the end everything is
driven by researchers like we have been
listening from the diverse vm and john
and it's basically about research where
these projects go it's not about the
software or software that's it
