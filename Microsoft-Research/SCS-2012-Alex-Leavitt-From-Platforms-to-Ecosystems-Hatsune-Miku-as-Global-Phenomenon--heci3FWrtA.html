going to be talking about from platforms
to ecosystems to focus specifically on
away from the signal platforms to focus
on how media ecosystems expand online
and I'm going to be using one case study
which is this Japanese music chemical
Vocaloid oh this is both Lloyd control
which is the vocaloid phenomenon and
I'll show this quick video on so you can
get a sense of what this phenomenon is
actually comprised of
so you might recognize this as Hudson in
YouTube who is this teal haired virtual
sinc and basically she's a proprietary
voice synthesizer software you can buy
her 450 bucks the interesting thing is
that her entire fandom is completely
open source you can call it like an open
source culture and it's becoming
extremely large in Japan and it's
created both online phenomena but also
offline so there are many many events
around the country where people dress up
and sell Vocaloid goods and they even
have virtual concerts as well what which
actually premiere in LA it got some
popular in fact that it even was
featured in a Playboy centerfold in
Japan with one of the weed fashion
fashion models last year ugly and so
hopefully it is extremely big and it
really began online in fact on this
website Nika Nika Go Go which is in a
sense that kind of like the Japanese
YouTube and fans will use a software to
create 100,000 dozens and thousands of
videos and put them up online for free
and so families basically enter into
this open-source culture by consuming I
think are up to 250,000 songs were made
with this one software and they share it
online for free and then people will go
out of my songs and it has expand
requests many many platforms not just on
you can you go go go so for example this
is website kia pro where fans can upload
art that come with lyrics upload other
songs as well and it's all kept track of
through this commenting system and as a
refund system and this even left the GPL
and creative commons license this pier
40 character lessons meaning that you
can use as main eq across many many
different ways with two themes
derivative works and non-commercial
content karoke is another platform that
emerged
which basically revolutionize how people
with lessons oh boy music and it came so
popular that it actually redefined how
music is licensed in karaoke rooms in
Japan this is actually another piece of
software that was created on me beeping
gasps which you can add any power
outages and put that to videos so
basically it helps fan videos for
details what's the posing it is a move
your desk actually the number one use of
3d software in Japan right now and it's
free YouTube is actually another
interesting phenomenon too because all
these songs and videos that are uploaded
to need a judoka are reappointed to
youtube so for instance there are many
many kind of alternative communities
that emerge be a localized or Japanese
on YouTube that are not actually the
original ones and here you can see all
that occurring in this one person who
speaks English right in the middle and
so this is one really interesting piece
I don't think it's
well anyway so many of these songs are
being uploaded as you can see from this
right slide here one song if you jump
that you have exactly one song that was
derived from using us making software
and of course this one video that dude
over 60 million times on YouTube and one
thing that I'm really interested in is
how fans can appropriate this
open-source culture into their own lives
so this is one demo than actually doing
this projection in his own home using
open source software and a very
geometric projector so that is what will
