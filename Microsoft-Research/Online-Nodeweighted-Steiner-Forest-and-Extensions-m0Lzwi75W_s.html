you
yeah hi everyone it pleased to have
widely I got speaking today he's been
intern this summer and we finishing next
week and today he'll speak about some
online mode with the style network
design problems thanks everyone for
coming I hope that it can hear me
suppose so let's a joint work with the
ammonia and my advisor Mohammed and it's
about online not rated tiny air
connectivity so let's just go to the
basic definitions if we can okay so okay
let's see Weston was an online problem
an online problem the requests are
coming online and when you get a request
you have to make an irrevocable decision
to somehow serve that request but this
decision should be made without knowing
the future requests okay and how do we
measure the performance we say that okay
we compare our output of the algorithm
compared to the optimum wish knows all
the requests in advance so that's why we
call it offline optimum and a
competitive ratio is simply the worst
case ratio of our cost or offline
optimum the worse overall the input
sequences okay so what is Norway today
Steiner forest we have a graph with node
weights W and then there's a sequence of
pair of vertices simti and the goal is
to find the minimum cost sub graph which
connects every pair okay we can also
imagine edge weights but node weights
are more general you can simply put a
vertex on every edge with the weight
equal to the weight of that edge okay we
also assume that these SI t eyes and
they don't have any weight david is just
0 this is without loss of generality and
only simplifies the explanation okay so
this is not weighted vest i er forest
for example if we only have one demand s
1 T 1 then this would be the optimum
solution if we have s to mt to as well
this will be at the optimum solution
which can be disconnected that's kind of
why we called a shiner forest and then
if we get s3 and t3 some demands may
actually benefit by sharing and then the
optimum solution would change to this
okay so what's the online variant of the
problem we know the graph in advance is
very important but the sequence of
demands are coming online so after we
get a new SI TI we need to augment our
solution to actually keep a scion TI
connected but we can only buy new
vertices we cannot you know give back
the vertices that we have already
purchased okay that's why it's kind of
irrevocable right and we want to be
competitive against the offline optimal
okay so let's see some bad news about
these problems so H Tyler Forester
special case of a turn a forest the
standard 3 in which all the demands
share a common vertex which basically
means that we only have a set of
terminals and you need to connect
everybody to each other okay a special
case of note via text on a tree is the
set cover problem where we have a
universe of elements and given a
collection of subsets of these vertices
you need to choose the minimum number of
sets such that every element is covered
at least once okay and you can see why
this is a special case essentially for
every element if we determine all those
vertices which you want to connect and
for every set we also put the vertex and
connect every set to the elements which
are you know covered by that set and
then we put a special terminal here and
we asked all the terminals to be
connected so essentially connecting a
terminal to the root here means buying
one of these sets
right also note that set cover is only a
special case of node way to dash Niner
three because if you have only edge
weights for example if you move the
weight of these verses to the edges
actually this won't be a name is Yvonne
me a special case because the cost of
the set cover is too but now you can
actually find a cure out all the hair
all the terminals to the root with only
paying one okay so this is important
that in only not wit h 9 3 is more
general than set color so the bad news
is that for the online variant of set
cover you roughly can get a lower bound
of log is square so this means that for
all of these problems we have at least a
lower bound of log square in the online
variant okay so these are the bad news
let's see what has been the good news
for the first good news is that online
set cover can actually admit almost a
tight upper bound of large square and
this is due to Allah our brush as our
poop on there are no this whole
framework can also be generalized to
many other problems for example
non-metric facility location which is it
will get to this problem later and then
in 2011 so if you know or the molly jaan
mohit they actually develop the first
complete logarithm competitive algorithm
for standard three not with visionary by
giving a log square competitive
algorithm although the there is no known
generalization of their analysis to
assign a forest and they left Ashdown
Forest problem as an open problem okay
so what we are going to do this talk
we're going to give a lock cubed
competitive algorithm for not weighted
external forest unlike variant and then
we are going to you give a better
competitive algorithm actually look at
me
evaluative when the underlying graph is
planar or in general it excludes some
fixed edge as a minor and then we can
show that only the same guarantees
before planer and general case carries
over when a problem which is more
general the National Forest when the cut
constraints are kind of characterized by
some proper function which I'll probably
skip in this talk so which we
essentially try to design a kind of
framework of working with novated online
problems to deal with these two so sure
it's not depend on the value of
functions for any arbitrary high
connectivity as well I know it should be
a zero one proper function yeah yeah
here why proper I mean zero matter
suppose it was so can you lose a linear
factor our paths or something
I'm not yet actually not selected that's
so funny even the engine needs a lot of
it yeah so i will quickly go over our
approaching few slides and then i will
formalize everything from scratch so
first let's try to give a lower bound
for the optimum solution look at these
black boxes are the terminals and you
want to connect them somehow let's see
how we can get a lower bound so of
course one way to go is to write an LP
and then get the do all but we don't
need to explicitly go to that we just
use the ideas behind the dual kind of
vectors that we have so let's suppose
that for now suppose that the edges only
have weights and suppose that I'm
drawing some disks on every terminal
some of the terminals such that these
these are non-overlapping ok then I can
claim that the optimum solution is at
least the total radio of all these disks
why because the optimum solution should
connect these terminals so this means
that for every terminal the optimum
solution should come from outside the
disc and reach to the center which is
this terminal so essentially the optimum
solution has to pay the at least the
radius of this disc ok so the total
radio of all these discs is a lower
bound for opt and of course I want to
make them as big as I can so that I have
a better lower bound for all right but I
don't want them to have any intersection
any overlaps
so agree so essentially we will get to
the formal definition but essentially
means that it starts from the center and
just reach to every terminal which is
reachable by radius R okay just actually
thing just an intuitive one draw this
circle exactly if I were vain yes Tom
Brady's every I mean every dis can have
a radius now if you keep growing these
disks at some point so assume that these
are discs well they're not exactly this
but okay at some point you get into some
intersection that if you grow them a
little more than you'll hand over
overlap right so at this point we will
see that one natural way to deal with is
to somehow connect these centers these
terminals to each other by connecting
them to this intersection vertex such a
three-week-old Emma spiders and in the
center of the spider the only vertex
which can have degree at more than two
and these are the legs of the spider
okay you see a little more about them so
this is essentially the old disks
business that we have now let's try to
actually design an algorithm for each
rated variant okay so we have edge with
edge style forest online learning so one
greedy candidate is to just whenever you
get this new turn new endpoints of the
terminal smt simply kind of simply by
the shortest path but the shortest part
considering the previous verses that you
have purchased that you get a discount
basically you get them for free now find
a shortest path let's say the length is
D and then by that shortest path and to
try to pay for that shortest path try to
put a disc of radius almost d on either
S or T okay so you basically get smt
there is a shortest path d you buy these
pads and then you will try to buy disc
so I'll put this over a sortie let's say
with radius D over 44 just some constant
ok
if you can do this then you're really
happy right because you satisfy the
request and you put a disc here so this
means that you can charge the cost of
that shortest path to the radius of this
disc but the catch is that there might
be some previous disc here which have
intersection with both of discount s40
okay so essentially you won't be able to
buy you won't be able to put this disk
without overlaps issue audis d is
basically they play use the shortest
fast mapping you find that it weighs on
you yeah exactly okay yeah you can
assume that these are only edge weights
okay so it's kind of more intuitive
ideas so we won't be able to put this
disk instead you're going to do
something else we're going to connect s
to the car spending center here and
teach the corresponding center here okay
so what do I get now what do i get is
that now you of SN u of t are actually
connected in my current solution all
right they may have been connected
before but now I'm sure that they are
connected okay so what I'm going to use
and somehow I want to use this fact how
I'm going to say that okay assume that
the radius of these disks have been also
the same so almost all of these have the
same radius D over four then i can say
that this pata time this extra pass that
I'm buying the length of them is at most
D over 2 so this means that if you of su
sub s nu sub T have been already
connected I have a contradiction why
because I said that the shortest path
between S&amp;amp;T is d but if these guys have
been connected in my solution before
then I can go from s to hear paying less
than V over to then jump to UT with the
word say that I've already purchased and
then go from you t to t so this means
that my shortest path is actually less
than D which is a contradiction ok so
by actually doing this I can I'm sure
that us annuity have been connected
exactly in this instance in this step
right so this means that if I keep all
these with the same radius together then
every time that I have such an iteration
that I cannot put these in new DS I'm
reducing the number of connected
components these two have been
disconnected now they're connected okay
so what I'm going to do is that for
every power of two for every radius of
power of 2 i'm going to have a layer
such that all of these in that layer
have the radius 2 to the eye and then
whenever such an iteration happens that
i won't be able to put a new disk i'm
reducing the number of connected
components so this means that i can
charge the cost easier to the nudist a
time putting or if i'm not putting a new
disk i can charge it to the previous
disks but i can only reduce them by the
number of this that I have right so
that's one way that you can actually
solve the edge weighted variant which is
due to Burma and coldstone ok and let's
see what have what goes wrong in the
node weighted variant and not waited
variant the issue is that ok you can do
the same thing by the shortest path and
then try to put a disc but now the
intersection happens on the vertices so
you may get into intersection with many
discs at the same time on one single
vertex ok so the National generalization
would be to buy these yellow a spiders
and then hopefully say that ok I'm
reducing a number of connected
components and the same analysis right
but this doesn't happen because this
intersection vertex might be very
expensive it might be the cost of all
these a spider completely concentrated
on this vertex so this means that s and
T might actually be far from each other
because we have not for sure
these intersection vertices before so we
cannot say that these guys are
disconnected they might be actually
already connected so if even if you buy
these in spiders you may not be reducing
the number of connected component so
this argument fails but let's see if it
actually fails I mean how can we fix it
so for example if this degree is kind of
constant this yellow degree the number
of legs of this spider which is constant
then we can almost do the same trick
right instead the over for we put the
over some bigger constant so the nice
thing is that if the underlying graph is
planar we can argue that the average
degree of the average average basically
the number of legs is constant so
somehow we can actually a motorized over
the whole number of disks so tell you
again you still can pay for all the past
that you're buying by charging into a
number of disks that how we will see
that we can do it on for planar graphs
but for the general graphs this
completely fails I mean there is no
bound on them which means that we cannot
just greedily by these botha spiders so
we need to be more smarter essentially
we need to buy some of these
intersection vertices to somehow keep
them keep their connectivity structure
on them okay to do that we essentially
are trying to open a facility on leading
intersection of artisans and then
connect the clothes disk to essentially
this intersection vertex right so this
is the whole idea that the relation
between facility location that we will
see later the idea to you somehow by
these interests and we're intersection
where it is a little smaller okay but
then there are some the catch is that
it's not just the yellow spider that we
are buying you are also buying this
shortest path so we need to make sure
that these kind of facility location
needs to pay at least this much d
so that we can charge the cost of our
shortest path also do this facility
location so this was the whole framework
for kind of going to this problem but
let's formalize everything by starting
from disks so we formalize them as a
kind of painting you say that every
vertex has an area equal to its weight
and this curve radius R from a center T
essentially means coloring every area
which is reachable by distance R from
that center ok note that we are assuming
that terminals have 80 so the center's
you always have 80 to worry about
centers ok and then just to name some
vertices that will be useful we say that
the continent of the disk contains the
vertices which are which the distance to
the center is less than the radius ok
and it so this would be D these are the
vertices which are closer to the center
than the radius and the other vertices
which are distance is at least the
radius and they are partially colored
they'll be on the boundary of the disk
ok so every vertex on the boundary is at
least partially color and the verses say
and so what is boundary guy so and the
vectors inside are those which their
distance the center is a strictly less
than the radius turns on the boundary
are those which the distance essentially
minus their own weight is less than the
radius but the radius cannot exceed
their distance ok ok so it's just trying
to formalizing the intuition about this
I mean what's meaning to go over with
radius R ok definition that
this end results here because you just
buy less idea so anyway so you can just
essentially they don't even tell me
where pixels here you can without loss
of generality yeah nervous for example
at some point we have multiple disks on
one painting and we say that these are
non-overlapping if you are not over
coloring any vertex ok and then if for
example one vertex goes tight at the
intersection of multiple disks we are
interested in this binding a spider
which essentially connects the
intersection vertex two centers of those
disks ok when you see this watch into
the boundary yes well this essentially
is this coloring this painting that you
put there ok I'm going to over color
please love em you color one vertex more
than its weight I mean a vertex kind of
has a area equal to its weight right
like it it's just well and this is
essentially function right function
which and colors some portion of every
vertex right so if you put these discs
to each other you color more of a vertex
if it's backing of is essentially right
you can also give a dual interpretation
these are actually doing objects but you
just don't want to go to the primal-dual
wall yeah yeah yeah so we call this
binding is by Devin somewhere some
vertex at the boundary goes tight ok so
and as which as we talked for example if
you have suppose that all of these have
the same radius R for example if you
have C disks then C times are the lower
bound for opt if they are
non-overlapping and also for example if
you have a binding a spider which is at
the intersection of for example three
disks then the cost of this binding a
spider is three times are
let's from the center of the disk to the
intersection vertex is just our okay and
everything is tight right binding a
spider so these are some things that you
can verify by just looking at the
definition of the disk okay so let's go
to the algorithm the simpler one is for
planar graphs let's go with that one
this is kami also generalized to h1 here
free graphs well I'm sure most of you
know the definitions but just to be sure
we say a graph G is H one year free if
you cannot how basically however you
contract an edge or remove an edge you
won't be able to reach from G to edge ok
a famous example famous family is
basically planar graphs and there are
many interesting properties about each
one different graphs when H is a fixed
programmable constant size graph the
most important one that we are working
with this in this paper is that the
average degree of H manual free graphs
is actually constant ok for example for
planar graphs we know that is some 06 ok
so i'm just going to explain the exact
algorithm for h1n free graphs it's the
same idea that we had before so we get
this new terminals SNT you find a
shortest path between S&amp;amp;T but of course
with getting discount from the previous
with terminal previous word says that we
are purchased let's say that this task
that minimum distance is d then we first
we buy this shortest path so we will
satisfy this demand then we choose the
layer I which is roughly d over some big
enough constant mu ok this is just some
big enough concern don't worry about it
so we choose that layer I we have these
layers of powers of 2 for radius of the
disk
so layer i will contain these of radius
2 to the eye okay then provide assurance
pattern let me try to put a disc Center
dinner at S or T if I can put a disc
there without any overlaps then I'm
happy that's it but if both of them are
unsuccessful I'm going to buy this
binding as spiders at the intersection
that happens so to just see it let's say
that SNT are the new terminals and the
distance is d okay i'll i will buy this
shortest path i try to put a disc of
size roughly the over mu either on S or
T if I can put it without any overlap
then I'll just put it there and i'm
happy i will be able to kind of charge
my cost to the radius of this disc but
it is unsexed if it's not possible for
both of them then it's me that there are
some intersections here right both here
and here I'm just going to buy both of
these binding in spiders for example
here this is one binding a spider and is
the second binding a spider okay that's
the whole algorithm but why not in the
sector just one place making it's just p
1 and down the intersection the second
step is in necessary
and wine is binding is fine is it
possible with Tommy oh yes if it's
greedy then it's not companies and
complete with you but if you don't buy
this binding a spider then you're just
boring shortest path this means that you
are greedy and the whole idea is that
when you buy these extra binding as
foreigners your kind of giving discount
to your future self that you will be
able to actually go with short as past
there and because for the edge version
is not necessary ya mean you may lose
you lose a little bit of the diversion
but it's still here what for sir colin i
guess course that's our yeah yeah but
this is why yeah actually page where it
is not a special case I mean that said
other is not a special case of age
that's what the side cover lower bone
doesn't quite hold your it's a it's only
the planar case but they're still you
cannot do it a ton log in in general I'm
just got the stuff still filled so let's
see how we can analyze this again if we
want to just charge the cost of all
these paths that we are buying to the
radius of the disk now i can assume have
you only have log n layers I mean you
can scale down stuff so that we can only
you only need to keep pluggin layers and
then if i can actually successfully
charter custom my algorithm the radius
of the beast this will give me a log and
competitive algorithm that every layer
would be lower bound for off and i'm
only our blog and layers okay yeah sorry
so cookies week eat soon how do you do
one step like okay so yeah so whatever
you buy this shortest up okay I'm 50
okay I try to put them discount and the
over mu in the layer which is put the
overview right so you essentially put a
layer I such a new times through the I
is less than 40 okay so you go to your
lair and you try to put this on s if you
guys don't have any overlap you're not
okay if it's if there is no one lap you
try it for 30 k if it again if there's
an overlap then you just you just borrow
these bonding a spider that's it if you
don't put any disk instead you buy this
part in your spiders and what is a
binding spider again and if you cannot
put a disc in on here this means our
there's an intersection which previously
so what is the center of the spider
tattoo bar at the intersection vertex
intersection vertex is caused by putting
the new DS with previous disks okay so
if you want to buy such a brilliant new
disc here then you get into intersection
with these two previous list for example
at least birthdays you may have
different intervention which terminals
are involved in buying the spider and
these centers of the discs which are
touching this intersection methods
so far only two days on the mountain yes
and the new one example and of course
the new 1s 19 I mean Buddha over there
you may intercept separate sets no take
taken anyone does not old yeah just one
single vertex once intersection graphics
for s and one intersection with expert
ski so now I total cost is the cost of
the shortest half a time Boing plus the
possible binding is finer than I made by
so if i can so i have two different
equations i think i can start this will
put a disc or i will need to borrow
inviting spiders and if i can
successfully put at least that I'm happy
because I'm putting a distal roughly
radius D and only paying me so I can
charge it that's good by the way be
buying these spiders there are two cases
here the first case is that one of these
spiders is expensive it has many legs
but many I mean it has at least new legs
the second case is that both of these
spiders are cheap they have at most new-
walnuts ok
so I distinguish between these two
different cases so just make sure was it
worked less so in terms of all these
parameters was the path of the spider is
it inspire is essentially the number of
legs hung the radius that's an upper
bound because this might be very close
so essentially been criticized on this
good exactly but both as far as our
cheese this means that I mean this whole
spiders business is just a constant
times D second radius for children this
is the musical music on star which is
related to the average degree of my
planer or Hispanic Libra once the
constant okay so exactly if both as far
as our chief then I can use the same
argument errors in edge weighted and say
that I'm actually reducing the number of
connected component basically I'm
definitely collecting all these previous
this to each other but then they are
constant I can claim that and these guys
have been actually disconnected before
otherwise there will be a contradiction
with the fact that my shortest path is d
so this can be deal with it like the
edge rated variant that's fun the couch
is happen I'm actually buying an
expensive spider so the waiting the
objective is to share is to show that
the total number of legs of all these
expensive spider fly by in layer I for
example is that most a number of discs
in that layer oh if I can show this
there can ok the total cotton and paying
for expensive as fighters is the number
of their legs times the radius R if I
can show that the number of legs is in O
of the number of disks then I know that
i already have essentially all times the
number of these as a lower bound for opt
right so then i can relate it again
still amortize the cost of the legs to
the rating of the beasts okay and for
that just average degrees
no you need it to be a you need to
contract them so that's why is my nephew
so it's just proof about a picture why
have that so these are my disks and
assume that these are non-overlapping
well it's real hard to draw those the
Bluebird theses are the standards of the
beasts in my lair the blackberry cells
are the Centers of the expensive aspires
and the legs are these and a black and
them edges and these are the new
unsuccessful terminals that are trying
to play them now but I have this issue
so I know that these are expensive as
father so this is at least new number of
legs here so first I'm going to ignore
this one extra leg which is connected to
smt i can double charge it to the other
edges that's fun now we'll use the fact
that if you have not overlapping disks
this whole intersection these
intersection vertices are only on the
boundaries of these lists you can check
that because I intersection vertex is
shared between two disks and a vertex
inside the disk can be shared with
another disk because when you're inside
you're fully colored with deb disk
another this cannot have any sharing you
so these black vertices are actually on
the boundaries so what i'm going to do
is you just contract all the continent
of every disk to its center and then
what i have is just a bipartite graph
between the centers of the disks blue
versus and the centers of expensive as
fighters what i want to do is to show
that the number of legs is in O of the
number of beluga thesis because blue vs.
are the number of these legs are legs
are my expensive
spiders that's all thing I they want to
show right i CZ and that's similar to
their knives of internal migration kind
of red like the government's movement
yeah what's been obsessing so
essentially you have been in almost all
the net for keys on a schmuck perhaps
you need to use it back mince pie okay
if you can track them here is still each
money free so you have this nice
property that the average deeper but it
just soak up every craft basically as we
showed our love in the client main haha
so the average degree is at most out for
edge for all the graph the steelers
monthly the black practices the minimum
degrees and foliage these are expensive
as further than number of legs at least
our fudge so this means that the blue
vertices the thing is at most efficient
because in average x alpha one side of
my paragraph is at least alpha every
single one of them so the average of all
these blue versus our most powerful so
if i have a bipartite graph such that
one side is average degrees constant
alpha this means that the number of
edges the number of legs that most of
the number of blue purchases okay the
number of these expensive legs that most
involve blue algae cells and that's why
i can essentially charge the cost of all
these expensive edges expensive length
to the radius of disks so the three
black nodes are black nodes at the
different time for the unwary TS it it's
lot of the same
at the end of algorithms just answer
every layer we have this other picture
here this bipartite graph but this is
for every layer separately the radiuses
can be mixed so that was for the planar
now let's see what we can do for the
general case okay so as I promised this
has something to do with non-metric
classification let's define this problem
in no metric fast education problem we
have a set of clients and a set of
facilities issue the opening cost if you
want an open the faster that you need to
pay this much and every client if you
want to connect it to a facility you
need to put the weight which is written
on that edge okay and then some of the
clients are active which essentially
means that you need to connect those
clients to some open facilities for
example if you want to connect all the
clients in this problem then the optimum
solution would be this you need to open
facilities here and here and then by
these edges ok well nice thing is that
the kind of general approach of Allen at
all you can get a longer square
competitive algorithm in the online
variant of this problem okay so we will
use this algorithm as a black box so
let's see how we want to do this
come on
so um give it a network and a radius R
i'm going to introduce an hour bounded
facility location instance I just call
it our bfl the way that follows so for
example let's say I'm trying to make a
for bfl instance what I do is that for
every terminal here I'll put a client
and for every other vertex I'm going to
put a facility the cost of opening a
facility would be simply the cost of
that vertex okay now now the radius
comes in play when the radius is for
example are for every terminal I'll put
it disk of radius R on that terminal and
connect them connect the center to the
boundaries of the verses on the boundary
of that disk for example here the radius
is very small it's just for so the
vertices on the boundary of this disc is
this 5 and 6 and for this disc is just 5
the cost on the edge would be simply the
shortest path from that terminal to that
vertex excluding the cost of that vertex
for example here it's all 0 because you
know the radius is very small for
example if you consider HB FL instance
again for every terminal you have a
client for every vertex you have a
facility now you could have disk of
radius 8 or t1 the vertices on the
boundary are three and four so you will
connect t12 these two and the cost on
every edge will the shortest path of t1
to that vertex excluding its own cost so
for example for this guy the shortest
path would be through the five for this
guy the shortest path would be through 6
ok
so for example I'm sure that the cost on
these edges is a strictly less is say is
strictly less than eight right because a
vertex on the boundary the distance for
reaching it should be at mu star should
be such Alesana ok and then 42 I will do
the same I will put a disc of radius 8
over it let's see who's on the boundary
these three and four and the shortest
path to them is just five so this would
be my our bfl instance ok clients will
be terminals vertices will be facilities
and for every terminal I put the disk of
radius R and connect it to the vertices
on this boundary ok so that's just
formalizing what we had in the previous
slide this is my RB FL instances ok in
my algorithm I'm going instead of having
log n paintings I'm going to have log n
layers of our bfl such that for every I
i have a two to the ID FL instance ok
these are going to help me essentially
by these kind of spiders in some sense
ok so my algorithm how it's going to
work is that I have this graph and my
two to the lbfm instances whenever I get
a new terminal TI I'll by the shortest
path and do some process here then if a
condition holds I will give this new
terminal to one of my bfl instances then
I'm going to use the log square
comparative algorithm as a black box to
solve this vfl instance and whatever
that algorithm
as in that vfl instance I am just going
to mimic it in my solution so if it's
going to open a facility I'm going to
buy the corresponding vertex here if
it's going to buy one edge I'm going to
buy the card spending path in my
solution okay so that's how it's going
to work my algorithm okay now I want to
say that what is this condition that
only sometimes I kind of consult with my
BF Ellen sensors the condition is it
kind of neighborhood clearance which is
which is kind of symmetric to the fact
that so we are always trying to put a
disc right if it was not it there wasn't
any overlap here we have the same kind
of situation which we kind of call it
call it neighborhood clearance it's some
kind of having no overlap you see that
giving a terminal t2 layer I it it has a
neighborhood clearance if first there is
no open facility close to this terminal
this client essentially and this client
is at least two to the I plus 1 far from
all the previous clients which have
arrived at that instance if these two
conditions holds then we say that ok
there is neighborhood clearance for
putting term for giving terminal t2 this
layer ok and if this clearance fails
this means that there is one open fast
there is either one open facility close
to that client or there is one of the
previous clients close to that guy we
call that either open facility or client
we call it the witness of this failure
okay so show you go over it again the
neighbor clearance so we are Troy
this is for special case of tiny trees
describe me first no no it's not part in
general then you have you have this
delicious what I bought it yes for now
just one terminal trying to go to layer
I if you if I want to give it to layer I
I should have neighborhood clearance it
is something like saying that there is
no overlap somehow okay now what is my
exact algorithm so my algorithm is the
same that has completed same speed we
say that you giving you demand SNT find
the shortest path width length the boil
at shortest path now try to give this
give either S or T to the lair I such
that well layer I such that the radius
is roughly do verse for right now music
very small constant just do or four okay
so essentially if either S or T either
one of them has neighborhood clearance
in that layer I i will give this it I
will give it as a new client to that
layer and then just mimic the solution
of that layer other voice this means
that both of them essentially none of
them have any neighborhood clearance so
we boil the path from s and T and
connect them to the corresponding
witnesses ok so the witness if you don't
have level clearance this means that
something is near to that something is
close to that vertex it an open facility
or one of the previous clients in that
layer the witness of failure is that
vertex which is too close to that guy
too close means actually due to the I at
least better once I knew he was near
okay so one of these two is failing
right so this means that there's already
an open fastenings there or one of the
previous clients in that terminal is too
close okay okay and that caused nothing
that is close is the witness of my
failure so if both of them are failing
I'll just connect each one to scare
expanding witness of course there might
be many witnesses well just any of them
one of them
so that's no longer term so let's see d
let's just put some names on these and
the terms here the first thing is that
for every layer I i'll define I the
optimum solution offline optimum
solution for that vfl instance as opt
sub I ok and the online essentially
mapping for that vfl instance i'll call
it m sub i essentially the mapping that
my online black box algorithm is buying
that is MI and then i will say an
iteration is type i if I'm giving my
clients to layer I essentially four
times to do the I is less than D mu here
is just for ok now what I'm going to
prove this is by just proving two facts
first are going to say that opt sub I
for every layer is actually a lower
bound for the optimum solution to the
schneider forest this will be easy if we
just proved my picture next I'm going to
say that the total cost of type IE
trations are closely related to the cost
of my mapping in every layer ok now note
that if I can prove these two then I'm
done then I have a lock cube combative
algorithm why because the cost of my
type I iterations would inviting all in
my in calera so at each time there's a
mapping of clients to facilities in
every layer so I'm the online algorithm
for facility location is connecting the
clients to some of these facilities
right so it's kind of a mapping so if
Alison's yeah yeah yeah so both of them
have this sub I so these are about bfl
instances the offline optima of the
geffen instance and the online solution
for that we have an instance okay so if
I prove that cost of my type I
iterations are bounded by cost of em I
then I know that because of that black
box the cost of em I is that most log X
square x opt I and by this lemma here I
know that this is also less than log x
squared times opt so the cost of my type
I trations would be at most log squared
times up and I have at most log NS log n
layers so we get a log in log Q right so
I just need to prove these two the first
one is easy just to show that applies
listen up then we go over for this one
so first let's try to show that the
optimum solution for every facility
location instance is actually less than
the cost of my external forest so let's
say that these are the clients in my fat
simplification instance and I have these
these sub radius 2 to the I of course
they may have some overlaps I mean if
you just put a disc of radius 2 2 I let
me have overlaps thus that was the whole
issue but if you have an overlap since
at every time that we get a new client
we have neighborhood clearance this
means that these centers there are at
least two to the I plus 1 far from each
other that was a condition of
neighborhood clearance that the two
centers should be far from each other
when they are far from each other to to
the I plus 1 essentially twice the
radius far from each other the only
intersection that can happen is on the
boundaries which fortunately I have one
possible facility for every vertex on
their boundaries right
so just consider the optimum solution
for the standard forest which is
connecting these centers so it's coming
from outside every disc and reaches
inside right so what I'm going to do I'm
just going to give a solution for my
facility location by just opening your
facility wherever this optimum solution
is touching a boundary of one of these
disks I'm just going to open a facility
there and then I'm just going to connect
the center of every disk to one of the
open facilities on this boundary
according to all so now this would be a
valid and feasible solution for my
facility location instance so of course
up to I as cost less than this so up to
I is at most apt good any questions
about this
so if you just give me any optimum
solution for external forest it is touch
it's touching every boundary so just
open a facility on that boundary on
those intersection and then i will just
connect the center to one of the
vertices this will be a valid feasible
solution so opt eyes listen up so all
that remains is to show that cost of
type o iterations is that most the cost
of the online algorithm for that
facility location instance then I'm done
then I have a lot cube algorithm so
again my total cost is the cost of the
shortest path and the possible paths to
the witnesses plus the cost of
simulating the past implication instance
so by D finishing the cost of
stimulation is that most cost of em I
that i'm just going to just buy
everything that emma is buying so of
course the less than that okay now to
show that to show that these two cars
some of shortest path plus the path to
the witnesses is that most true to the
eye so remember that to to the eye is
essentially the cost of D the shortest
path the radius of these disks okay you
sure this effort that you put into this
slice but I mention that the color
quality is not random at all right so
the green color is equal to the sum of
these two things and the two things are
blue and yellow so if you had the
spectrum element
get to be feasible so nice so yeah so so
I need to prove these two facts to
essentially show that the total sum here
is to do the I these two facts are first
showing that the number of type I
trations are actually all of the number
of clients in their eye so even though
some of times sometimes I don't give a
new client it's a still fine so still
the number of titration is kind of odd
number of clients in that layer and then
I will show that every time that I give
a new client to that to that layer my
end this mi incur the cost of at least
two to the eye if I can showed both of
these iterations both of these kind of
facts then I know that okay the total
cost and I'm paying here is some
constant times to do I then I get that
okay so these are in awe of the number
of clients and for every client mi incur
the cost of at least 22 I swarmed up so
let's see these two facts actually the
second one is easier the fact that mi
incur the cost of at least two to the
eye why because every time that you get
a new client you have neighborhood
clearance which means that there is no
open facility close to this guy so if mi
is going to connect this new client it
has to open a new facility and also by
the edge connecting it to that open
facility but this means going from the
center of a disk to the two one vertex
on the bound on its boundary and also
buying that vertex so this would be at
least the radius of that disk which is 2
to the eye so whenever you get a new
client in that instance mi has to pay at
least to do the eye okay because it has
to open a new facility I'm connected to
that terminal so i'm good for here now i
just want to show that
you just remains true that the type
alterations are actually a number of
clients how alluded is just saying that
okay the good thing is that if there is
a witness it's in an open facility or
someone close to me if it's an open
facility it's already purchased so if I
want to get connected to it I need to
pay less than 2 to the eye well it's on
my boundary boundary of discover ideas
to do I so my part it is less than to
the eye and if it's some other terminal
which is close to me so I know it's
close to me so again i need to pay at
most off to to the eye to connect to
that guy ok so for smt to get connected
to their witnesses you pay at most due
to the eye so this so this means that if
these two witnesses if they are actually
connected before this iteration then I
have a contradiction but if you put
these two to the eyes together this
would be less than D my shortest path so
actually whenever I'm buying whenever I
have this iteration that I actually
bypass the witnesses I'm reducing the
number of connected components so again
I can do the same old argument and
saying that ok I can pay that with the
disks here so the number of actual
iteration that I do are actually equal
to the I mean all of the number of
actually I post twice the number of
clients in that layer ok so for every
type I iteration my cast is in off to to
the eye and mi is also paying almost
through the eye so my cost is bounded to
the cost of mi now since my class is
bounded to the cost of em I I know that
because of the property of my black box
it's bounded with a factor of large
square to the cost of my optimum
solution so this means that i pay at
most log cube because i have login
players
so just to wrap up so we are using this
this painting as framework which helps
the lot in simplifying the node weighted
kind of standard connectivity problems
might help us in some other problems
also you can also generalized these
results for price collecting variance so
when you see what is it is this Benji
you need something more than just friend
it is probably what it's complete
primal-dual but they like this scene in
English well one thing is that you
shouldn't so one thing that we kind of
insist on it is that you shouldn't merge
these modes so you usually have these
dual modes that you merge them to each
other and that makes things very hard
that's well things gets complicated and
that would be hard to analyze
essentially the whole thing that we are
insisting here that these disks you
don't need to mix them especially for
node waited and this actually helps in
some sense that's the whole thing about
difference that the thing that we are
saying is new compared to the normal
mode growing when you need to do
essentially connecting with these
bunnies but I don't merge them in this
location and that's thank you so if any
questions any part
that's twitter
so but it doesn't generalize directly to
our backs yes maybe
not so what's new we all right Helen is
good right d not enough rent a plane no
it's not straightforward no not just the
only happy for two connected i guess you
look like a monster something yeah i'm
at a few people can you get more even
our max is not visits no I think it's
not gonna be a norm about massive not
but here in Lake forgets connectivity
online no nothing ok so far edge costs
first then casa y SI ya so edge costs
there is a ritual to do yeah so there is
very soulful paper to it yeah there's a
place of paper by than others which does
does it but it uses use a structure that
don't don't weights don't have so for
example it gives us a metric of the
disease so it was for all hatim to do it
does yeah I think it gives our max there
is a kind of full note way to move like
to move it for often novated you can
actually get if I guess at the are
friends but yeah it's complicated so and
it's not exactly primal dual really miss
us yes it's a it's a better way to talk
so it at a very high level what it does
is come up comes up with a
generalization of spiders too k
connectivity but it's a very complicated
generalizations
