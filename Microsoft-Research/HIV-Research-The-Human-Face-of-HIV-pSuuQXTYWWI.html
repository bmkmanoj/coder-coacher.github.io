live in south africa hi I thought my
life was over the first time I came to
South Africa I was completely unprepared
I had no idea of the extent of the
epidemic it's really hard to put this
project down at night to leave the
office I know that just the time i'm
going to sleep thousands of individuals
will die from HIV people told us that if
you hiv-positive you you did i'm not
going to leave this project is very
personal to me having gone down to South
Africa with Bruce to visit the
hospital's down there and just people's
homes people infected with HIV it's
absolutely horrible to see what it's
doing to their lives and that's really
what led us through our collaborators to
launch a more aggressive effort at
trying to bring solutions to the problem
so one of the biggest challenges in
building a vaccine for HIV is that HIV
mutates a lot you can't just take a
single individual and look at the HIV
that they have maybe following over time
and figure out what's going on
so what Bruce and his team has been able
to do is to get data from many many
different individuals
so in South Africa women bear the brunt
of the HIV epidemic so much so that if
you look at pregnant woman walking into
the clinic that by age 21 in three
already have HIV infection I mean it's a
striking figure purity is an amazing
young woman she started treatment when
she was really sick she's a very
positive mind and somebody very
enthusiastic about life has big goals
and ambitions and excitement about life
which when we man here it was at the
stage where she felt like my life has
just been shattered it's about the
breakdown in family structure it is a
legacy of apartheid it is a legacy of
colonialism and what you had was you had
the destruction of family life my print
died and left us with noble here in this
house
I'm so painful for muscle you didn't
have food you have nobody was reeking
then until your assistant got a job she
is an orphan who made it possible for
her siblings to leave a manageable life
so that to me tells me that purity is a
woman of power woman of strength and I
really admire her courage there is
always hope these homes only and thank
you today and you here with me I'm fine
so the collaboration with Bruce and the
South Africa team it's very fluid
there's so much data being generated I
realized that we had this algorithm that
could help him so he gave us the problem
one Friday night and by Monday morning
we had a solution for him and that's the
sort of thing
that David and others have been able to
bring to this problem is to take massive
computing power and novel innovative
algorithms and allow us then with a
vaccine to try and make the virus
something it can't be force it to become
what it doesn't want to be there by
crippling it and thereby hopefully
getting the upper hand if I meant
somebody with HIV oh I would tell them
to hold on they still like these hope
take they must rail that because that
just give me call dreams dreams and
dreams hopes yeah
I firmly believe this is a solvable
problem and I and many other people have
devoted our careers to this and we're
going to continue working on it until we
succeed I love my job I get to come to
work every day and to work on things
that have high impact of society HIV
vaccine design and we're making great
progress it it will be true a dream come
true it should be dream come true for me
yeah they say anything is possible
