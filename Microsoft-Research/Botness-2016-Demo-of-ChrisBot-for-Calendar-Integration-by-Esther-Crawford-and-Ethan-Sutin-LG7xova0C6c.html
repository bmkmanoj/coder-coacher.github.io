weeks ago I launched this personal bot
called s turbot and it was really just
like an MVP to see what it would be like
to conduct like a job search with a bot
and to have me created in some sort of
like persona I launched it on messenger
tell about telegram &amp;amp; SMS but mostly it
was used on messenger there were like
tens of thousands of interactions and so
some of the key learnings that came out
of that is that structure really helps
at least right now having when I
switched from individual messages to
where you could like text the response
to two then actually having just buttons
that made the interaction let's go way
up and people seemed a lot happier with
it I saw that there was this challenge
of navigation with the invisible you I
so in this next iteration I wanted to
like try to work on solving that and I
also felt like integrations were an
opportunity my first version was didn't
have any integration so this one we
added some I thought it'd be fun to keep
personality in there and I put my bought
on hired it created like a summary I put
it at the top of my summary hired as a
recruitment platform I just wanted to
see how would recruiters interact with
the bot and four out of five of the
interview requests that I got through
that platform alone referenced things
found really deep down in my bot and so
things related to like values and
company culture so I thought that was
like a pretty interesting exercise so
this is going to be version 2 and this
time around I did it for someone else I
actually did it for Chris and so this is
actually a Chris pot it's true we were
just working on it yes brand new we were
just pushing yeah
oh is it distracting is that bigger oh
okay I just ignore all the junk yeah so
we just want to show you the calendar
integration okay so yeah so when you
start when you start to chat so presume
the presume that you found this through
probably Chris's Twitter account instead
of going to his about Tommy page you
might go to the spot instead or from his
about me page you might redirected to
the spot thanks ben Brown so when we get
started it's going to give a little bit
of insight about how the navigation
works so we're using emoji as a key for
the navigation this is like essentially
your home menu we've got here about a
product hunt which is something that
Chris is really passionate about and he
uses a lot and a way to connect with him
and then finally this is the last panel
is like our ad for being able to capture
users and recommend other BOTS so let's
start with product hunt we did an
integration a lot of people who are
reaching out to him or reaching out to
him because they want him to hunt their
product so this this version right now
it goes into a tight form so you can you
know go ahead and he can capture
information and he can hunt your product
for you if you want we want to
eventually like actually put that in
into the experience itself but this is
like the first version of it and you can
see his recent hunts here live from the
product on API can you hear me sorry
yeah so point in from the product on API
so that's like our first integration and
we kind of see that you know for a
personal but you know everybody has
content on the various platforms and
you'd be a
to customize which integrations you
select pull in data from from all your
different services she also is showing
here the recent comments so it we're
also going to pull in you know what is
Chris commenting on now do we lose the
video sorry very opportunistic with the
sleep okay yeah so so yeah these are
just a couple of the couple yeah I sorry
a couple of the integrations now I'll
hand it back to her but just on note on
the navigation so Lester came up with a
really cool idea of using kind of emoji
base to tag towards the dialogue because
if you noticed if you've ever used
Esther bot it was very conversational
but also very strict and if you went off
the rails then it was hard to figure go
your way back and so this is much more
dialogue approach or a structured
approach ok so next we can kind of look
at the about section and wow so many
Twitter followers happening guys cool so
yeah we could dig in further into his
history we're not going to do that and
we could look at articles or podcasts
that he's appeared in listen to things
that he's usually these are like you
know interviews he's done things he's
written Wow alright guys clearly I
should have turned Twitter notifications
off okay um we can also go up here too
let's go ahead in back to home okay so
events so we integrated a calendar his
his calendar um we had him create like a
public events calendar so to make sure
that only the events that showed up were
once he wouldn't mind other people
seeing kind of an interesting thought
here is that you can actually click off
to the to the event itself if you really
wanted to or you could even add
to your own calendar so the way the
integration works with google calendar
is it simply uh you register a calendar
with it for your events and the events
just will auto-populate and if you would
attach an image in a link it will pull
that straight out of google calendar so
all you have to do is add an event and
it automatically show up for you okay
and we're clearly not prepared for this
but you know this is real life right
here ok so the connect so one of the
things that we thought would be kind of
cool one of the things people really
liked about Esther bot was that I could
jump in there was a way to signal hey
you want to connect directly with Esther
and chat with her live it was really
overwhelming though because their people
might connect try to connect with me in
the middle the night or a bunch of
people might try to connect at the same
time so in this version and I've created
it so that you can actually schedule
times and it's kind of like office hours
on messenger for Chris and he has a
calendar that connects into this and so
I'll go here and just say okay I want to
schedule this time when I know Chris is
going to be live and then I'm going to
add that to my calendar and you can see
on here we actually have the calendars
we have to so we created two calendars
that we've registered with the bot the
events which you just saw which pulls
into speaking events then we have this
office on the office hours calendar and
she just booked on the the Thursday so
if if we go to the what time slot Oh
Tuesday TT so here you can see it's
updated with the number of people who
have registered for that slot because
Chris can obviously talk to more people
than one and if you are actually look
inside the event details we've we've
gone ahead and created a list and it'll
it'll keep a pending people as they add
and we can't put their email in because
face
book doesn't allow you to pull the email
from the graph yet that's one of the
things we're most excited about the
platform is opening up more of the graph
to developers because that's where the
real power is and being able to connect
people but sadly that's not possible yet
so we're just using the public name
which is the best we can do but at least
he'll have you know a sense of how many
people who's going to be talking to and
roughly who they are the other thing we
added is kind of this secret admin panel
so we can either type it or we could use
a so the other thing we added is the
secret admin panel you can type in admin
or you could actually use like an emoji
latke we have a couple of emoji that
unlocks it this is only for Chris
obviously he could give access to other
people so I have access to right now but
this is like a way to manage what's
happening in messenger for you so we've
got broadcasting messages out a look at
the live chats that he has scheduled and
being able to like start a scheduled
chat with just the subset of users
who've actually scheduled for that time
so that not everybody you know goes live
so the way works is when it's
approaching the time he'll get a
notification as the admin hey you have a
schedule in scheduled office hours
coming up he'll get the message he can
go to the admin and when he's ready he
can say start scheduled chat that will
push out a message to everybody who's
scheduled like hey chris is live now you
know ask him anything you know or you
know it's kind of the idea is to be like
a more personal real-time intimate kind
of ask me anything or people can you
know use it for whatever case they have
but that's the general concept yeah and
then just some like basic analytics of
the number of people who are interacting
with your bot so we'll go ahead and do
the broadcast right now this just says
you know how many people are accessing
Chris's bot so I'm going to go ahead and
send a message so this is a wide
broadcast this when you click on send to
all only four people have used it
because it's brand new but this is going
to broadcast wide to everybody yep so
once I click send it's going
uh ask me if I want to add anything else
to that message or if that's the final
message that's good enough and there it
is so it sent out to everybody who's
broadcasted to ya who's falling
following him and one one last thing I i
will share so I told you that there's
like a little add component that we have
as the last panel in the home this is in
order to capture people's info because
we want to keep getting people to sign
up for it we also thought it'd be fun to
recommend other people we're just doing
this for fun obviously these people
aren't on it right now since this is the
first one but if we had other other
people we would go ahead and and put
their BOTS and you could link off to
them as a way of adding personality we
have some like Easter eggs in here so if
you know Chris you know he really likes
to drink and so if you send like a
cocktail emoji you'll get his real a
real list from his bar notes account
which is one of his very used apps so
yeah that's that's it that's all we got
yeah so it's not quite live it's going
to be live in a couple of days we're
just working a few of the kinks yeah and
then you'll be able to go chat with it
he'll put it I'm gonna heal product hunt
it it is yeah that's Esther bought calm
yeah it's going to be Messina bot
actually uh also I'd like to do a group
chat later about personal bots so anyone
interested we could have a more in-depth
discussion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
