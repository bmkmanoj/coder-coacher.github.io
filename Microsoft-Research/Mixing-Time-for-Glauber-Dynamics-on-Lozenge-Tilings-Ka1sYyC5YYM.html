you
okay hi everyone it's a pleasure to have
a Benoit lolly a from the University of
Leon and he'll be talking about it's not
a new title but he'll be talking about
the global dynamics for mixing times of
global dynamics for Los Angeles so thank
you for the invitation for the
opportunity to talk yes title is moving
around if so what I will be talking
about is a loss on styling or
equivalently Ising model on c3 or
interface of the incident using model on
c3 at zero temperature so normally
everybody view has seen that this tiling
can be seen as a stack of cubes and so
it's exactly equivalent to some to one
configuration of easing model with
boundary condition data everything below
the curve in c3 given by the contour is
a say plus and full cubes and everything
above is minus and invisible human bc it
from height because it's convenient to
parameterize such tidying by height
function and here we will choose to for
site function for each intersection of
to Los Angeles we will put the Z
coordinate of the associated stack of
cube so just like we could work also and
fall with ouzo tidings such as dominio
tidings and this is how we can see
Domino tiling as something in in r3 but
it's much less clear in the picture so
we'll stick to with Los Angeles so we
will be interested and in the asymptotic
behavior for very large domain when this
height on the mondavi converge to some
fixed curve in the r3 and can consider
that the size of two cubes goes as one
over L and as you see in the picture you
have quite a rich behavior which you
know of course they will ok well off for
the typical configuration so it can have
places like this one law
no break-ins yes this one is Rick
canyons in his paper with Oakland curves
this one I don't remember which paper it
is anyway so you have region where all
listeners are aligned which we will call
frozen region I will be important after
world and region in the Middle where you
see some random configuration that will
be called liquid region and if we have a
law of large numbers this typical tiling
converters to some deterministic height
function depending on the answer
boundary and one potent special case is
when the boundary is contained in to
some plane and then the GSM tajik I
function is planner so now what we have
looked at it the global dynamics on
these tilings so achieve the we make
move consider adding or removing just
one cube from from the stack so going
from something on the left
see occurrence in the right there so if
we in terms of diamonds but only its
rotating three diners around one phase
and the time scale we consider is that
every face so every intersection has a
rate one clock and so we know in one
unit time you have order l square moves
and yeah and for this chain or main
results are the flying so let gamma be a
boundary curve
such that h infinity the deterministic
limit thing height function has no
frozen our region so it's only it's
liquid everywhere then with high
probability if we consider h l at time 2
plus
or lips so if we consider as height
function with scale l and at a time l
square up to a small rural town then
it's macroscopically speaking very close
to the equilibrium shape note that here
this epsilon is mean you still need
epsilon times L cubed to you allow
macroscopic change but so this and
another result is if gamma is say cut
from an hexagonal each infinities and so
mixing time this time is equals
so what do I mean as cut from the annex
agonal h infinity you consider this big
hexagon and you draw a curve inside the
liquid phase and actually you need there
you don't you are not allowed to go up
to the boundary of the big face you have
to stay strictly inside then this gives
you a curve in r3 which you can use as
boundary condition and for these
boundary conditions we have released a
mixing time versions
into Facebook the first is not really a
mixing time the second is really the
mixing time for Rosenstein Inc so you
with the violation distance and yes the
first one is much weaker so you have no
information on local structure oh we
could whether it's not that it is
implied by second
when those boy in the second in the
first also have some concentration
information about the state fair in
distribution plus 15 years yes but this
information about the stationary
distribution it's a well known since
actually prop results so first theorem
yes so if there is a frozen region then
what do we know this is actually all
more true and if there is a frozen
region we the best results are I think L
thick to the six or we know that it's
polynomial and but but we don't know
what happens we're about the cheapest
one yes we think that it is l 22 plus 0
of 1 but as you'll see to get this L 2
we have to follow and understand quite
closely the all the relation with mean
curvature motion and and if we have
frozen region than the lot of things I'm
some ability could die will diverge
surface tension becomes angular and and
we see this problem in the proof so so
how does we prove this time we will do a
recursion on things that will define the
deterministic
yeah deterministic surface that will
slowly move towards h infinity and
iteratively shows that we will stay with
very high probability below this
interface so it's really the same kind
of ID as what was on first with bye
Fabio Fabio Martinelli you talk up to
and phosphorus aminos and so we show
that but the real difference between the
planner case at seeded and non planar
case is that we have to be more careful
in the definition of this evolving
interface and we have to use more
complicated than fluctuation estimates
so i will get more precisely we will
define you also and our moving interface
raised like magic yes but i have also
pictures yes i can you read if i write
the few thing here ok son i will try to
keep it here and so this CT will be
equals to the h infinity ok plus we r
epsilon 1 minus t / l 2 plus little of
one and some function sigh which give
will give us it's over shape and ok can
give that's a lot constant minus
but
ok so we define or shape it's basically
something that will when she will become
of order l2 plus literal of one it will
become very close to h infinity it ok it
can start at distance to epsilon because
if we know how to go from distance to
epsilon to distance epsilon then we just
have to do this argument 1 over epsilon
time and since epsilon is constant and
we are losing L to the little o of 1
which is still diverging it's not unsure
so and and we will have the following
recursion so for all g graters and so
say
some Ellen times l and c g is lower than
C
so the recursion will be for all T dick
bigger than or ends time we will stay
below some he has a cap at the ends time
and this she also smaller than some very
large time to avoid that we just flipped
rates back up and that's with with high
probability yes and then we work by
induction on n so here is a schematic
picture of what happens that sometimes
we have a city which I drew a concave
but actually when we are close it's not
concave anymore and we consider one
point and we want to lower by one cg at
this specific point with high enough
probability so we define a small domain
G of size more or less square root 1
over square root so you have square root
los angeles in around p and we look only
at what happens inside this small
demeanor so now we can try to draw
everything on this in a sigh yes the
cross-section side view so we have this
domain c is
should we define something bigger all
the man d and we at the initial time we
know that we are some somewhere below
and so the dynamic is monotonous so we
can replace HT by some H tilt which is
started back at City but because we are
our recurrence hypothesis which is
forbidden to ever move above city then
we can also add some floor not too far
below and we get to study this H tilde
which lit only evolves on the man of
size square root and which has a flow on
sailing which are actually not very far
from each other because here you have a
curvature which is of order one when you
look at the domain of size minus one
hour plus some little of one side of d
then this distance here is why it's a
non so if G is of size minus one hour
plus epsilon this distance here because
becomes some l2 the epsilon
over L so 1 over L is because it and we
have a first key lemma which says that
this H sealed with all its contains it
will mix in time of order l brothers the
size of the domain on which it lives
squared so L of order l and another
Lamar that also said that when it's at
equilibrium it has fluctuations on the
of order a logarithmic so it will not
fluctuate above all to the epsilon minus
1 in a very long time and then with this
clear i we can say at time T plus L
basically g + l we will stay below this
a chilled at equilibrium and this HD
that aquarium will be below C T plus L
so that's the basic ways recursion works
and so like a sand yes we have lemma 1
for so dynamics constraint between
so the says the first lemma it says that
this htl with its constraint mixing
times the size of the domain squared and
limit through inside we have
that we can write in a very informal way
like that so the proof of this lemma for
los ange tilings it's actually deduced
from the work on David with another
dynamics where a mixing time l squared
was proved for will without any
constraint and the constraints allows
you to reasonably accurately compare the
two mixing times and yes oh then you
have also another argument for Domino
tilings follows and she can get a little
bit better in the power of H and logs
sunset but it doesn't matter the second
Lima was one of she's a big improvement
with respect to the planner case because
fluctuation estimates are a quite
difficult to see alpha minus one-half
plus epsilon this is basic file size 10
well yes
so so the idea was to use fluctuation
estimates on large exact ones so it's
the same kind of picture with Thai food
in the in the beginning that were
obtained I paid off like three years ago
where you do have logarithmic
fluctuation for something which is not
planner but it's only for hexagons
fortunately when you look at something
of radius square root of L and then you
can do Taylor development of any shape
and you see that the third order would
give a contribution l to the minus the
33 half which is more rather than 1 over
L which is the smallest significant
distance so you can really ignore all
higher orders and two and then you
compute sing and you see that in you can
find somewhere in the next corner any
second order the road development of of
the macroscopic shape some and then you
ok for any small domain you find the big
Zagon you fit it so that it has the
proper a boundary yes that's the proper
boundary and since you know the
fluctuation sides big domains you know
in particular that you have look at me
inside the smaller one and that's how we
get this limit to yes this is the reason
why we have the discrepancy between the
general boundary and really boundary cut
from an exact own because if we are cut
from an exact owns we can use the
hexagonal you can adapt limit to with
bigger domains and held to the minus one
hour because we are always with demands
yeah exactly novel type while for
general boundaries we cannot we are
stuck in all recursion when I mean in
over question we are only allowed to
look at very small domains and that
means we cannot we have to stop when the
curvature of city becomes too small and
into curve so and that means we cannot
really approach more than that fixed
distance or h infinity um I know much
time I have left
okay then i can say just the word about
i can either speak about Lamar one or
give a bit more details on the recursion
to explain why this particular shape for
some salami nation city I don't know
what you would prefer
look you can start by maybe keep
discussing lemma 1 just because
um now without the constraints of the
ceiling in there I'm how you use this
evening in there okay so i can think i
will present the proof of lemma ones
that works exactly in the same way for
lessons or for the minnows because a for
domino's it wasn't known and from sat
I've seen yes we have one pictures so
the general idea is to define knoxy do
rate dynamics for which it will be easy
or for which we will manage to compute
the mixing time and then make a
comparison between sees these 2 so 4 to
define the auxiliary dynamics we
consider a another representation of
tiling so timers which is a kind of beat
mother think Pete model is primarily for
the continuous part of the continuous
analog but it's really it so diffusion
cost likes it forget about any diamond
or that do not which is not horizontal
then then you have configuration and
it's actually enough to recover a full
diamond because if you have this
configuration
if you look at these two vertices you
know they have to be and more generally
all the vertices in this this region's
you have to be matched with each other
all else because yeah you know that they
are not matched and there is an even
number of it you only one way to hunt it
and furthermore the interaction between
these beads is quite simple they have to
stay or around or organized like in this
picture so between two beads on the same
thread you have exactly one bead on the
right and one bead on the left and these
are horizontal dimers okay this works
for some X a ganar lattice but you can
also find threads and for Domino tilings
is the diagonal on the square lattice
and then the dynamics joshua oxen
aerodynamics we use is just at an update
is pick either even or odd and recent
poll all the beads which lie on even or
odd threads threads are labeled and
order conditionally on everything else
so if you take if this is zero and you
pick
I'd you will put this to back this one
inside this region this one inside this
region you will be some poor also this
for etc extra so this is a no so
monotonous dynamics and we can check
that for this dynamics if you look at
the volume between two interfaces so the
volume bit with being so some of the
value of the height function on all
sides on really in the volume in off a
then it is the it is a martingale or 00
it tends to decrease its over Nottingham
let Sylvia not so it turns to decrease
then if we we can also knows variance of
this process why because um oh I don't
have this picture here I can cheat and
take
huh
so to balance the variance we have to
know where are we allowed to make
movements and one place where we are
sure we can make movements is when we
have when we could just add the cube or
remove one and how do we find someplace
where we can add a cube we start from
anywhere anywhere and we try to go away
from the war that the maximum possible
speed then we follow for example this
this pass you have lot more choices here
you could just pounded well and if we if
at some point we are stuck we are in the
local minima we could add the cube now
if we are constrained between a floor
and a sailing which are quite close some
age / L then this process of moving at
the maximum possible speed it will it
has to stop quite quickly and actually
it has to stop in at most constant time
H steps because we are moving towards so
flew on sailing at the positive speed
yes so we have around l squared divided
by some power of H sides where we can
make a move so the variance should be of
order l squared
and we also have so the volume its
martingale oh I saw Martin gay which has
violence l squared which is positive and
has a maximum L to the three so putting
it all together get a mixing time for
for this for this luxury dynamics and
now the comparison is also easy because
when we moved 1 bid the set of a load
position was actually made of one pass
going up and one pass going down so it
was also my of order H and this means
that we can simulate a one update of the
auxiliary dynamics by freezing
everything in the size of odd threads
and ready letting the global dynamics
runs for h square steps because in h
square steps each bead will make each
square move inside your simple random
walk inside some thing of size at most
each square and if we can mimic then
again part is very sweetly winkler some
soaring compares it to so to mixing time
so that's and that also gives us a lower
bound yes
we can find some spatial boundary
condition for which the volume drift is
lower bounded by something like l and
and then we can additionally these
conditions look like big pyramids 20
false those and case it just should take
exactly no boundary conditions and I
know if you want to say that an initial
configuration cannot move down too much
you fit below some pyramid and you know
that the pyramid can erode volume only
at speed l so at times some small
constant times l squared it only has
removed the small part and it has not
moved too much down so you cannot have
converged yet let's give the wrong lower
bound constants time l squared a bit
better than what was known before and i
think this should beat
could you say a few words about not
showing that
fluctuations lemma 2 yes so the Petrov
computations rely on the exact the
solvability of the motherland you you
can express exactly with integral so
probability that you see one dime era at
some point and yes then you approximate
this integral and you get the
fluctuation in the inside the pig
hexagon and that tree yeah not my work
but to get some here's a fluctuation in
small domain so key point is this by
activity actually between points inside
X agonal boundary conditions and
although to development of some curve or
of some interface and then you have a
nigs act formula for the limiting I'd
function inside xicans you can derive it
and compute the differential of the
application that to some point on some
parameter of Zigzagoon gives the local
call the tail or development at order to
at this point that's some application
you compute the achieve you computed the
data min and you see that it's nonzero
so at least locally
you have somebody activity and then you
say that please a boundary of the set of
points inside some exact guns is sent
basis application to some boundary of
the set of the tiller development to
order to which is basically infinity and
if you have some function which yeah
maps by actively small open sets to open
sets and maps the boundary to the
boundary then it's globally by objective
and inserted sure but retaining these
kinds of pictures I was traced what I
had to do with my work ok this that was
the another tentative to yes them to
compute fluctuation estimates in the
domains with non planar boundaries so to
wreak engine as vaporware showed how to
relate the random or harmonic function
on these graphs where each half edge is
oriented away from the point void so how
many function on these graphs are
related to the custom n matrix and
ultimately to other situations of saudi
models but to get really a great
fluctuation estimates you have to have a
precise estimates on how do harmonic
function on this converge to true
continuous harmonic functions
and it's something I I tried to do it
and I proved that the random walk
converged Brownian motion on this graph
but not with accurate enough all sorry
not with any speed of convergence that
could be used for later okay thanks
