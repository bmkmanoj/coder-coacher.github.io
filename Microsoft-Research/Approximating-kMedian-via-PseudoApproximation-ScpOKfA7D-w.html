you
okay hi it's a good to have hola Swenson
with us it's been a while since he came
here we've been trying to get him for a
long time and he's going to talk about a
very new result I believe this is the
first time he's giving a talk on this on
comedian so yeah okay thank you so much
it's a nice to be here so this is very
recent work as we'd serve so its joint
with me chili use the last year
graduated princeton and i'm at epfl in
Lausanne Switzerland so I want to speed
it's been the first slide we convince
you why k mean it's a very important
problem for mikes of research in seattle
and that is you know where you should
locate your research centers so as to
minimize that which traveling time so my
traveling time was of course very long
to get here so we will see some
optimization on this so too serious we
have an American Western Europe and UK
you know you could plot the
concentration of researchers we have
Seattle Silicon Valley Chicago east
coast then maybe Sweden England lost son
of course germany and so on and it looks
like you did your homework because now
if you plot backs off research we have
seattle of course where we are Silicon
Valley New England are now new one in
New York but then there's the Cambridge
and you know obviously if you remove
this don't look good so that's that's
all oh but more seriously so like when
you want to place your max of research
okay so you can think of different
objective function so in theory we often
consider minimize average distance or
minimize the maximum distance so these
problems are known as K medium okay
center and we start to look at these
poems I was not really clear why we call
them like that so let me spin one slide
of most of eighth in the name of these
supports so let's look at the medium
poem but now I format the lil bit
differently than we are used to so we
have clients on the line I want to put
one point on this red line so to past
minimized average distance so if we just
put a point here in the line then I can
see that if i push it to the left then i
will decrease the distance for these
free clients but Donna Donna will
increase them for this six guns so it
looks like a bad move to move left
another and if I move
to the right then I will decrease this
of 6 and so on so this is the green
direction so now let us move this point
along the green direction until I find a
clip and this then coincide with the
medium as you know it so that's why we
called media and then for the center we
simply want to find a sense we look at
the two extreme guys and then we place a
guy in a center ok so this did I want to
say that is a little bit insensitive
objective function because once i have
my point here no matter where i apply
place the light where the clients they
will not affect objectified s'okay media
now is that we yellow eyes to open k
points still this and it's not a real
line it's a metric space and what we use
is that the distances are symmetric in
the triangle inequality satisfied so for
this case i think makes sense to open
these two and ok sent you could open the
same two but it also makes make sense to
open this outside here because you only
care about the extreme cost ok so any
questions on the problems so I mean I
mean intuitively here you know this guy
is a bad luck for him so we should open
one in each cluster but ok something
doesn't really capture that because you
only measure the maximum distance so
maybe you know this is also an optimal
solution as well as everyone here
yesterday i'm considering comedians I
want to work the way to know the vehicle
virtual came with it so the important
thing is that we understand Kim idiot so
so another point in favor of comedian is
that if we look at the state of thought
of the case Center problem we have a
very good understanding so there is a
greedy very simple to approximation
areum you can make it LP base and so on
and this is the best we can do what to
do ok so we have a complete
understanding of worst-case behavior you
look at Khe Sanh now some people don't
like worst-case behavior so so I have
this image from Geneva so this is joe in
the winter it gets cold though it gets
very you with next to a lake so if you
go if you go for dinner and you park
your car next to a lake on a cold layer
then we get back you will find it with
ice covering it and you cannot open it
until it gets warmer
that's to say that sometimes in a
worst-case happens it make sense to keep
into your planning okay so so we know
everything about case center so what
about k median can we do as well or can
we you know can we answer add to
understand what we can do k medium so
what what do you think you think we can
do better can be there okay center you
have no idea moot you have no no gasps
okay yes this is a Russia we don't know
but you know but at least the hardness
says that became we cannot do better in
1 plus 2 over e so this is by yang at
all in 2002 but and what we don't know
how to do better than free so there's
quite a big gap we didn't know how to do
better free and my guess would be that
this is tight so yes by working but this
is a guess underline and so honest I
don't know but it feels like we should
be able to do better but the current
techniques doesn't allows okay so what
we were going to talk about today is
like the best approach is so forth
approaching this problem so what's the
known techniques then I will stay to our
results and I find it it's like two
independent ports and I think the first
part is made most interesting that is
this K is a hard constraint we cannot
open at most K facilities so what we
show is that we can turn this hard
constraint into a soft one so we allowed
to violate slightly but then how much we
violate this constraint will affect the
running time but as long as we violated
by constant it becomes a promoter my way
and once we have this result we can what
we design what we call is a suit
approximation and combining this gives
you a better approximation so yes before
I start a little bit about known
techniques let me make some convention
so it will be it will be convenient to
distinguish the points in the metric
space where we can open a facility and
the clients i will always tour the
points where i can open a facility by
squares and the clients by circles and
the goal is time to open k facility so
if we would open k free facilities may
we open this and once we know which
facilities to open is trivial Torresani
clients yes to the closest force it
so what is thallium okay so the first
time if you looked at the median on the
real line we are started with any point
and we greedily improved it so let's try
to do that 4k medium yes what we do is
to start by opening nek facilities and
while it exists a swap that decreases
the value we do it so smoke means that
we if I start with these two guys then I
might close one of them on open another
one I do this as long as there is one
that decreases to objectively so maybe I
swap this an animal and this actually
gives you a five approximation OS disk
was proved by aya tolling 2001 and now
if you have a swap the next thing you
will do is to look at p swap so instead
of just closing one you would oak close
p and open p Sol and this gives you a
free plus 2 over p yes so the and this
is the best so this yeah if you let P be
sufficient biggest free plus epsilon
poke summation so this is the best that
we have so that's what we have right so
this is tight the analysis maybe you can
come up with the Sun smartest was but if
you just do this work sir and it's tight
yeah so that depends on it's not clear
right so that's where this epsilon comes
into play so this is not free plus 2
over p but you need some slack in your
inequalities so you say that in each
step I want to improve at least this
much otherwise I stop if there is no
SWAT that improves this smarter we stop
if you any other bad examples where you
can take many many steps
yes I I don't know if that's the bad
example what the Apple box end to end up
of P but I mean yeah that that's not the
main focus of their output so anyway but
you know this was in 2001 and since then
we have tried a lot to do better of free
and one very promising candidate to do
better freeze you know linear
programming so it's going to the game no
that's why I said you need a slack in
your improvement yeah yeah yeah yeah
okay so so I know you don't like
probably most people don't like linear
process but you will not need to
understand the new program in this talk
is brought it here but they understand
that this approach is what you need to
understand is that a variable Y I and if
you think of this that is you take value
one if we should open that facility and
then there is a variable x IJ that takes
value one if K is connected to I ok so
now this objective function is as the
sum of average connection cost ok and
this is that we can upload most k
facilities here each client is connected
and here we say that if a kind is
connected to facility I then that one
has wheel so don't worry if you went
through here quickly but now you know we
liked you when here like randomization
so what we do here is to interpret this
why is probability that the facility is
open and then when once you have this
intuition okay then the first time you
would try to just open in the parents
that well no meat facility probably why
I so this is not that good ideas why
first of all we have to satisfy this
constraint that we can only open k
facilities and then there is a real
problem that in the neighborhood of some
client we might not open any facility so
there might not be any facility at all
open close to a client so maybe that's
the most serious problems what people
have done is that they very carefully
grow balls so they take any client and
they both close involve there and they
do they grow this ball until the lp says
that inside is for wish or at least one
facility then we grow another
all and so on and they do this very
carefully now they do to run my
surrounding so i still-- sure that the
open at most K facilities and at least
one is open in each all and the marginal
should be satisfied so maybe we open
three facilities in this Excel and this
was the first construct box masher so it
is careful the parent one english six
point 25 approximation and from 99 and
now you know they've worked on this
quite low so that now the best one from
this year is a three-point 25 and this
is extremely careful dependent when
Weiss welding so and they think that
it's a better than free but the analysis
is very long and so because you know
it's not clear how to grow these subsets
and so on so by the way so here we see a
clear difference between a relatable
facility location because in
facilitation this techniques gives
nearly tight where's here we have the
horde concerned we can open open k and
this gives makes problematic so facility
does the next slide that's good so if I
see a location same as Chimaera but no
hard constraint that the most cases is
open is that we have an opening cost
each guy can be open with various I'm
opening costs so but there is very nice
relationship week a medium but I now
want to talk to that we will use so this
comes from a simple economy so now if we
can surprise some facilities suppose you
set the price to be very cheap then we
would open many of them we put the price
to be very expensive than few facility
open okay so what will you do you try to
find a price and use the best known
arguing for facet location to get the
solution at opus basically k facilities
then this would be a solution to K
medium unfortunately this function you
know it's not continuous you cannot be
sure that the open exactly care
facilities so what you do is to find
prices so that if you change it slightly
you find one solution that is slightly
lower than k1 slided a big run and
that's the intuition by these PI point
solutions that Janie wats Ronnie
introduced in very nice paper so what
they pro is that ok so let me explain
here by losing effect of two we can find
two solutions so think of k equal to
free here so in one solution I open
less than K facilities so the blue
solution in one another the solution I
open more than K facilities eye open for
facilities here in the green solution
and in each then defines a pseudo
solution where I connect the client to
the closest in a green and the clothes
in the blue it's a two solutions and
what they prove is that we can think by
losing effect of two we can assume that
the LP solution is a convex combination
of these two solutions okay so we'll
just take the Commerce combination i get
the very structure of this solution yep
the cost of opening capabilities in
convex function of K is that and you
know people ever look at that sort of
more general cost functions uh I don't
know probably I would say yeah that's
true I don't know I don't but it was
earnest am here so i have two solutions
in the comics place in the final
solution to the LP so I just draw it
like this i can order them like that and
all the clients in the middle and they
will be connecting is home so one blue
solution and one green solution and i'll
be will be a convex combination of the
two and then what they show is that but
you know it's quite easy once you have
this structure of delta so you can round
it so they show that you can lose you
another fact of two we can convert such
a LP solution to a solution that opens
at most K facilities so if you take you
lose effector to hear you lose effective
to hear so you get the four
approximation so this first they lost
the factor free and then they lost
effective too and this what this one is
tight the course if you're given a store
here we have k plus one facility client
pair so these clients they have distance
02 these facilities and their distance
12 this topmost facility so we have k
plus 1 green in our green solution we
have k plus 1 facilities open the cost
of this solution will be 0 here we have
one blue guy opened and the cost of this
one will be k plus 1 because everybody
would have distance won t so it's
extreme difference between open
one more facility then we are loud then
we get the solution cost zero but if we
open k facilities you can see that the
optimum is two and LP will tell you that
we should open this solution we probably
one over K and this one week a minus 1
over K so this is the worst case a known
for the out-pitch lesson in class gap of
2 if you feel and our algorithms will be
obtained by staring at this graph long
enough and then I'm it's a very simple
graph but it gives you a lot of insights
ok so you understand this is this
instance we have k plus 1 facilities
here and if we take the green solution
if you have cost zero if they did blue
one which has caused k plus 1 so
therefore the LPS value 1 plus 1 over K
because it says that we take the blue
one we probably 1 over K and the green
way BK minus 1 ok ok so just summarize
the best value mr. Lucas search based
free perception best furnace this guild
users such as a beast at hoorka straight
away Oh most cases can we open yeah so
for facilitation we have almost typed
results so what's all results I said
we're going to stay on this graph for a
while so what we proved is that we can
get a 1 plus square root of 3 plus
epsilon in EM tube of 1 over epsilon but
ok so that's an improved fact is 2.7 t 1
but I think the more the coolest result
is that so if you have an or sued
approximately that opens k plus C
facilities then this can be turned into
our Plus app to approximate a room that
doubles care facilities in runs in time
and people see of epsilon so this this
shows that for example this integral at
the gap for LP disappears because I can
just open all the green ones and then I
can apply that theorem as a black box to
get a good approximation so
yeah you could call by criteria if you
want so the problem with micropterus is
not a multiplicative factor so I don't
buy catira so many people means that you
would have a multiplicative violation in
a number facility Chopra and that would
kill our result here because then you're
running time would be empty puff k and
then we just do absolute approximation
that this one per square root of free
that opens all the one over epsilon
centers so this this is I think it's
very good this is good but it probably
can improve this okay so let's prove
this theorem so that is so the idea is
very simple so if you look here you know
if you have if it if the if the so here
we have the clients which is students
and then we have the university's you
know so if then if the clients are not
too concentrated around the university
then if we just remove one university we
will make some guys angry but they're
only few compared to the total number of
students okay so we can wait comedian
objective allows us to make some clients
very angry it will not affect overall
objective very much okay so that's the
idea so we'll make so that is the two
extreme so we have a very sparse
instance that no clients are too
concentrated and then we have the dance
classes as you can see in the
integrality gap instance that we have a
clients that I've connecting cost zero
two facilities so clearly if we can open
for facilities here it has a much lower
cost than if you can only open free
sorry yeah so removing a facility here
will increase only if you know if we
remove one facility then we will
increase the cost by may be a factor of
1 over K something like that no not too
much concentration around this so some
guys will be unlucky but they will be
rerouted but if we remove one here then
we will increase the cost with a huge
factor so the question is this seems
like an impossible thing to prove that
if I take a solution of the dolmens k
plus 1 samples how can I turn it into a
solution at opens case centers without
increasing it costs and the ender and
the and the answer is that you want to
remove this kind of you
yeah so you want to pre-process away
these instances as a removing customers
feel so as positive x yeah and then yeah
the proof would be a solar tube if we
can remove a facility here then we will
increase the cost by little and we will
now prove that we can I concentrate on
sports since the without loss of
generality so let me take some time so
what do I mean by sports instance so I
said at an instance a sports if for
every facility I I look at that facility
here and now I look at all the clients
around it which the radius of this ball
is the distance from I to the op the
facility or opening the optimal solution
so here I am only allowed to open three
facilities in the optimal solution maybe
stick green facilities now I draw a ball
around this facility I that i'm
considering with ray just di october
free so here i have di opt and the
radius here is one third of this
distance okay and this all the clients
inside this ball should have connection
costs in optimum that is most a for it
to be a sports does that make sense the
definition may be no I look at a small
ball around the facility I look at all
the clients what's the connection
costing optimum I don't want it to be
very big compared to hoped because that
would mean that if I remove this
facility then I would increase the cost
a lot compared to which mansion
classified I know so this di of this the
distance from the facility I to the
optimum facility the closest facility an
optimal solution so but they call the
connection cost of a client here and
often solution would be at the most two
thirds this
yeah I'm yes I for simplicity let's
think about k plus 1 you mean not every
facility that's included in any solution
but just every potential every potential
facility and yes any potential for seed
location right good you know so this
guy's not he's not spores because here
we can see that the clients in this ball
will actually be the whole optimal cost
in the optimal solution right if I have
these clients here these guys will have
caused 0 dis cos 0 0 0 and optimal
solution but these ones will have all
the cost of doped this guy's a dance to
dance instance of course I don't know
opt but you can still allow those three
clusters if you just add those three
clusters you can still call xbox yes
like Oh Lewis yes that yes yeah yeah
yeah yeah so it's a little bit confusing
in that way so if the dance things are
around facilities at opened in the
optimal solution deny TILs college
sports but because i call it sports
because the problem is that the maybe
the lp tells me that this guy's open
with high probability so basic LP fools
these clients and that's a problem yes i
assumed one solution to be unique so you
can yeah you can also do it with joelle
adams without peace okay so how can we
now obtain so of course not all the
instances we see your sports but how can
we assume sports to without loss of
generality so how would you do to obtain
a sports instance there are so if i know
the optimum suppose we know dr. on what
would you do well the first thing we'll
be okay let's remove all the locations
that are not part of the optimum that
will be then we would have a sports
instance but that's a little bit too
good to be true so let's try with
something weaker so wild exist our dance
facility okay what i will do is to
remove this facility and
and the facility within the that is
closed so this facility than the optimum
so so i removed this facility that this
facility location and i remove anyone
that is closer to this one than the
optimal facility the deficit is not so
remove that one and i remove that one so
i didn't draw the clients here yeah so
now this this is a this is the algorithm
that we see that we could turn it this
is of course not a polynomial time I'm
because we don't know opt but we will
see that it doesn't matter yeah yeah
yeah yeah you will not implement this
away whether but no no this you will see
that you doesn't matter that we don't
know opt that's why I said I mean we can
always make we can if we knew up this
trivial we can remove all the locations
that is not opt but that's not good so
now I try to do something weak or that
they can turn into a polynomial time I
wheel so let's look at something weaker
and the week your thing is that i am
looking for october t sports instance if
i have an opto a tea dance facility I
then I identify this facility I here and
now i will remove it because i know that
i'm not using it eloped and i will
remove any facility that is closer to
this one than optimal one because i know
they are not used involved so i remove
that one and that one now i remove I
iteratively do this okay I find these
balls but now a key key thing is that
these spots will be disjoint by the way
we constructed this iterative out so how
many balls can we have you know so the
opto t dance means that the connection
cost of the clients in this ball was
knocked over T so we can have at most T
balls okay because balls are disjoint we
can have at most T balls this otherwise
opt will not be hoped yeah but now we
can guess these balls even if we don't
know opt because we only have tea once
we can't enumerate all possibilities in
Antep of tea time so that's why it was a
fourth experiment but you
easily turn into thallium by paying a
large for longer factor so that's why we
can look at sports instances and now it
may be you want to believe me as we saw
before that if we have a sports in since
then is quite easy to turn it into one
that only uses care facilities there are
some complications but so now what we
look at is let's look at this guy let's
try to remove him let's try to analyze
how much they did the distance of the
clients in this sorry so if i have an
solution it naturally partitions myspace
into boa noite diagram right so all the
clients in this one will be connected
here and so on so now let's look at what
happens if i remove facility i well if
this client here is far away from the
facility let's say at most effective one
over T thanks alive which is the
distance to the other one then his
distance were increased by a most
effective 11 yeah yes by the triangle
inequality but now if he's too close
well if we had then we know that since
it was a sparse instance these clients
cannot contribute too much by removing
this and that's it yeah if we have if
this optimum are far away from the blue
guys so there is some if you don't run
but there is a technicality to say that
if all these guys are very close then
we're in trouble but then the thing is
that if they are closed and we basically
found optimal solution already and we
can guess the symmetric difference but
that's a technicality okay serenity we
obtain our October t sports instance
time m tube of T run sudo approximation
areum or sports instance that will
define later then massage it in time
entity into a solution of the bus k
facilities in course twisty then comes
up in a running time so that's why I
have this c / episode
sorry yeah yeah that comes now yeah so
we're so yeah this we call it the
storeroom so this is the store we have
in Sweden Christmas we hang them in it's
very dark we have a lot of lights in the
rooms okay so okay it's not i don't i'm
not it's not call the store I because
it's the best time it's going to store
arguing because we use stores okay so
how to run one start now when we allowed
to open a little bit more facilities how
would you do okay so it's kind of the LP
tells us that we should open a sub to be
probability 1 over K and we show open
the green solution we probe to k minus 1
okay so now the arguing we simply open a
central point A or otherwise we would
open all the leaves we probably one
might say so probably be yeah so either
open this or all the leaves so did in
the worst case in this case we will open
k plus 1 facilities and expected cost is
the same as stealthy okay so there is of
course let's think about not to my lives
if you have many leaves you have to be a
little bit then you cannot do it but
let's it's enough to think about yes
rounding several stall how would you do
are you opening or universities open all
the keepers
listen so if you have way too many
leaves what you would do is always to
open a center and then I'll open like a
big fraction here do the same thing as
the previous papers which they pleased
to solution which one more than one less
and you pay basically same as your twice
there yes so that's why I say it's not I
think one can improve it so we start by
losing effect of two to get this kind of
structure but this was the integral yeah
so we okay so how will you round several
stores okay so pick em a fraction of the
stars randomly is maybe a pic this
fraction for those guys I open the
center and once I open all the leaves
now you know maybe I pay you know number
Fisto busy k plus constant by some
rounding problems but this is assuming
stars of the same size and not too many
leaves okay so it gets more complicated
if you have different number of lease
for every store and so on but let's will
not worry about no we might have many
stores fraction of the stars we pick
randomly have to do we have to be
careful yeah we do uniform at random on
a fraction of the stars
that that's just too that I want to
expect the connection cost of a client
is a and here they expect that opening
is a and the expected here's B cpk Eva
no I'm sorry it's difficult to write
yeah ok so now the square root of free
comes into play this is no next I so
okay so how is the whole album now when
we saw this okay so obtained boy point
solution losing a factor of two as we
saw that we could do from jayne-ann but
sarani and now we should obtain stores
from this instance and the way of 10
stores is to look at each facility in
green and take the cheapest edge to the
blue okay so each edge here has a deep
green distance and blue distance so if i
sum these distances up i get the
distance of the whole edge and for each
green i connected to the blue to take
the cheapest edge so this gives me some
stores plus some clients that goes in
between stores okay i cannot remove the
clients but i will define my stores like
that so for each green guy I picked the
cheapest edge where they cost of an
artistic this green distance plus the
bluid distance to the blue guy so I see
this as an edge with a green port on a
blue port to blue
yeah because here i have many clients
right so my stare so if I say this guy
so these are part of the stores this is
the ones i picked but i will have to
keep the other clients so let me let me
redo it so for each green guy i will
pick a representative but i have to keep
all the clients the representative a pic
is the cheapest so I have some cost here
the cost is the length of the green port
plastic length of the blue port so now i
have an unique representative for each
great guy so it will be stores based on
the blue maybe i have different sizes
and so on but some of the clients
exactly and this one is one of the other
ones that they didn't pick as a
representative but what's important here
is now that if we look at the distance
of this client to that one what's the
distance it's this screen part busty
screen plus this blue part but since we
show she pick the representative here to
be the cheap as possible we have that
the distance here is at most the
distance here so the distance is to d2
plus d 1 okay so it says that every
client will have a will be pretty close
to the center of that store and why is
that good because remember album either
open the central all leaves so either
the leave is open we are very happy the
center is open or none of them is opened
and then we can connect him here because
we know that this guy is open if this
one is not open and and now you just so
now you write down to expect the
connection cost and then squared and you
get that this is one plus squared of 3
over 2
so that's the whole thing and under data
that a plus epsilon and so on becomes
because you have to deal with different
sized stores if you just have the same
store sizes you get plus 20 plus free
okay so the sum is I think the most in
finish that we managed to turn this hard
constraint into a soft constraint so
this gives a new point of view and what
is very nice is that this standard of P
we thought it was not good enough to
answer what we think is right one plus
two agree but now it might be good
enough as we can open a concept more
facilities so just by looking at this
standard helping try to round it opening
a little bit more facilities even if I
only open one more facility I don't know
of anything worse than one plus two of
you so it might be possible to use the
standard LP and then it was first
obtained by sundas here kiss for so i'll
be here is 4k medium and then chili so
that we can do it without air kiss which
is easier usually but it will be
interesting to see you know similar
things done used other points with or
constraint so in particularly this
comedian if you have capacities on a
number of clients that be assigned to
facility then there is no constant known
if one could relax these then the
problem gets easier okay so thank you
and one accumulation yeah everyone put
their organs yeah yeah we know it was
one more practical researcher that
visited mohit this money exactly that
was his questions I don't know so I
think we are looking at this because
it's easier it's a LP and we haven't
understood this yet so but there are
based on the free approximation local
search for came in there is a9
approximation for k-means yeah that does
hey means that's came easy that is so
there's a9 based on the same technique
its local search but maybe you could get
the better here we haven't looked yeah
ok oh yeah you don't have that intuition
was it may be
okay yeah I guess equality is getting I
guess he is a MP to look at the dead one
and you can sell the comics power yes
yes maybe that we should actually look
at that strange that we because they
seem to be more practical open the door
I I don't know do you know I think we
like this experience because you know
they're easy to think of in terms of LP
or yeah
so you mentioned that viously you had
another complaint on some hierarchy the
hierarchy in wouldn't it football to all
these pieces will be like for the second
power no no it was only for the first
port to relax the constraint so instead
of doing the enumeration to get a sparse
instance you can use condition in Cheryl
Adams so that you dislike advance you
know is this diff facility dance and
then you can condition on these events
and you have to condition on that money
events so sure L Adams is enough we'd
add that one constraint these circles
that you get here
so you conditional those centers not
being in excess I condition on ma I mean
so here we said sparsity without so here
I condition on this guy so here I said
what I do is to sit so I condition on
for if these facilities earth is dance
then I would condition on this one being
the closest opened and this will force
all these to be closed so that that's
the vampire than all the lp values will
be seer of this I can remove no should
only it I will have to have a
reinterpretation that X I a stands for
not the facility guys connect the two
but it's the old closest open facility
which is you know what you would expect
also for the I'll start a little you
could that be use a factor after days to
discuss no no so if I just understand
late but that problem is going to give a
one per square root 3 word to
approximate here so this shows that they
are not the toughest extreme points now
since you can open more than okay yeah
it's better so this shows that the horse
is into girls gaps are not in this form
I we don't know no it's probably not we
don't yeah analysis is probably tight
like H by H analysis but you can
probably round this kind of thing but
you don't want to lose effective tool to
store</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
