a research project we're calling hollow
flector hollow flexure is an augmented
reality mirror what we're seeing here is
a very large translucent mirror and
about three feet behind that is an LCD
panel it's also very large and I'm
standing about three feet away from the
translucent mirror that means if we
render graphics on the LCD in life-size
I can still see those graphics and
they're basically in correspondence with
my reflection so it looks like the
graphics are perfectly overlaid onto my
reflection now you'll notice here that
you see this this image of myself we're
getting that from the Kinect sensor
which is placed just above the mirror
the Kinect sensor is monitoring what I'm
doing we're also getting the skeletal
tracking data we also notice that
there's a blue ball superimpose onto my
right hand that's basically join me
where the system thinks my Windows Phone
is right now so that's an idea we call
sensor fusion and it's something that
that demonstrates the complimentary
nature of the sensors on the phone and
the Kinect sensors so let's have a
little bit of fun so here's a
holographic video call that we can see
through the mirror so there's just a
video of me we can imagine this could be
a live image of someone that I'd be
talking to you'll notice that it will
actually switch from one hand to the
next so I can hold this little version
of myself so it's kind of a fun idea of
communications in the future so as
another example of what we can do to
combine the phone with the holo flector
is we have this basically this wooden
paddle that we're rendering and so on
one nice thing about using the phone is
that we get the nice orientation data
from the phone and we're also using the
position data from Kinect and then
finally we can demonstrate interacting
say with with a fluid simulation the
Kinect data is now colliding with the
various particles on the display for
this kind of interesting experience
we've seen a lot of examples of
augmented reality where there you're
looking at a phone and you're seeing
graphics superimpose onto video feed
like a camera and this is much more
about rendering graphics on to the real
world
the reflection of the real world and
it's also a study of how we can use the
mobile phone in a complementary way with
connect thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
