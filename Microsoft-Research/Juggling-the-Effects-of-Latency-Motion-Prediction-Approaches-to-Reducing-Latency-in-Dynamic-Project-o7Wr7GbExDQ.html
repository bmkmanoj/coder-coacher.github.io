our work ex will suffer only approaches
to minimize the effects of latency in
projector camera systems projector
camera systems or programs afford a wide
range of interactive possibilities
however latency in the system can cause
the projection to slip from its intended
target as a result of this program
systems have typically shied away from
truly dynamic scenarios instead
constraining users movements previous
work has explored latency reduction
through custom hardware or advanced
multi camera tracking systems however
the requirement for additional hardware
and expertise brenda's these approaches
at odds with the lightweight development
approaches favored by both the
enthusiast and research communities such
as made possible by cameras like the
Microsoft Kinect as a result of this we
explore the feasibility of software only
prediction approaches to reducing
latency we explore two different example
fast motion scenarios involving on
object and on body projection our first
scenario explores objects in free flight
we developed a juggling display we fit a
projectile motion model to a Kalman
filter to project the balls location
approximately a hundred milliseconds
into the future this allows us to align
the projection with the balls expected
location our second predictive approach
is based on the observation that expert
skill involves repetitive motion and
seeks to minimize jerk watch the
jugglers hands their motion is
predominantly cyclical we call the semi
predictable motion we developed a
predictor of memory model where we use
the prior motion from the last 30
seconds as a look up for our prediction
we can use this technique to increase
projection accuracy in on body
projection across a range of scenarios
as latency varies by device we designed
our system to automatically measure an
account for its own latency we encourage
you to read our paper for a more
detailed explanation of our work and our
results
