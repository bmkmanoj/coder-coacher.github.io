the next step we have eindhoven oh hi
everyone where the students of the
University of Technology Eindhoven this
here is Ken my name is Leone and we
working together in a team with Tom and
cool and we're here today to introduce
your concept called amp and show your
process how we came to this end results
M focuses on sharing social data which
is of course related to this year's
theme of the design Expo big data so
nowadays we threw our mobile devices
were always connected and we're very
easy access to large amounts of
information and actually we're using our
smartphones over 2 hours a day so are we
becoming a little bit addicted to all
this information that we can access
properly everybody recognizes those
moments when you take out your phone
just to check if you have new emails or
messages coming in it's a quite
unconscious behavior and when you're
especially when you're together with
your friends this can be quite annoying
well what you get this picture was
actually taking during one of her
project days so Tom walked in on us and
so sitting like this and what you see is
that we're very distracted we pay our
attention to our phones and not to each
other so we starting to isolate
ourselves in the social context and well
we took the situation as a starting
point to design for through several
interviews observations and workshops we
came to the conclusion that this
distraction does harm the social
interaction but on the other hand we
also came with discovered that it can
also add value to the conversation our
users clearly indicated that are you is
clearly indicated that removing the
phones from the situation would not be
an option so this brought us to the main
question in this project how can we
bring the data that we now access to
your
to a social context in a way that adds
value to the conversation and does not
isolate us so now Ken will tell you
something out about our process and our
concept okay so how did we start our
design process for a series of hands-on
explorations and prototypes we generated
ideas how to tackle phones and data in a
social context we liked the idea to put
your phone on the table since this
gesture made the neck made an action and
inspired us throughout the explorations
in addition we also made scenarios which
mapped out the main important values and
in addition we created acting out
sessions which gives us a first-person
perspective what sort of information we
had to use so through in through
interviews and user tests we finally
made the decision to choose data related
to the city to be more specific what is
actually happening in the city by using
location-based data we wanted to add
value location-based data such as
Twitter messages and Instagram photos we
combine the exploitive prototyping
sessions with use of the location-based
data to enhance social context we create
an experience which allows the user to
put their phones on the table and
enhance their conversations by using
location-based data and this leads up to
our final concept called am I would like
to show you a video which is showing the
lamp itself as you can see right now and
also the possibilities how it would work
and how it would react in action
so we start our story with Nicholas he's
going to in yeah he's going to meet up
with a few friends in a restaurant or a
bar or a cafe and while he's waiting he
sees the lamp and he can interact with
it so he pulls up his application and he
places it on the table there's a small
little phone application supporting this
and in downtown I oven there are some
people that publishing or treating or
making photographs which could be
visible in the application itself so he
places his phone on there to see what is
actually happening you can see he is
searching up some information about the
clock about and while he's doing that
some other people our crew could make
photographs or could talk about the
museum so he could switch between those
points and see what is actually
happening so the friends are joining in
at a could enhance the conversation by
placing their phones on the table on
those hot spots which are represented by
the online activity and actually see
what is happening they could determine
for instance what to do next and yeah go
to that specific place after their drink
or after their dinner
so I'm consists of three main components
the first component is allowed it's an
object that integrates and blends into
the environment and is also responsible
for the light effect the second
component is a map which is the light
effect and it's created by a shadow of
the lamb and is also showing you online
activity so it creates hotspots where
people could place their phones on the
third and final component is the
application so people can place their
phones on the hot spots and it would
represent for instance the things that
are happening right now and they could
look up what is actually being taken or
what sort of photographs are being taken
there our I would like to show a little
live demo so can we pull up the cameras
so can we change out the camera image on
the owner presentation thanks so what it
does is the lamp itself it's a fifth
prototype that we made so really yeah
it's different from the first one where
we started and it is made from a 3d
print of translucent 3d print and also
cnc router wouldn't leap up pieces which
creates a really nice lamp which could
integrate within your environment in a
cafe or in a bar and as you can see
there's a small little shadow it's a
city of Eindhoven and it represents
those areas and you could use your phone
for instance to ya to to place on top of
one of those hot spots that are
generated so and then you could see what
is actually happening there by use of
the application a cool thing to show for
instance is also what is inside of it
because it doesn't use as a projection
that uses a small little water container
and it simulates those hot spots by
using that water container and vibration
motors so actually is a low-tech
prototype but also a low-tech object
which blends in perfectly without the
technology and a technological look in a
restaurant so can we pull back the
presentation thank you
so well you've seen a working prototype
and I would like to summarize our three
key concepts of of em and amplifies the
social interaction by bringing the
relevant data to the conversation it
enables for tangible interaction with
objects that are already present in
shared physical space and it integrates
different kind of city data in an
aesthetically pleasing waved in the
context so we believe that our project
amplifies the social context and brings
back the quality of the conversation
thank you very much for listening um hi
I really like the fact that it's not a
projector above I'm not sure how you
intend to move the vibrations different
places that's all but obviously you
could just put a map on the table and do
a similar sorts of things as well Jonah
tell us a bit about how you came to
projecting the lights with the flip with
the notion of water versus I just wanna
get worse okay um yeah it's designed
from a perspective for it's a image
decoration piece so it blends in into
the environment itself so what we wanted
to do is design something on a nun
obtrusive so we rejected the projector
idea and made something really analogue
it's also something that has a sort of
old-school feeling towards it by
creating an actual light and yeah it was
a series of explorations as I said
during the presentation we started out
with a small little laser cut up map and
through the processes we also thought
okay we can't put a map or some objects
on the table in a social contact sheet
you have glasses you have you have
cutlery other stuff on the table itself
so it's fright obtrusive if you put an
object on the table
and we decided to lift up the map and
play with the light that comes yeah from
that object so we started to play with
shadows started play with a map and the
shadow in a combination and through
water we came to the conclusion that was
a really nice way to visualize data
that's thank you yeah that's probably
the process that we went through through
the act of making it through trying it
out a question from the audience okay hi
it's great to hear your process did you
guys I'm curious if you had experienced
deploying it in any way it's great to
see that you went through multiple
versions of development to see what
users brought to the process and what
they gleaned from it and how that might
have driven like different kinds of data
or how you might facilitate the
interaction between the users I think we
yeah we deployed it partially as you
could see in one of the photographs we
made of earlier type or earlier
prototype which had that light effect
and we asked them questions about okay
how would this enhance the conversation
or how could it improve it by placing
several hot spots for generating those
hot spots in that area but we didn't
deploy it into a social circle contacts
itself so that would require or that
could be the next step or we have a
fully functional lamp placing it or
placed inside a restaurant where people
could actually enjoy it and see what
protect ya could happen but most of the
interviews that we yeah that we did and
the usual test and the acting out
sessions there's a really supportive
because everyone liked the idea of
having something unobtrusive on the
background and if you want to use it you
could just pull up your application
British yeah which is a group activity
so I think to keep it short we tested it
in a way but it could be tested further
if we have a fully functional prototype
thank you if you have chance you should
come down and see it after after the
presentation because
really beautiful especially I'm looking
inside and see how they crafted it so
thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
