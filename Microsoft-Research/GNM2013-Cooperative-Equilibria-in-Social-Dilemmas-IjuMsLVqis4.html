you
it's great pleasure to to welcome Maria
from University of Southampton and sees
a loss of external speakers and she's
going to tell us a little bit about to
social dilemmas so Maria thanks for
coming it over to you probably going to
tell something that game theoretic
solutions can be not dead better
predictions behavior if you come up with
the right solution concept anyway yeah
so I'm going to introduce the concept of
cooperative equilibrium to predict
behavior in social dilemmas in
particular those played intuitive
certina this is our joint work with
Valerio Cabrera mateo the nancy and nick
jennings at the university of south side
or the first prediction i can make right
now is that this stop probably will take
less than 45 minutes let's see all right
so the standard assumption that economic
models make of that players always act
perfectly rational have been assessed
implausible in many experimental studies
with human players and these studies
usually are conducted with on
fundamental social dilemmas actually the
original dilemma the travelers dilemma
and the public goods game and in which a
high rate of cooperation had been
demonstrated and by cooperation women
here the deviation of the unique between
efficient Nash equilibrium in these
games and has also been shown that the
the rate of the corporation what was
dependent on the game parameters that
bear function parameters or the other
parameters in the game or the
environment in which the games the game
is played how the players are matched to
each other and so on how frequent is the
direction between different types of the
players this type of things so let me
just briefly remind you if you've
forgotten which is hardly to believe are
the prisoner's dilemma you have two
players the prisoner separated by a wall
up
and they can choose either to cooperate
or defect in which case both of them
cooperate they get a reward are and if
both of them defect they get a
punishment pay of P which is lower than
the reward if one of them cooperates he
gets a temptation fav of T which is the
highest of all and if I sorry if one of
them defects he gets dead and the
cooperating players learn that in that
combination gets a sucker our payoff of
s which is lowest of the oh and it's
known that there is a unique Nash
equilibrium for both of the players to
defect and of course it's not the best
thing to do because it's not there is a
Pareto optimal solution for both of them
to cooperate and get a bit of a similar
situation we see in the travelers
dilemma we have two travelers they can
claim some amount x I within the range
of L or h of monetary units for their
luggage that have been lost by the same
Ellen company and the airlines have the
rules to avoid high claims so that the
player the traveler with the lower claim
em would get M plus B units the other
one will get a minus B units will be the
value of the bonus of the penalty is
fixed and I both claim the same amount
they will get the very same that amount
and once a game in this game it's
obvious that the unique Nash equilibrium
is to claim the lowest possible amount
of money but it would be the best thing
to do for both of the travelers to claim
the highest reward highest reimbursement
and finally the public goods game we
have n players in this setting each one
has some endowment of monetary units and
they can contribute some amount of money
to public pool the pool then is
multiplied by a constant alpha 0 and
then evenly divided among the player so
that the utility of each player is his
endowment minus
his contribution and some fraction of
the total amount where this fraction is
called the constant marginal return
that's it the unique Nash equilibrium
here is to contribute zero to the public
pool while of course everyone
understands that it would be better to
multiply our money all together and what
people do understand that so in practice
and many experiments that have been
conducted cooperation is frequent and
basically it depends on the perimeter
saw the environment in which the game is
played and prisoner's dilemma in
particular the rate of corporation would
depend on the payoff function parameters
or the way the players are matched to
play with each other and there are
several works that shows these
dependencies in Travelers dilemma the
rate of cooperation depends on the value
of the bonus penalty be whenever the
game is single shot or iterated and in
the public goods game the rate of
corporation depends on the value of the
marginal return the main perimeter of
the game and also in the frequency of
iteration between the co-operators or
Free Riders based on the previous
iterations of the game now the three
reference is there which highlighted are
particularly relevant to our because
they and they use iterative settings and
also basically we use their experimental
data to for our calculations and would
like particular thank Anna Gunn throws
daughter for the original data that she
sent us that was not included in their
paper okay so all these findings
actually inspired a considerable effort
in attempt to explain the observed
behavior of human players some methods
in this direction assume that actually
humans just have bounded rationality and
makes mistakes in their computations and
this they are keeper dimes in this
direction the quantou response Theory
the level K the quantum level k theory
the aerobics with this approach is that
it's really hard to justify this point
of view for
the games where the pair function is
actually easy like in prisoner's dilemma
or where the incentive for deviation
from a Nash equilibrium is obvious lie
can travel sdram over the penalty close
to zero right other methods explain
cooperation in terms of evolution one of
the examples here the cognitive
hierarchy mud model or reciprocity
mechanisms but they actually have been
shown to be outperformed by the quanta
level k-theory so they don't seem to
predict the behavior very well finally
lots of work has been done in attempt to
define just profoundly different
solution concepts and here we have the
notion of fairness equilibrium the fat
cited prequel group both of them are
although predict either complete
cooperation of complete defection in the
prisoner's dilemma so they are quite
rigid another notion is that of maximum
perfect equilibrium this was shown to be
quite are good in many settings button
travel is didn't made predicts
cooperation without irrespectively of
the value of the be so it's also not
very flexible than the rated regret
minimization showed good performance in
many settings but once again it showed
art it coincided with the Nash
equilibrium for the prisoner's dilemma
so it didn't predict cooperation there
at all while the cocoa value on the
other hand predict full cooperation in
in the prisoner's dilemma so all of
these notions are not flexible in all
thee in all the dilemmas they've been
applied so are based on these recently
another concept was proposed this is the
vodka of Valyria so he came up with the
idea of corporate if equally blooms that
he defined for the single-shot games
the idea is as follows why don't we
believe that actually humans have
natural attitude for cooperation so
basically they start playing not a
single players but they would assume
that they would form coalition's and
then the word focused how a game would
how the game would have been played if
they form colleges and they take actions
according to the to their best focused
so this is just the essence of this idea
and it demonstrates actually
impressively high precision whens
directly implemented for the single-shot
games what we do here we just extend
this this approach to iterative settings
right so we define the iterated
cooperative equilibrium that combines
this approach with some ideas previously
developed for iterated games and what's
important here that in contrast with
other methods the iterated cooperative
equilibrium doesn't use any free
parameters so it's fully predictive so
we evaluate it on the travelers dilemma
on the prisoner's dilemma and the public
goods game and we show that it makes
quite accurate predictions for the
trivial for the travelers theorem we
also compare it to the logit loudoun
lonely model that was developed in the
original paper with the experimental
data and we show it outperforms that
small as well okay let me I have to
define it so a bit of noise a beautiful
tation so we take our way in the normal
form game with set n of M players as I
few strategies and you I I utility
functions for each player I we look at
the mixed strategies and the expected
payoffs to define a in a usual way and
the idea behind this notion is very
simple so identify yourself now with the
player I and just look at the game from
the perspective of of player I so
simply consider two possible situations
two possible scenarios either all
players are completely selfish so it's a
fully selfish play called PS where
everyone Maximizer optimizes his own
interest his own utility or all players
are fully cooperative so they pursue the
collective interest now with each
scenario we associate a value v.i.p well
actually index I will go through the all
slides now which is just an average with
the following with the following
probabilities and values so tau of P is
the probability that all players
actually do play the scenario p and tau
bar p is the complement probability that
they do not play that scenario but what
do mean what do we mean by they do not
play the scenario this means that at
least one of the players deviates from
this from that scenario pursuing his
individual interest so that's these are
unilateral deviate deviations not
collective deviations and this basically
means that for this scenario PS this
probability is zero right because player
would players would play just Nash
equilibrium and there is no unilateral
incentive to deviate for any of them now
the payoffs are so the e of P is the
payoff where the players play the
scenario p so either in nash equilibria
movie cooperative play and the payoff to
the agent I where there are deviations
is given by the infimum of the of his
games where other players debate from
that scenario we now use these values to
define to determine the strategy of each
player in the corporate difficulty blue
so we look at these two scenario we take
the one that maximizes the value of the
eye the eye of B and we define the
induced gay
for that scenario where we take only
those mixed strategies with the utility
the expected utility of a player is
greater than the value V right now this
induced game so this set is compact and
convex so this it has a Nash equilibrium
look at that Nash equilibrium take your
strategy this will be your strategy in
the co-operative equilibrium in the
original game that's the idea in a bit
more detail how do we compute the
probabilities and the payoffs so I need
to give you these phone numbers for two
scenarios PSP see so for PS we know the
probability zero and one for PC we start
in the iterative setting we start with
just completely fictitious play with
probabilities half for each in forest
scenario cooperated for deviations from
cooperative play now if player I absorbs
cooperation in the first round then he
then the probability of PC grows to two
thirds otherwise it drops to one-third
and in general if before round t we
absorb k cooperative place then the
probability to play cooperation in round
t is given by k plus 1 divided by t plus
1 now by cooperation we mean here
cooperation with respect to the
corresponding induced game so we look at
the previous stage we look at the only
on those strategies who are supported by
the induced game right and now for the
payoffs if we look at the game which is
I the prisoner's dilemma travel is the
remedy public goods games and it has a
unique Nash equilibrium and it also has
a unique Pareto optimal yeah
come individually the worst possible
outcome for playing a balanced it's not
social Optimas pareto-optimal so it
could be that kind of somebody select
the copper typically do with the office
say the worst to the table how can the
divorce on his diapers hmm yeah it
should yeah sorry it's it's burrito is
no day it should be there it's not
social it's not be social welfare mom to
its pareto-optimal and these three games
the Nash equilibrium is unique and the
pareto-optimal profile is also unique
okay so the the payoffs of the agents
are well defined in this to setting and
so we define the payoff for the selfish
play as the payoff of the edge and when
he plays a Nash equilibrium and since
the probability for that play is 1 this
is also the value of V for that scenario
for the co-operative scenario the payoff
of the agent will be given by his payoff
in the pareto-optimal profile okay and
the only value that is remained is the
payoff of the agent in when he expects a
cooperative scenario but the radiations
from that in the first stage this payoff
was given by the infimum pay off when he
looks at all the profiles where other
players have individual deviations but
he's stuck with the cooperative play all
right so he looks at all the Sigma's
where where the strategies of the others
are weak improvements correspond with
with regard to the optimum place for it
optimal play but he plays this
particular strategy and for next
iteration for the next iterations we
just take the every strategy is played
by the other players and we fix our
player to play the optimum the Pareto
optimal
so this will give his pale so this gives
us the values of we we take the maximum
one either for the selfish play or for
the cooperative play we define the
induced game take the Nash equilibrium
of that game and the strategy of each
player as the Nash equilibrium strategy
in his in use game this is how the
co-operative equilibrium with combined
okay let me know let me just show how it
works for travel is dilemma we play it
with claims between 80 and 200 there
were groups of 10 or 12 subjects and
they played ten routes of the travels
dilemma with either low penalty of b5 or
intermediate 20 or 25 for high 50 and 80
and they will casually matched after
each round so for the in the original
paper as I mentioned there is also the
prediction model of a lot cold sorry
called learning logic model which is
basically just the quantal response with
probabilities are calculated using the
logic functions the differences between
the two concepts are first of all they
are different conceptually the first one
cooperative equilibrium applies the idea
of natural attitude of natural attitude
of cooperation while the learning model
explains the deviations from Nash
equilibrium in terms of mistakes made
and computations by the players and
secondly the learning model uses two
fixed parameters the learning perimeter
and the error parameter why the
comparative equilibrium doesn't use any
doesn't use any free perimeter so it is
predictive while the other one is
descriptive okay so these are the data
for low penalty values the actual claims
of the players are quite high ok so the
these are
the first column is average absorbed
play across the rounds and it's quite
high and it goes higher to the end of
the experiment and both the iterated lib
room and the learning model actually
capture this tendency well I see comes
quite much closer to that than the
lonely model so this is how it looks
like the black line is the actual data
the red line is the llm and the blue
line is the co-operative equilibrium for
higher values of the penalty the station
as similar so i seee are clearly
outperforms the llm and it's very close
to the actual data especially in the
very last rounds it performs less
accurately for intermediate value of B
25 here actually llm and I see are
comparatively the same but also the
actual data is very oscillating so it's
actually hard to say to see any tendency
towards I aha by the high or low rewards
while the penalty gets higher then the
players tend to claim lower lower
enforcement in particular in particular
in the in the later rounds of the of the
game and as you can see for the very for
the very high penalty actually once
again both llm and I CER close to the
actual data but I see literally
coincides with the with the actual play
where they were the players by the way
played the Nash equilibrium there they
just claimed the lowest possible ah
reimbursement and LLM comes closer but
it never coincides with that four
prisoners dilemma we had well 70
subjects with 20 plain 25 rounds of the
prisoner's dilemma with the shown pills
and there were three there were three
treatments with different
merchants games either the players were
matched randomly to play with each other
after each round or they would be
correlated by one period correlation so
if they play cooperation the previous in
the previous round they would be
randomly measured between those with
those who played cooperation as well and
the last one is weighted history code
correlated meshing you looked back five
rounds you wait ah with Fibonacci
numbers doesn't matter you wait the your
place in the previous rounds and you
took similar players randomly this is
how it looks so the black one once again
is the actual data in the blue one is
the eye CEE it comes very close in
particular in cases where the matching
was correlated it's a bit less accurate
with random matching it looks let's say
less optimistic so the the database the
percentage of defection okay so it looks
less less optimistic for the for the
random matching which you can explain by
the high value of defection in the
intermediate rounds of the game so
somehow are yeah the IC gets upset and
and it continues to predict higher rates
of defection for the public goods game
also there were three treatments with
three different values of the constant
marginal return there were 36 subjects
for the first and the third treatment
and there were 60 cypress for the second
one and they played ten rounds of the
public goods game with groups of four
and the data it looks this way this is
probably the less optimistic ah figger
where you can see that i see prediction
especially in the first round is just
zero which is very far from the actual
number but
gets closer to that to the later rounds
but you can see that the standard
deviation here is very very high so the
actual data is very heterogeneous and
it's hard to predict it's better than
that and well possible but hard racing
and i seee stays within the range of the
standard deviation anyway so it's not
very close but it closed and it gets
closer the error decreases with the
later rounds of the interaction and
similar picture we see for the higher
values of the marginal return so this is
what they had to show basically so we
give the notion that is fully predicted
fully predictive it doesn't use any free
parameters it seems to work well in
particular and travels dilemma the the
predictions are very very precise the
questions are okay can we make can we
make better predictions in particular we
should tackle the cold start effect so
we started with completely random
probabilities of half half so we
probably should have done something
smarter than that second question what
can we say about the convergence of
iterated behavior right so if we talk
about i seee it can converge only to the
robins famous equilibrium which is
either the lower or higher claim for the
travelers they're more cooperation of
defection the prisoner's dilemma but can
the actual behavior converge to
something which is different from that
like if for example you would assume
that actual convert actual behavior in
the travels dear Emma would convert to
strategy 175 is that possible so if I
play one said if I know that my up we
converge to 175 so my open implies that
i can either reduce my claiming and get
better gain or i can increase
I claim and show him that we both can do
better than that so it's in fact
implausible that an actual behavior will
converge at all in this situation if not
that if not to the extremes and the
final question is how to extend this
notion to other relevant games models
where which are not as Extreme as the
social dilemmas where you have obvious
difference between the Nash equilibria
and the Pareto optimal solution we have
sort of obvious incentive to deviate
from the Nash equilibrium because in
certain games you may have the social
dilemmas embedded in meta game which
would result in more complicated
cooperative coalitional structures right
so then this scenario that you should
consider from the beginning should be
much more complicated but theoretically
it's extendable to them that's it thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
