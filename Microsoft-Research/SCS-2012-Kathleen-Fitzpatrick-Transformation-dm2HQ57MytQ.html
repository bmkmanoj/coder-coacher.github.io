talking about transformation last year
was the first time that I came to SES
which if you recall was focused in part
on the social life of books at reading
which is a topic that's been a huge
importance to me over the last several
years last year here though I found
myself a little bit distracted as I was
in the middle of considering a really
enormous career change it spent the
previous 13 years as a professor of
English in media studies at a small
liberal arts college in Southern
California and just before arriving here
I had been offered a job that I now have
completely out of the blue and I mean
really really out of the blue the job
didn't actually exist that I was being
offered and so right now waiting to
catch besides there we go from the
organization that I work for have
long-standing book publication program a
long-standing journal publication
program and those you know I've been
around as you might guess for a long
time they did what they did with the
kind of efficiency that those programs
work with but they were starting to feel
the pressures of the 21st century as
younger scholars and I don't necessarily
mean that as logical designation but one
that's more about mindset or methodology
we're starting to demand new kinds of
access to products of scholarly research
and there were also demanding support
for new kinds of scholarly work and
expanding traditional modes of
communication and Humanities be yelling
the book in the journal article the
traditional products publishing it to
include instead crazy things like blogs
and Twitter and other kinds
digital archives and databases and
visualizations and mapping projects and
a whole range of other modes of
scholarly communication that we haven't
even yet begun to imagine so this was a
challenge that as it turns out I
couldn't resist not least because I
spent a few years before thinking about
how to transform communication among
scholars and Media Studies who were
themselves still very focused on the
book in the journal article is the mode
of doing their work and so founded media
Commons which is a platform that
attempts to provide these scholars with
a range of tools that are enabled the
production of new kinds of scholarship
with a range of weights and time
signatures and forms of mediation from
the blog post through what we think of
as middle state publishing all the way
up to the monograph all of which are
presented in open malleable discussable
formats that are intended to produce
some kind of deeper interaction between
scholar and the media object but also at
the time you've been working on a foot
project called planned obsolescence
publishing technology in the future of
the Academy which I released a couple of
years before online for open peer review
and which is now at last out in print
from my you now here's the thing I'm a
humanities scholar write an English
professor by training but you can tell
that in fact that most of my slides are
just words but there's there's been a
lot of talk of around a certain kind of
cultural studies professor for years
about the desire to be about with
intellectual but these scholars even the
ones who want to be public intellectuals
have you until very recently almost
never actually done their work in public
and the idea of fruit approaching in
English
fester and saying hey let's find out who
research actually works in the real
world is kind of shocking so I was not
to put too fine a point on it terrified
I mean what did all of these ideas that
I had turned out actually not to work so
what if I got rid of the safety net of
tenure of n discovered that really
wasn't all that good a tightrope walker
after all senior last year though
something very fundamental about the new
ecology of research on communications
started to sing in which is that without
risk there can be no unexpected outcomes
and without unexpected outcomes there
can be no transformation and
transformation in scholarly
communication is my find my primary goal
so last year sitting in this room made
the decision to leave it started by your
job six months ago and while I was still
getting my bearings having spent the
first six months mostly trying to figure
out how things have been done for the
last 40 years and why I'm beginning to
see the real potential for
transformation on the horizon when for
instance our annual convention which was
just last week was wildly successful if
for no other reason than the way it
began to really showcase new
presentation strategies and the ways
that they can impact greater
communication among scholars and we're
working on a whole bunch of other cool
stuff at the MLA which is not a phrase
you would have heard very well been over
the last few years but I'm looking
forward to being able to announce some
of that stuff at the coming months the
key point of this talk is basically just
to say thank you to SES for inspiring
and encouraging me to take a chance and
so that I can hopefully encourage other
scholars to take some chances to thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
