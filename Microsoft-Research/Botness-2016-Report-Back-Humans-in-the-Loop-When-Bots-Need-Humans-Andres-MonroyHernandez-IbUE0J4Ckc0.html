in the loop so when bots need active
people behind the scenes and so there
were a couple of things that we talked
about one is what scenarios are good for
humans and what scenarios that good for
automation some people thought that
things that are very task oriented are
thoroughly fine if it's automated
especially if we know how to execute the
task but things that are maybe more
emotion oriented could be better for
humans and one example of an emotion
oriented one was some of the people in
our group were creating bots that helped
you with things that require a sense of
style or a sense of fashion like buying
furniture or or styling yourself and so
for that having humans actually it's an
added value for the experience the other
one is you know that there are also
other scenarios where is useful to have
a human which is when the bot gets stuck
and how to escalate to human is one
important thing to learn but also how
once you're in a human space howdy
escalate and go back to the automation
and it seems like there is some initial
work and that space will you see a lot
of opportunities for growth the other
one that people talked about this
disability to include humans that have
certain skills that either for legal
reasons or for other reasons you
actually need the human so people
mention things like mortgage brokers and
so on that legally you actually need
somebody with certain certifications so
for that you actually need to have a
human in the loop then the other thing
that people discuss where issues around
privacy and so once you have people or
humans in the loop representing a bot
people need to be aware of this but
apparently in a lot of the experiences
that people have had so far with users
you should really don't care that much
if there are humans or not especially
people talked about some scenarios with
teenagers and how there are pots that
interact with them and they really don't
don't have as much concerns about that
and then the other one that we talked
about a lot was how to source workers so
there are different ways in which you
can get people there is 1099 workers
there is full-time people full-time
employees and then there is like a
combination of both and so people were
talking about the pros and cons of
different approaches both in terms of
cost as
in terms of what kind of information and
skills you need and so some of the folks
in the T in the group were saying that
maybe you need a hybrid approach where
you have some decentralize and some
centralized task so the centralized ones
you have employees of your company
dealing with but the ones are kind of
menial tasks you may have people that
1099 workers or also doing it outside
the company and lastly we discuss what
kind of gaps that are in current
technologies for addressing these and
one of them was the training machine
learning with human labeled data
apparent a lot of the tools today are
simply about helping your route to
humans once they go from bought to human
but there is not a lot to kind of train
them the machine learning with that the
data some initial tools around the space
are like Lewis and with daria and others
they are still very rudimentary and
there's more work needed there and then
their ability to have tools that help
you transfer the state of the whole
conversation and historical
conversations between the bots and the
user and lastly wonder people have been
saying for a long time is this idea of
how do you transfer all these personal
preferences and personal information
from the bot from the user to the bottom
from the bar to the human in the loop
through some kind of personal API and
people were thinking that maybe Facebook
will be the best position for doing this
but there's also some concerns about
that and i think that's it and just in
terms of payments one thing is that
people have taken different approaches
for payments both hourly workers or task
based and section base and some of the
folks in the table have gone from one
model to the order for both costs
reasons as well as incentive mechanisms
sometimes work better if their
transaction base that's it
