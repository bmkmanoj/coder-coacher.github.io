Research in cambridge in the UK and I'm
Tim Regan and I'm going to show you some
of our research around printing
interactivity there are two sides this
research one looks at making it really
easy to design and model and print 3d
objects at home and then the other is
about adding electronic interactivity to
those components so over Christmas the
windows team pushed out drivers to some
key entry level 3d printers like the
MakerBot behind me and a store app where
you could download and print items and
what we've done is we've added the
ability to build your own models into
that app I'm going to show you a space
invader so the space invader is built
entirely out of small cubes bite
whistling round you can see that and
I'll just make his ears a bit longer so
if I add a few cubes to his ears he now
has a strange sticky-out ears when you
print him you end up with a model like
this one and this is what you might
choose to add interactivity to using the
technologies that Steve's developed
that's right so like tim says we want to
add some electronic functionality so
another technology we've been developing
is a way of printing circuits so
traditionally if you wanna make an
electronic device you have to make a
printed circuit board and you have to
solder components down to that and we
want to make that whole process much
more accessible and much easier in the
same way that 3d printing has become
much more accessible even to home users
over the last few years so what we
actually use is we've got this ink but
it's very special ink because it's
silver nano particle ink and I've got
some in a pen here so this is like a
regular felt pen and but I filled it
with this silver nanoparticle link you
can see it's Brown at the end of the tip
and I've got a piece of regular photo
paper here so this is like inkjet photo
paper and and if I just draw a line as
soon as the ink leaves the pen it
actually turns into silver so it's
electrically conductive so over here
we've got an inkjet printer it's sort of
like a hundred dollar a domestic printer
so now when the printer thinks it's
printing black
right onto photo paper it's actually
printing and a conductive circuit now we
can't solder electronic components down
because this is on a piece of paper and
you can't sold out of paper so we've
come up with this other idea we call
them circuit stickers and what we
actually do is we make these little
objects in each one has got electronic
components solder down to it in it in
itself it is like a little printed
circuit board what we've done is on the
on the reverse side we put these
connection points so the idea is in a
tour like vizio for example you can have
a pallet of all the all the different
circuit stickers you have in your kit
and you can drag onto the canvas you
ones you want to use and then you can
wire them up so then you can print out
your design and you get something like
this and the idea is that you your
design is it is made in such a way that
you can match up these contact points
with the with the components you want to
use but we still need some way of
attaching these and we can't solder to
it because it's paper so so for that we
use a special type of tape made by 3m
and it conducts electricity it's
electrically conductive double-sided
tape but it only conducts through its
thickness not across the surface of the
tape so if I put some of this tape on
them on the reverse side of one of these
these circuit stickers then it doesn't
short-circuit these connection points
but it does mean that when you stick it
down it's going to make a connection
through so this substrate that we've
printed the conductive circuit we
printed on the paper axle to wire
together your circuit so here you've got
a battery a microcontroller little
motion detector and a couple of lights
and it's configured so that and if you
if you give it a little movement at the
lights flash and then it stops so we can
take this circuit we can fold it up and
we can put it inside and the space
invader that that Tim showed us and we
can end up with something like this
which is an interactive space invader is
eyes flash when you tap it okay to
summarize what we've shown you here
we've shown you two different
technologies which we think are going to
help people and turn their ideas into
reality so you know first of all we
showed you a 3d editing application
which combined with the 3d printing
supporting windows as you take your idea
and create a real physical object but we
also show you another technology is a
little bit further out probably where
people are going to be able to we think
print their own circuits perhaps at home
and add electronic component tree to
that so that they can take the object
they've created
actually make it interactive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
