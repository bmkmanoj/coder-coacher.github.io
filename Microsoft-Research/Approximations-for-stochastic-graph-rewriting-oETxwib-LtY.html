you
it's a pleasure to be here and so this
is going to be less model modeling
language and more model but there's a
notation for models in the background
and I think we've nothing that much in
that direction will be interesting so
what we're trying to do here is to model
the problem of resource allocation so we
need so the first thing I need to do is
explain why it's important to model the
self that's my short introduction there
are three reasons so first of all
systems biology is not actually that
much about the system we're modeling
subprocesses little cascade map k
cascades for example was thinking about
them and somehow we all know they
function in the background of something
some bigger system and Chile they share
resources for example of all the things
that are wrong have to be expressed as I
you say they're to go through the
successive stages of transcription
translation and all sorts of
intermediates so the processes are
people trust that their models are going
to be you know surviving the
interference of the interconnectedness
of the process as they are described
with the rest of the system so here what
we like to do is to describe the rest of
the system to give a rather simple
minimalistic model of what the context
is a cortex is a family on ocean and
processors right as we understand them
in computer science so if we take an
engineering view of the problem
obviously we're going to want to put
circlets inside the system and it's good
if we can model somehow the relationship
the circuit is having with the services
that is drawing from the whole strain so
so we were talking about really
microscopic embedded systems and so for
them resources energy metabolites all
this is very important and keep their
good functioning and the third reason to
do this or we can return to
the first talk of this session Oakland
was explaining how you can evolve
circuits to perform better but really
this powerful view which comes from
evolutionary biology would be even
better he was informed by a model of the
physiological the global status of the
system we're dealing with so these are
you know free aspects of the reason to
try to capture something of the global
status of the system we're trying to
manipulate it or understand so there are
basically two ways to do it one is to
look at an exhaustive description
perhaps in a simple organism of all the
transistors and this is supposed to say
two things it's rather complex although
this is one of the simplest organism
known it's a form of mycoplasma and also
to say that all the processes have to be
seen together and they're in the
promiscuous environment sharing all
sorts of things so suddenly just mulling
them separately is is is an
approximation so this is exhaustive
style of modeling well there's also a
more simple sketchy way of mulling
things while you just have a broad
categories of processes and trying to
look at the interconnectedness in a
simplified manner so I'm going to follow
that particular route so I'll
distinguish for the sake of the argument
three different ways to do it the first
one is the one that was for example
developed by toei sink and scruffers
which is to be simple tractable but one
disadvantage of this approach for us is
that the problem of allocating resources
or the problem of how resources are
drawn for one from how the various
services so to speak of the system I
directed to battle or sub processes is
solved by optimizing growth of the
system or this is a limitation because
we know or we think I would like to have
examples where growth on maximizing
growth is not actually the goal which is
pursued by the host by the system itself
because maybe
Rauf is not Fitness and fitness is what
matters or perhaps just simply the
underlying mechanism that were not
describing are not capable of optimizing
growth in all contexts so to plug this
is a principle preclude the ability to
talk about those additional cases were
interested in then there's this very
detailed model so that that is extremely
interesting and it can ask all sorts of
questions but it's a huge monolithic
object which is pretty much simulation
only and very difficult to deal with so
we're going to try to reconcile the two
things get a mechanistic model where we
don't postulate grove apt analogy but at
the same time stay simple so I describe
the minimal model so piece by piece so
it's it starts with S which is some kind
of abstract resource which is outside
and if you can import inside and obtain
something called s I so like sugar
internal sugar and then that internal
sugarless abstract model is turning to
universal resource which people
sometimes call a precursor which is
going to be the one thing we used to
build everything we need inside the cell
to grow so you can think of it as ATP I
mean I said everything all the little
you know bio breaks you need to put
together a new copy of yourself so now
we can machinery to do this so here we
go we have an enzyme T which is going to
import or transport what's outside
inside and then another enzyme a which
is going to transform what's inside into
the the precursor molecule so that's
good now we have also the need to build
these machines so now we have a dark
blue material flown out of this
precursor when our changing them to
construct be macromolecules pauline
earth and we need a machine to do that
so that machine is our like ribosome and
the machine is going to direct the
floors of
is a niche see that the machine already
has a choice between direct directed the
one incoming resource to build either
some tea or some tea so we have a
location problem now this is biology
right it's so it's completely autonomous
so we also need a machine to make a copy
of the machine that's making copies of
ENT right so Rosen's actually can make
copies of themselves which is quite
convenient so this is the third element
we need and we are done we have a
self-replicating system but for the sake
of the argument were going to
distinguish two additional sectors in
the economy we can produce EGR but also
p which is some generic belt protein
with no particular function as a version
of P which is Q which is self repressing
and the interest of distinguishing
between both is that will see that the
behavior of cells retracts in queue and
afternoon number you ATP is very
different when the growth conditions
conditions change the first one is going
to be very sensitive to how fast the
system is growing which might be a
problem where the second one will manage
to have a level of expression which is
broadly invariant in lots of different
growth conditions which can be very
handy so the system is tractable we have
a bunch of eyeballs not meant not that
many reactions not that many parameters
which is fortunate because you want we
want to explore them each catalytic
reaction the little orange things here
is a model by a michaelis-menten type of
attraction also have a reversible
binding of ribosomes to messenger RNAs
so this is so this little arrow here is
two stages transcription translation but
we won't really need to look into this
and finally to keep things even simpler
we keep a deterministic version of all
this and see what happens so the problem
is to understand how the resources here
in synthesis so the translational
resources if you want I located towards
the various things that this machine
supposed to be doing so if you're the
sexual planner of this little economy
you're going to have to decide how much
of my resources do I push in this
direction or that direction of that
direction and you have a kind of a dual
problem which is how you allocate your
primary elements material you're a 480p
I think of it as energy so these are the
two problems we'd like to understand and
of course since everything is
interconnected some choices will will
have consequences of on the rest of the
system so here are few notations I the
ribosome lambda as the heb the growth
right so at the percentage per time unit
at which the system is growing TX will
denote transcription CL translation and
we have all these different five types
of proteins I arranged over them with
the variable X so the structure of the
model is quite flexible and actually I
this kind of diagram which we can call
catalytic diagrams which which come from
this paper to my knowledge maybe earlier
I a very nice type of notation for this
type of models example yet we have two
types of inputs and so we have two
inputs to the metabolism and I can ask
different questions we also have two
types of enzymes and we can ask you you
know which is so the allocation problem
is refined and you know you have more
decision to make so we can also talk
about choice between two enzymes with
the same diagram notation here we can
talk about the need to also take into
account the replication of information
because actually that machine the
ribosome does not make copies of
something just after the something it
needs genetic information which you
yourself have to duplicate with
specialized polymerize of which you can
make new copies using your gene which
codes for the machine that makes copies
of the information so so on and so forth
so this is digression this is just to
give you a feeling that it's a quite
handy notation to talk about whole cell
systems all right so I return to
our model so this is the protec mass of
the system so let's look at so what it's
made of so here you have the complexes
that are made of a ribosome and a
messenger of type ax so if I some of
these complexes and i multiplied by the
length of the ribosome kept all the mass
counter didn't I mean oh I said I get
the total number of amino acids that are
actually involved into that I've been
invested it's my amino acid capital
invested in making copies of something
in the system then I've got the free
part so these are the excess including
the ribosomes but I know that work so
this is always a fraction of the systems
where the machines are idle so for each
X i can define the mass fraction of the
corresponding protein so it's just the
total mass in amino acid / this complete
mass of the system and then the most key
important definition here is the growth
right so this says this is the total
work forms and work so this on your
items actually actively translating
something whatever it is and you
multiply this by gamma of fame so gamma
is the speed the rate at which the
ribosome machine is working in terms of
amino acid per time unit and it depends
on the level of energy so in a way that
we can derive and we have also some kind
of nickel is not an dependency and then
we divided by the total mass so this is
the IE that the growth of the system is
measured relative to the prior to the
current mass in terms of how what's the
percentage of increase of the maps that
we get a reference time units so the
growth rate in terms of how much biomass
we produce relative to the present mass
there's another notion of growth for it
uses division right and here we
postulate them to be equal so we get now
to fit that tractable model and what we
get data so the data points are the
little circles here they're coming from
a scenario
because and the model is a figured by
little crosses here so let's it does
that mean on to us that is very short so
let's look at the point so what we have
here is a so if we follow the zeros here
we have the coordinates designate in the
y-axis that the mass fraction of
ribosomes so the mass fraction of
working I mean I said if you want and
the x-coordinate is the rate of growth
and when we move along the zeros here
when proving the yield of the asian
molecule injecting in the system so we
see that we discover a roughly linear
map and covariant relationship between
how fast we grow and the amount of
capital in the system that's invested
into making new copies of itself which
is you know depending on where you are
coming from quite intuitive a lot and
here you can compare with the actual
model points that they are quite close
so then when we move to two and then 24
and 28 what we do is we perturb the
translational machinery we actually
decrease the efficiency of the gamma the
max gamma so we we impair the mechanism
of translation and again we see a linear
relationship here both in the model and
then the data point and that linear
relationship is now contravariant so we
see that where's here we were you know
code kavari when we modified this yield
of the initial molecule yeah what
controvery when I impairing the the by
using an antibiotic when pairing how
well the ribosome how fast the ribosome
translate just by occupying a little
slut in the ribosomes that's getting in
the way of the new translation so I was
going to pass for how many
I've got zero matter okay so I'm not
going to do that and so so these are two
regularities that have been well
observed and that the vowel recapitalize
and then we there's another low that's
been known since the 50s which called
the growth flow of model which is how
the growth rate depends on the amount of
nutrient in the system which you can
also capture in this fashion so I just
finished with one slide and one we won't
have time to show applications maybe
I'll flash you some pictures so the
really interesting thing if you remember
the choice we didn't make which was to
optimize for growth is that there is no
specification in the model that tells to
the model hi chip allocate those
resources it's entirely generated by the
differential reaction of the
transcriptional translational machinery
to the level of energy in the system so
maybe just a tiny bit more concrete so
depending on the ATP level the amount of
the normalized amount of transcriptional
response we get will depend on the X so
if DX is the ribosomal machine itself
then you spell it rises later and I've
done your rest of the system so this
means that if I have more energy than
mechanically the entire economy will
produce more of the final machine and
then we'll get this effect of shifting
the fraction of the the protect mass of
the system towards more ribosomes so
it's a it's a simple but key example of
the type of effect you get by the
interconnectedness of the system so i'll
give you of this as a meditation so we
have applications to scenario you can
plug in a synthetic circuit and see how
an oscillator for example relates to the
growth conditions and how we can
modulate the amplitudes and depending on
this so we see a fact and another
application as at the population level
the multiscale design where we see that
we can explain
a critical decision making in cell
systems by the fact that there's a
connectedness between different
decisions being they made by different
cells the data that are mediated by the
fact that they have their all draw from
the same resourceful so and in fact we
establish with the model that maximizing
Roth is not it's not the same thing as
being maximally fit and it's fashion i
gassed up there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
