managed Applied Science Group here at
Microsoft Microsoft we have the vision
of the magic window and this is a large
telepresence wall that allows users to
walk up to it and gesture in front of
the screen and also and also have a
telepresence experience that are that is
really close to the screen and far away
at the same time and in order to create
that experience you need to be able to
capture light through the screen itself
so you can do the gestures that are
nearby and also send the image of my
hand across the world that is really
close to scream so to do this we use a
very special lens that we work on here
Microsoft it's called the wedge and this
is a flat PF this is a piece of plastic
with a very unique shape on it and it's
able to guide light that is over here on
the surface I'm going to take this piece
of paper and hold us up to the camera so
that you can see the wedge itself and
I'm going to put that piece of paper
down and there you go there you have it
and there's that piece of paper and
that's the image that's guided down that
piece of paper you can see it's coherent
and it's clear and so if we can put a
camera here down here and hook it up to
the computer we can capture a light
through a screen so we take this wedge
and we put the switch behind this
special display and this is a display
provided by Samsung it's a special
prototype it's an OLED but next to the
OLED pixels are clear windows and this
almost like looking through a screen
door so we have a wedge looking through
this kind of screen door capturing both
infrared and visible light at the same
time so here I'm showing you my infrared
cameras and they're looking through
looking at my gestures in front of the
screen you can see I'm pretty far away
from the screen I can get really close
and and the image stays the same when I
can move really far away I can even
track things like my finger all the way
out here you can see my little that rail
red dot and my finger kind of wiggling
back and forth but this applications
just shows the functionality that we're
capable that's just this this prototypes
capable of doing so I can walk there on
to these digital post-it notes like so
and I can take an object with this kind
of bar code on it and I can recognize it
out of free space and going to burn kind
of room there so i can create room i can
recognize objects that are out there
much like surface did but service does
that on the 2d plane this is the
it in the 3d plane i'm going to show you
the ability of capturing white light
through this place so here we've written
down the magic window on a yellow
post-it note and i'm going to hold it up
to displaying you're going to see i'm
going to actually take a physical scan
of this post-it note all in kind of one
fail smooth and so here we've shown you
the ability of a display that has unique
capability of capturing infrared light
and visible light for the purposes of
gesturing and telepresence applications
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
