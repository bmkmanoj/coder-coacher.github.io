hello everybody welcome to design Expo
yeah so this is the 10th year we did the
design expo i'm just going to talk for
about five minutes and give you a little
bit of an overview and then each of our
nine schools is going to do a quick
presentation about a 10-minute
presentation and then get some feedback
from our critics and if we have time get
some questions from the audience so we
started this really i'm one of the
things that we get out of this is every
year we identify a problem or a
challenge this year it's making data
useful and i think one of the things
that we do by giving the challenge to
all these schools is we really learn the
student perspective you know across
different cultures different skills and
sort of different ages you know what
might be some interesting problems and
solutions to the challenge that we give
them and then of course one of our goals
is to really build long-term
relationships with the school some of
the schools have done this you know many
many times every year we rotate schools
so every year we also have new schools
and I think over the last 10 years we've
had about 50 or 60 top schools pretty
much from every place you could imagine
participate and so so welcome just a
little bit on the process usually in the
fall we actually select schools and
professors we've worked with the design
community across Microsoft and then each
school actually holds a semester-long
course in the spring on this topic and
there's a lot of work that never comes
here they have a lot of projects that
don't get selected to come here each
school probably has about four or five
projects just in their school they pick
a project to come out and together with
their faculty they come out and they
present this together as part of the
faculty summit so you know if you have
other questions about any other other
projects make sure you meet the faculty
and talk to them and hear a little bit
more about the schools because the
curriculum and schools and programs are
really awesome so this is
the challenge one of the things that we
did I few of the people who participated
in the past emailed me and they were
saying you know clay and I think the
school from Israel were saying you know
what's the challenge going to be and i
said i don't i don't know what would you
recommend and so we always collaborate
and work with our faculty to try to pick
topics that are really relevant in the
schools and this year it's making data
useful and really how does that how my
there's so much data around there's so
much talk about big data but how might a
single person an individual or a small
group of people or maybe a city sort of
experience the data in a way that's
really impactful and meaningful and you
know today of course we're just at the
beginning and so I think you'll be
pretty excited by how the students had
sort of interpreted this challenge so
just kind of want to give you as a sort
of an eye test if you can read but just
wanted to let you know these are the
schools that are participating I'll just
quickly name them and the professor if
you could just stand up and wave that'd
be great we also have a liaison from
different group across Microsoft he's
gone they're all semester long and has
spent a lot of time this week sort of
working with the students so first we'll
have NYU pleasure Keys the professor
there yay from IDC the interdisciplinary
center the me lab in Israel we have
orange liqueur Minh and Noah morgue
from Carnegie Mellon the school design
we have Peter so if Hallie and Bruce
hannington by the way they have on their
team shirts so good team spirit from
UCLA we have the digital media arts
center such Christian Muller and soo
hyun kim and k series but i think their
professors weren't able to make it so
but they're awesome and then at the top
we go to Eindhoven from the netherlands
the ID group and we have Barry Egan from
India we have the national institute of
design or nid so it is rupesh first time
the design expo we have Northumbria from
the UK with Trevor Duncan I Bo americana
from Mexico City Jorge Missoula and
University of Washington axel Rustler
alright so with that we're gonna start
off oh I almost forgot we also have
three critics so what we do is we have
the students present and then we get a
little feedback and we have some awesome
awesome critics Tony done from the royal
college of art uh duralde bishop turtle
and i were actually interns together at
apple a million years ago and we're
students when we saw this starting and
bill buxton
and then behind stage there he's I think
he's listening I could see him Mike
Kasparov from truckee knees my partner
in crime and sort of pulled this
together and makes this happen he's
hiding does he's partner in crime it's
criminal alright so that's it for me how
fun students have worked really hard and
we'll kick it off with and my you hey so
um my name is Oh Mel this is a Donna
this is Carl this is Michael we're on
facebook this is actually how we see
ourselves on Facebook for different
personas like this is the aim these are
the images that we see and this is
really important because we're about to
present you mine mine is a service that
allows you to see yourself the way the
data miners see you now if I were giving
this presentation when we started six
months ago I would have to explain what
data mining is and convince you that
you're being tracked I don't think I
have to do this now the Snowden case
showed us that actually you know
governments without any problems can get
a lot of your data what it didn't show
you is that companies can do the same
thing with relative ease so let's talk
about Dana Meyers for a minute you know
what let's not talk about data miners
let's talk about Sharon she's Karl
sister she's 31 single um and she's
she's looking for a house looking for a
house means that she's looking for a
mortgage and looking for a mortgage
means uh something completely different
than what him in 15 years ago because
Sharon uses foursquare whenever she
checks into a pub someone is making a
note of it and selling it to her health
insurance that's worth money that's
transaction that's worth money she also
uses Facebook so whenever she takes a
picture that's embarrassing you know it
gets sell soul to an HR from an HR firm
takes it and sell it to her next
employer also when she tweets about
spending her bank makes note remember
that mortgage
the other thing is like she also uses
you know she can use LinkedIn tumblr
multiple tumblers that's all worth money
this is an entire ecosystem which one
one member is missing the creator of the
ego system she has not seen any of that
that is not her property we want to
change that we want to give Sharon back
her identity want to give back her data
so giving Sharon the back the power of
her own data is where we started with
mine we wanted to help Sharon understand
how others see her we wanted to show her
how she might be able to use that to
alter her persona a bit too to protect
herself online we spoke to over 150
people both both in online
questionnaires in mechanical turk and
also with in-person interviews and we we
asked questions based on our own social
media that we volunteered such as the
following here's Carl we have two
versions of Carl and we asked which man
would you invest it invest with rather
the Bunnyman on the right or the serious
thoughtful guy on its first date maybe
we thought that the man on the left
would be the winner but over seventy
percent of our respondents said that the
bunnyman was the man they would invest
with because he seemed more sociable
amiable and maybe even more able to get
money for the enterprise we also used
negative images such as these we said
which of these women would you would you
would you want to lend your cell phone
too and we thought again the
mean-looking but serious one might be
more prone to give it back to you
however it was the drunk woman who
seemed to need it more and most people
responded they would lend their phone to
her which is kind of an uplifting
surprise here we we also did some single
questions open-ended questions to see if
we could tease out a different kind of
insight here we asked did we you know
would you invest in this man and most of
the people we talked to said well if he
were doing a start-up they might invest
with him but if they were getting into a
hedge fund or a mutual fund forget it
something that we found in these
interviews was the power of assumptions
and judgments that people bring with
them when they're reviewing the social
media of those they don't know but with
the comparison pictures we found
something interesting we discovered that
actually we might be able to use what we
got from those to create a kind of
bubble sort of opinion that we could use
to possibly enable people to create that
elusive quantified selfie thanks Donna
so through our process we learned a few
things one of which was that context
really matters yes that's me on the left
aside from the Jersey Shore s style of
the photo on the left it actually
humanizes the data on the right if you
were just to see a bunch of check-ins at
bars every night of the week you might
assume the worst but in fact looking at
the photo it's just friends getting
together and hanging out we also learned
that people need buffers gmail has undo
send you have medium which is a personal
publishing platform that lets you post
to just a few select people before you
go completely public so our goal at mine
is to be that buffer but for your social
media we learned one last thing that
like 10 years ago when people were ready
to come together on Facebook snowed in
and other events that have happened as
of late have created this community this
community that wants to get together
help each other and protect their data
mine can be the force that brings this
community together so those were the
goals in mind that we thought of when
you're creating our interface thanks
Mike so Homer talked about these big
machine automated data miners and then
Donna talked about these humans that are
judging each other one-on-one and we
went through this whole design process
and now we'd like to show you what we
came up with so when you first launch
mine you have to plug in all your
different social networks
the more you give us the better we can
help you so once you hook it all up you
click make it mine and then you're
brought to this first part so a mine
analysis consists of two parts you have
a machine analysis and a human analysis
the machine analysis you know as soon as
you hook up your data your different
social networks it breaks it down into
different attributes that it notices
about you the first one is the most
prominent and then it goes down to less
prominent ones and it breaks it down
into posts those are just normal posts
you know talking about what you had for
lunch fax these are a number of
check-ins the types of places you
checked into and then assumptions and
these are the types of things that data
miners would assume about you based on
your data so the next part is this human
analysis and so the human analysis you
have to select which attributes you
would like to highlight and hide in your
social media profile so in this case
this person wants to look more
influential and so they drag it over to
highlight so then they can see how they
stack up so a part of mine is this karma
system so you might see this in online
dating sites and hot or not you go
through and you do the side by side AV
analysis that we found in our user
research and so in this case this person
wants to appear more sociable so Sharon
if she's using this click set one and
then you do this over and over again
until you put enough karma back into the
system then you get your human analysis
here this is a breakdown based on what
the attributes she specified Risa
previously and so she Scrolls down the
green plus there is things that she
highlighting and the minuses things that
she's hiding so in this day and age
where data mining is not a problem it's
a reality nobody's looking out for your
data you should let mine be your canary
all right guys is this working okay um
every choice so just jumped into those
um how's it going it's interesting other
um so at what point do we're at what
point if you're competing against system
does the system then start competing
back against you how do you feel about
well so the thing is you know it's an
arm it's an arms race as long as you
maintain it that way like data mining is
usually is between machines it's kind of
like if you think of high frequency
trading it's sort of the same way like I
date a mind then you hide something
we're trying to cap that we're trying to
say data mining is a reality use that in
order to you know you can face your data
miner and say this is the information
I'm serving you and no more this is the
order that I'm serving in this to you
and I know all of this so I'm not afraid
of what I'm posting I would not be
surprised when it appears on my HR
report that's what we were after we're
after capping this arms race at a
certain point and it's possible that if
things get to the point where we have no
where there's no data because everyone's
hiding maybe we can start to make money
from our data miners want it then they
can pay for it I think I'm sorry look
obviously I just think the real value is
I know it's always this back and forth I
think the real value is the community
that if they come together I don't know
if there's an escalation from that point
because it's just then helping each
other out and being that kind of
impenetrable force I'd like okay if
something retraining each other yeah to
be more mindful of what they post that
was not a tenant fun but yeah let's do
mind your own business definitely a
behavioral aspect
so I'd be so thanks for the presentation
I mean this I like it because it's
confrontational in an interesting way
but something's important and I think it
just in the very title the double
meaning of mining versus it's mine is is
well chosen and in place to the point
I'm confused in some sense as to whether
the objective is to help give me some
reflection of myself back so i might
control my own image in terms of what i
make available or whether at the back
end to some way and this is the part I
don't understand is that how this would
prevent information that data about me
from being captured by mind elsewhere
because if we were going to make money
and keep it private I don't I haven't
grasped where where the firewall is that
that's my stuff be mine until I give it
to her well certain stakeholders like
Facebook they have all the data anyway
so can't really do a lot there and even
if you delete it they already know what
you had so yeah this part of the system
is it's a one-time process it informs a
user about what sort of assumptions are
being made so that they might make
better decisions in the future now we
need to design this in this sense that
this follows up in the future say
regular intervals at sensitive email
updates like hey did this but that's
there's potential for that but the best
we can do today is just you know educate
the user and give them the control to
hide or up you skate or maybe delete
things that you know somebody like maybe
a third party network would not have
access to otherwise all right thank you
thank you there's a third did you get
the canary in the coal mine Gordon yeah
the canary in the coal mine now I think
it's a really provocative doctor I mean
you wanted to see yourself see what you
get these results</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
