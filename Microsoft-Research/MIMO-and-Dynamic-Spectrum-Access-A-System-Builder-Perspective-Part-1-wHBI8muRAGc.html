you
hi all welcome to the post lunch session
yesterday you heard Coon talk about
software his upwards seven-year pathways
the software-defined radio a platform
now you'll see he's done a lot of work
on my mo in the past few years and much
of it actually has been done on Sora so
I think he that's what he's going to
talk about now so let's hear what is but
it's thank you ass and get off them
everywhere and thank you for thank my
talk so in this afternoon I'm going to
talk about to slightly related since
when is a mile and another is a Hellenic
spectrum access the to pod and as
Krishna is now so basically talk about
from the system point view it is how we
can view the system implement my mo
basically how to make the mind almost
scalable and also how we can in label
this dynamic spectrum access as a first
pretty maid of day one is this okay so
oops
so actually the motivation of this are
nine of this research is simple is that
we designed more while its capacity
right so this because of now the one is
networked you become the primary Network
for access so we help our bones of this
smart devices smart phone tablet and
this Ultrabook which use the wireless as
the only access to the internet so
that's why we need more wise memories
and also the because because this mobile
device became more powerful so they can
enable a lot of this data incentive
applications Naga doing the video
conferencing 90-day even a Terry
presents that consume needed to
communicate a lot of data so currently
we have talking about how the data
pattern as most likely from they
interacted to your device but now with
this all these smart devices so the
Paragon need to be retrieved so not only
the download traffic you can vary
increasing still increasing but also the
uplink our traffic so we need to
consider upon how we do that but only if
we improve the downlink traffic goals of
the uplink traffic so it'd have been
predicted some prediction have made that
so actually we have going to carry more
data traffic over one is instead of this
wide link from that mix let's say just a
moderate we little more while its
capacity so
yeah so how can get more wine is
capacity first day we have used at the
spectrum reduce so basically we say that
because the one is just a propagating
certain range so if we can reduce the
rent and put more export and so you
eventually you can get more close to the
exit point and you can use a you can get
more capacity right so it's like I think
having a long research along this line
next reduce safer from 32 point view
which we just reduce their sale signs
from this macro cell to micro cierto
femto sale but already complete up on
the wall Wi-Fi is it's already very
small okay so probably we have and reach
the point that the seal should not be
that very small because if the series
become a really small than the handle of
things mobility become more complex or
demand your network but anyway this is
one way to do that not only is so we get
more spectrum okay because we know that
from the competition series that is this
more you have more frequency to transmit
you viene got more capacity but we known
as the spectrum is basically a shared
resource plays a scarce and it had a
limit okay so there's an arm research to
can use of battery on me so normally
currently is a frequency reuse for
communication is usually below the 60
gigahertz okay well as their cell
research line to do communication over
very high frequency like a 60 gig hers
but but but but that sure this is a way
to do that but the other way which are
which going to color in this talk is how
we can use existing spectrum more
efficiently okay basically there are two
ways the first day is I how can we
escape squeeze more bit are ever occurs
of frequency current if we can use okay
so this basically regarding to the mod
important might help port of my mo six
and a second series which reduce the
spectrum are this
list of the spectrum the hollow can be
more efficiently allocated inspection
for different while I psychological-wise
devices so they say so regarding to the
dynamic expect my access so you this I
packed this is to Catholic I will lead
to three just so we know that say the
moment range so basically my mode can be
modeled a swing so we have a stream of
data then we'll strip the data updates
to different antennas okay and
transmitted simultaneously on this a
different this multiple output china
antennas and this waveform going to mash
up and no one is channel and it received
as they receiving antennas and this
receiving antennas doing a drawing a
single processing to dmacc plaques or
this us this transmission slick laws so
they got these different spatial streams
okay then with these different I glitch
spatial streams you're going to kill the
container on the map them and decoding
them so we get to implement bit let's
say transmit so make it more
mathematically is that we model the
channel as a magic show is a penta n
metric so each element of the metric
corresponding to a probe kitchen pass
over the wire channel from when transmit
antenna to a recent in 10 okay now with
this modeling they receive in siglo is
can be represented by the channel our
matrix multiple by the transmitting
signals and of course price a random our
knowledge here then we got these are
these equations so the mammal decoding
is basically to solve these two
equations okay sorry it is very simple
if H is square and the invertible we can
invert ball we can compute the
Shh that's inverse of the ash and a plus
in the multiple that chili receive the
signals so then we got ax and we got the
ax and we basically we do the all the
decoding / and regardless information
please in general if the transmission
antenna and the receiving antenna is not
equal then the H is not square but we
can also still 10 do they solve this
equation by gets a pseudo inverse of the
edge basically we can on to compute this
this one on and then we got ax okay so
this basically called 0 40 I'd say of
the idea of y is equal to zero forcing
because the decoding part can be
considered of how to just zeroing out
all itself into fruits then you can stay
desire to seek willow stream from the
Psychlos but we can do better if we know
the last level okay so you know
previously we have this it's done worked
previously we have this noise listen
always considered but in this decoding
process we do not consider this a lot
but even though the last level
equivalent to date the better the handle
this noise so we change the decoder from
this one to this one and this decode
mmse that is a battery on decoding
mechanism if we haven't considered a lot
of lowest level so this is basically the
man wore breeches but the minor
abrasions requires is multiple antennas
and both standard and the receiver okay
so it's not your case that as a mobile
device you can have many many or receive
antennas right because there is a size
consideration there's a power considered
region and so usually we consider that
the access point it can have many
antennas because in more powerful is it
have the power supply but the mobile
stations this mobile device only have
very few like one or two antennas okay
so with then how we can extend the mob
region to the situation when all this
mobile device have only a few antennas
okay so this is our idea would come from
the come to the idea of the multi-user
mine so ideal multi-user MIMO is net we
will treat all the collection of
different small devices as a as a big
and it's virtually a station that have
many antennas okay so now you have the
uplink of bridge and atomic operation so
let's consider opening operation so I
think our region is that basically all
these mobile device transmits a close to
the actual point so as long as we figure
out a way to sync rise that we can do
that by by Sonya Burke has message on
the channel so that this mobile device
transmitted simultaneously nanak is Pawn
basically confusing the same MO
operations my multi coding procedures to
decode this message okay then get the
information from each of the mobile
device okay so it's basically the sea
and as we can cause some validity but
the timing is very different because now
we gather remember that when you do they
mammal decoding we need this drawing
process in that means you need all the
information from each and receiving
antenna and to cancel a self
interference but in this darling since
us us down in case this mobile device
our justice individual devices do now it
cannot communicate to each other
occasionally so basically you cannot do
the joint single processing okay but we
can have a clever way to do this is
basically we can move this joint single
processing from receiver to listen ok so
this process is called precoding
assuming that the access point know the
channel state information to all this
mobile
then the sender can compute a precoder
the basic is another magic will call it
p a p equal to this are so this R this
actually especially the channel state
and P equal tube is one okay very like
this pseudo universe of the channel and
instead of transmitted X you transmit TX
okay so you can simply verify that ask
the channel the H&amp;amp;P just a cancel each
other okay then each receiving a breach
mobile station basically guide say
spatial streams that's eight design okay
so they do not have a self interference
the infinity is cancelled wine is
transmitting the signals okay so this is
the basically they buy more and Matthews
the Bible operations in Syria so so this
is very promising a details in theory
it's linearly increase the channel
capacity by deploying more antennas then
you get basically unlimited capacity
right but the question we're going to
ask can we what kind of system design
come in May to really make a large
scalable my mo system okay what's the
issue we need to consider in your system
design that's really snatch this one is
capacity skill with small antennas
deployed in our access point so we will
talk about not skill so highlight is
large right so it we need to have set um
go because in system these are always
have a go there and see if we can you
achieve this okay so the door is that of
course this is automatically set is one
to realize a vision that we can deliver
a get beat wise link to every mobile
users ok so y will take a dick wait
because now we have the gig
Bissonnette way so we want to if we say
we shift all the traffic from the what
network to the one sec we need to
provide at least comparable being speed
to the different users so net way to
pick up the geek bit one is so this is a
state bots are so if one would do the
gig be one is how many antenna and
bandwidth so we have these different
band ways and different antenna say we
just compute how much capacity we can
get Siri in optimal case and we say this
basically what define is able to tell
you Ray okay so it's up to 44 by for my
more and deliver knock 690 the per
second let's move it and this part is a
2011 83 so it's sad are we can support
at eight of ignore it okay so and up to
160 megahertz a bandwidth so now we
change that you in order we going to do
that we say this part is the nautical
mamasita matagi that so we can sub hold
100 antennas and of course at one point
a 160 matters anyways yeah please
this way
in this case for the downlink that's our
the downlink will be specific to each
client yeah yeah so basically they say
so the donning case say they the
exponent can select which user to
transmit okay then guides a packet for
each user's then do the precoding
percentages and the transmitted signals
simultaneously on each of these antennas
the egg the exit point has okay then
this simpler is just a mashup and each
receiver because it's a it's a properly
precoded they're each receiving a digit
mobile user basically cats just to get
the signal is target at it then it's
just passed through the normal decoding
as if there's a one-to-one communication
okay that is a key is a precoding
because they can so the channel cancel
the channel your facts before you
transmitted signals okay
now yeah this is a the assumption here
is that exponents knows the channel to
each mobile device okay so this is a
assumptions and then you may have a clue
to how we get this channel state the
information ok let me do factually so
they're basically it's why I can do
better because because so in my mo you
do not the sender may not lead the
channel seat ok because receiver does
commander the channel in the cat or the
village but if you're doing Matthew the
mind what you want to do the precoding
process you lead the standard has its
channel state information so NASA is
concerned then of course you get more
information you can do better ok and
mobile location on that ok
yeah so so this is a Widgeon to have
this large number of antennas and so it
can gave particularly when we consider
about if we support only a 20 concurrent
users considered a kiss pointed to cover
a certain area so now in average
appropriately only a few cans of mobile
users there so if we can cover this
small area then we see properly we can
do that being different because of the
special news so this is a lot trying to
picture is light you've always supported
this so 20 concurrent users in this
bandwidth at least we need forward he
and tell us okay something here okay so
they say what set about go we're trying
to support 40 antennas the data
automatically so we is still improving
improving to achieve mythical right so
what's the change basically I think
these are the chances are that's really
nice the first change if that actually
have just a management so in order to do
the precoding is required the standard
gas the channel state information it is
not you know you can get because the
channel is wearing right so it's a it is
channel at high point so how can you get
this information it's really changed no
and the second is that if we really want
do a large-scale mimo system then they
do the whole drawing processing consume
a lot of competition how we can build a
access point actually can do the rip
this signal processing real huh finally
is above neck and we'll clean it while
building my mo transmissions pick how
the different users actually sick
recently a fact your scapula t if you
pick up the wrong person of all wrong
mobile users in a group of that being a
mole transmission sometimes they may not
increase our capacity okay now we say
that's picking up this
is user selection is really where hard
problem and we need some ways handles oh
you can still Synchron set you can do it
you can do a synchronous pepper sure
yeah so the question is that if the
uplink is what computer async lines now
they momma doesn't improve lot yes but
this is that when on this traffic is a
light no of course you didn't leave my
mo because you're wise capacity is
sufficient to support these
transmissions okay but when the scenes
gets congested that means you will
should have some mobile users have
package backlog at the same time okay
otherwise you won't calc impress it
right so when it gets congested then you
have some users gets their backlog
package at same time now you can using
the my mo the mac user manual to
transmit a simultaneously to to get
involve enemies oban more capacity okay
okay so how we can get this as general
States Army repeatedly catch the channel
state information on the sender or cold
as a 10 si si si si basically channel
state information acquisition problem
okay so because the you usually can all
get this a start from the sender so the
conventional way basically have the
feedback loop okay so idea is simple so
to serve a standard the exit point
basically transmitted or so gross siglo
on H of this antenna in very close time
treat you can trigger that symptom and
the Tuesday receivers and for each also
close trading symbol all these receivers
going to measure the channel state okay
and the guy to this channel state and
packet in some form of packet and get
the feedback to the expo okay in this
way we can celtx but the problem is that
it actually says it's not skill on
because you will even matter this
channel state on everything and so they
from the mac layer we can have a
three-stage it got an arrow stage fake
backstage and the frame the frame
filming basically you transmit the data
three okay let's do the precoding the
transmitter food okay on so stairs our
measurement is anemia with a number of
the antennas you want to make your how
many transmission on Tanner you need to
measure that so considering our case we
have 40 antennas ok then each we
transmit eight model seconds so this
basically will depend ways in falling
total bandwidth is 20 makers by default
okay so if it's a larger if a wider band
we need a longer train of symbols okay
so this is my own page on Tandy so then
we have this 300 a millisecond time to
measure the channel the feedback
actually takes a lot of time ok this is
still Nene with a number of tennis you
need a transmitter package for every and
inner care to this is our packet so
actually you can every load can trans in
the packet for all the CSR space is a
measure for each transmit antenna
yeah yeah yeahs on if you have a wide
band it means you have me more energy
because they you date energy on each a
fragmentation that we keep our concept
Oh know this because ah yeah yeah right
oh yeah all right that is done in the
change so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
right yeah joy so this number is not
depend on the venomous yeah yeah even
longer boundaries that you have a mole
sampling rates then your kids a simple
concept right so but but the packing in
the packet gets more Oh f you leave the
program boss you'll need to do the
coding and so on so forth and you need
to consider by the rate so actually this
number we basically 1.4 made hers
because we just say just why pick this
is basically using the noise rhythmic 6
mac for mac with a second motivation for
the reliability for some reason and then
you just pack all the bits you want to
measure this a sign into that so this is
a a long packet and in sum total is
really announcement now you're 50 46
milliseconds right but a consider about
data transmission comes about the lomo
packet side ok so it's only take a few
milliseconds or transmit ok so if you're
considering this way actually you guys a
channel measurement you spend more time
that transmit has really usable data ok
Yeah Yeah right thanks Troy yeah I just
this is just a back panel so let's see
how we can improve that yeah okay so so
let say how are we so yes you're right
so can accommodate by one way is just
like using the free application let's
see I do a lot of frames in one
combination but actually we consider
this a you didn't rule a lot of frames
do this right and so you did not film
have other concerns night he increase
the delay and also increase the
possibility of being in the fears and
the packet loss my yeah certainly
although the coherence time yes so first
the same we can say you previously seen
that one of the majority over high is a
feedback okay so we're trying to get rid
of that so the idea is that they have a
consider we're using a channel
reciprocity okay now we can remove this
feedback hey by the music birthday is
like you nothing imagine why it's
channel okay it's basically the
propagation path of this video we okay
then consider about standard we're in
this transmissi glowed goes through this
pass certain pies and it will get a
receiver only we realize that it's
basically the receiver standard siglo it
should follow the scene pass okay so
this is Nancy fuller channel should
equal to the are to the reverse chain so
net is how the channel reciprocity
states okay yeah but see choose is that
the media this treason part mean this
propagation can it's only part of the
transient only in the path of the
channel that you make it as they base
their okay basically why you transmit
you should go through this transmission
chin this particular holloway then go to
some wireless media
in the media and the received I'd
recipient okay so you go these parts now
we know that the channel is actually so
affect the channel of this transmission
basically this factor multiplied by this
vector and this vector ok but it will
reverse the just passing through
different channels different the
transmission and dignitary ceviche okay
so it's like they say we have a
different channel covalent Z which the
channel receive the only hoes at this
part consider about the publication so
we'll even consider this model actually
we can solve that we got these equations
like the darling a pass is a just a
factor of the uplink past then we
rewrite this factor at the jiah khan the
good news that this g XR is basically
depend only on the hardware okay it's a
don't change over the time so we can do
a calibration whence when you first
register the access point we do the one
calibration then can use that is known
as you do not you do not restarted read
you keep the video hardware running okay
so and that means actually channel
reciprocity the reciprocity after
carefully treatment it can be used in
particles the second thing is how we can
reduce these per package there's
environment okay so that actually the
idea is a very simple we have it at kerr
has mentioned about the channel coheres
time I mean the wines channel depends on
mobility this should keep in constant in
certain time period okay so here is like
you said some one of the measurement we
have done getting in our building or is
that if you used to be we stay still
okay just don't move z coherence time
can be very very large
like 200 milliseconds okay you'll do is
try to move if it reduce the to unite 40
if you do relative of the as a move one
meter perspect one meter per second
means ugh as a normal working then it's
reduced to 40 if you read it wrong
something not care not another fast
around a dude walking very fast now you
still have the 10 tens of milliseconds
co-head of time so so we do not need to
measure chan a matter that is a sod in
so only get only only need Wednesday's
on measurement do lyrical has hot that's
enough right so we do not do need to do
the per packet but by the second so what
do you mean really me ok channel keeps
did keep constant right what's it really
mean right yes actually if you measure
the channel from the baseband the
channel continuously change never ever
can found the two channel measurement
adjust a constant ok the rhythm because
as I mentioned the effective channel is
not a lot on it determinate by this
propagation part but also your hardware
/ ok now you have a transmission chair
and the recipient here we have different
frequency offset ok so these are tokens
half size if you keep on changing your
major channel in a way that it makes
this channel so this h 0 means these are
you know i'll say some some true channel
that's the reflects a prepetition
property of the awardees channel but the
this weapon is all set of this hardware
chain and i keep on this rotation with a
certain speed ok this part vary over
time ok so actually the channel never
keep constant in practice ok the
different hardware a la jara difference
make it running keep
so now the problem is that when you do
the channel matter we need to matter
that at same time okay but different
users may have different or so may have
different coherence time okay you need
to update at a given time and also you
may pick up different users you know to
even one technician so you'll pick up
this user so that means how you can come
by come by the measurement channel
measurement from a different time
instance to form a precoder is really
the key if you cannot do that that means
it's all reduced to really tune the
matter because you pick up a different
user it leaves matter channel because
this compilation of users is you leak in
your transmission okay so we need put
more study on how they see us on the
element house it's met how this CSI a
difference over the time impact a
precoder design so they said basically I
just using very simple to buy to our
mark user mode case ok so the axe phone
I have two transmission antenna and the
station each station have one antenna so
as to you two stations now when the
station measure so we consider whether
we supported okay so when the station
where I made the channel be basically
the season one transmitter transmits
training symbol and the AP access point
Mary Channel right so the gods least not
so this mega as they are as say t1 time
can point and the t2 they a peek at this
measure at the t2 point okay so actually
it's different from if you measure at
the the channel it looks and different
if you measure the channel exactly
before they will transmit the packet tu
tu tu station when asleep
but what is the impact how can I do some
math is that we can decouple that into a
this two part okay this part is
basically you do not have these loading
phase that means it's just determined by
the media propagation structure okay
this part is determined by the time you
measure and safer can offset or between
the transmitter and the receiver this is
hard way of determining dependent so
actually fortunately this one does not
matter when we do the precoding because
it can be correct as a receiver okay so
and when you turn this right okay why
this part this is different from what's
a real channel Madrid but this is a
doesn't met you when we do the precoder
so actually we can expand that using a
cyst following expanded in the following
equations we divide that so they
precooler basically we just using the
action so they actually is not the true
edge but today while we have and just
artificially put together not this one
okay so they have this this part we
return that to the lambda okay it's
partly tonight 0 so the precoder steel
is the reverse of etch then you can
translate into the s0 of the universal
at diesel and the universe of this
dialog Oh magic okay now if you consider
about it when you do the precoding and
this pre-coated a stickler goes through
the channel actors a spark cancelled out
ok so the channel propagation in the
fridge just canceled TRG now in lat to
da da da
a magic so they say it doesn't matter
too much because we still attached the
training symbols at each packet the
spatial spatial streams then this can be
measured at the receiver and a crack by
the receiver is a basically a phase
rotation of the siglos so now we still
do that just treat these artificial
combine the channel as the dual channel
then you can still do the precoding so
this is a very large property okay
method imply the exponent can track the
CSR of each mobile station in Japan okay
so the access point basically maintain
database database it just get each entry
just a record the CSI for each mobile
station okay hey how's ur is a channel
value a time stamp at which it's a
measure and attract coherence time to
that user okay now when you do
transmission just check out these
database say if this user this
compilation of this user have they are
relayed a korean-style coherent saw
entry it just put it together in the
form a precoder and computer per quarter
for that and we found that if the
exponent on some station Channel just us
just become us become alpha babe it's
just the easter egg send a measurement
request to the user and that user is
trying to send out nano the training
symbol to update this entry so this
makes this channel tracking and channel
states tracking incremental okay so
that's a very nice property if you want
to design a scalable system okay okay so
i need little creature okay so the
second thing i'm calling about it is
scalable on goodness on signal
processing
so so what's a why we did consider about
it because we can do some very quick
back of an envelope calculation on how
much computation relate to do a
processing on Microsoft so so you do
that still enough the example likely to
keep it linked a user actually a
computer that firm the data policy would
be a few hundred gigabit per second to
get all these digital samples to the
excellent from the exit points are
firmly antennas and then when you do a
computation a channel in viewers and a
spatula traumatic taxing and the channel
decoding it takes a lot of computation
power to do that ok so you sum that up
which means is required 7.2 terror
operation per second there's a lot of
computation again how are you made in
hand build a single chip that do that so
that means I shan't shrine if you
consider the centralized some
centralized entity doing days it's
basically impossible you cannot it may
be possible but we're very difficult to
build a single chip to learn so there's
still the you see that on anything we
can do make a skill that we can paralyze
this joint a similar processing ok if
you can paralyze that means we instead
of building a huge chip to do that we
can have a many small processing unit
issue they imagine a junior and tony
part of the processing and then could
with Kaiser connect all that without
together and we'll get the old a data
all the streams bond okay so actually
the first think of that is really easy
right because because the transmission
the dinero transmission is naturally can
be paralyzed paralyzed because you
transmit each packet independently so
basically can have this a bouncer for
percentage server to land by somebody's
fastest an attitude that work and the
antennas basically do
a packet detection okay I have a packet
and then I trans me the older packet it
too when server like this okay now goes
the second pack head and send advantage
server so we can do this as long as we
so let have enough service we can just
like process all these siglos we get ok
so that's a it's a not big deal but it
will real problem with that is taking a
lot time to process on a single server
so actually that they induce a non
processing delay lucky we'll post as our
packet inmagine package i could fold
here antennas easily good to one second
to process that even on comic incur in
the state flight server ok not a 16-core
server so but we know that Y is profile
portico require usually milliseconds
feedback ok na kyo dude all 11 is really
micro second novel but if you want to do
some 3g or as icing and that would go
into milliseconds 3 millisecond or 10
minutes so these are a huge difference
here so we need to some further
inspection how can we speed up the
packet the the packet processing not
only do they pack the paraline let you
know we need to destroy the person these
are the package speed up the packet
processing so in look at they saw our
this much destroying the processing or
this as a mime or processing pipeline
because this channel universe and as the
spatial multiplexing and the channel
decotis so here by channel decoding
basically i include all the demodulation
parties there because they so basically
not that different from maternity Cody
so this subpart basically a performed on
the each subcarrier okay so it's a
naturally idea to do the subcarrier
paradin on based on this two-stage and
the channel decoding is performed on
each
spatial streams so actually special
stream pattern can be used as a stage
after this observation actually build
system to form our by the way we lived
at a big station the bill that is
disputing the problem ok so we group the
servers into three stage ok so each page
also contains a group service is
performed the same task at this stage so
they trance the sick laws cooling to
from the front side sir module a
basically this video from there ok now
you then transmitted to different a a
server at the stage and a shuffled at
the datastage in the shuffle nano stage
ok also yeah right so each each state
contains our group with servers at doing
further do any days data parents so
therefore operation is not face ok so
after they and antenna they got our
samples on each subcarrier we do the FP
here and go to the samples of each
subcarrier and the partition the seekers
or cooking to a superior and stand the
lasik low to a sim sub curler choose a
channel inverse our servers and the
spatial multiplexing service ok now do
the channel universe here and then do
the special democratizing here at this
stage the group's Z on these symbols
according to their spatial streams and
the shop for the data again and make
each subcarrier according to the spatial
streams ok then the decoding server
working on this spatial dissipative
stream so now take an example on so if
we have a gig bit to 20 users so
inactivation so it's 160 matters being
slit is is totally hyper for
hundred and the 688 peril subcarriers
and now they will use a subcarrier
parents the HS server leaves only to
handle minimal 10 megabit per second
data they say is a corresponding data
array of a single carrier so there's a
minimal you can you want it get so this
is either you can process actually
current server can process much more
than this so we can handle several sub
carriers and the spatial stream petition
then each server decoding server need on
handle five gigabit per second but you
still consider previous is 200 gig
people second now it's only five get
productive but you can really use it to
feed current or like a business like
metal pole and the multi-core
architecture okay price by seeing that
when you do the processing at the single
server we still need to consider the
parent of the server itself because now
we have imagined the server have a
macbook cause can have a lot of SIMD
instructions then can you Pro this
server on paradigms if you them exposed
well then actually can do the processing
real fast fortunately we found that the
kitty origins are used in my multi-tech
generic metric measurement
multiplication in verse and without the
decoding actually can be party easily
paralyzed ok I'll different the cause
and so there's a jazz activist fuel
example like a metric multi black
publication is really you can doing a
divide-and-conquer way actually you can
you can rely that become a to the
multiplication of two sub magic and the
each of them can be assigned to deepen
the car and to get a result something up
then you you just read make the make
them the speed up the process the
channel universe can be also can be
paralyzed we're using a way called
chosen causing Jordan method which one
is just the Eugene pendant Lee doing
this elimination of each lines okay its
laws then you'll get you can assign a
different role to give in the cause and
in doing this elimination on
independently then finally you can't got
this result in a pair of matter okay
Nestle is pretty full but the number
there is not possible for is to paralyze
the Viterbi decoder okay so it's
actually exactly why it's difficult
because the Viterbi decoding is
performance on a sequence of continuous
bits it's soft bit okay so he's
instantly cannot be paralyzed okay so
one way we can do that we just
artificially divide the bait streams
into blocks and assign the blocks
different calls and doing this decoding
but that has a problem because on each
at the boundary of the blocks they do
not holding this convolution property so
then sub this boundary it will cause a
very high a bit error rate okay so in
essence all good so the solution is
that'll work just a padding little bit
okay oh this rocks so with decoding
through these are this great blog but
this data we do not really use which are
just remove that so we treat a little
bit overhead on computing but we get
more accurate result of this salt is a
it's blue box then there's a pitcher in
the hallway can design the right block
sides okay this is the piece is
basically the between the latency in the
whole hat so we have a lot of blogs name
we have a nice overhand because this
part basically 0 hat okay but also had a
longer delay so actually we the goal we
want to do is to fully utilize this
computational capacity while keep this L
as minimal that's
we have a minimal delay why would keep
the whole processing unit a busy so
basically the intuition is that so we
catch this equation to do this but the
intuition with the question is that
we're elite partition the block in the
way that after one blocks the bank one
proxy being decoded you can immediately
get a new block and to schedule a new
blog on this processor without any gap
so you without we do not have a gap then
every processor simply cheap and easy
like to do in tickly so this isn't it's
not that difficult can divide that
yourself ok so there's only of course
other optimization because when when one
communication property is that we have
different over the different state we
need to shuffle the data rights of the
deed so there's a one problem where is
not a problem when you do the
communication because all the data are
going to transmit to one particular
server there is a possibility that the
server buffer going over wrong and they
got the packet loss after you've got the
park laws then create a processing delay
this is because they need retransmitted
packet so this problem recorded the ink
has a pole so you just a many standards
dumb data similarity receiver and the
receiver simply get lost because there
is not enough above it so but but this
problem we can solve that because we
know exactly know the package check your
pattern because we know how much data
you can get okay then we can provision
in the package other mean the provision
there is a buffer carefully to avoid any
packet loss okay yeah and also other
computing start auditing in town did
move it okay let's see some Marco
benchmark on firstly we dead say our
this channel universe actually say that
extra can perform channel universe very
well with current server on for example
if we want to have these 40 and
hennas actually can do that within two
hundred mil effect okay it's pretty fast
and if you have more calls it can
further increase they reduce the
settings be okay so actually if I found
their channel universe if not really a
bottleneck of the internet system and
also the spatial multiplexing actually
we can do as a 23 more than three
gigabit per second our ways it's a four
course okay and for Te'o is close to 1
gigabit per second okay so spatial
multiplexing is you still ok ok now we
technically Cody's do the bottleneck ok
with for call so we kinda only boosted
the the trap super to dr. barely below
this 300 negative second so we want to
have the one gig we need more course
maybe a the course or even more don't do
this but anyway the point is that we can
scale the processing speed along with
circle at many calls and we can speed
this up so the whole point wika got this
be the point then we can do some
hypothesis analyze how much service we
can get if really won't do are not just
kill my mo muna so so they start
basically with sweet contribution we
want is a media skill not ask you and
ultra skill so also skilled is reflect
you 50 users each one I have the one
came in second last guilt when the user
6600 and Peter second per user so with
phone calls actually I'm pretty with
volcko servers we can do that media of
course itself doesn't it doesn't need
move many many servers ok only a few
servers can do that now still we can
manage but he still a lot ok for the
organized actually going to be a decent
to tell you this processing ok there's
too much
but there's only four core server but I
can consider that with currently already
have 16 cores and in a few year we have
swing so here is 332 course ma'am it
going to significant reduce the number
of servers we need so we still love that
small but this you can handle being a
small rules just a few racks of servers
can do that yeah it's a really a target
ball target ball go that we can we
achieve in a few years did you yeah Dave
it you could yeah yeah yeah it's a good
question so wait you think about that
but having extra this I'm not sure I PG
@ XX VV on definitely compute f PG so
you still need a large many many of you
gene yeah yeah yeahs number of them yeah
sure so actually we put up this on this
or am I milk it so its own Iker so this
would this is a securities a
four-by-four sauron meinl video from
Earth and we connect that with swim
services as a front end then we have the
line back back to a peasant we have you
know you know you know office and we
have using a 12 server to process this
across and then we're very exciting on
that and so we're only a benchmark
firstly about the per second delay
because you know where we need to stuff
the data a few times so the processing
delays actually like a 860 macro sec
because your transfer family day day is
alight and doing this so they go the
reason y Gasset
Nathan say because we control the
transmission pretty well so we never
never an overflow this switch buffer
because we know the traffic so it
controller 12 control the transmission
rate where we are so you do not overflow
the bathroom it will not have the loss
ah yeah but it will of color with you
have a lot in a clean this have this
hairy too and if we have a more Harriet
note that means we have other traffic
going on that almost if you have this
the means you like this number but do we
have a longer tail okay because of the
interference of other traffic death but
what I'm saying that this view can be
improved with currently advantage of
networking her logic one path particular
tackle can use is the remote at EMA that
can replace the TV PRP which okay
achieve not a hold of magnitude improve
in the latency okay but by by by the way
so this number is pretty good for 3g and
cellular Perth course if you can get the
data processing one millisecond so it
gets the first experiment with 14 scree
parents experiment what we found that
the result is actually not encouraging
right so no increase the antenna but
shall we they just capped at some point
and it never goes through knock nike you
know it has a 100 maggot second then now
goes through then we find the 1i we did
it because in this experiment we choose
the receive antennas it's as an equal to
it speed antennas that means the
transmitter always transmit like n
different streams to 10 different users
okay for in it so that's a problem we
found and on that because it was a
random users in action it basically you
cannot fully utilize your get giuffrida
if you try to you push through that
doesn't improve your capacity ok so in
acts experiments we actually will always
use the 12 antenna transmit antenna but
to change the number of receivers so
it's from 02 and they're not now I can
summon the early increase capacity of
the of the valleys ok and then we go to
the line they say is a Mac point we do
BR not it's capped again so you know or
say that regardless these are six point
seven times in pool in capacity but it's
really me the problem is to me how it
could pick up all this user's might pick
up these user is really critical to
scale the lat work to scale the wine is
capacity so I probably are still here
and again the second part i'm going to
cover this one ok yeah sure please
mmm is number Alan Emmys number of
antennas all right access point because
if you have a more antennas then you'll
need more competition to do the
mathematics because you have neither
dematic magic you'll need more
computation yeah so that means you can
process the last samples per sec okay
second um i would i would like to have a
practical example like what is what I
sense is when you increase the number of
antennas like we did the example of big
AP and then we have large number of
users in practical terms it boils down
to having as many number of servers like
each server it's more or less like each
server for one AP or one Anton on types
no no so is there really a benefit of
creating a huge system with this R is
still we go on a simple type of a
one-on-one kind of a stuff and we can
still achieve this benefit I'm can you
give a practical example of a huge
system and getting benefit with the
complexity involved in so much of
precision and I think the question is
asking if we why we need to build an H
not a skill they come back system right
okay compared with just so you know
currently standards specify this son
yeah six okay I think there's a weird
question to think about say you're
basically in this research we just try
to push something to limit okay we just
see how much a large scale we can build
okay now in practically of course we
have a lot of other issues to consider
an alkyl naka naka in practically how
many user is a typical asian in your
room and there's if there's any
application that really required at high
throughput is a given given the
perspective on that yeah and from our
perspective as you just try to
understand how fast how far we can go
yeah it's a relay since yeah yeah
yeah lassila yeah the last light why was
it hitting a ceiling or m is equal to n
like was it because of channel
characteristics or you mean how I cap
yeah and yes because this you can
consider about this ok because it's a
kind of random pick up users so you're a
tease the channel it's kind of thrilling
ok yeah now we know that could be held a
native a legit tell me briefly tactics
so actually the channel will be the way
you do the decoding actually we need to
cancel the self interference so how are
you self interference going to affect
each other it really depends on your
channel ok so if the channel is very
correlated so you need to spend a lot of
energy to cancel this difference when I
say wire have a different channel
capacity as catch a node structure of
fact I'll capacity so really random pick
up a channel coefficient if your magic
goes the notch there's a theory on a
random theory as it more likely your
girl curly red hair the channels okay
then that means you do such capacity per
ticket increase the number of the
antenna doesn't get by you more
correctly because these channels either
created okay the number of antennas
increased the HIV head it will be kind
of identity matrix kill entity so there
is a lesser number of collisions right
journal entries yeah so yeah so he's
taking into account real effects that
come from correlation yeah yeah yeah
this assumption there is an assumption
rate it's only 40 ed right or you only
have tdu yeah the apathy it's difficult
because they'd be the propagating
structure going to different yeah
because I dip in the frequency but I can
say that FTD is more more and more
systematically even ltd going to have
fdd-lte so you in Beijing Lee only have
a TDD out okay so we have quick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
