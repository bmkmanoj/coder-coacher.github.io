my colleague Simon PJ you think soda
from a shirred his talk as well in the
course of the years and is one of the
most popular elements in the school he
will give the first talk of the school
and the last one as well today it will
be on how to give a great research talk
so Simon is a principal researchers in
the programming principle and tools
group
he's also says his research is very much
around functional programming languages
so he's worked a lot of his research
life on Haskell and specifically the
Glasgow Haskell compiler Simon's also
very well-known he's now the chair of
the computing at schools Society so he's
been involved for a very long time and
has been instrumental for a change in
the UK school curriculum namely making
computer science a mandatory science
subject and in schools which is a very
great achievement here here in the UK
and finally we've been very proud that
Simon was elected as fellow of the Royal
Society just this year so please welcome
Simon okay good well you will note from
your program that firstly a talk about
how to give a talk is a somewhat
recursive endeavor and also that the
last talk of the Summer School appears
to be the same as the first one so
perhaps there's an infinite loop in this
recursion but actually there isn't it's
just a misprint the last thought Willie
is different so one this is kind of
about how and why we might want to give
them a search talk so I think it's
helpful first of all to position it and
say what are we doing this what are we
doing this for I think research is about
communicating with people it's all you
know we we have this kind of picture of
people sitting in windowless room
staring at screens having great ideas
but actually for me it anyway most
research actually happens in dialogue
with other people and research talk to
an important part of that dialogue there
there was sort of big part of our
communication and I'd invite you to
think if you've probably been to quite a
lot of research talks by now how many
times have you been to a talk when you
didn't just you know you sometimes
somebody i sat through that talk while i
sat through six talks like how many
times you been to a talk but you didn't
sit through it you thought I'm really
glad I went to that talk I learned
something I was interested in it I came
away a bit excited by it
think about those talks and what what
did that what was this speaker doing
that made you feel excited it probably
wasn't just that they were speaking to
the precise area that you yourself was
working working in that can help but it
was probably something else about what
they did or said so I kind of like to
invite you to to think about that and in
particular for this talk what I want to
try and do is to give some sort of
simple actionable ideas that I think
might help you you've better talks the
good news is you know the general
standard is not that high so you can
shine without without without too much
trouble
and so as scarlet says I'm a kind of you
know professional researcher I'm sort of
sharing the ideas that that I've had and
found useful to myself I'm not a you
know I'm not a professional communicator
so you're going to get a completely
different picture from the professional
coaches you talk to but I think that
dialogue also might be quite intriguing
to you now research is about
communication and giving talks is not
about the kind of thing of which about
which the right answers so it will be
much more fun to me if you instead of
sitting there though politely and and
stoic ly listening to me you would
interact by asking questions or by
making comments from your own experience
so but don't don't just save them to the
end if you just sit there like bread
puddings I will feel that I have failed
so you have to help me feel that I have
not failed okay so why young so this is
the last piece about some why it's worth
paying attention to it was worth paying
attention to speaking is that when
you're speaking to let's say you know 20
or 50 or hundred people you are
consuming you know 20 minutes worth or
or half an hour an hour's worth of
people's time and that's the s the
commodity which they don't have anymore
of rich or poor we all have exactly the
same number of hours in the day so by
coming to your talk they're giving you a
kind of priceless gift that they will
never have to give again which is
something of their time so it's quite
important that you pay attention to it
so the first thing is what is the
purpose of your talk if you listen to
talks you would often think
this was the purpose right it was to
sort of impress your audience with how
clever you are right and to show them
and sometimes if you listen to a talk
you would think this person is trying to
tell me everything they know about this
topic but because it's only 20 minutes
they have compressed everything they
know about the topic into a sort of
tight you know highly compressed bundle
that nobody could understand and that's
really not what giving a talks about I
think it's about communicating a single
idea right so I'd like you to when
imagine giving the audience some
intuitive feel for the idea they don't
need to have a deep technical
understanding of the idea that you're
presenting but it's really good if they
can go away with some intuition so one
one thing I think is helpful to bear in
mind is imagine that your audience
contains you know five or ten percent of
people who really know about the topic
that you're talking about but there's
another 85 or 90 percent who know very
little about it they may be a computer
scientist they probably are computer
scientists but they're not gonna know
about your particular area of networking
or you know static analysis of pointers
in programs but and you'd like all of
those people to take something valuable
away with them rather than to think this
talk isn't for me I'm going to switch
off and read my email you see the point
so we want to kind of what can you give
them that even a non specialist in your
area will take away and think he's
valuable to them and you want to kind of
make them feel that they're glad they
came so what would make them feel that
they're glad they came well something
that engages their interest in
excitement and so you know kind of
conveyed that somehow now of course that
would be easier if your audience was an
easy audience so that the audience you
would like is like this they have
they've just jumped outta bed in the
morning there were full of vim and vigor
they have been reading your papers for
the last five years and are eager to
understand the next piece that you have
to present to them and and moreover
they've earned aces thoroughly
understand the technical background of
course this isn't really what happens
right what actually happens is they
don't know you from Adam or from Eve
they don't know the technical background
and moreover they've just had lunch
right so they're in that saman and post
lunch phase in which if they're not
somehow engaged they're going to slump
into a kind of dose so your goal in it
is to kind of wake them up and make them
feel I really want to listen to this
talk I'm going to pay attention and the
other thing is you're very politely
sitting you know looking with you I can
see your eyes like often when you're in
a research talk in a conference about
half the audience you won't see their
lies because they're looking at their
laptops like they haven't been told by
Scarlett not to read their email so they
will be like and that's not them their
fault it's yours right so it's got to
make them drag them out of their laptops
by thinking I'm going to find something
exciting here and so I want to say a
little bit about what to put into a talk
and a little bit about what to what not
but rather more actually about what not
to put into it
okay we searched so fast through at any
any other questions or observations so
far so what do you put into a talk well
perhaps quite a lot but I would suggest
not very much so I was just there two
things one say something about what the
motivation is what are you trying to
achieve and then secondly focus the
whole of your talk on one key idea and
you need to know what that is
so I want to say a little bit more about
both of those things so the first thing
is what's your what's your motivation so
in it when you give a talk you have that
that sort of two minute bit at the
beginning at which every audience will
give you some leeway they will pay some
attention to you at the beginning so
it's quite important to kick off quickly
so I find it quite a lot of talks I go
to I'm paying attention for the first 30
seconds and then the speaker goes into a
long riff that appears to be sort of
general fluff about the beginning you
know I'm glad I'm here and I came on
this plane and he is the general kind of
thing I'm doing I kind of lose lose
attention so try to dive in really
quickly with something that's going to
engage their attention so and what is
going to engage their attention well if
you can say something about what problem
it is you're trying to solve and then
give some reason to believe that it
might be an interesting and and a
problem that's worth solving because in
you know in computing there are lots of
problems and not all of them are worth
solving
like novelty is not so much of interest
in its own right saying all that later
this week and and and then it's helpful
if you can give early on some indication
that your talk is going to give a
worthwhile step forward not just you
know here is you know Mount Everest and
I'm going to wander around it but here
is you know a reasonable-sized mountain
and by the end of the talk I'm going to
taking you you know to at least the
foothills right so give them some
preview of what they might get to if
they stay with you so here's a kind of
here's a couple of examples I'm going to
stand back and look at these but they
don't have these off by heart right so
I'm a PL guy so this is you know Java
class files are very big give some big
figures so it's sort of sort of some
brief numbers and so the idea what's the
key idea maybe we can use some kind of
compression technology to shrink them so
they take less time to send over the
network and then and then then but then
maybe it could be language aware right
if it's a generic compression technology
just gzip you might do so bad but if you
knew that you're compressing Java maybe
you could do better so so that's a kind
of you know you could think there's
something vaguely plausible about that
idea you say actually this idea works
quite well we can do you know 30 percent
better than gzip and I'm going to show
you how right so now you've got in a
very short time you've got a quick
overview of the problem and how you're
going to solve it well this was another
one how we going to find synchronization
errors and concurrent programs everybody
knows concurrent programs really hard to
write lots of you know race hazards when
you you know mutate one verbal and
another and read it in another and I'm
going to show you a type system that is
a kind of static analysis that's going
to help you find at least some of those
errors a particular class of the others
and there you might give an example of
the cut immediately give an example of
the kind of error that you might find do
any very quick summary of what you're
trying to draw you're trying to achieve
and so that was about the motivation
part right that was the first bit so
you've got that kind of two or two or
five minutes at the beginning to again
their attention yes could you put a
video there well it would kind of
depress so that could be great right if
it was a video don't you know say that
you were oh I have such demo over people
who do robots right but supposing you a
robotics person and you could say I
figured out a way to make a robot walk
better you know and you show a video
that says here was it walking before you
know and then you know is it walking
afterwards like that would be that would
be highly motivating right so but it's
um it's um has to be you know relevant
to to your talk like if it's just hey
I'm showing videos not so good so if
you're a sort of person
do video as well absolutely go for it
but of course remember typically I'm
thinking often of a sort of 20-minute
slot in a conference right or you know
or maybe half hour I sort of it's a bit
rare to get you know full and how I talk
so videos have to be quite short to pay
their way yeah anybody else yeah yes
please have comments are good oh can you
sort of make sure everyone can hear you
well don't you speak to me yeah at IBM
so it's how they train you and they make
you do presentations to all sorts of
people so I think one thing that I
learned over the years was that any talk
or any presentation has to be dynamic I
mean you can sometimes you can prepare
for hours or days but when you arrive
somewhere and you gauged the audience
and the kind of people they are there
maybe what you thought was going to be
motivational is totally mundane and
boring for them so I think you have to
also be quite receptive on the go on
what they're absorbing and what not and
willing to change yeah you know as you
go along the presentation I mean it
could be a video or a joke or sometimes
it could sound lame so it depends on the
audience I think it's quite a two-way
thing certainly being responsive to
notice particularly if it's a smallish
audience that you can engage with this
is kind of really helpful and you should
if you know you need to in the end have
the confidence to kind of give up a bit
on your planned presentation and divert
if necessary but yeah anyone else is it
good yeah it is really important in your
life we see two different people and now
you are talking and speaking louder and
moving around and using your body to
mimic things it's much easier to follow
you up and seeing the motion and you
getting out of you and you know we're
seeing that that you are really
motivated and like so I'm quite a bit
more to say about enthusiasm and
presentation towards the end of this
talk so yes how you present I'm so the
moment one what to present and we're
going to get to how to it's super
important super important thank you okay
let's do a bit more about to what so
motivation and key idea so the key idea
is really quite important right and when
you go when you leave a talk here's an
exercise but every talk you go to this
week when you walk out say what was the
key idea of that talk that I've learned
if you can't articulate it the speaker
not you has failed right so I you can
you can you can try this out of my
colleagues this week it would be quite a
laugh so but in when you give a talk try
to make sure that the audience could be
in no doubt what your key idea is
because really a talk is a kind of it's
like a it's like a pill that you're
giving you know the audience is
swallowing the pill and it's carrying a
payload right of the drug that's going
to infect their system and you want to
kind of get that idea into their head so
they can't think about anything else
like it sort of tuned it can't don't
forget like so so but you've got a you
wanna you have to know what the idea is
because if you don't they certainly
won't all right so that's why I say yeah
ruthlessly prune the material around the
key idea right so you have lots of stuff
you know you'll have been when you give
talks you'll have been working for
months on a particular talk or
particular you know maybe it's a talk
about the paper the paper has quite a
lot of material in it but somehow
there's a the core of the paper there's
a key idea that's what you've got to
convey right and and everything in your
in your you know took your talk you
don't have very long has to be pruned
around that that that moment and
moreover I think it's helpful if you're
explicit about it sometimes you have a
key idea but the audience still doesn't
get it right so you want to you want to
be absolutely clear you can have slides
at the top that say you know this is the
key idea you can you know stand on a
chair and say this is the key idea at
this moment if you remember nothing else
from this talk remember this I get
across the key idea and making make sure
that the audience know what is that
make sense
I'm super super important now another
thing that you will often see in talks
is that they kind of try to cover too
much right so I call this sort of
shallow and broad rather than narrow and
deep like so in order to position your
talk you have to say something general
about the area that you're working with
but sometimes people do a sort of you
know a horizontal you know a shallow
trench that covers a lot of ground but
not in any great depth and that's very
unsatisfying right what's much better I
think is to do a short overview that
positions what you're doing and then do
a sort of deep dive I call it you know
producing the technical meat right
imagine your audience is sort of hyenas
you know they need something a they need
a red meat we've got to give them some
something substantial and that's this
sort of deep bit now that means that
there are other deep bits that you've
dug like and I put a lot of attention to
that you're not going to tell them
that's okay
like they can get that from the paper
but you have to give them I think part
of what engages a technical audience is
interest and enthusiasm and you know we
are talking about technical audiences is
some actual technical content right and
it's difficult to do that because in
your in you know computer science is
very specialized so to take your
audience in 20 minutes from zero to some
actual content in your space you'll have
to be pretty precise about what you show
them and what you don't why you cannot
show them everything does that make
sense yeah yeah Bob Oh cost and when
you're speaking to other people entirely
it's even harder right so like if you're
this happens I sit in this room a lot
but and Microsoft interview talks and
put people at the interview for
permanent posts they're asked to speak
to the whole lab so I'm listening to
people in you know who doing machine
learning I'm a PL guy and I'm struggling
to understand them but that but but
nevertheless you know it ought to be
possible for a machine learning person
to explain an idea to a PR guy right
even an idea in their in their little
patch so it's harder it's harder the
more your audience knows about your area
the easier it is yeah okay but I do
encourage you don't don't just do the
you know we got the Wiswall system and
the you know that sort of issue the
shallow shallow
and but in order to do this but how are
you going to present this this techno
material well do it by example
right so examples are your main weapon
in presenting ideas clearly never in my
humble suggestion least there's a
starting point
never present you know the theorem or
the generalization first instead produce
an example remember we're talking about
some motivation I put up what did I put
up a couple of examples right to
illustrate what I meant by motivation
and when we're talking about
synchronization errors I said well
perhaps even at that moment when you're
saying what to frame your problem rather
than talking about synchronization
errors in general you could produce a
particular example of a synchronization
error and put it by putting right up
there so people get there get a hold of
it right so everybody in their learning
always moves from the specific to the
general and yet extraordinarily when we
present to other people we often try to
move from the general to the specific
it's completely bonkers or the way we
all learn is this way right and so
that's the way should take your
audiences it's not you know a universal
truth but it's a pretty good starting
point and all that the good thing about
examples is they can often when there's
a complicated technical point right so
sometimes you you do get into technical
something say why does this equation at
this side condition you can say it's
because this example demonstrates why
it's necessary right you can show an
example that says oh now I see that you
know the simple rule wouldn't work for
that yeah because I mean most of the
time people seem to switch off unless
it's like a really technical conference
so this is let's say Oh what are we
gonna what to leave out there I'm gonna
skip to a bit about what to leave out so
one one thing to leave out is too much
technical stuff right so this kind of
slide alright and then you know you
people put up these kind of slides you
could see the audience going oh they
sort of you know reel back in their
seats right because and the trouble is
that it makes them it's a bit daunting
and unless they're really into this
stuff they're not reading this I mean if
they just makes them feel stupid right
but they think I don't understand this
the other people in the audience very
clever chaps you know they they all
understand this but I don't I'm a mere
worm I will
so you absolutely like and yet right
I do think you want to get to some
technical detail right so I find it
deeply unsatisfying if a talk just says
well you're not really clever enough to
understand that you know anything
important so I'm just going to give you
some generalities so what I would do
with something like this is to pick you
know one of these rules say you know
blow it up big and say I'm just going to
show you a little snapshot of a type of
a little corner of this system and how
we think about it as it illustrates an
interesting point and then you may say
you could have this as a backup slide or
you just flash it past do you say the
interesting thing about this slide is
that's the whole type system you know
it's in the paper you can read it but I
think it's quite exciting that it fits
on one slide like then you're not then
that's a whole different thing do you
see what I mean so it's a balance
definitely no overwhelm them with this
kind of stuff but don't go to the other
extreme of no no technical stuff at all
another example yes but but in this case
the example might be so here these are
typing judgments right so I might pick
one of them as an exemplary typing judge
with but then I might have some little
programs that illustrate its operation
yeah so it's all Turtles all the way
down through now yeah okay let's go go
back how fast can this thing go back not
very fast examples yes I'm gonna skip
this example because that was just
another example of an example let's see
this is this is good
what did leave out this is even more
important so what so what are we going
to put in quick reminder what are we
going to put in number one motivation
number two the key idea very good right
remember that that's all you have to put
in and here's some things not to put in
this how often do you see this at the
beginning of the talk right early on it
so it seems that good scholarship right
speaker says thank you for we are very
pleased to be here you know it's so
exciting to me how come a long way so
etc only put here's the drought line of
my talk and then they they sort of say
well you know first I'm going to tell
you about the flu goal system and then
it's shortcomings and then I'm going to
tell you about synthetic epi morphisms
and at this stage you have no clue what
flugel is or what of synthetic epi
morphism is and but because the speaker
is some you know they're actually quite
interested this stuff they can't
resist adding a sentence or two about
each of these points like all of which
is complete double dutch to the audience
of that stage right so it's like you're
taking this precious two minutes at the
beginning of your talk and you're just
talking nonsense to them right and it's
it's it's unimaginably dire and people
do it a lot
not University I would say you know
maybe only about a third of talks do
this but but don't yes polished material
was so theoretical how do you encourage
how do you encourage the presence of
pedagogical material that is focused on
exactly how do you encourage the how do
you edit Gaja , to oppose to focus on
examples in a technical field
programming language is very theory
based but on the other hand so so here
you are so think about it this way
you'll hear giving a talk because you
have witness a per maybe or being
invited to give a talk about something
that excites you like somehow um your PR
person
why so there's something about it that
you think is interesting right what is
it alright so somewhere in your heart
you're beating hard it says this is you
know someone which is so important to me
I'm devoting years of my life to
studying this stuff all you have to do
is to rip it out of your heart and show
it to audience right and it's I'm sure
it isn't that it's you know it's highly
technical Wow that's why I so that's why
that's what I'm so excited about it
there's something something else right
so there the technical stuff is a is a
kind of support to to or something you
know for me it's for I'm a I'm a PR guy
programming languages guide to I'm
interested in functional programming and
I think you know functional programming
is just a sort of radical and elegant
attack on the entire enterprise of
programming that I you know intend over
the course of my could upend the whole
business of programming well it may not
work out like that but at least it will
be fun and and then of course you know
there's plenty of teton for that if
you're building a rocket right there's
plenty of detailed technical stuff about
how you make the rocket and how you make
the spacecraft get into orbit around
Jupiter which it has right but then
finally the point is it was excited
they've got you get the idea I don't
know if there's no easy answer but but
go back to go back to basics I would say
but don't do outlines
no more outlines it's okay to an to do a
bit of orientation slide so you know I
notice I have been putting up slides
like this that say that tell the
audience that I come to the end of a
little bit right so actually you know
this could be a good place if you've
been you know wanting to ask a question
and not sure when then you know this
could be a good moment it's a sort of
signposts sometimes people are put up
content slides like this they don't make
much of it they just sort of go by
quickly and they say this is roughly
where I am right so just as a quick
brief orientation about whether where
people aren't at all but don't do it at
the beginning and don't hesitate very
long on it does that make sense have you
you been to talks that do this and have
you thought wow I'm gonna stop reading
my email and look at this content slide
you're not okay here's another thing oh
yes go okay so tell your supervisor that
Simon says that you shouldn't I may not
work but but you could try or the other
thing is you do put it not at the
beginning put it after the motivation
right so you've got them motivated and
hooked and then briefly you're gonna say
in my talk and make a content slide that
has three things on it not eight you
know and now I know now I've sort of
given you a bit of motivation
first I'm going to you know show you the
key idea then I'm gonna say a little bit
about how well it works in practice you
know and you on you've taken ten seconds
satisfied your supervisor and moved on
but there is a recording of this talk
yeah that's why you can point to the
video sending the link yeah yeah yes yes
so should you so reading your slides is
not good
absolutely I would not go through stars
to forbid any overlap right because
otherwise you think well you know now
that you've gotta kind of its kind of
split brain think I'm a tweeting this
item and listening so and you'll get a
lot of advice from the coaches about you
know how many words to put on slides and
so forth and people vary a lot in their
styles I tend to be a bit wordy
right and and with the other thing to
try to avoid if you can is to us a bit
or that is to is to treat your slide
solely as a prompt for you there can be
useful in that way but but yeah at all
costs do not just read the slides that
is important yeah but you could have
notes that's fine yes and so this will
vary a lot between people some people
will be fine with that notes others will
want to look at notes others will feel
more able to move around dis important
things to be relaxed about it
oh and but it's much better if you can
avoid reading your talk right that part
that is it's difficult to do that well I
mean so you know if you know your talk
really well you can have it completely
scripted in front of you but if you can
avoid actually having to read off it
it's very helpful I mean it's it's a
this is another personality thing it's
quite difficult to just extemporize to
begin with but you'll get you'll get
used to it but if you're perceived to be
fixed on a podium with your eyes on your
talk read reading from your talk that
isn't just not an engaging way to it
you've got to try to avoid I've again
yeah okay let's see well what was this
when I sit work yes what about related
work so sometimes this is not such an
such a frequent sin but it does happen
the people's can spend quite a lot of
time talking about related work which
seems to be good scholarship like worst
of all they can do this early in the
talk and that's terrible because it's
even more technical than that content
slide nobody understands what you're
talking about except you know the three
you know mister xxb right is very
pleased maybe but that's all so but even
putting it near the end uses that sort
of precious moments of your talk so
rather than having am a related work
slide that really is only going to be
appreciated or or learnt from you know
how might how many of your audience are
going to go away thinking I'm really
glad that I you know that there was that
slide about related work like most of
them going to are going to go away
thinking well I'm really glad that
person has done their good scholarship
and when I read the paper I'm going to
find out about the related works in a
site all the relevant
stuff and really glad that went chat
when when somebody asked a question
about related work they seem to
absolutely know their fields right and
was able to respond in an able and
articulate way I'm really glad that when
they said yes absolutely we built on the
word worm you know the work that Martin
Tedeschi did live in Scala which is
pretty amazing you know particularly you
know his treatment of you know
object-oriented programming or something
there so you know take the opportunity
to speak well of your as it were
competition or more accurately their
shoulders are the Giants on whose
shoulders you were standing but don't
actually proactively force it down your
audience yes anything the related work
to the motivation section because some
of the related work might have motivated
your current work so saying that this
and that happened and so it's a very
interesting idea but yeah so good
thought but if you were the audience
listening to that put yourself in the
receiving end
was it a direct interest to you who you
know who did it and why why what's of
direct interest to the audience is the
idea sequence so you might say well
here's you know here's a problem our
Java class files you know a standard you
know you might think you could compress
them with gzip what everybody's heard of
GT you might not then say you know and
the authors of gzip were so and so
biotin it was done in 1976 you might say
you know because the idea sequences
there's some sort of generic compression
technology and then but but but the idea
that is talk is that maybe we could use
language or where compression technology
you see what I mean and then in the
paper you cite chapter and verse for the
for the competition if somebody asked
you about them you could do but the
point the point is so you're trying to
focus around the points that the
audience is directly engaged with
interested in so and sometimes just
possibly they will be right it may be
that something is so blindingly
obviously it'll be absolutely in their
minds you know the standard tools that
they use you've got to mention okay
let's see we talked about technical
detail so we're going to omit it about
one thing I forgot to say is one thing
that makes it difficult to omit
technical detail is that it's you
invested so much in it yourself right
drenched in your blood right that that
figure right you've been through 30
versions of that figure and you can
hardly bear not to show it to audience
and yet you have to put it in the paper
so it is difficult and I think that
probably you know the reason that that
speakers sometimes overdo technical
detail is because it's you know it was
it's hard one to them and they want to
share share something about it but then
again think what is it that I'm sharing
it's not really the technical detail
itself it's the insight that kind of led
me there see if we can extract the
insight in some way okay so far so good
so that's all about content any anything
anybody got any other observations or
questions about content yeah a
conclusion you mean you know what you
what you've learned from that result
yeah I suppose what would you do if you
were with a friend in a you know in your
office with the whiteboard would you
show his up without result without
conclusion or will you show result a
little conclusion then you look for the
kind of thing you're thinking of what
would you do you probably interleave
them wouldn't you so I would it's
actually a good model what would you do
if you were just explaining it to a
friend with a bit of paper on a
whiteboard trying to avoid thinking of
your talk as a sort of formal entity and
more as a kind of informal dialogue you
know ideally you get into that's true so
so yes if you you don't show too many
things but I think the force of your
suggestion was you might have a key idea
but then you might say well this one of
the reasons it's a good idea is it
because it applies in situation X and
situation Y in situations edge Y so
here's my you know I applied in a
situation X and this is what happened
that so that's a that would all be a
sort of outworking of the key idea as it
were yeah but yeah you want to make sure
they're still they're still anchored to
the key idea
okay
well let's see well this is being
mentioned a couple of times but by far
the most important thing about
presenting a talk is to sound as if that
you are interested in it right that is
to be enthusiastic about it and it's um
it's a you know because if you don't
appear to be excited by your talk why
will your audience be alright so this is
really it's varies a lot between
individuals I'm a bit of a sort of
exhibitionist so it's not it's not hard
for me I know that some people find it
much more difficult to know to look
their audience in the eyes but
nevertheless if you if you stand behind
a podium and um and you say well I'm
gonna give this thought today it's not
very interesting you probably won't
really want to hear it mean you might
want to read your email but but I'm
gonna give it anyway so slide one then
you know and this is not what anybody
actually says but somehow there that you
know subliminally you get that message
and that's you've got to somehow just
struggle with yourself to break out of
out of that feeling everybody feels like
a worm right that nobody will be
interested in your talk you've got to
set a break out of that and just share
the sort of you know the passion in your
heart for what you're doing and and with
your audience yes everybody back no no
you're looking a bit yes you can okay
keep speaking loudly
so he stalks him the lowest of stones
and he's like so almost moved and he's
not animated at all and but he is he's
somebody that thousands flock in to
listen to so I think sometimes I kind of
like God you know so so he gets a free
pass so I would so yes there were
counterexample so I and clearly you know
the things that he says people have
learnt that the things he said says are
worth coming to regardless right but
nevertheless it's a kind of it's like
what enthusiasm makes people
dramatically more receptive so it's like
think of your audience like sunflowers
right they're all you know sunflowers
are nice kind of like this the Sun comes
out and they all come out like this and
they become sort of receptive to the Sun
so enthusiasm literally makes audiences
do that they they look at you they smile
they become more open and they've become
vastly more receptive to the ideas now
of course the idea is maybe no good
right and it's possible that you know
the ideas are so good that even the most
so the droopy audiences will
nevertheless absorb something but you
might as well give yourself the best
chance was to somebody else yes
personally I would strongly recommend
moving around conference format is the
conference format is that use these
there and you sit and you click on your
laptop make strenuous efforts to say I'm
not going to do that right so so for a
start always bring your own wireless
gizmo so that you don't you're not tied
to your laptop and certainly that you
know very very occasionally they say
we're recording this you know our camera
is fixed you must stand here that's very
well actually usually they're usually
they're not recording you and even if
they are that somebody couldn't point
the camera so makes join us effort to be
allowed to move around yeah while the
microphones the other thing you really
want a wireless mic if you possibly can
yeah yes so I would I would so it's a
judgement you know even without a
microphone I would try the room and see
you know can you hear me at the back
when I'm speaking without microphone
pizza I bet you could probably hear me
with that microphone in this room it's
fine and then for the scale of talks
you're probably going to be doing for
the immediate future that will probably
be fine but I mean it's up to you right
so it but the the key thing is I think
you could give an extremely engaging
enthusiastic motivating talk standing
completely fixed in place right it's not
this isn't the be-all and end-all it's
just that I personally find it easier to
move around yeah well yeah it's always
about it you know if I was doing
handstands you'd need to stop thinking
about the talking about something else
so it's about it I don't think I walk
around a lot
I don't maybe people are just being very
polite but nobody's told me recently
that merely walking around there was one
person I know who's Roger Needham
actually who was the lab director and he
would do this and that sort of
repeatedly joined the entire talk now
that was a little bit distracting I have
to say he was a great computer scientist
also also stand behind you when you talk
to you so yes one reason I like moving
around is that it's you know giving a
talk with stressful activity and
physically moving it helps loosen you up
actually so it makes it easier I find
okay um let's see so I said right
besides the night before here and I
don't quite mean that because I often I
did use to do that and actually not
nowadays I found I often write some
slides during a previous talk because
you know there's a there's a talk and I
think it's kind of interesting I wonder
if I could modify this talk a little bit
and nowadays you can do that the
PowerPoint it's great I come from the
days when we actually had to handwrite
slides on acetates and had over train
overhead projectors but the important
thing is that you need to be familiar
with them right so it would be it's
perfect if you never actually have to
look at your slides at all because you
just know what the next slide is right
so you
the the the antithesis of that is when
you spend the entire talk doing this you
say oh you know this very interesting
rule over here you know I know and you
and your point you have your back to the
audience the whole time now again that's
an extreme version but your goal is to
be eyeballing your audience almost all
the time just occasionally you may need
to say you know this particular point on
this particular you know look at look at
this particular equation then you can
you can turn them out to try to avoid
doing okay another thing that often
happens in talks in its almost
subliminal is people kind of apologize
for something they say you know I was
delayed on my travel here my laptop
crashed last night or it's probably not
a very interesting talk or you know
there's something there's something
negative about what they're doing
sometimes it reflects something that
really has happened you know they really
didn't get any sleep now it's dawn so
they really were sick last night so they
really are jet-lagged but don't share
that with your audience right because
they while they might be sympathetic
they don't think there's nothing they
can do to help you at that point right
look retentive so it's not it doesn't
set you up to be in a good place
so just never apologize all right no
matter how bad things don't apologize to
audit just keep going you're good right
because it otherwise it leaves them as
an audience member if somebody's
apologizing to it you just don't know
what to do with yourself right you've
got no way to respond and so that's no
good it's an individual that's quite
different right but you know in a group
setting it's not so good
now of course there are physicals things
right so when you're sitting here you
know and the previous speaker is you
know just winding up their talk and
you're sitting there and you're thinking
I'm actually not sure that I'm
physically going to be able to stand up
you know you're kind of breathing fast
and you know you can feel a kind of
tremor and and you think will my legs
actually work apps out there I've really
thought that I thought am I going to be
able to physically stand on the stage ah
well I simply collapse it's very
unsettling but I've seen very very few
people collapse on the stage it's quite
rare so actually it works out that it
you know you can stand so the it is a
worry but it usually doesn't it doesn't
turn out to be as bad so
here are the things that I do what one
is that you know do the sort of usual
deep breathing kind of things and
nothing that I find helpful is for the
very beginning of the talk that first
few sentences right which they're you
know the the host has introduced you and
like searchlights 150 I swivel and a
fixed on you like that moment you're
like the rabbit in the headlights that
is a good moment to have an exact script
for what you're going to say right it
just gets you off to a good start
usually once you're going things are
okay so when I said about reading a
script I would have it I would have that
actually memorized to write to know how
you're going to start so you have a
strong start that you feel confident
about and then then you away yeah I've
said the other things
oh very yes yes please so I think this
is very personal
I would I would not recommend starting
with a joke I think it's if you're the
kind of person who can tell jokes
naturally that's great
and you know and then go for it but I
yes I would be cautious about as it were
you know reading up on jokes and
thinking I'm going to start with a joke
you know it sort of kind of like if it
comes naturally to you fine if it
doesn't it's a it's a it's a technical
presentation but it's not enough to
dinner talk if you like that's it that's
another medium yes
the audience laughs and we forgot about
everything
Costas apologies so I should say I mean
humour is good like that if you if you
can get your audience to laugh that is
fantastic it's just that it's uh it's
hard to do by trying if you see what I
mean so they it kind of so I think it I
don't think it for me it doesn't come
under the heading of a simple actionable
idea it's more something you might go
into but yes sometimes people very
naturally and you know in a kind of
relaxed way can turn a tricky situation
into something people laugh at and
that's so brilliant when they do that
but I I don't know how to turn that into
an actionable point yeah altogether
right so at that point your slides
really are quite helpful right you
really can look at your slides and say
so to get yourself back on track what am
I trying to say so just try not to save
the audience I'd completely forgotten
what I was going to say just but but but
you can you can have silences right
it's okay simply to stop and just have a
moment you know a moment's pause while
you regroup they're not going to you
know that if you stop for you know a
whole minute they're going to get a bit
restive but simply pausing it's okay and
then you can just sort of so yeah don't
apologize just pause whichever you are
we grew okay we talked about facing
audience and not pointing I have seen
people pointing at their laptop they let
it sit on that very much usually point
but even pointing that screen is pretty
dodgy right because it means that you're
forced to put your back to the audience
and that means you're you know you're
not watching them for questions you're
not you're not you're not really engage
with them so while you know a laser
pointer can be a useful thing I don't
use it too much and it's a slightly
dangerous thing too because if you if
you are a little anxious then it turns
into sort of lissajous figures you know
it amplifies your the the shaking of
your hand and so you get little figures
of eight on the screen so it's kind of
kinda bit not good
that way let's see now it's quite good
to one you know what to make eye contact
with your audience and and it's quite
helpful to identify somebody in your
audience or maybe one or two people who
know some people instinctively not as
the you know as at all it goes long
some people just sort of sit there and
passively and doesn't mean they're not
paying attention or not interested it's
just their their natural body languages
but others you know do more sort of
instinctive nodding and you know some of
you have been doing that like so so
you've been asking what's your name I
mean yeah that's right Muslims know it's
you that's right yes so you've been up
some questions as well like but but
you're not a bit and so and not us are
quite useful if you can find somebody
who's doing that they're people while
they're following they all sort of nod
but when they get lost they stop nodding
all right so it's great so so you can
you can start to kind of say oh so you
know is anybody lost here you know
because sometimes when materials getting
a little technical it's good good idea
to do a check and say it would really
help me if somebody asks a question
really say Rob how's it going you know
did you understand that so if you
identify someone in the audience you
actually know so and of course by
watching the audience you can also keep
an eye out for questions and for me the
in conference formal conference formats
it's always give the talk questions at
the end everything else I'd strongly
encourage you to to look for questions
during the talk in fact I've got this is
what this slide is about so if you can
if your audience is willing to engage
you in some dialogue during the talk
that is a huge victory right if they sit
there respectfully until the end and
then ask you you know one or two
questions it might be okay but it's not
nearly so great as when they've made
comments and questions during the talk
you know as you have been doing yes go
of course you're dealing with
antagonistic questions motions that are
designed to show off so this does happen
so sometimes yes you get the sort of
troll kind of questions who are really
kind of derailing your talk so it's it's
comparatively rare in my
experience right but it's why you might
feel anxious about questions and so I
think you know stage one is to just you
know respond in a constructive way when
they pick it start to become persistent
you then say no so there's plenty I
could say in response to that question
but if I'd have I respond at length we
won't get to the rest of the talk and
there's you know there's some key ideas
I really want to get to can we talk at
the end and then if you're really
struggling that's when you start
eyeballing your um your session chair
and you know sort of making signs of
distress because they should rescue you
right if somebody's being really
aggressive but in my my expertise
vanishingly we're maybe different
they've different things happening
different cultures - you have to just
say you know so it's about you've got
them in a dialogue you say you clearly
know what you're talking about
and there's you know there's tons in the
paper but you know what button but I'm
keen to get to the you know the the key
idea that's you know in a couple of
slides of time so you can you can just
say you you you understand control the
other word you want to be responsive but
nevertheless somehow in control so I
think it's okay sometimes particularly
in a less formal talk you know in a
let's say you're having a seminar in
your department - you're visiting
somebody else it's about not giving it
giving a talk well then you know even
truncating your talk not doing some of
the material but engaging in a dialogue
is way better than saying shutting
everything down and saying I'm just
going to stick to my script it really
annoys me when people are totally
dismissive of questions they sort of
blow you off very quickly because you
feel they've got their thing they want
to say and then really not very
interested in you the audience right
they just want to say their thing that's
annoying so if as in all things it's a
balance but for me I would err on the
side of following the questioner rather
than blowing off until they you know
till it goes too far that's about it yes
right at the back
Oh what do you do if 80% of your
audience is lost well so again it
depends a little bit on the on the
circumstances if it was a departmental
seminar I'd more or less if I really
thought my oldest was getting lost I'd
sort of stop and you know see if I could
do sort of whiteboard II kind of things
or find out where they were lost because
the truth is very little you know the
world is not made a better place by you
finishing your talk and having 20 people
who just happen understood anything of
it it's better just not to finish your
talk so I mean they'll come a point when
you're listening to talks there'll be a
point when you may think well this isn't
in my area I was engaged in the
beginning and now it's got too technical
and I'm going to disconnect that happens
to me a lot particularly when I'm going
to interview talks in other areas that's
going so for the speaker at that point I
wouldn't want them to think oh I've got
a stop and deal with Simon right so
because you know that there is a there's
a kind of the talk is framed with a
particular technical point right and if
you can't get to it at all you'd be
stuck so but if everybody's lost I'd
stop and it's easier to know that in
small groups something I suppose well
don't give you much of a chance to
repeat because they're quite short
typically bit so I would typically do a
repetition like that by way of examples
you know here's another example that
illustrates the same idea and it's
another example that illustrates the
same idea so you're not repeating
yourself you're just exercising the idea
that would be sort of trying to say okay
so you know here we are it's a you know
it's a half-hour talk and we've had
quite a lot of questions and we're you
know 22 minutes have gone but there's
there are two things I really want to
show you you know can we just pause and
do that and then you but then you then
you probably a you know you must kiss me
I might need to skip a little bit to get
to them right so you've told your
audience that you
adapting to then write that there are
some things you want to to get to
because you think it'll be of interest
to them but you are you're not just
racing through your burger twice the
speed yeah if you could even plan for
that a bit yes a building escape routes
you say okay I could stop here is
actually very helpful if you can do that
yeah starting I don't know
so should you the question is should you
avoid saying that's a great question no
I think it can be quite a nice things if
you if you say every time you know then
it gets a bit but you know often
audience members he will feel quite
tense ative about asking questions they
feel worm-like to you are the you know
the person who knows what they're
talking about so then it may be quite
tentative so if you convey you know that
was a really stupid question on you know
what how could you possibly have thought
of asking me that will be bad right so
you want to convey that and maybe once
or twice you will actually said did it
annoy you when people do that I just
sometimes feels as if it's is it so I
guess some people might to kind of sort
of formulaic yes yeah yes so yeah
avoiding formulaic counters some people
just yes that is only better things ago
I've been doing a bit of that right so
it's quite often audience members other
audiences for far away have not even
heard the question so repeating the
question be quite a constructive thing
to do it also lets you rephrase it in a
way that you know is who I think you're
asking this like and that gives the
question which I'll say no I wasn't what
I was asking at all but sometimes people
ask the most obscure things yes
what do you do they don't know so if you
don't have the answer they then it's
better not to flannel I mean it just it
is difficult you have no clue then you
just have to say they say but you know
are classic is and but didn't you know
Strunk and and boodle do this you know
what what about their Wiswall system
I never heard of them let alone the
wisdom or system you just have to say
that's really interesting I don't know
about that can you tell me you know give
me a pointer to it afterwards there's no
two ways about it if you just watch all
and so the people will detect it it's
better just to bite the bullet I think
yeah do I practice a lot
Oh before yeah so I think it's a yes
it's a it's a very good idea to do a
complete dry run if your talk so you
won't get any questions you know in your
bathroom just to check for length length
is quite difficult to judge in advance
people go through slides at very very
different rates
I have typically have quite a lot of
slides but still go through them you're
about to see an example of truncation
it's 1029 but yes rehearsal good good
idea preferably with a friend and how it
helps to do a good effect okay so there
are there any key points that we at
missed I'm going to just I just wanted
in the last 30 seconds tell you two
things one being a good audience member
so you're being good audience members so
this is the other side of the coin right
be the person who asked the questions go
and tell you how often that you you have
a whole audiences that are completely
lost and they're just desperately
wishing that somebody would say I
haven't got a clue what you're talking
about can you please send I say that
again in a clearer way but none of them
are brave enough to do it so you can be
that person so and do that early don't
wait till very late right and then you
betrayed the fact that last 20 minutes
have been completely wasted if I because
you so as soon as you get lost start
asking questions and then some point
it'll become clear that you know you're
not you know that there may come a point
where you have to stop just because you
aware that you're going to become that
questioner who's debating the talk let's
see
just let me mention do not do do this
right that's really annoying and this is
also really annoying this is also really
annoying yes right so so they're really
revealing points one by one I hate that
it would annoys me right because it
makes me think makes the me think the
speaker didn't really trust me okay and
you must stop there's what I'm about to
do because when it comes to be 10:30
you're still sitting there quite
politely but when audiences expect the
talk to stop they
how stop listening so if you go on right
then they will nothing goes in so to
complete waste of time and your host
gets arrested and then I've seen people
you know they're five minutes over there
on slide you can see in the corner there
slide you know 22 out of 60 and they
look at their host then they say I just
got a few more slides would that be okay
and the host that you know the audience
are going looking at the hosting game
and it says well yes that would be
lovely
so please finish and we shall so we
could take a couple more questions and
I'm sure we're Simon will around
actually all week and I'll be back on
Friday so any questions you want to wrap
up or all comments and observations -
from your experience then you might
sound robotic I think a couple of
lunches will not make you sound robotic
right 51 threes might make you sad
robotic so I do it a bit but but not
script every line what I want when I
pause oh yes yes I think I would so I'm
done this very much today but I think if
you if you think at that point in my
talk I'll just pause for a moment yeah
I'll look at the audience you could even
say okay just make you know if it's
anybody got any questions at this point
and there's bond you're regrouping yes
absolutely so planning some pauses I
think would be good oh I contact I can't
super important yes
look people in the eyes and with with a
few or many Oh
like I said picking a few that you look
at occasional but if you just look at
one person all the time they get a bit
they sort of suddenly what what is it so
you just so you want to pick you know
if you're gonna eyeball some particular
people but but the big thing is look at
