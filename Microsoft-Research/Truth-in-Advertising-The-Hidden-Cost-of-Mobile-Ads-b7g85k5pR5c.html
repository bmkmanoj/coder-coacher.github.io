you
um hello my name is Tom Zimmerman from
various groups and it's my pleasure to
introduce may knock upon from rochester
institute of technology so may actually
got his PhD from North Carolina State
University he spend 2 years 33 years in
Queens University in Canada and he
actually collaborated with us in vse
group in Microsoft Research many times
or many different projects and today
he's going to talk to us about his work
on EPS remaining thanks Tom thanks for
the introduction thanks for coming out
as Tom said I'm a Naga van and today
i'll be presenting some work that we
recently did on truth in advertising
that's kind of the shot you know sexy
version of the title but it's actually
we're trying to see the the hidden costs
of advertisements in mobile apps and
this was work that I did with William
how fond and jumping grief from
University of Southern California and my
student in Queens Stuart McElroy so the
motivation for our study is that as you
know everyone now has smart phones you
know I know that everyone has
smartphones because my dad now has a
smartphone that's the rule of thumb that
I have he's he was one of those people
who used to say children of this
generation as just so bad they're always
on their phone and now he's the guy
who's on always this phone so I know
that it's it's getting very prevalent
there's hundreds of millions of users
probably billions now is almost about
200 300 thousand developers developing
apps for various stores the google play
store alone has about a million plus
apps so does the app store i OS app
store and microsoft store has tens of
thousands of apps and also the
blackberry store but most of these apps
are the way that they kind of monetize
is kind of strange where most of the
apps are actually free to download and i
say free to download because only to
download away free
a lot of apps are now following a
freemium model where they free to
download and then you get a pay for
using different features or different
services in these apps but till such
time that the developer actually gets
money from the users for these features
they have to monetize the app somewhere
at some other way the way they do it is
through advertisements so it's kind of a
win-win situation where the users don't
actually pay for the app when they
download it they use it and when they're
using it the developers display these
ads which they get from advertising
networks like Google or a flurry or
Facebook or any of these advertising
networks and these networks get the
advertisements from companies like GM or
Heidi's Burger King or whatever
whichever company that wants to
advertise they give the advertisements
and money to google ad network and
Google then gives these advertisements
to the developers the developers then
display these advertisements in their
apps and when users see these ads and
usually it's a specific number something
like every thousand times that a
particular ad is shown the developer
gets X amount of money it's not a lot
it's a little usually it's about a few
pennies for every thousand times an ad
is shown but every time an ad is clicked
they get paid it's about five cents or
so but every time an ad is clicked so if
you do click and add in your app you're
actually helping the developer so once
in a while you should actually click the
edges so that you support them but the
developers themselves don't pay anything
out of pocket for these advertisements
the users don't pay anything for the
apps out of pocket as well so it seems
like a win-win situation where you get
the free app and you get the developers
get some money for the free apps but we
wanted to see if free is actually free
here like is there just like free to
download these are there actually hidden
costs with respect to these
advertisements and that was the
motivation for
work is to identify different types of
hidden cars and quantify these different
types of hair in curls we wanted to
quantify to see if these casts were
actually significant or not what what
impact they have on the end users so
continuing with our motivation one way
we found that we should look at these
advertisements is when we looked at some
of the apps and this is an example app
which is it's actually on the google
play store called a restaurant finder
and when we looked at the reviews one
particular review kind of zoom in and it
says the ads are so annoying even before
they start making a recommendation for a
restaurant taste show ads i'm
uninstalling this app and i'm sure
you've seen these reviews in a lot of
apps that you have used i'm sure you
wanted to give some of these reviews for
apps that you've used well the ads are
just annoying and you didn't like it and
you are uninstalling it so this is now a
developer not just getting a bad review
but also losing a customer because the
customers gone they're not going to come
back to this app again so there are some
kind of costs associated with it so we
wanted to see what are all the different
types of hidden costs that we can
unearth and then we try to quantify it
so some hidden costs that we identified
were yes customer in the mobile space I
mean either the app is free and customer
it doesn't pay anything to you anyway
for the app is cost a dollar but they
can't get the refund they can't get that
if I but in the free app when what i
mean by losing a customer is when the
customer does not have the app installed
anymore they're not going to be using
the app therefore there is not going to
get advertisements and therefore you're
going to lose ad revenue from that
customer trash also the even if they buy
it's not a one-time thing right after
that they sell features through the apps
in the freemium model you keep buying
things if they already uninstalled the
app you're not going to get any more
revenue from them so some of the hidden
costs that we have that we identified
are one is the obvious one which is kind
of like a performance cost
advertising is still some kind of code
that is being executed right it still is
going and fetching something there's
some kind of code that is being executed
along with the code for the regular
application so there is some kind of cpu
utilization and there's some kind of
memory that is being utilized but what
does this mean that when this happens
does the responsiveness of the app the
runtime responsiveness the app actually
change so we want to measure this cust
the second hidden costs that we
identified was energy costs so when you
use an application with advertisements
does it mean that the app actually
consumes more energy and if it does
consume more energy then that means that
there's more recharging cycles that are
now required users may generally know
that advertisements or their battery is
getting drained faster but they may not
know that it is because of a particular
app or because of something inside the
app they may not know where the battery
drain is coming from they may not just
know that the battery is getting drained
faster now the third cost that we kind
of looked at was the network costs so
advertising the advertisements
themselves are stored in a central
server in let's say the google ad
network and the developers connect to
this network through the apps and
download these advertisements from the
network and display the ads on the app
so there's definitely a network related
costs to this and if supposing I mean
most of them now don't have they have
unlimited or at least a significant
amount of data plan when you travel or
you know in other countries where you
don't have unlimited data plans for
example even Canada does not have
unlimited data plans surprisingly so
there might be costs associated with it
and these are significant costs so there
might be actually a dollar cost
associated with the network usage of
advertisements as well we also looked at
some other costs with respect to not
just users but develop
there's a maintenance effort to keep the
appt up to date and it's always you know
it's one of those things that you have
to do and it's it's a it's difficult and
you want to keep fixing the bugs but
because advertisement is also code in
the application now developers have some
extra stuff to maintain they have extra
libraries to maintain they have extra
calls to maintain they have and these
libraries change all the time so you
have to change these api calls so
there's extra work that they have to do
for code that is not in the core logic
of their application it's just to
monetize their application so we can
have wanted to look at how many updates
were being done to just add related
calls in the application the final
hidden costs that we kind of identified
was the impact on ratings we kind of saw
one example review where a reviewer
complete user complained and they wanted
to uninstall the app but this past
research which shows that the success of
an app is closely tied to the ratings
and reviews that the app got so it's not
necessarily that a high rated app will
always be successful but it's very very
unlikely that a low-rated app will be
ever successful and that's we did some
research before and we found out that
there's some apps where it's high rated
because you get your friends to go and
work for your application and this
almost like ninety percent of the apps
on Google Play has less than 10 reviews
and two versions in a year 28 filling in
reviews I think this is facebook
facebook whatsapp Angry Birds there's a
few applications like this which at you
know on a unrelated note we did some
studies on these on these rating systems
and we found that they're not the most
ideal ones because it's accumulative
rating system this application the 28
million reviews from four stars to go to
a three-star rating needs another 28
million people to give it a two star
rating
so they can actually release an app
which does absolutely nothing leave it
in the store for a day and still see no
difference in their ratings but yeah so
like I know that the at least on iOS
when you the initial settings you see is
just for the most recent release and yet
like specially asked to see the
aggregate overall yes so I don't know
why it is but iOS is the only platform
where they give the ratings of the
latest release and the overall
cumulative on maybe it's a patented
thing and nobody else can do that I
don't know but none of the other stores
actually displayed it makes me think
that it's not great indeed because nokia
had a store back when they were still
nokia and they used to display the
version rating as well and we have a
different paper where we say that unless
you display the version rating these
ratings are so sticky it's successful
apps with Lord of ratings can never lose
their rating and on the flip side an app
which has got a significant number of
low ratings can never become a high rate
adapt and so it's in the it's not in the
interest of a developer to improve their
app at all there's no need to release a
new version should always release just a
new app but coming back to this study so
we want to see what the effect of these
hidden costs on ratings would be and how
the developers could actually face some
kind of difficulties because of this
some other examples are you know too
much advertisements or you know there's
full screen ads everywhere and therefore
i'm going to uninstall the
advertisements are right in the middle
of the screen is covering my picture i
can't see it therefore i'm on uninstall
so there's a lot of these negative
reviews and how these negative reviews
can affect the application itself so
having identified all of these kinds of
hidden costs we came up with you know
five research questions to actually
quantify each of these hidden costs
three of which are for the end users and
two of which are
for the developers so in order to do
this we carried out a case study like
all good software engineering studies
should be and I'll kind of give an
overview of what we did in our case
study we first selected apps that we
wanted to study and for this we went to
this website called distimo which ranks
applications in the google play store so
they ranked the top 400 applications in
each category ah they ranked based on
the user rating the user reviews they
kind of do some mining on the reviews
and the number of downloads and based on
this they come up with a ranking scheme
and they say these are the top four
hundred apps per category it's about 30
categories and so about 12,000 apps are
there on the distinguished but some
categories don't have 400 top-ranked
apps they have little less so on the
whole is about ten thousand seven
hundred fifty apps and remind these apps
every version every review every release
notes and all of this on a daily basis
so every day we go to the store and get
data on these 10,000 apps and we've been
getting that since January until now
actually but this study is still August
2014 the data used for this study is
love is very funny so once we have we
have these apps we can't some of the
studies the calculations that we do for
these cars are very intensive so we
can't possibly do this on all 10,000 of
these applications so we picked the top
21 applications based on the ratings and
the number of versions in which they've
released in the Google Play Store and I
given here so this is it's kind of small
but these are the list of 21 apps that
we looked at they sorted by their rating
as you can see they're all successful
apps and they all have many versions
that have been released in that
eight-month period so there's some apps
which are released up to 40 versions in
eight months and if you can see the
categories are all very varied is 14
different categories here so it's not
just one type of app
we're looking at me looking at apps that
are from various categories so we took
these apps and then we remove the ads
from these apps these were all free to
download apps with advertisements in
there so what do I mean by ad removal we
actually did a little bit of bytecode
rewriting so we take these apps which if
you've used Google a prefers they have
the the package this dot APK files then
we have some standard off-the-shelf
tools with which we can get the bytecode
from it and we know that we are going to
look at advertisements from the google
mobile ads network so we actually looked
at the documentation in the API is for
google mobile ads and we found out what
are all the various api calls for that
and we identified the api calls in these
apps and we went and removed those calls
we could have just removed the ad
library itself but if you remove the ad
library there's still empty calls going
on and that still consumes power
consumes network consumes performance
and all of that so we wanted to remove
the call once and for all so we remove
these cows and then recompile them and
repackage them and after that we made
two kinds of checks we ran the
application on the devices and we
manually checked that there were no ads
but still the application is executing
as expected and yes or no security
certificates signing these apps so that
anybody can free write them we can
rewrite them we can upload them or you
just put them back on your own phone
yeah we can put them back on our own
phone we can't put them back on the
store so yes so there is a signature
security signature so we can't upload it
in their account but your own account
right we can store it for my own account
I can create a separate signature for me
and I can upload the same app again
there are actually cases in a different
study that we did about two years before
we found that there are cases where
people download applications decompile
them change the account for the
advertisement network so from if you
created the app I'll change your key to
my key
and then reupload them and so now
whatever revenues that come from the
other version of the app come to me and
not to you chose to restrict your
attention to the top 400 using the
customer list but if you consider just a
apps in general not considering only the
top ones you might have found an even
stronger safe with respect to your five
research question absolutely absolutely
we would have found much higher cost we
wanted to say that even successful apps
have this kind of gas so the non
successful ones definitely could have
even more so we wanted to find the one
to the the best case scenario had so
much cast so the worst case can be even
more so we did somebody rewriting and
then the other check that we did is we
connected it to the the apps can i
connect to the wireless router in our
lab and we looked at the TCP dump logs
to see that we were no longer connecting
to the google mobile apps network just
to make sure that there were no
advertisements at all and now that when
we were assured that we had removed the
ads we kind of wanted to generate a
workload to measure these costs and for
a the workload generation you can see
kind of an animation here that both apps
the one without the ad without the ad
and with the ad the workload is the same
but in one case you see an advertisement
in the bottom and in the other case you
don't see the advertisement and we used
a tool called reran for this and it kind
of records our actions and then we can
replay this over and over again the
criteria for our workload was that it
had to be complete in the sense that we
had to finish a particular user action
completely it had to be repeatable so
when we record and replay we had to get
the same actions again and again and it
shouldn't be any non determinism there
and the sequence should be long enough
we used about three minute 24 minute
workloads so that it was a considerable
user action
so once we got the workload we ran the
apps with the ads and without the ads
for all the 21 apps and measured the
five different hidden costs and the
results for some of them are cared for
the performance we used a the top
command in the phone so we just ran top
on the phone every one second and we
measured the CPU in terms of the
utilization percentage and the memory
use in terms of kilobytes and we
actually measured the resident set size
of the memory and we found that indeed
there is an increase of CPU utilization
and memory the CV utilization on average
is about somewhere around fifty percent
more CPU was utilized because of
advertisements then without
advertisements right and the memory you
is about twenty-two percent more
consumption because of advertisements
but what does this mean to the end-user
that there's more CPU utilization memory
utilization why should they care right
are they absolutely relative okay
selected fifty percent more than it it
had used before but not fifty percent of
all cpu no no yeah fifty percent more
than what they had used before so what
we did is we wanted to find the response
time because that is something that the
users would care about if they actually
are trying to interact with a nap and
their response time increases in that
matters so we found that apps with
advertisements actually took about seven
percent longer to handle the same set of
events and apps without advertisements
that's a considerable percentage when it
comes to actually interacting with the
application the second cast that we
measured was the energy cost and for
this we connected the device that we
tested on to a the monsoon power monitor
and we sampled it at a frequency of 5
kilohertz and we measure the power used
by the app when it was run with dads and
without ads and again like before no
surprises we found that there was a
considerably higher entry considerable
increase in energy consumed the mean in
the median were around fifteen sixteen
percent more energy consumed when the
app had advertisements in it the top
application so m17 the app had about a
third more power consumed because of the
advertisements so again what does this
mean to the end-user right so oh and
well 62 the apps had a over twenty
percent increase in their energy
consumed so what does it mean to the
end-user typically you want a phone the
last at least the phone's battery to
last at least eight hours so that when
you leave home for work and you have
enough battery till you come back home
or you are out in a different country
and you're doing sightseeing and you
want it to last at least eight hours
more if you can but at least eight hours
right yeah so the question about the ads
are the ones you showed in this in that
simulation work banner ads yeah are
there are some ads that are require more
resources than others like animated adds
more than just a banner ad did like it's
this google code that's using all this
energy or is this the actual app that
happens to be coming in it is so we
looked only at banner ads we didn't look
at other ads but we assume that it's
going to be more for the other types of
ads because we think it's a lot of the
energy consumption area because of the
ad itself being displayed in the network
being used to download the attachments
and i actually had a relation so so many
answered in sweep up as a manner i'm
wondering how numbers would be different
if there's a trend going towards
interstitial ads which are natural
transition
the game yeah just to not interfere with
game activity but also there's a trends
in inter socialized to me to video ads
which I think hardware acceleration will
offload some of the i guess that is you
cost but it's definitely more resource
intensive them yeah static image yeah
it's going to be more you salute them
and in terms of the network bandwidth
and probably the energy as well as
probably is going to be much more than
banner ads all but if you're playing
video ready percentage-wise you increase
the show you know if you JPEGs here and
there it depends on where the
interstitial ads I've if it's in a video
game which is already using a lot of its
its it's going to be one but some of the
apps that we use that we study that
actually like apps that are like text
editor apps and they have these big
banner ads and they can get these other
advertisement that's all they're not
very resource-intensive to begin with
and they they go higher and it's special
in terms of network use i'll show you
the slide in a short while but i think
five or six of the apps did not need to
connect to the network at all and the
only reason they needed to connect was
for the advertisements right and so all
the network used from that app is from
the advertisements so you would think
that hey this is a text editor i don't
need the internet for this and you could
be using this in you know when I was in
Canada and I used to travel the data
pack was i used to pay thirty dollars
for fifty megabytes and if i was using a
text editor app there i would be
consuming a lot of these in terms of
advertisements without me realizing that
I'm using it so if you go to airplane
mode houses to those ends up so if you
can fool them and you can still use the
app without the advertisement if its
banner ads I don't know about
interstitial ads whether at that point
it comes and it just stops till you get
the advertisement and will not let you
go further when it ends on it all
patients and developers if they're
larger charity my throne
scheme which case a they may have the
option to cash certain things that show
even in airplane mode but a lot of
developers would just say can't sort me
out because I make some people might
just say hey no I'd still continue using
but it's okay it'll just be code that is
executed nothing is actually happening
because of it and it will just go on yep
only seven percent difference in the
response time eclipse match ended it
doesn't include the network latency as
well or just the cpu processes you know
let's gets the overall response right
and end-to-end respond all right right
it wasn't just because of the CP okay so
did we actually steady about like of
Nicolaitans here as a giant lcb crossing
us oh no we did not split the two of in
terms of latency so that's something
that we can definitely try to look at in
the future is how much latency is
because of network and how much is
because of CPU okay okay I'm so coming
back to the energy eight hours is the
battery is supposed to last if the
median case that we take the mean case
that we take then it means that the
battery is going to last only 6 17 hours
and we take the worst case only five
point four hours which means that it's
not the cost of the energy itself
because it's it's nothing to charge the
phone in terms of actual dollars but
it's inconvenience you might be stuck
somewhere without power now and without
juice in your battery and you may not be
able to use your GPS or something else
right at the classic example that
another researcher gave a talk was that
you're going for an interview and you've
set your alarm because it's all of these
things your battery dies you don't wake
up you don't go to the job interview and
you lose you know you've become a bum
after did you check that all the apps
you looked at use the same version of
the Google Apps library uh yes they
world not the same version but close
enough you performance improvements that
that are the reason there's a different
uh they could be because of the google
ads library that they were using but
they were plus or minus one of those
versions so they were close enough but
but I mean continued point is if you'll
show something about this it sounds like
a cola right let me shake the video is
too cold too quiet and that's going to
cost it harm in your life yep locally
free cash call see all these ads and
then serve them at some later point that
it doesn't cost or it doesn't cost you
much no but again it's better it's your
victim of the steel in some sense as
opposed to yeah so the developer how
they build it as well Madam's right so
in general me developers can do that
developers and not to do that they don't
do that is because uh over time to get
smart about whatever all they asked so
they actually depend on the ability to
anything must have it you certainly
wouldn't say me and you also have to
keep in mind that the developers most of
the times don't get an advertisement
when they request for one what are you
so the demand for advertisements is
about five times to supply for
advertisements so if you're angry birds
every time you ask for an advertisement
you're going to get an advertisement but
if you're the app hello world app that I
wrote and uploaded every thousand times
I request I probably might get one and
Google will send ads depending on how
many people have installed how many uses
are there so it doesn't make much sense
because I mean what just because a
macgruber is popular does that mean that
someone who uses angry birds for likely
to click an ad I mean so great boys you
know no he's not just a factor right
it's a lot of factors but they do
differentiate the amount of data that
will ads that are sent to different apps
the fill rate is much lower in some of
the apps than other apps it's not
necessarily downloads right it could be
that there are some kinds of
applications where the users are more
likely to click on an ad and those
applications might get a lot more than
other
when it comes to views again Angry Birds
made you know there's a hundred million
people who downloaded it and at any
given time maybe a million people are
looking at it and therefore as an
advertiser I can reach more people right
so it's possible and again the age group
might matter and there's a lot of
context that goes into these
advertisements and who should get rich
advertisement so again its energy is not
in terms of dollars with more in terms
of inconvenience when it comes to
network us the way we measured this is
we actually connected device to the
wireless router then we use the TCP dump
command and we measured the total bytes
in the number of packets that were
downloaded and exchange between the app
and the network granted we could have
done this with respect to the 4g network
or 3g network as well but it's not easy
to measure the total bytes in the number
of packets with that and there were some
concerns that if we did use the 3g
network which might be slower than which
is slower than the router it might take
longer for an ad to come and therefore
there might be a higher energy costs and
higher performance cast because of this
as a ripple effect but because it was a
wireless router the advertisement so
stretched pretty quickly and therefore
the ripple effect cost might be much
lower discussed themselves the bytes and
the number of packets are not going to
change whether we use Wi-Fi network or
the telephone network so we measured
these cars in and we got the most for
this I mean the median was about ninety
seven percent because most of these apps
did not actually need to connect to the
network if they needed they needed to
connect spira sparingly we were actually
123456 apps that did not need to connect
to the network at all so the only reason
they connected to the network was for
the advertisements so one hundred
percent
of the network cars were from the
advertisements and relatively when we
just do a percentage it would be
infinite percentage with this you know
we can said this is 100 max out at
hundred percent so again this if you
actually in about 16 of the 21 apps head
over eighty percent of the network la
ciudad vert Iceman's so we did a little
bit of math to see what dollar cost it
would be so AT&amp;amp;T charges about 1.7 cents
for every quarter megabyte of data and
so if you use it for about three minutes
you're using about quarter megabyte and
if you use it about two hours a day then
that's about twenty dollars a month
granted that this is probably going to
be part of your quota and so you might
not go over and actually spend this
twenty dollars but if you're traveling
and you're having a data fact then you
could be going over your quota because
of these advertisements are the fourth
costs that we looked at was maintenance
effort so we looked at two adjacent
releases of the application and because
we were able to do the bytecode analysis
we knew what advertisement API calls
were there so we were seeing how these
calls were changing between the two
releases and we found out how many
releases had these changes and we found
out that there's a lot more change going
on related to advertisements about
twenty two percent of the releases or
twenty three percent of the releases had
a deleted change in there we saw that
during this time the google mobile ad
network liability itself changed five
times there were five releases for it so
they had to update it five times at the
very least if they wanted to keep up and
get the money and this is again
something if we found from previous
research that in that case study where
we looked at about 10,000 apps a third
of the apps actually had dead add calls
so they were calling ad networks that
were no longer
companies so because they were not
maintaining the app they were not
maintaining we add related calls they
were making calls to networks that no
longer existed because ad networks is a
very volatile market everybody is buying
over everyone else yeah yeah mediation
adapters through that mob or were you
okay this is only the google mobile ends
okay so gay mediation efforts yeah um so
relate a question how much of the so you
mentioned ever changes I know that
Google releases updates to bowl ads from
our frequently they tend to be iterative
yeah so you don't have to necessarily
make changes unless you want the new
features and they tend to be separate
from the app with every play services
model so I'm just curious for the cases
where you detected I guess actual
maintenance effort how much was that
there's two kinds of my offensive one is
that they had to change the library
itself even if they didn't want to even
if they didn't make all the changes they
didn't make changes to the calls it
might have changed the library alone
which they do sometimes right because
Google just says hey there's a new
library put this in there like okay I'm
going to make any changes because it's
not breaking anything but I'm gonna put
the new library in in the lease and we
find that as well we've actually found
in a previous study there's a calculator
app which released seven versions in a
particular year and the only change is
made to the apt word to the advertising
network so every time as a user you
downloaded a new version all that you
are getting with different kind of
advertisements they did not change to
the application itself this is what the
guess the google play services of ads
and not doors no okay it's interesting
because any google story that i can make
you can take advantage of future visits
and view updates because the because
we're delivering updates that's part of
a good police service updated not
require you to recap opko to take that
chain show this because this year that's
all the global blessed illnesses
oh this is when they actually had to put
in the advertising networks into the
party there's no this is google mobile
ads but they had to physically include
the library in their apps and compile it
well I still do yeah there's they
offload and a lot of the guess the core
functionality to separate actually
running framework on the device yeah but
they updated kind of way of the actual
app so you don't have a Polish people
yeah yeah but okay yeah that's that's
true but this is just the part that's
included in the app which is getting
updated right yep one of the advantages
of keeping your mobile ad network
library update is that you show up on
the updates and you remind your customer
that your app exists it's possible I
integer the size of the app every update
relative to like the physical size of
the app that needs to be downloaded over
the network update it versus the amount
of ads it downloaded so like if it
updates itself every month yeah then
it's going to be probably a lot more
bandwidth than if it just downloads
asked yes or potentially accesses ads
that no longer exist yep so we didn't
look at that we actually didn't think
that's actually an interesting way I
don't know if developers actually do the
updates just so that users know that
that's an interesting news even so does
that yeah we update our app every four
weeks always we're doing our to it yet
so but then this or ice giving you
updates they never tell you what it is
but you have to download yeah but some
apps actually do make changes like this
there's this app called k-9 mail and
they release every two weeks and it's
because they just have a quicker release
cycle every time they big fix bugs and
the fixing and every two weeks is a
release but there are some applications
where the releases are only knew
sometimes it's not just updates of old
advertising networks but they connect to
a lot of new advertising networks as
well because of the sill rate issue
where they don't get enough
advertisements they add
more networks to that list of
applications one other question I have
is did you check about add that leaning
over Wi-Fi and over cellular because do
it might be possible for that library to
adjust itself to realizes it's over
cells it might down the lower bandwidth
pictures it is yeah we didn't actually
do that we did only the wife wireless
network so it is possible that the thing
is we did only google mobile ads network
okay and it is possible that google
mobile ads might download bigger
advertisements and more frequently when
it's on the Wi-Fi network then it is it
would be a logical thing to do we don't
know I don't know at least if it does
that or not yeah so 2 1 more comment
about incorporating network so so
Google's model is you can plug in these
third-party networks to help you out for
a problem yeah um so you can include
them on your client publisher out they
also provide on the dashboard site that
about Bruce a way to configure usage of
the adapters so even if you included
like one that maybe is dead today you
could theoretically at Google could
automate this implement features she's
not to try and request the eyes from
that it is so we're not saying that they
may be requesting as an art but it is
still dead cold even exist in your
application right and this is literally
code that is never going to be executed
and it's sitting in your application and
we found a third of the apps that we
studied had this because yeah I mean
they just realized this yeah there's no
downside so I'm just gonna let it stay
there i'm not going to remove it white
what should i do i mean i don't know
what the effects are keeping a hug
called shouldn't very logically yeah
this face but there's a lot of space on
the devices and it's not too much space
so we did find that there was
considerable amount of maintenance
effort even beyond so 10 of the apps
actually had more relative changes than
the five releases themselves so they
were actually changing the calls even
beyond the just the library updates as
well
and the final cost that we looked at was
the impact on the ratings and for this
what we did is we looked at about 20,000
reviews that we collected from these 21
apps and we looked for keywords related
to energy to network to performance and
to add related keywords and we found out
that there were about 2,900 or about
more than ten percent of these reviews
that had keywords for one of these four
events had only one or two star reviews
so we assume that they were complaints
people did not like and they were
complaining about a particular thing
where there was energy or network of
farm ins or advertisements and we found
out the percentage of complaints so it's
only the reviews that are one or two
star and what percentage of them were
related to these different hidden cars
and what percentage was related to
advertisements and we found it with
respect to the hidden cast it's about
five percent of the total number of
complaints total number of one and two
star reviews five percent of the reviews
were related to raja yoga how did you
know that how did you even get back did
you visit a manual study or need to do
some kind of sense villanelle how did
yeah so how did we know that it was
energy-related so we in a fast study we
kind of did manual analysis and we
tagged reviews and so we kind of knew
what kind of keywords show up when
they're complaining about energy so in
this study we just searched for those
keywords and we tagged each review as it
was an energy related complaint or a
network-related complaint or a related
complaint this work in our previous book
ah well accuracy because via the ones
creating the gold and Seth and so the
manual is included with multiple authors
looking at the reviews in tagging it
right so the accuracy right now we are
actually doing a study and we're looking
at accuracies in integrated agreement
and it's about 70-80
tis anywhere between seventy and eighty
percent is where even humans agree on a
particular reviews about a particular
thing so our machine learners you cannot
get further than that but because even
humans disagree in about twenty percent
of rabies but the ones who ran out of
energy couldn't fill out everything it
is possible yeah have you correlated a
relationship between the timeframe
dipping downloading the app uninstalling
the and so the advertisement so the
thing is uninstalling we can only know
from reviews whether they are going to
or not we actually cannot know if they
are installed an app or not okay the
google him no but we cannot know from
mining the app store whether they are in
slavia we cannot know even if the only
reason we know they install the app is
because they left out of you how many
people have installed the apps can leave
reviews and we don't and we know that
when they left therapy they still had
the app but after that we can't know
that they installed yeah porn on so even
though five and three percent might seem
like low numbers they are actually much
higher than some of the other complaints
that we found in previous studies so the
only kind of complaints that are more
than this crashes complaints about
crashes and complaints about feature
requests saying that not at this app is
bad because this feature is not there or
this app is bad because it keeps
crashing those are the only types of
complaints that are higher than this
surprisingly privacy-related complaints
are much lower than this I you would
actually be useful seeing like oh here's
my crab showing how its ranks for those
things yes respectable yeah yeah that's
actually yeah we have it in a different
study where we have the other complaints
and we have this and we can kind of see
compared ever we get actual the shop why
is the surprising I mean did you know
when there are disclosures right it's
entirely
Oh a little privacy complaints right
right it's not a billion have no idea I
mean energy or any kind of batteries
obvious yeah privacy they don't know
that they're losing their soul yet goes
yeah in some of the studies in the
previous studies that we did in
advertisements we found that sometimes
the app itself is not compromising the
privacy but the advertising library in
the apt is compromising the privacy okay
so there were a lot of users were angry
with apps because of the advertisements
and they were complaining about the
advertisements but they were directing
it at the app right there was actually
one ad network which was so bad that
Google had to change its policy to
prevent developers from using that ad
network anymore and the ad network was
paying top dollar for their
advertisements and so all developers
were going towards it what the ad
network does is it starts installing
other apps on your phone so you install
an app and the ad network inside the app
will install and out for Chevy or
whatever company's advertising it will
install their app on your phone and you
actually give them the permission to do
that and now google says no no no you
can't have advertisements later they
actually had to change the policy a
couple years back so that that had that
kind of ads with all the possible but
yeah so the developers themselves did
not know that it was doing this kind of
crazy things they just thought hey i'm
getting a lot of money for these
advertisements i'm gonna include it and
then they got slammed with reviews magic
music they had uninstalled it the other
kind of study we kind of looked at what
would the increase in rating be if these
complaints were not there right so we
kind of removed these and recalculated
the average and there will be an
increase of 0.003 facts and this number
is is an insignificant number let's be
fine but but
this can be the difference between
staying on the first page or in the
second page when you search for an app
because the ratings are so close between
some of these apps that this is enough
to push you from the first page to the
second page and that matters a lot like
how many times do we actually go to the
second page of search results how many
these 21 apps were on the first page oh
oh yeah all of it were they close to the
fuck I don't know is the point 0 0 3
like important for them so what we did
find this week when this is a
rudimentary thing but we looked at if
you take these 21 apps right and if you
consider these these apps will switch
other because of the 0.003 and it could
go to the next page because of that hey
it's it's a hypothetical thing it's not
actually the other than the same car
bursts yeah so now I'm just saying again
it's hypothetical is what I'm saying and
the other the same price is the price
play so there are free apps for all
three actions because there are like the
Diceman based aspect so in this 21 we
didn't have many from each category
right there's only like a couple of apps
that are there from the same category
but I'm just saying that it this could
be you could go from the second to the
third place because of this you could go
from the tenth to the eleventh place
because of this confirmed that the
retraining can not say the number of
reviews which is drastically different
like there's a 2x difference knowing
that this what influences people's
choices I'm sorry I look the number of
reviews there's a 2x difference for the
first best life quotes in 3d sense yeah
yes where's their rating is very close
so is it there ain't alone whether that
was the reviews plus other things uh I
don't know I don't know if the ratings
will be affected by Xena I know that the
change in ratings are affected by the
number of reviews that is there that the
more ratings that are the less change is
possible but I don't know if actually
there's more
it means that it'll have a higher rating
if there's more reviews there will be a
higher rate would a space for personally
in the selection oh good you consider
the rating for the girls considered a
lot of use a number of reviews is also
strongly correlated with the success of
the app and not just the high ratings so
yes they do consider people with more
reviews tend to have more downloads as
well so it is true yeah because it's 2x
it's possible that they won't look at
the small change in the rating and
they'll just say there's more people
using this there's more people reviewing
this therefore our juiceless so to kind
of just summarize we had three different
kinds of cars that we had performance
energy in bandwidth and we can have
quantified how much there is we also
found that there's maintenance effort
considerable maintenance effort because
of advertisements and that the ratings
are also affected because of the
advertisements so what now now that we
found this right some of the future
directions that we're looking at is one
is we want to do like static analysis or
an automated way for a developer to find
these cars we use the power monitor we
use like TCP dump logs and a lot of
heavy analysis to actually find out what
these tosser and developers may not have
the resources to do this so can we
provide them with a static analysis tool
where they run this and we kind of model
this tool based on historical data and
we say that if you do all of these kind
of calls then you're going to get this
kind of cast and therefore be careful
right and give them a heads up that they
are give adding a cost to the users and
also try to see if we can make some of
these calls more efficient maybe catch
them maybe
get more when it's on Wi-Fi then when
it's on 3G or 4G and different kinds of
things how can we do to optimize this
these various castes yeah i'm gonna go
to play devil's advocate so from a
developer from from the previous things
a lot of his concert and consumer it not
really cost the developer one thing
that's costing the developer cost
rankings because that basically you'd
impact kind of like the snowball effect
of getting use your train so in that
case i'm going to make a guess big a
leap year qualitatively speaking of
seeing most attic complaints are around
ad placement not around performance or
not your life or remorse and so that's
yeah that's definitely a ball and that's
why i think mine developers moving
towards your special native ads um in
video ad skits are more attractive and
more engaging but for the other things
the developer that's my primary way of
monetizing off users on Android
ecosystem our windows for cheaper than
iOS users or even able Sun users then
why I guess why would I invest further
money into a structure on cost rate
hidden things who are not costly than
the other thing I would I guess I would
ask is for the advertiser advertising
networks in this kit google ads why
would I invest in making I called more
efficient for some of these things um to
farm so a lot of the second person stays
for Google it's in their best interest
to give the best product out for a
mobile ad network because if there are
going to be costs and there's going to
be significant costs and you know we've
published this result we've put this out
online and we act so I the you know when
we kind of talked to the media about
this the way they presented it was it's
it's cheaper to buy a nap then use the
free app is kind of how they were
selling it right and people when they
see it they go wow really and more
people get educated about this they're
going to it's going to come back to bite
them right so it's
our best interest to start optimizing it
before people realize since no although
it might be in the best interest I just
realized and pay them money right
that'll be good for the devil of the
church that's very much good for the
developer I think because they would
definitely make more money when the
development their users pay for their
apps then for the advertisements because
even if they pay a dollar if I pay a
dollar for a nap the developer is
getting more money from me and they will
ever get from me through advertisements
because every thousand times they get
like a couple of days so to make that
one dollar from just me using the app
it's going to be a lot of usage of the
app there's a cop that goes through
google yeah yeah so I'm saying the cut
that comes to the developer is about a
couple of pennies for every thousand
times and add is viewed whereas if I pay
a dollar they get like 70 cents of the
dollar right I think they get seven I
think the iOS it's like 70 cents i don't
know how much it is with you sure look
it was about seven cents taking for
possible purchase for a thousand years
is what sense at all solutions yeah for
every thousand years whereas if they pay
a dollar then it may get seventy eighty
cents of that dollar and they might get
moment it's actually better for the
developer and the user if they actually
pay for the app we pay a dollar for the
app have you um it seems to me that adds
arguing difficult to cash because
they're highly context-sensitive very
sensitive to your location and so on so
have you given much thought to that you
suggested that as a way to optimize but
I you know one
how feasible that is yeah so it might
still be possible that it is context
sensual but since context sensitive ah
but I was going to say contextual and
then I combine context-sensitive and
contextual into one word its context
sensitive but it could be that every day
in the morning when I'm in the wireless
network it downloads everything and it
shows me the ads through the day and
then the next time i connect to the
wireless network in a few hours it again
that could be could be and it's it's not
just one way or the other but it's going
to be a challenge right it maybe it's
the trade of how much of context
sensitivity am I going to give up to
reduce the costs really I'm just asking
i think that's an interesting question
for you to pursue yeah exactly we you
know when it comes to making it more
cost efficient we need to see a multiple
trade-offs and see what might be the
best option here right and to come back
to your first question about why would
the developers want to do it I think
it's the same kind of reason do it now
before users realize that it is that
right it I mean it's it's one of those
things where now they don't realize it
but and it's they're not going to
realize it from using the apps but if
more people start finding this out and
more people start talking about this and
discussing this it's possible and
they're improving their apps they don't
have to but it's one of those things
where it might come back later to bite
them but you through that they need not
so that's why we want to make this as
cheap as possible for them to use it if
they do not need to invest anything if
it's just a static analysis tool if they
run and they say hey look this
particular version of your app suddenly
has like way too much cpu usage yes just
looking for actionable guides here I
I wonder feel like we already know where
the hidden costs are it's like how would
we possibly optimize that thought that's
hurting modernization right sailor the
reason you tend to ask for ads office
because you know that not every that's
going to be effective so you increase
this a sort of sweet spot of give the
user enough time to see the ad that we
know it's going to effective or not and
then after that this one is that I get
possibly yes that's true it's true it
might be better did not just fine but
also say what would be a better way to
monetize at a lower cost yeah so do we
have any any any I guess inside sir
recommendations on I guess what are the
kinds of optimizations to make without
hurting developer ones yeah yeah
possibly I don't know oh I don't know
yet this is things that we are looking
to explode in the future math I'm just a
bomb on this one things we're working on
this local client side Evans were never
close this Aguilar aggregated effects
you don't have to call about every term
the energy costs are reduced you have
basic with it do been a bit of privacy
and high levels of personalization quads
and that takes care of some of these
concerns it's not sufficient there that
observation is that if we just pop out
of the solo that isn't it the very I
mean isn't this by design that these
ghosts I mean frankly denote as hidden
perhaps and thats I'm to be known as
hidden because they're designed to be
not Chokin times in female model to move
people were you from this annoying free
version that you know just what's up at
the riv each way and way Sam general who
fails to the big version where they two
dollars and then all these annoyances
iconic this is just the simple
psychological trick right you basically
eliminated a yes by only paying adaalat
I mean
this is all by design so I'm not even
sure that it sexy because of the energy
being put through this you know why
plight of it it could be by design but
you have to keep in mind that am I
willing to pay that dollar or am I
willing to not use the app at all and
move on I think how many a question here
which is you I didn't identify the pain
once and you have a way to estimate the
PM of the cost and so then of course if
there is one way yeah against the actual
course yeah and it's not obvious that
usually do you have an answer nothing's
up you don't have an answer to how we
are going to optimize it yet but it
sounds like I mean we go there's a bit
of personal preference and place into
this book for me much your time either
just pay and not joke at this answers
yeah yeah and there are increasingly
more people who are willing to pay and
get rid of the Alliance right and when
that comes through I think most of this
would become irrelevant because they
were like okay yeah it's just now it's
kind of like we were talking about this
this is this work was presented in
exceed this year at Italy and actually
someone was saying it looks like it's
like paying protection money so you pay
that money and then you don't get an ID
anymore but if you don't then you get
any sort of way to live it is the you
lease before you bought yes this is much
more yeah and that's what a lot of
developers are now moving towards is the
finial model where you use it for free
just to see whether you like the app or
not and if you like it you pay and you
buy right and if they're moving more and
more towards that yes definitely this is
something but again we can still suggest
like how much pain can you give before
they can actually they uninstall the app
or they pay for the app that might be
something that we can look at as well to
see if you start and eyeing them too
much are they going to pay the one
dollar and you'll remove it or are they
going to uninstall so try to figure out
where that balances instead of their
specific yeah it is out specifically
this person specific as well
there's definitely people who are
willing to use and to come back your
first find about hidden cars a lot of
people when they are told this they're
like yeah that is true but they don't
realize it before they're kind of told
this like when we talked to non computer
science people and we say hey because of
this this is happening and they're like
really yeah that makes sense that yeah
you know that is obvious it looks
obvious but they didn't quite think of
it before they thought it was a free app
right yep why do you think this is less
of a concern and iOS is it because iOS
users have a door tolerance for this
kind of I I don't know if it is a lesser
concern for iOS we did not study iOS for
multiple reasons one of which being that
we don't mind the iOS store continuously
we think that Apple might be more
vindictive than Google if they find out
that we are actually mine in their store
and it's also a lot more difficult to
decompile iOS apps than android apps
just because of language that they use
is on this very good d compilers for
java and almost long for objective-c so
we haven't looked at iOS so i don't know
if iOS users find it less painful or not
if you research and numbers publicly
available kosovo likely to pay for apps
so so as to when I olds because of a I
more or less patient i should say this
would be less needed from one ization I
on iOS as you stir more perhaps there's
someone here last yes the number the
paper is available it's on my website
and you can download it for free and all
the numbers are there on it so yeah
anything close to the logic of different
there is a hipster no it is not heavy
