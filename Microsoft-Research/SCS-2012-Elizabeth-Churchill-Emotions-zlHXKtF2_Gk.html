about today's in
and I am reduced so I am profoundly
under-qualified but anything to do with
emotion and hard work depressing it's
depressing it or ignoring it however I'm
very interested in motion online because
we have various ways of dealing with
emotion online I love you were talking
about predicting and our emotion is
contagious online how we experience
things that happen to us online now we
express ourselves how we can manage it
online now I'm a psychologist originally
before I became interested in technology
and I were talking to a lot of community
managers online and about how they
manage people who very badly people get
online and they're right things and they
are really shitty to other people and
sometimes those shitty things that they
do get very contagious and other people
do shitty things turns out that and
padonia and that down person lives all
the time can also set the tone for a
place an online space so one of the
things that we know is that how people
behave explicitly really affects our
others behave task flea how we read
other people's emotions also can change
what we do if you show someone a smiling
face goes as a frowning face they are
more likely to take again they are more
likely to gain more money now here are
at most six emotional faces and is a lot
of rhetoric around how their these are
the basic emotions and we can actually
track them and we can understand them
and we can recognize them and we mirror
them and respond to them there are also
other ways that we as humans express
ourselves tacitly and these are through
our body changes and here we have
arousal to arousal lower abs or
high-rise almighty due to panic and yet
violence and it turns out there are many
ways to measure their sim ja MIT folks
Rosa
how this device that Brady has tried it
and one of the things we know is that
Brady gets very aroused when he sees Lee
gather it's not clear what you do with
that information we had a pair of your
data true this is a great if you happen
to have a magnetic resonance imaging
thing up your hand little disposable you
can see that this is range however as
Joe do major points out in his fantastic
picture personhood that isn't not
necessarily way to deport people going
to do most of the research that says
there are basically merchants is based
on Charles Darwin's original work who's
basically birds and Paul Ekman has a lot
of historical facial recognition on that
however despite massive claims in the
media whatever and others acknowledge is
that babies and animals tend to be very
regular in those kinds of emotions and
way they express them socially but when
you start to get to higher order
expression or once we've been socialized
personality does make a difference some
people are limited range others not some
people are given to shame which is more
likely to beat arrange some begin to
guilt some people like famous ed worse
mumps can actually start training the
narrow implicit signals and can start to
train how they reacted in public and how
they react to very stressful situations
so there are huge differences there is
also the vanity reason for why half of
your friends like they have
effect whatsoever and that is Botox and
so if you're going to do official
recognition technically or
interpersonally Botox is not going to
help you because everyone looks flat
there are also ways that we swallow our
anger will consume our anger or fear or
are paying or whatever it is in order to
follow social protocols we know that the
expression of emotion is different
across different cultures even brief
privately expressed publicly expressed
as a new orleans with a very flamboyant
kind of funeral is expressed differently
in different cultures um you know an
Irish wake is very different from varied
our ceremony and what we know is that
across different cultures what will
allowed to express difference and so if
you look at Confucius and the Analects
you will see long descriptions what is
appropriate or inappropriate in
different places there are also
different kinds of emotions that are
being invented if you like the slides
just jump straight over so for example
Milan Kundera talks about Lee toast
which is the most fantastic emotion
shuttle freighter has to be one of mine
in person but anyway what I wanted to
same this is that I've been thinking a
lot about emotion its social expression
it's personal experience and its
modulation interpersonally but also what
does it mean for us online for how we
manage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
