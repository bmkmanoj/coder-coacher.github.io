welcome to Kronos ooh
Crona zoom is a window into the world of
big data it bridges the gap between the
humanities and the sciences through an
infinite canvas allowing the exploration
of data throughout all of time our time
scale is dynamic and allows for us to
explore all of history from today until
13.7 billion years ago when time began
this is an exhibit inside the museum
about the Big Bang where it all unfolded
you see the mashup of data that we're
bringing into Crona zoom from different
data sources this picture is from Allen
of MIT showing the inflation theory of
the Big Bang we can look at other
artifacts inside this exhibit for
instance the logarithmic timescale of
the first billion years we can also use
other multimedia types we believe that
everything fit in the Big Bang including
even time and space Crona zoom is a
visualization tool allowing for the
first time people to mash up data from
all sorts of different places in
different formats enabling new insights
that would have never been possible
before now let's zoom back out to all of
time and now let's explore earth in the
solar system now let's think about life
again notice the time scale along the
top and that we've gone from today to
millions of years ago
the beginning of life creations of life
up to the time of the dinosaurs
and let's look at all the things related
to dinosaurs
and look there's a dinosaur extinction
impact and there's some great
information in a video here and the fact
that the dinosaurs went extinct due to
an asteroid impact 65 million years ago
for ten years people kept saying well
where's the crater
this is Walter Alvarez provisionary
behind President
probably one of the most significant
features of chromosome is the fact that
it's backed by the power of Windows
Azure Windows Azure allows for
scalability both in compute horsepower
as well as database data repositories
and storage from doing mashups of all
this big data from all sorts of
disparate data sources scientists
researchers even students can discover
new things they would have never been
able to discover before hello my name is
Seth Lee this timeline is part of a
project I've been working on for my big
history class let me take you on a brief
tour this is a story about the
japanese-american internment during
World War two explain through the lives
of a couple named Arthur and it's still
a shego Crona zoom allows for telling
stories about cultural preservation and
connecting digital humanities and
Sciences here we have the bibliography
and every exhibit inside Crona zoom
contains references not only to the
source material and where this big data
came from but it also points to other
data throughout all sorts of
repositories for furthering your
exploration of the event this is really
where the mash-up shines through the
power of Crona zooms infinite canvas new
insights can be discovered both within
time and across time as we come back out
of humanity and back out of pre human
history back out of life and of Earth
and to the cosmos trends can be observed
between timelines of great historical
proportion that can help influence our
understanding of the future
