manager at Microsoft cognitive services
previously known as Project Oxford
Microsoft cognitive services is a
platform of machine learning based
restful api and SDKs that help
developers easily add and integrate
smart into their application today i'm
going to talk about an interesting
service called speak recognition speaker
recognition service helps you recognize
user based on their voice as voice has
unique characteristics that can be used
to recognize and identify a speaker so
just like everyone has a unique
fingerprint everyone has a unique voice
to establish identity three pieces of
information are needed something you
know and this can be a pistol a password
or a pin something you have a credit
card a secure token a mobile device and
something you are and this covers all
biometric characteristics voice
fingerprint and face and this is where
speaker cognition comes to help in
general speaker cognition has two phases
enrollment and recognition during
enrollment the speaker's voice is
recorded a number of features and
characteristics are extracted to create
what we call a voice print that uniquely
identifies the speaker these
characteristics are based on the
physical configuration of the speaker's
vocal tract which are unique then comes
recognition during which the provided
speakers audio sample is compared
against the created voice print and the
speaker's identity is verified speaker
cognition offers two services speaker
verification and speaker identification
speaker verification takes security into
a higher level it is tightly related to
authentication scenarios and that's why
it is associated with a passphrase
to let us see how it works let's have a
look at the services demo page first I
need to pick a passphrase from the given
list of pass phrases so let me choose
this one
my voice is stronger than passwords the
service requires at least three
enrollment to successfully register my
voice with the service and have a voice
been created so let's get started
my voice is stronger than passwords
the first enrollment went through two
more enrollments are needed my voice is
stronger than passwords one more
enrollment to go my voice is stronger
than passwords now enrollment is
complete and I can start verification
step and test the service using
different scenarios so let's do that
my voice is stronger than passwords
as you can see the request was accepted
as the service was able to recognize
that I'm the correct speaker saying in
the correct passphrase so let's choose a
different path phrase how are you doing
today the request was rejected as a
different pass phrase was used then
comes speaker identification speaker
identification service can automatically
identify the person speaking given a
group of speakers so indicates you have
a group of people sitting together it
can help you identify who is currently
speaking this is best shown through our
services demo page here we have a list
of well-known people presidents and a
list of audio files and we don't know
which audio file relates to which
President but using our speaker
identification service we can identify
which President is talking in each file
so I'm going to start and choose this
one and as you can see the service was
able to recognize that the speaker in
this audio file was Barack Obama so
that's all about speaker cognition api's
hope you found the video useful thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
