greetings all of you thank you very much
for coming
I've been on a wild wind tour for the
last month and a half doing talks all
over the place talking about the book
sharing about the ideas and I always
want to share one of my most recent
adventures with wherever I am speaking
next so I want to share with you about a
week ago I was in Los Angeles and I was
at a talent agency where the people were
very very nice and we were exploring an
idea which is how many of you have ever
seen a show called super nanny Jeff sees
super nanny OKC so super nanny for those
of you who don't know she liked
parachutes in two highly dysfunctional
families kids are screaming and running
around and super nanny comes in and she
gives parenting advice and then in the
second half of the show you see the
happy family implementing all of super
nannies excellent advice so the idea was
this show would be called the coach and
there would be some dysfunctional
executive team and then I would
parachute in like super nanny and
identify what was going wrong and then I
would give coaching to the team and then
you'd see them all very high-performing
team at the end so a pitch the idea and
these incredibly nice women look at me
and they said you know what the new
trend is in television
naked naked is actually apparently like
the in thing on television so for
example survivor used to be normal
survivor but now it's like naked and
afraid' survivor so like could there be
a way we could do the show naked I'm
thinking yeah this this is not that
wasn't my vision and I think the naked
coach
no one's gonna watch that so yeah anyway
I want to share that with you just as a
way of linking my adventures on the road
I hope there would be fewer curveballs
in this conversation today then that one
but I'm very happy to be here to talk to
you guys about the book and promise not
to parachute into your lives after this
looking for dysfunction what I want to
talk about is the way that we all get in
our own way in our lives in our
leadership in our professional teams in
the projects that we pursue in our love
lives probably not any of you here but
some people mess things up in their love
lives and give you a pretty clear map
for something you can do about that and
I came to get very interested in this
the idea of how we prevent ourselves
from doing things that we know we could
do we should do we've had training or
we've read a lot of good books and we
have tools and techniques but oftentimes
when it matters most we don't use them
so many years ago I was teaching an
executive education program at Harvard
Law School it was a week-long seminar
and we had one faculty member and three
delegates so let's imagine I'm working
with the three of you and the exercise
would be taking place over the course of
a day we had a video camera we're gonna
give video feedback to people and each
person had the chance to choose a
challenge something that was really
difficult in their lives and they would
bring it the next day and we'd work
together as a team you know with a coach
trying to really get a breakthrough so
in one instance of
this exercise I found out the night
before that one of the people in my
group was a justice on the Supreme Court
supposed to be daunted and that I was 25
I had just graduated from law school and
my job the next day was to give coaching
to this person thank you see now you get
the the ridiculousness of the situation
and I you know panicked I was thinking
what can I possibly have to say to this
person and I started fantasizing if he
has conflicts with Parliament or you
know Sentencing Guidelines and his other
justices on who knows what he's gonna
want to talk about this was not by the
way a US Justice it was a high court
judge from another country but I
couldn't really imagine what he would
bring fast forward to the next day it's
his turn to do the exercise and we asked
him you know very elegant gentleman
respectfully sir you know if you could
tell us about the challenge you chose he
says I really want my wife to stop
choosing my ties and with total
sincerity and I said I'm sorry
he says for 50 years I come out of the
washroom and she's laid my clothes out
on the bed why does she do that I hate
that yeah I said she loves you so I
asked him a question which was have you
ever asked her not to do that now that
is my problem
I simply cannot bring myself to ask her
to stop and in that moment I really
started to see negotiation conversation
leadership interactions in a totally new
way because this actually wasn't a
conflict between the judge and his wife
it was a conflict inside of him a part
of him that wanted to say something a
part of him that didn't right we could
roleplay lines like you could practice
how about you don't do that anymore
or we could practice brainstorming how
about if you pick out my outfits money
to Wednesday Friday and I do it Tuesday
Thursday you know do some joint problem
solving this is a problem inside of
himself and the way to get out of it is
not going to be practicing what he can
say it's going to be identifying these
parts inside of him that are in conflict
getting really clear what they are what
they care about what they want from him
and then in essence getting to yes
inside of himself so that he can then go
interact with someone else and from that
moment on I've been researching and
talking and teaching and writing about
the idea that the most important
negotiations you have in your life are
the ones you have with yourself and we
think about negotiating youth buying
house or asking for a salary raise or
you know negotiating for product sharing
across maybe different tech companies or
what's going on now in the Crimea
negotiating big world affairs or massive
business deals negotiation is actually
something you do every day all day with
yourself but there's really not been
before a very good map for what that
looks like or how to get good at it so
that's what I became really interested
in my belief is that every single one of
us you know mess up our lives every day
all the time we may have different ways
of doing that we may shut down someone
else might lash out right someone else
might just walk out deny a conflict we
might just get physically ill not
knowing what to do but most people have
some examples in their lives where they
either did say and do something or they
chose not to do or say something and
then they're left with regret right
anybody ever have that experience you
lay in bed at night like oh my god I
just told my boss to shut up
yeah so um I actually did have this
experience two nights ago I had gone
from Los Angeles to San Francisco I was
in San Francisco right before here and I
saw somebody who I hadn't seen for a
long time the backdrop you need to know
from this is that I got married three
years ago and this person was a friend
of my husband my now husband I haven't
seen him since before the wedding so he
came up to me was at a cocktail party
and he said hey how are my dear friends
Erika and Bernard s that's my husband
and I said not that dear friends cuz you
didn't even RSVP to our wedding and I
thought wow that's
I didn't plan for that to happen this is
a completely true story and he said what
and I said I'm just saying I mean we can
chitchat you know if you want but I mean
not really good friends right cuz I mean
you didn't come you to actually didn't
even RSVP I actually said this two days
ago so actually don't read this book or
listen to anything I say I have nothing
for you but if I don't then I had to
write an email which I was like
horrified so I'm so sorry that didn't
come out right
you know and it didn't right really I I
feel hurt from that time I felt hurt for
my husband because it was his friend
I've been carrying it right I haven't
seen him and when I saw him the first
thing that rose in me was the memory of
like that was painful that he didn't it
felt then he didn't care enough about us
to even tell us he wasn't coming and
having never met him before it was just
there it was so then he brought me back
and said it's okay and so just so you
know it's all been kind of worked out
but I offer you this example just to say
that it really is part of our daily
lives even people like me who practice a
lot we have moments where we get
defensive reactive we get hooked in some
way maybe we feel threatened or insulted
scared
and we wind up doing things that are
much less effective than what we know
we're capable of I have plenty of
experiences of not attacking friends at
cocktail parties so that's not my best
so the way I think about the problem
that winning from within aims to help
people with is mess and miss on the one
hand we mess up our lives we mess things
up at work we mess things up with our
families in communities on boards we
serve on from CEOs to summer interns
even though we know better we also just
simply miss opportunities you know can
imagine yourself sitting around a room
in a conference room sitting around a
table and somebody says there's a really
cool new project you know who might like
to volunteer and maybe part of you is
thinking like I would love to do that
but then you think well you don't want
to look selfish or maybe other people
should get the opportunity or I don't
know this is like a very high-status
person
it's nerve-racking what if you don't
impress the person then you just don't
and someone else raised their hand is
like great well that person got that
project and then again you have to go
home at night and say why didn't I
volunteer for that that was a great
project for me so oftentimes we wind up
making mistakes missing opportunities
and then we're just left asking
ourselves ok well now what and I think
people will be happier more successful
and more genuinely fulfilled if we start
to have a way to avoid this cycle
entirely I don't have to fix it at this
point you want to have a way to get
ahead of it as I say it doesn't work all
the time but you can learn ways to
understand yourself discover parts of
yourself develop them and learn along
the path of mastery of yourself
that you actually can cut down
dramatically
these suboptimal situations
so the way I talk about this in the book
is as a performance gap we have on the
one hand our highest potential to behave
I could have been lovely to that guy
been happy to see him we have what we
actually do in real life right I shut
down I kid I didn't volunteer I sent
that email I know I shouldn't have sent
it that's a gap between your best
potential what you really could do right
the judge knows how to say something to
his wife and what you actually do which
in his story is nothing but just let it
eat you up inside
for 40 years so I want to share with you
four steps in the next 15 minutes as a
roadmap for a process you can learn that
will help you close that performance gap
and the four steps are one that you
start to recognize your big four which
I'll define in a moment that you start
to recognize them in general and you
start to appreciate how they operate in
you that's your profile it's your big
four constellation that you start to
learn the process of negotiating with
yourself I said before that a lot of
negotiation training a lot of
negotiation frameworks are but had to
make deals with other people how to deal
with difficult people or crazy people in
this case the difficult person you learn
to deal with is yourself and it makes
your life easier and the last one is
that you set off on ongoing journey that
you appreciate that you can become more
and more skillful over time you can gain
capacity that you don't have today and
that's part of the journey it doesn't
happen overnight okay so step one is the
somewhat radical idea and that radical
idea is that you you what you think of
as me is not singular you are plural
Walt Whitman said a long time ago I am
large I contain multitudes what does
that mean Joseph Campbell described
human beings as a hero with a thousand
faces right how many of you know that
reference so there's a long long
tradition of recognizing that the human
condition our inner experience is not
unitary there are different parts of us
but in our society in our culture today
at least in the West we've largely lost
track of that tradition which is
hundreds and hundreds of years old that
has guides and maps for how to
understand how to navigate this inner
world that is complex so the idea is
that you start to recognize actually I
am me but there's a bunch of different
parts of me in there and figuring out
how they operate what makes me tick is
going to be much more helpful than just
operating on autopilot with no
understanding of what's going on so I
said Joseph Campbell talked about a
thousand faces I think that is unwieldy
certainly for people in business life so
I've honed in on what I call the big
four that is not in any way to say that
the human condition has four parts and
nothing more there are many lineages
that could tell you you have a hundred
you have a thousand different you know
dimensions I focus on these four for two
reasons one in ten years of research I
can tell you that these for show up
again and again in different names in
different languages but over and over
from cave dwellers to depth
psychologists to now neuro scientists
who are mapping the brain say we have a
part of us that dreams that longs for a
better future a part of us that thinks
rationally a part of us that feels and a
part of us that wants to take action and
get things done these four are very
fundamental and the second reason is
I've just experienced that using them
with executives in many different
there's helpful people get them quickly
they notice which ones they're using and
not using and then they start to gain
capacity pretty quickly so I apologize
there's no CTO here I realized this
morning that was you know we could add
that but the image that I want to offer
you is of an inner executive team as if
you had these executives inside of you a
CEO that was about setting direction and
vision and possibility a CFO or general
counsel that likes to gather facts and
information takes different perspectives
helps you manage risk and evaluate
trade-offs you have a HR expert who
cares about people who knows how to
engage employees or create a sense of
affiliation on a team that whole set of
skills and finally you have a sort of
chief operating officer who really wants
to keep the trains on track and help you
get things done how many people with
that description can start to see parts
of yourself that if we asked your
friends to describe do you see one or
two of these inside of yourself okay
great so the first step is just
recognizing you have these four it turns
out that they actually are a lot like
different negotiating parties which is
why I talked about negotiation within
they have different values different
interests different priorities different
styles of communicating with you and you
really want to get to know them the
second step is to start thinking about
what I call your profile and that means
everyone in this room has some
tendencies around how you use these for
you all have all four of them as
potential but most people tend to use
one or two of them a lot maybe have one
that they would just never use they say
well that's just not me I'm not like
that
you have different situations where you
call on them for different reasons
so a profile essentially means I started
to come to notice that in many
situations I'm really only using these
skills and I'm not using those and
that's just a good awareness to start
with so many business people who I work
with for example are very productive in
terms of their jobs their clients likes
them a lot and they have teams that
constantly complain about them in 360
degree feedback right people criticize
they're so mean the guy's a bully you
know I think he hates me and when I
confront executives with that
information they often are shocked they
don't see that side of themselves if you
ask them you know do push your team very
hard they will say they don't work
harder than I do right and we have
standards of excellence so it could be
true that one of these is an overdrive
in your life and you may not even notice
there's also a common pattern I've seen
in organizations where one person on the
team is sort of the isolated patient
identified patient as like they're the
people person they remember the birthday
of everybody on the team maybe some of
you are this person they always want to
check in when people get back from
vacation and holidays but they run a
risk which is really straight logical
business people don't always take them
seriously they seem so lightweight so
checking in with the people in your team
is a wonderful skill balanced in a
business environment with demonstrating
you can make a logical argument that you
know how to analyze information right
you have to balance these strengths
depending on the circumstances that
you're in not get stuck in only one or
two of these because that's where you're
comfortable so I want to give you guys
two minutes before I keep going to turn
to someone near you could be
behind you someone in front of you and
ask yourself this if we ask the people
who know you best take your own self out
of it if we ask the people who work with
you every day people who live with you
to describe your profile he's you know
always thinking always trying to solve
problems but not the most relational
emotional guy or no I think actually
this you're pretty balanced at all those
things although maybe the dreamer hasn't
been very active lately just take a
minute with somebody near you what were
the people who know you well do you
think say about how you use these for
your life
okay 30 seconds
okay just between us I know it's being
videoed but if you put that out of your
mind anywhere do you want to share
anything that came to mind maybe not
about yourself but about a hypothetical
person
how many of you found when you thought
about it that you probably do have one
or two that you use more or even three
but there that there's one or two that
you don't use nearly as much how many
people found that so that's pretty
common and what I want to say to you is
that you have this full breadth of
potential this is like an inner
technology these parts of you have tools
and techniques and methods and processes
and it's as if you're only using half
the inner technology available to you
which I know none of you would do with
real technology so it's really important
to start to investigate these parts of
you something I feel also pretty
strongly about is the basic principle
that we do all have these big for we use
them to varying degrees there are a lot
of corporate piping systems right that
will tell you you're blue or green but
then you're not red or of course
myers-briggs very well-known an enormous
contribution to helping people
understand themselves but at the same
time can give people the impression oh
I'm a thinker not a feeler right I'm
this and therefore not that and I don't
believe that we have the intrinsic
inborn innate capacity to live fully
broadly to our full potential it's
likely true that over the course of our
lives we've learned things through
success and failure like I'm very good
at this so I'm gonna keep doing that or
maybe someone in my life told me acting
like that is no good and I stopped doing
it but now we're all adults and we can
open our eyes and say hey there are
parts of myself I left behind maybe
because my first manager told me you
know I'll never be a people person
because I'm brilliant tech person that's
just not true and I can tell you that
from working with thousands and
thousands of executives the story you
tell yourself the
file or identity that you described can
limit you and it can also open a lot of
new possibilities if you're willing to
explore how you describe your profile
and what else could become possible so
two more steps the third this is kind of
where the rubber meets the road once you
have the awareness and the insight you
learn to negotiate with yourself you
learn to notice there are different
parts of me in a conflict and instead of
just having some vague sense of
discomfort or stomachache or a migraine
I'm aware that different parts of me
have different preferences or priorities
here I'm gonna hear them out and then
decide and I'll give you an example of
this I was working with a large company
based in Europe and I was working with
the executive team they were negotiating
a very big contract with a company based
here in New York and these negotiations
had gone on for months the deal on the
table seemed pretty sound they had had
different people evaluate it and
essentially they had a deal the u.s.
organizations sent over contract to the
Europeans to sign and my client called
me hysterical and he said they wrote the
amount in u.s. dollars not in Euros
which means that although we agreed to
these numbers they're paying whatever it
was at the time you know half or
two-thirds of the amount because they
wrote at US Dollars and we're
negotiating in Euros the whole time so
he called his lawyer of course and he
had his lawyer call the lawyer in the US
and they said you know I think we're
having some kind of a breakdown here we
had agreed to these terms and conditions
under the understanding that the shared
currency was in Euros and the lawyer
actually was very apologetic you know
there was a just a mistake innocent
mistake we're gonna fix it we're gonna
send you a new contract so lawyer wasn't
sure whether he believed it or not but
he said you know what do I care they're
gonna give us the contract we thought we
agreed on in your
the client executive I worked with he
did not agree he said this is not an
innocent mistake this is an intentional
attempt you know to rip us off did they
think we wouldn't notice you know and he
just wanted to pick up that phone and
start screaming at the business guys on
the other side of the deal
understandably so yet he had to decide
between the different parts of himself
in my emotional self I'm outraged I feel
betrayed this is injustice right in his
warrior I'm gonna take a stand I'm gonna
say this is not okay and as a thinker in
his rational business self it's a good
deal for his business in fact it's the
very deal he agreed to it's not even a
different deal he already agreed to the
deal of the day before and he thought it
was a good business opportunity then and
his dreamer might likewise say we did
this deal because we think this contract
is gonna move us forward towards our
strategy or it's gonna help us in the
direction we're trying to go but then
you still have this part saying I don't
care right I don't care about the deal I
just you know I've been wronged and that
part is not wrong right from this lover
warrior perspective it's perfectly
legitimate to say the most important
thing in this situation now is that I
call this guy I call him on what he did
I get to tell him that I don't respect
his business practices that's what this
sort of lover warrior wants to do but in
this moment he can either just do that
and put the deal at risk or he can
notice okay part of me that's what that
part wants to do another part of me is
excited about the future that the
contract represents and rationally
speaking I've run the numbers gonna be a
profitable deal now these guys have to
decide and there's no right or wrong
choice they're all legitimate the only
thing you want to make sure to do is
choose and very often we make important
choices in this
kind of situation just on autopilot
right I mean if you're the kind of
person who always speaks up and shares
your feelings that's what you're gonna
do regardless of the business
opportunity if you live your life in a
rational logical you know business
framework you're going to just keep
going and may not notice that there's a
part of you that is really hurt and
angry that feels betrayed and you are
abandoning that part of you completely
you don't even notice that they're there
and by the way if that's a pattern you
carry for 15 years you'll start to
notice when you have a heart attack when
you're 46 right I mean you can't just
ignore these strong emotional
experiences for your whole life they
will ultimately many people would say
and I would say myself though they will
show up in the body they will show up in
disease I mean you things have to be
worked through
so in that case more or less we really
were just weighing if this were a
one-time sign the deal exchange goods we
have the transaction we don't have to
work with this guy again then it might
make more sense to just let the thinker
dreamer go forward if this was a
situation where these two guys were
gonna need to work together a lot for
the next decade and now they know trust
but I think the guy in Europe so he
doesn't operate in good faith you can't
build a working relationship on that
you're gonna have to say I really need
for you to help me believe that this
really was an honest mistake
because it doesn't seem that way they're
gonna have to work that out to make the
deal succeed over time so I would
encourage you to just start thinking
about situations in your own life where
you might have made a move quickly
whether to say something not to say
something to express your feelings to
make a certain kind of evaluative
decision to throw risk caution to the
wind and not measure risk because you're
so inspired and excited and in those
moments you want to call on one of the
big four that's not at the table and
just tap in and ask yourself does my
dreamer warrior lover thinker have a
piece of wisdom here
that I need to think about before I just
move to put that on a bigger scale just
for a minute
I've talked a lot about being more
effective and having higher performance
higher performing teams and
organizations it's also true that many
many traditions wisdom traditions
psychological traditions now I think
some neuroscientific traditions in terms
of being able to measure heart rate
variability in all sorts of coherence in
the body have said for generations that
the way to not only an effective life
and a high-performing life but also a
meaningful life a fulfilling life is to
bring the different parts of yourself
into some kind of harmonious balance
this is a very timeless image for that
right these these parts are all
interwoven together the black is in the
white the white is in the black they're
kind of too round and circular so
they're just in a constant cycle that
moves but this symbol in essence is also
saying as a way of life you really want
to have all the different parts of who
you are interdependent active alive
available because there's a deeper
wisdom to what that will bring through
you over the course of your life I love
this cat this cat is looking at a lion
in the mirror so I said to myself self
you're amazing the last part is just to
decide to commit that you're gonna
expand your profile over time
whatever constellation you have today I
use these two a lot I don't use this one
that's not your personality you're not
locked into that way of living that is
the way today you are balancing these
parts of you it's not a death sentence
it doesn't really tell you anything
about how you're gonna start to live
love lead work with other people
tomorrow and I want to share with you
just a personal example that I had with
this because it really brought home to
me the truth of this is that these
things are fluid and ever-changing so I
grew up
on the East Coast I don't know if any of
you could tell that I came from New York
but in case that wasn't obvious I am
originally from New York and I grew up
in a pretty traditional Jewish household
and my whole life my family had a
fantasy for me which I deeply integrated
that I would get married around you know
25 26 to some ideally rabbinical student
but anyway some nice Jewish guy from
Manhattan and then we'd have some kids
and then you know send them to medical
school so it turns out I went through my
20s I went through my 30s I met my
beloved when I was 40 not only was I 40
but the man who I ultimately married was
married before so he has a little son
from his first marriage and he lives in
the Netherlands not anywhere near
Manhattan he lives in the Netherlands
and he has shared custody obviously of
his son so if I want the guy that I want
Europe and you know the whole thing not
my dream it wasn't so I went through a
really challenging period of confusion
life but I know my dream my dream was I
was gonna be this guy and there's gonna
have these kids and we're gonna live in
the suburbs maybe Massachusetts and I
had to confront in my dreamer that dream
already didn't happen right I already am
NOT 35 with two kids and I'm actually 40
unmarried with no kids so I'm still
attached to that dream but actually that
dream already didn't happen so here's a
real opportunity with a guy who I
actually love it represents a life
towards which I have no dreams I've no
visions of living in Europe I have no
dreams I had no fantasy I promise you of
learning to speak Dutch but that's
that's my life now and so in that life I
do have to say to myself okay dreamer we
got to find a new dream I here I am I
live in the Netherlands I have this
fantastic stepson who refuses to speak a
word of English
still love the guy you know it's a
totally new world and I could sit every
day in my new life thinking like my life
just didn't work out if I stay attached
to that dream or I could say no it's a
new day so and I really work at trying
to imagine you know what's the happiest
life for myself here what's the highest
potential I have in this context to
fulfill myself my purpose my possibility
and a different vision of a family than
what I would have had so I share that
with you only because it's not just oh
the dreamer has a dream like yeah that's
right and then maybe that doesn't happen
so then what okay well you have to keep
going the lover you know has a
relationship but gets hurt
devastated broken hearted you say well
okay well forget that that you know
whole people thing didn't work out no no
your lover has experiences you learn and
you say okay let me find out when that
part of me is ready to engage again you
keep going and that's what this you know
expand your profile over time it means
every day of your life is a new
opportunity to use parts of yourself you
haven't been using or to tap into
potential you have that's just waiting
for you it's just waiting for you to
invite that part of yourself in so I'm
gonna stop here because I'm also
watching the clock and just want to ask
any comments questions doesn't have to
be a question could be just your own
reflection or impression and also of
course I'm happy to take questions yes
so I've been studying the Princeton and
profiling yeah and yeah like I said when
I feel like I'm sentence to you know
label he's saying that he feels
sentenced to in some of these typing
systems I okay that's that's the
sentence but as we try to if I try to
adjust and try to bring you know the
other aspect on before oh yeah
definitely something
indecisiveness internal contention
and how will work come back I think
that's a dilemma of trying to learn
anything right you could say okay in my
comfort zone here I'm really good at
this so I'll spend my life just in this
comfort zone so how does it feel to
operate in your comfort zone
the shoutout what did this on things you
feel in your comfort zone competent safe
what else do you feel in your comfort
zone
relaxed comfortable it's boring yes
say again you're unchallenged right so
it's both you're in your comfort zone
you already know how to do this it's
safe and comfortable and also boring and
you're not challenged then you step out
now you're outside your comfort zone
until what does it feel like being
outside your comfort zone it's scary
it's exciting it can be exhilarating
exhausting can be threatening
that's the uncomfort part of going out
of the comfort zone right so it's also
both it's not comfortable it's not
necessarily feel safe don't necessarily
feel confident right when you're trying
to do something new however it's
exhilarating it's exciting you actually
do learn and if you continue to practice
the things that are outside of your zone
today right down the road you realize
hey actually now those things are
included within my comfort zone and
they're not scary anymore and now we
better try something else
so this town is in my mind and Silicon
Valley about pushing ourselves to a
future we don't know yet right going
into what's uncertain not staying with
what's tested and true but asking you
know what's the coolest new smart thing
we can bring to the world a year from
now five years from now that's also a
good mindset for life I think you don't
want to spend your whole life being safe
and bored
yes yes yes she read the first two pages
she oh yeah yeah I realize it's makeup
because I'm a female and one annek
dreamer and a barber
I know what he said I think it's more
like a pink order so do you think the
difference
I know thought about this of course the
fair amount I think the difference is
less and less to be honest I think we in
this room and you know some of us are
older and some of us that are younger
than ourselves
I think we in this room still grew up in
worlds where boys and girls were
socialized quite differently right at
least when I was growing up and that
it's already very different boys played
on sports teams there were clear goals
there were winners and losers right and
my friends and I played school where I
was the teacher of course and they were
my students but like our games were just
about talking to each other that was our
game all the time well you know we could
play I don't know any game that had a
structure called we talked to each other
and communicate we connect
you can't win or lose at that game the
worst thing is if the girls don't want
you in their group anymore that's
devastating but but
and that's quite final actually if you
think about losing a soccer game you
know you could win next week so do I
think that in our generation we in
general were raised to pursue value
connection relationship you know
imagination and fantasy dreamer kind of
stuff and that boys were raised more
doing competitive things where you could
see a winner and a loser where they
conditioned more towards thinker and
warrior I think yes but as a big but I
don't think that's really that true
anymore I think many many of those
things have broken down I look at young
guys today they're sharing co-parenting
with their women they're taking quite
seriously
like we're both responsible for
nurturing right obviously girls today
playing on all kinds of sports teams and
they do grow up loving competition they
do grow up wanting to win so I don't
think it's inborn genetically as you can
hear I think it has to do with what's
rewarded and encouraged and I think the
kids who are kids now and as they become
older and enter the workforce I don't
think you're gonna see that as a very
clear line great it would be worth you
asking yourself how much is there a real
story here about me as a woman and how
much is that story how I get myself off
the hook from saying I really should use
my warrior my thinker right yeah and
that's it oh but I'm a woman so that you
know sorry
no I would say let's just establish
there might be an element of that but
get rid of it and see what becomes
possible yeah yeah and the reason why
I'm really curious about that is you
know when you typically in a business
scenario and you have this yeah we kind
of get coached to to do a little bit of
both right so you say you suck smiley
smiley smiley you know you became a
smiling smiley and here's how you'll
move forward oh wait how is that doing
both that say that yes you smiling
smelly and then you say I'm very more to
go on than you know all they do know
water you betrayed me but you know you
still do business and in three years
later you see them a cocktail party like
hey you talk about being friends let's
think about that whole euro US dollars
thing yes so in many situations like
this the key is to find the both and
right not to choose but it has to be a
real boat and it can't be like smiley
smiley now you betrayed me but hey let's
move on I mean that's that's not
actually honoring the reality of this
perspective
right so then the question is rather
than saying to myself do I give you know
clearer tough performance feedback to
this person this is a hard truth and I
want them to get it or should I be nice
and encouraging and tell them I believe
in them that's not a choice you should
be nice and encourage them and tell them
you believe in them and give them
difficult feedback if that's what they
need to perform you really want to do
both it's not as I said it's not thinker
or feel or dreamer or warrior that's
what the the yin and yang symbol is
saying it has you have to draw in them
all so what we did in this case he said
it's a good business deal from a thinker
perspective I don't want to blow it up I
do believe it's part of the future of
the industry dreamer perspective and I
am so upset and angry because I don't
believe it was an honest mistake and I
can't move on from that so what are we
gonna do so what we did was we arranged
a conversation for this executive with
the other side's lawyer and we said okay
let's keep the other business guy out of
this for now let's give him benefit of
the doubt for now that maybe it was a
mistake but our guy said I want to sit
face to face in a conference room with
that guy and I want to say you persuade
me that this was an honest mistake
because right now I don't trust her
client and I don't feel good about
moving forward and so the guy brought
out various emails various documentation
you know trying to shut communication
they said you know look Draft after
Draft after draft it says euros euros
euros euros euros I don't know why this
turned into dollars it could have
literally been you know these the
administrative help that was typing this
up it was it was genuine a mistake he
said all this email communications
between the lawyer and the client he
said use you see no exchanges here
saying hey we can get you know create
some extra value by changing the
currency there's no indication volition
you know to rip you off I'm telling you
it was an honest mistake
and you know we'll never know but the
client genuinely was skeptical walking
in and at the end of the meeting he
thought yeah I mean could be an honest
mistake
and there isn't really evidence
otherwise and it was enough he let it go
and he didn't talk about it with the the
his essentially his you know partnering
the deal so it means another example
also of asking yourself if there's a
part of me that has a need or that's
upset about something is there a
creative way right that I can take care
of that legitimate need that I have
without putting at risk something else
that I'm worried about if I feel like
you really can't take tough performance
feedback but I know if you don't get the
message you might lose your job
maybe I say I'm gonna go to your manager
and say listen you know you're gonna
have to give some coaching over time
because if she doesn't get better at
this I don't think she's gonna stay and
I'm letting you know that because I
don't think I'm the right person to tell
her but I do want her to get the
information right so by giving everybody
a voice you can then start to
strategically ask yourself by what path
can they all get their needs met does
that make sense yeah
to my dying day I'm gonna wonder whether
that was a mistake I'm never gonna know
yeah it was an interesting you mentioned
all the different systems that had for
yeah incredible reviews in the
philosophy did you see whether you're
like--you're for your whore aligned with
other whores and why do you think this
only there's four not three or five
that's a good question um what I would
say is that my four are an attempt to
translate a lot of very esoteric
material into language that everyday
mainstream business people can use and
understand so I think there is a close
although not perfect relationship for
example in the Kabbalistic tradition
mystical Jewish tradition of the four
worlds there's a relationship in many
different traditions where you would say
I see the seeds of this map in this
system the language is very different
some of is not that different many
indigenous people have you know earth
fire air water four core elements of
life and I have mapped them here some
say north south east and west some use
the seasons but I've looked at
acupuncture I've looked at the five bit
of families I've looked at you know many
different traditions asking is there
some way to to boil this down and to
translate is really the best word I have
translated into language that we all in
our world now you know can understand
and use to get better at what we do so I
did pick the four because they seemed to
me again reading things in translation
to be close to the truth of what I saw
over and what I saw over and over was
four by the way it's not like these guys
well the Buddha families are five but in
and of course there are some threes but
I'll be honest and saying many many
systems over thousands of years that try
to describe the essence of the human
condition the S
of human nature will identify by their
own language these four I will also say
and sort of beyond what we can do today
you are not just for you're not just
your big four you're a lot more than
that for example the part of you that is
aware of the big four isn't one of them
right so what's that what's going on
there so in the book I do talk about the
Transformers these three aspects of our
identity that are almost like a board of
directors that are overseeing the
operating big four right like a board
they want to make sure the big four are
acting properly and optimizing value and
not breaking the law but these
transformers like a board aren't
attached to any particular one of the
four and so once you get the lay of the
land of the four then the fun really
starts because you start to learn about
the parts of yourself that can exert
choice over these guys it's like put
yourself behind the steering wheel and
put these guys in the back seat you know
let yourself lead your life not let your
warrior lead your life because he always
has or let your warrior lead your life
because she always has you know you want
to lead your life safe to learn also
about the part of yourself that's
actually bigger than the big four and
many many traditions of course support
that from witness awareness to
mindfulness I talked about the lookout
part of yourself that's on the lookout
inside of you for what's going on and
the captain is the part of you that
chooses so you you mean to say my ex is
not my board of directors well trying to
understand the operating model of your
ex that is actually the advanced course
I do offer that but it's like in a
weekend format and it's very
confidential so I can't speak about that
but I but I'm glad you're asking the
question I think that's really the key
any other comments or questions please
US dollars yes it helpful
to identify I mean when you talk to
those different parties did you identify
what the different elements or just
address the different ways he's here
when you were talking to the one side no
I mean the beauty of the system is how
easy it is to use right so the my
clients look literally we have four
chairs and I said okay I want you to sit
in this chair and I want to hear your
dreamer talk about this opportunity as
your dreamer you laugh but just wait and
the dreamer comes to this incredible
opportunity and what's gonna become
possible the dreamers very angry and
upset that these guys want to blow up
the deal right a dreamer sees this could
fulfill a vision that the dreamers had
for 10 years right and and we hear from
the warrior and we hear from the thinker
and we hear from the lover and then what
I do often with clients as I might say
okay Sean I want you to stand over here
I'm gonna play back to you just a little
highlight of what each of these parts of
you said and as you stand back and you
can just sort of hear into these
perspectives what's the inner wisdom in
you not attached to any of them you know
what comes up for you about the wise
course of action here that's the stance
of the captain like okay I get it I hear
you guys and I have to decide what is
best and the language is very helpful so
I don't shy away from it because it's
very clarifying and if I say I want to
hear from your lover you you I mean
these possible slight digression but
only for a minute these of course are
based on archetype switch MBTI was also
right for those of you who study young
these are fundamental human patterns
that young believes are just inborn into
the psyche from the moment we arrive
nobody needs you no one needs to teach
you how to have your heart beat no one
teaches you you know to move your lungs
he would say no one needs to teach you
what these forces mean they're inborn
they're in you just like you would know
mother or father before someone taught
it to you or you might know villain and
Savior before someone taught it to you
have any of you guys ever seen a little
girl five or six years old
who
works out a little dance routine that's
like it's like a little shake a little
eyes you're like who are their friends
of this girl okay where are her parents
um she didn't have to learn that it's
inborn right she's gonna grow into the
mature expression of it but it's in her
no one taught that to her probably it's
not like she's watching the wrong TV so
they're inborn in us and the reason why
it's such a quick intervention with
executive teams you know giving it to
employees through a company because once
you get the language you can actually
tap into these quite easily much more so
than may appear to you sitting here now
because there are fundamental forces
that are in US and they have each one of
them carries their own wisdom which is
why it's a shame to you know leave one
or two of them behind in your life
you're missing out on what they have to
offer you he's like oh my god they're
starting till I bring out multiple
chairs I think this is I just suddenly
remembered I had a conference call right
exactly now no no I'm teasing
thanks for coming oh thank god
he's going to his therapist I like to
have that effect on people
morning from my sessions and call
nine-one-one any any other questions or
comments yes it's back and forth between
the transactional which is here's a
situation that you know I'm faced with
yeah there's where I need to be and
here's the way I need to think about it
versus the resilience over a journey
mm-hmm I need to evolve yeah do you
track and I haven't read the book so
apologies if it's in there but yeah get
to that yeah is it is it something that
you talk about have you mapped people on
their journey as to how well they go
into these different personas or
decision-making patterns or when they do
it when they choose not to wear is that
something that that's a great question
it's a great question so the third of
the Transformers is a part I call the
Voyager which is in unique to each of
you what's your voyage but there are
also you know patterns that you can see
so one pattern that is tip
Cole might be you start in your career
as an individual contributor right you
have tasks you're executing in certainly
knowledge companies you're using thinker
and warrior because that's what your job
requires of you to do and then if you're
very good technically you might get
promoted to a managerial position and
you have a few people reporting to you
and now oh my god all right I mean what
would I know about managing people so
the opportunity will almost demand that
you learn about those lover skills
employee engagement inspirational
leadership you know building a powerful
cohesive team you may not have needed
that lover so much when you just you
know had to do your job but now you're
leading a team managers who are
successful also get promoted into
positions of firm-wide leadership right
and now they really need to be able to
access and share the dream as a vision
of our company right they need to be
inspiring people with our imagination
and possibly getting up at annual
meetings right and here's my vision and
for our strategy lover and warrior
aren't going to be very helpful at that
point right even thinker and warrior
aren't going to be helpful even lover
for senior leaders usually isn't enough
right people want to know where are we
going what's the vision why should I
care about that why do I trust that
should follow you because you see where
we're headed and and those kind of
things as well as innovating new
products and services right no shortage
of the dreamer here but in many many
businesses when managers become
executives they have to go on a journey
to remember I haven't been using my
dreamer and so long how does that work
again because it's quite different
imagination intuition sensing you know
what's happening is very different than
the other three so to generalize I think
there are paths that require evolution
and of course everyone has their own
journey those are both true
okay I'm getting the sense because I'm
very in tune and discerning I'm sensing
that we should bring this to a close so
thank you guys so much for coming I
really appreciate the chance to dialogue
with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
