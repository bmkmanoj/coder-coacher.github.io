hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you very much it is delightful to be
here on a sunny day I always feel like I
need to offer people cash rewards for
coming out to a darkened room to hear a
long and surely boring lecture and
especially in this particular week where
sunny days are very welcome I thank you
all for coming so what I want to talk
about today is something that I think is
captured perfectly by this recent quote
from Thomas Friedman in the New York
Times it cuts to the core of a rhetoric
about work and technology and it draws
on this cultural toolkit that just
mishmash ha's together all sorts of
ideas that we have about innovation high
technology and the economy and
especially ideas around risk and that's
really what my talks focused on today
now I would argue that this kind of
cultural toolkit that people are drawing
on does real material damage to jobs and
job policy and it also i would argue
hinders or harms our ability to innovate
and that's really where I'm coming from
now in his column Friedman proposes that
entrepreneurship in this case learning
to make your own job is the best
solution for our way out of a jobs model
so jobs growth is slow we should simply
learn to make our own jobs and
especially in this column he's targeting
he's talking about higher education and
what we need to be doing in higher ed to
prepare the students of the future for
then this brave new economy now it's not
that he's saying we in the United States
need more innovation through more
computer science majors
math majors or engineering majors no we
need to teach students how to innovate
and how to think like innovators and
what is thinking like an innovator mean
well in this kind of framing and the
rhetoric that I'm talking about today
this it is about learning to take and
bear risks if you need a job you should
simply learn how to invent one like this
so this quote is a quote from an
entrepreneur and I spent a lot of time
talking to entrepreneurs and you know
this is the kind of thing that gets
entrepreneurs really excited they they
want to talk about how much they
struggle right how difficult it is to
work in innovation now this wouldn't be
completely out of I see how i'm getting
lots of grants which is good i'm in a
good audience for this um this wouldn't
be completely out of place in on the
business pages but this quote is part of
an article that appeared recently about
the new Cornell tachyon New York City
campus so literally if we want to teach
and create the newest kind of education
in technology what we need to be doing
is bringing in folks like tim nokia oh I
don't know who he is but we need to
bring him in to teach students that you
know what they need to expect at work is
no income no health insurance in the
words of the reporter true entrepreneurs
urge students to take risks but to
expect it first at least a precarious
existence riddled with setbacks that
will require obsessiveness and thick
skin and they made it sound like the
grandest of adventures now how did we
get to this height how did we get to
this point when the best jobs in the
economy and in technology innovation are
framed in this particularly fraught way
that these best jobs are going to go
to people who are hungry thick-skinned
and exhausted and these are the
questions than I address in my book so
this is what I'd like to do today first
I'd like to give them a brief kind of
cultural history of the new economy that
really focuses on how we came to frame
entrepreneurship and innovation as new
so it's a not an expansive I'm not going
to give you a new economy history lesson
but I want to I want to pull from that
history to show really what we what we
culturally did was make a break with
something that happened before and then
I want to do a little bit from my
ethnographic analysis of workers in New
York City's tech industry before during
and after the first calm boom and how
they talked about risk and uncertainty
in their own jobs so using their kind of
language and voice to frame what I'm
talking about and then finally I want to
suggest and bring our conversation
forward to what this means for policy
and for innovation and high-tech sectors
and workers today so start with the
persistent myth of boys in the garage
now what if the challenges of thinking
about innovation is that if you don't
have a garage like this particular
gaming conference didn't you literally
import a garage right that innovation is
located in the in the in the garage and
this myth of the garage and what it
represents of a outsider soul or small
team entrepreneur tech entrepreneur this
myth is particularly strong in
technology innovation Tom Streeter has
called it a romantic myth and by
romantic Streeter means um like Eric
Raymond would say free as in freedom not
free as in beer Streeter would say free
as in a romantic as in Henry David
Thoreau not romantic as in hisses or
roses
and by this he means this myth of the
entrepreneur this myth of the tech
visionary is one that is a struggle for
individual self worth and meaning and an
outward expression of inner reality
that's kind of what we mean by romantic
in this in this literary sense in other
words dream big but be yourself that's
fundamentally a romantic notion to of
apples founders steve jobs in Steve
Wozniak they fit this myth of the
romantic outsider right they they made
they were hobbyists they were outside
even though they were working with an
industry the idea that they created
Apple you know in the garage as a
persistent myth how ever I mosaic has
called Mike Markkula the third founder
who often gets written out of this
history as the most important of the
three how many of you knew that Apple
had three founders yeah Apple had three
founders so one of the reasons we don't
know that is in the decade of Apple's
first in Apple's first decade as a
company there were over 900 articles
written about Steve Jobs about 500
articles written about Steve Wozniak and
87 mentions in all of those articles of
the third founder my coolant now there
are lots of things that he did basically
it is argued by those who have studied
the company that the company wouldn't
have moved and positioned itself without
the season Silicon Valley insider there
at the very beginning of the transition
from creation to company and that the
company would have stayed at least for a
while in the realm of hobbyists rather
than being one of becoming one of the
big war big boys so it's this myth of
the the boy wonder who's out in his
garage is quite persistent and it
contains in it a rhetoric about
innovation and risk-taking let's think
about another one Marc Andreessen now of
course those of you familiar with the
history of Netscape I like to show
this picture just because I love looking
at old pictures of the internet this is
a picture of what Netscape look like in
1997 which is actually not that old I
mean there's older pictures of Netscape
but I love that they're there's there's
there's 200 leading companies have
chosen Netscape in this pigeon so um
Netscape as you all probably know was
the first commercially available
graphical browser for the internet and
it was released in 1994 it was developed
by several folks the one of the most
visible ones was someone who was working
as a work-study student at the National
Center for supercomputing applications
at the University of Illinois Marc
Andreessen but again how few people
connect how quickly and how early on and
how central the role of Jim Clark a
serial entrepreneur who had already
successfully built and sold silicon
graphics which at that point had already
brought us Jurassic Park he put in three
million dollars of his own funding and
that was leveraged by venture capital
very early on but the end of 1995
Netscape had one of the most successful
initial stock offerings up until that
point it was a one point just over a 1
billion dollar offering and the
company's market value doubled in one
day this is historic and I'm in a market
sense as well right not just because
it's a it's the in essence the first dot
com stock was Netscape now compare the
release of Netscape in 1994 to another
event in 1994 in the mid-nineteen
through the 1980s IBM stood as a paragon
of high-tech large company growth it was
the Colossus that works this is a Time
magazine cover from 1993 it was one of
the world's largest corporations at the
time it had revenues of over 64 billion
and it commanded fully a third of the
worldwide computer market but in a
decade it became a symbol of slow sloth
in a big company in 1993 it was listed
as one of the 100 best companies to work
for in America and it's very easy for us
now to see why IBM offered a
historically great benefit benefits
package including a pension that covered
eighty-five percent of every employees
final pay and one of the country's first
work-life balance programs that included
a guaranteed benefits paid three-year
leave of absence so you could no
questions asked you could leave for
three years and come back one of the
authors of this list said people are
respected there and when you come there
to work you expect to work there forever
you're not going to be terminated
abruptly the San Jose Mercury News
called IBM's approach a jobs for life
policy and it was in 1994 that actually
this policy ended at the end of 93 IBM
made the first announcement that they
were going to have layoffs for the first
time in their corporate history those
layoffs took effect in 1994 but the time
the layoffs of that round were over IBM
had cut in half its global workforce
from about 400 thousand employees to
just over 200,000 employees and a fifth
of those laid back came back as
consultants without this generous
benefit practice a package a practice
that became increasingly common in the
90s so that the process of hiring as
consultants and building in that kind of
flexibility into companies really began
in the 1990s now what I do in the book
is I argue that Netscape and IBM really
offer these two very different models of
work so what was at stake in their
historic um fight over what the internet
was going to look like was also a battle
for what the future of jobs would look
like big versus small
and at stake which which was which of
these models would prevail in the new
economy now there's lots that go into
this and really you know these are too
kind of symbols rather than causes there
are institutional arrangements meaning
laws and policies technological
developments and rhetorical cultural
shifts arguments that people make that
made possible a dot-com boom and we can
see the roots I think in the beginnings
of these two how is framed IBM in
netscape represented a spectrum of how
technology was framed in the 1990s it
was at once sure a sure thing stayed and
big stable and young rule-breaking edgy
and the symbol of large bureaucracy
right so you have all of these kind of
ideas cultural ideas competing in one
particular space just just the company
just the company yeah and and actually
that's a great question for us to come
to in in the discussion what does this
mean that products can be innovated
innovative within large companies right
that's that's a whole that's a whole
nother talk that would that would keep
you here until seven o'clock but let's
but let's come back to that in the
discussion so entrepreneurship in
technology was not always a given in
1995 business writer Peter Drucker
worried that the safety and bureaucracy
were being favored over innovation he
said that people will not take jobs even
high tech people he said will not take
jobs in New risky high tech ventures
they prefer the security of a job in a
large established safe company or in a
government agency in an economy that
Spurs entrepreneurship in
innovation those people will keep on
looking for jobs and career
opportunities where society encouraged
them to look in large safe established
institutions so we go in less than a
span of a decade from this kind of idea
that large safe is better coming
straight from one of the foremost
business writers in the country
observing what he saw was a cultural
trend to this idea that we see in
Business Week so this is Business Week
1997 are you ready to make the switch to
high-tech being in high tech according
to this infographic of this little
sidebar and this was a sidebar on jobs
and jobs in this new so-called new
economy at which by 1987 had had yet to
reach its fevered peak this expressly
connects jobs with risk creativity and
entrepreneurship you need to be ready by
being willing to take lower short-term
salaries for the chance of high term
rewards long term rewards now this is
where my study came in I started
studying this first wave of internet
pioneers that emerged in the mid-1990s
and how they talked about risk and
uncertainty in their jobs at the time
career guru tom peters described such
workers as turned on by their work the
work matters the work is cool she is CEO
of her life yeah um don't have like much
higher turnover than tech companies
sorry don't restaurants have much higher
turnover tech companies so like that
should apply also if I gone to work for
less well exactly I mean but so compare
this kind of advice to what people were
saying a jobs for life policy at IBM
right that we went from IBM as a
technology company having very little
turnover
to the discussion at the beginning of
the dot-com boom that technology is a
sector is a sector with high turnover
with low initial salaries with you know
risk rapid change in a less hierarchical
I don't know how restaurant is drawing
on a different population than I p.m.
but IBM and I mean I remember that time
in IBM and startups or were competing
for the same people i am no practicing
serpent edifice offer a job Elias is in
a stable industry if I might add a small
note I mean you're never going to be
seduced by the chance of highly
long-term rewards through stock options
oh I don't know Terrence I you know get
that these these you know calling
calling um minimum-wage workers partners
um you know ok goodbye into their jobs
so so this is partly partly when I'm
trying to unpack I completely agree with
you right that this is this is a
cultural you're thinking exactly along
the right lines this is a cultural move
that doesn't necessarily mean that
technology is risky right there's
there's something else going on that
that I thought was interesting to unpack
what I what I argue is it's um that that
these concepts manifest a changing
cultural relationship to work in which
freedom choice and Brian collectively
point towards an individual experience
structural economic forces and what I
mean by that is that we started to see
collective social phenomenon through
very individual lenses and very
individual eyes let me tell you where I
studied this so um this is who I studied
and why I wanted there's a few good
reasons that New York's growing and new
new media industry and by that really
new internet content companies we're a
great place
look for this um one was there were
really few institutional supports for
this growing industry it was a very
bootstrapped small small company
industry it wasn't it didn't what was
happening on the west coast and happened
in the emergence of the companies around
Silicon Valley had very different kinds
of institutions they had very different
kinds of social networks very different
kinds of funding and funders um there
were mainly a cohort of young workers in
this industry that I studied and these
were workers coming relatively early in
their careers so that their expectations
of what jobs were weren't necessarily
formed by a long career history so they
had really interesting things to say I
argue in the book and finally it was an
intersection of Technology and something
else that in other words what was in
this industry was a notion that what was
being made was not just hardware or
software right you know those folks in
Silicon Valley they just make machines
you know Bui Bui to them um you know
we're the ones actually using those
machines to write the great works of
literature or in the words of Jason
Calacanis who was an industry proponent
is still quite around for those of you
who follow social media entrepreneurs
would you rather have made the camera
that shot shot Citizen Kane or make
Citizen Kane right and so this is this
is a rhetorical move that New York City
industry technology industry made right
we are the artists we are the creators
whatever those silly folks are doing on
the west coast whoo-hoo I mean their
words not mine they're just
technologists right we're something more
so now here's the puzzle
many of awesome many of those I
interviewed for this project really
articulated some degree of the of
ownership in the companies where they
work so unlike fast-food restaurant
workers they really felt like they were
building and part of building something
and yet by 1999 in the height of the
stock market boom for Comstock's forty
percent of people in the New York
industry had some form of equity share
in their companies so you know on the
one hand this was people saying I feel a
sense of ownership on another only there
were most people didn't have any real
equity or chance of equity in their
companies so were they really bad at
making risk/reward calculations are they
you know walking around like Homer
Simpson saying well I take the rewards I
should take the risks I noticed that
they talked about I'll come back to what
I did so what did I do I spent a lot of
time hanging out with people over a
pretty deep period of time from 1996 to
2002 initial interviews were really long
and I interview people multiple times
over that period I also spend a lot of
time going out to calm parties not a
strategy that I would recommend people
while they're in graduate school I got
good at going to parties uh and and then
I spent a lot of time in the archives as
they exist so the historical record of
this period is particularly fragile and
I'd love to talk to you about that and
if it's some fun social network analysis
of 9,000 people at a thousand different
events over time we can talk about that
too so what did they do well I noticed
three kind of broad set
discourses ways that people thought
about risk in their jobs and they really
are summed up in kind of 33 kind of
mottos now people would use i coded
these from the from the interview data
so people would would say them in their
own words but really there was a way of
saying hey this is a you know chance to
make a lot of money you should take a
chance another strategy was well I'm not
really doing anything else I've got
nothing to lose I am you know getting to
make cool stuff in a growing industry
and I have a great job that lets me
continue doing that and it sure beats
you know the temp work that I was doing
for magazines the third kind of strategy
was a strategy that said you know I
really am smarter than this industry and
I'm smarter than the market and I'm
going to figure out how to keep myself
safe and i coded these kind of three
strategies into what I term financial
creative and actuarial and they really
do Co here pretty well across the
interviews right so I went in thinking
that I would find a lot of people
talking about being attracted to working
in small risky startups because they
wanted to make a lot of money and really
that was only about a third of the
people I interviewed two thirds not
split equally were this kind of notion
of a creative worker someone who really
wanted to make and was attached to
create a to products and then someone
who was attached to or wanted to balance
risks across working a career within the
industry so what was at risk and how
they talked about risk in each of these
scenarios in each of these strategies
really depended on what their
orientation was so for example a
financial to give you a concrete example
financial strategy from someone
responded in the book was you know I
hope to make it if I pick the right
company I'll be able to retire
early my dad retires retired he plays
golf I don't want to play golf but it
should be nice to retire early right so
the whole idea of work is if you pick
the right company and you go for it and
the company pays off then you know you
don't have to work again the creative
strategy was one of the great
respondents that I discussed at length
in the book is a woman who actually
built her own website a zine product
that got bought by a major media company
and she said you know the risk for us
was the company could buy it and make it
suck and she fought so she the pentacle
was that she became known as the woman
who made this thing and this thing when
I say major media company there was
television show involved a magazine
involved I mean it was a it was a
multimedia product and after the crash
she and her creative partner spent quite
a bit of time acquiring this product
back because they did not want it to
stop right they rather go dormant then
see it find a life as a corporate shill
product whatever it was and then finally
the actuarial approach was summed up by
guy who in another paper i described
tried to get me to smoke pot with him in
the middle of the afternoon and that's
one of the disadvantages of doing
ethnographic work with the unemployed
he's a guest and some unemployed i
really don't have anybody get stoned
with do you want to get stoned with me
and i was like no i just want an
interview thanks but he said you know
all of these people who went into the
dot-coms thinking that they were going
to be calm millionaires were just naive
of course unlike him who was sitting
there two in the afternoon with nothing
else better to do interviews and smoking
pot um so so actually the investment was
about 20 financial strategy was about
twenty five percent creative was horny
actuarial was about 45 and then these
are their relative entry into the into
the field
and their exits so taken together yeah
yeah that's a great question did they go
to different companies yes they all
worked it they all worked together which
is to say you couldn't predict and you
couldn't predict a particular kind of
company would have just one kind and you
couldn't predict based on jobs so I
interviewed creative directors who were
who fell into this kind of actuarial
approach right so I interview people who
were creative types but they really were
trying to problem solve the problem of
risk and then I met artists fine artists
who actually had this very investment
oriented approach to their careers you
follow them for unja peers in DC whether
they tend to achieve their goals whether
the people so that's great I follow I
have follow-up data on 12 of the 54 so
some of the folks i interviewed towards
the end right so I didn't start
interviewing them in the beginning and
I'm happy at the end of the talk to talk
about a little bit about those 12 I'm
hesitant to say it worked it didn't work
right what I was much more interested in
in the study is taking how people were
thinking about risk and seeing what we
can make of that rather than saying well
actually all the folks who did actuarial
approaches to risk came out better in
their careers that make sense
so so why do that actually leads me to a
great question why do all of this work
now I argue obviously these because this
comparison of strategies actually leads
us to very different cultural percent
very different political implications
right because what we see from data like
this is that people have tightly linked
what it means to be successful creative
and in control of their career to this
idea of risk so it didn't matter really
whether people were talking about an
investment approach to risk a creative
approach to risk or an actuarial
approach to risk what mattered was they
were talking about risk now taken
together I say that this is something we
can call venture labour venture labor I
argue is this expressive explicit
expression of entrepreneurial values in
non entrepreneur in non entrepreneurs
right so it's it's the ways in which
employees articulate their investments
in the companies where they work when
people begin to think of their jobs as
an investment or having a future payoff
other than wages they begin to act as
venture labor now it includes some of
the aspects of what might be called
entrepreneurial work of how people feel
ownership in their companies even when
they're not owners of course the term is
a play on venture capital and I chose
the term deliberately to invoke what
startups need they need people to buy in
to help do the work so people invest
their beliefs in companies and they
invest in many other ways they can
invest through employee retirement funds
agreements to defer some or part or all
of compensation in exchange for options
to buy stock in the future they can
invest time as I saw within the
early internet industry people were
investing time to build their own social
networks as both a hedge against future
possible downturns or losing a
particular job but in the process also
created what Annalee saxenian has called
a regional economy and the process also
created these networks that helped ideas
and information flow through a new
industry so that becomes a resource for
companies to draw on as well skill in
some cases can be a what economists call
a specific investment people can learn
to update their skills or act as
consultants bringing in skills that are
very particular to a company or industry
and now what I argue in the book is that
these trends are at once both continuous
with a larger economic pattern and
they're embedded into a larger economic
context and I'm going to bracket that
for today Richard Sennett has called
this change the culture of the new
capitalism and it replaced a rhetoric of
and an expectation of company loyalty
with venture labor and other forms of
personal responsibilities we move from
having companies espouse a policy of
building internal work forces and
maintaining job ladders to towards
employee risk-taking now what I argue is
people didn't start taking these risks
necessarily because of simply demand
they didn't think that they would become
millionaires they the work as venture
labor meant being exposed more directly
to the economic risk that companies face
without the same possibilities of
protection afforded to capital investors
venture labor and tells risks that are
not distributed equally distributed
neatly accounted or directly compensated
the risks that ordinary employees take
to continue with this investment minute
metaphor are not as portable easily
diversified or fungible as financial
assets
now there's a couple of theoretical
implications for this one of the the
implications that I want to point out in
the time remaining is that I argue that
perceptions people's perceptions really
change markets this is a bit of a debate
in sociology and economic anthropology
at the moment where a strong program of
social construction has taken form right
so markets are what we make them and
really what I want to do is push back on
that a bit and say that there is a real
process that is co constitutive of
market construction and rational action
that needs to be understood in tandem
and media framing plays into both of
those things so as hacker Jacob hacker
has argued the shifting of risk towards
individuals in the US and other Western
economy has mean has meant that risk is
on the workers not shared between
companies and workers and he asks he
says I can't understand why people do
this but my question really is why have
people been so willing to accept this
risk and some of the answer is risk was
made attractive through these kind of
cultural moves that were made right the
joost van loon has argued that some of
the risk some of the discussions and
risk in political talk and media
discourse are autopoietic that is as you
discuss risk people become more aware of
risk and therefore it makes things this
gear that it remakes society that social
order gets gradually eroded when you
when you have these kinds of framings
and discussions of risks so what then
survives in the words of my co-editors
what then survives the new economy
in addition to political and economic
changes that that happen that help bring
about a new economy there were new ways
of talking about risk and it's in these
new ways that we come to see that the
notion of this entrepreneur this lone
entrepreneur really begins to do damage
to the ways in which we think about what
is innovative in the economy economic
geographer Nigel thrift has put it it's
part of the romance of the era right
he's used the phrase again of exciting
interesting risky new jobs in a rapidly
growing field not the financial rewards
that attract people to work in
entrepreneurial startups so why does
this matter I would argue that the
culture of the era meant people really
internalized a message that taking risks
was desirable and in turn helped to both
justify and internalize a lack of
economic security throughout their
throughout their jobs and throughout the
economy so that the idea innovate or Die
really has become a bit of a mantra and
I argued that we could have seen this
come in any industry it's historically
deeply rooted in this shift that
happened towards post industrialism but
it has profound implications for what we
think of as great jobs it has profound
implications for what we think of as
innovation and I think that it's
something that needs to be continued to
be addressed and tackled as we go
forward so because you know workers are
going to keep getting younger and
younger the technology education is
going to get started ever earlier and we
need to certainly begin thinking about
how we can assure good jobs for the
future with that I would love to open
the floor up for questions
so really interesting stuff and you know
what are the things I always wonder
about in our analysis of the problem the
pressures of capitalism right and
neoliberalism and and people are getting
tricked into these risky jobs and
trading for the excitement of the
entrepreneurial world for you know no
health insurance and no salary and
overworked and not being paid for
overtime and and all of that and you
often come back to the question of you
know well how we to evaluate it right I
mean isn't it is this solar you know
this is this still a little better than
I don't know the sweatshops or something
I mean because the promise of something
seems to be there and maybe the promise
is a lie most of the time or it's more
like the lottery than it's like a job I
guess there's that but I that's why I
always you know I read that I don't know
reviewing papers that are always
criticizing the old liberalism and and I
agree it's a problem but how do we go to
the next place I guess that's fine
that's a cool that's a great think how
do we go to the next place okay I'll
tell you how we don't go to the next
place um so in one of my first job talks
fresh out of graduate school I had one
of America's most famous marks a
sociologist sitting in the room I shall
remain he or she shall remain nameless
and he or she said to me isn't this just
false consciousness meaning shouldn't we
simply go around a program of
re-education of technology workers and
tell them that they are balance of risk
and reward system how loopy that's not
the right way to go about it right so so
this this idea I frankly I think we have
to throw out notions of exploitation and
begin something new and different and
that new and different looks like
supporting workers
I were I'm making a policy would say you
want to support innovation you have to
support people to be innovative and if
that means working in small untried
industries and small untested companies
make it so that they don't lose their
shirts if they lose their jobs or lose
their health insurance is government
support well it depends right so we with
some colleagues I've actually done some
cross cultural analysis right and the
ways in which entrepreneurship looks in
Scandinavian countries is very different
because people don't stay right they
don't they don't have to worry about not
having health insurance and they don't
have to worry about being unemployed
being unemployed is not it's not a great
thing for anybody but it's not a
drastically terrible thing so who is
allowed to come to the table for
innovation looks very different in those
scenarios Jennifer Steinitz so as you
look at the workers who are looking at
you know the cool startups versus the
state companies I would argue that for
some people in technology what what the
choice was and still is is is academia
versus the startup then with you know
these these big companies weirdly in the
middle and mostly dismissed because
they're usually the worst of all worlds
though I would argue that in this case
that isn't true but but usually you know
you're looking at an academic job as
well it's good because its stability and
creativity so that's I mean right as i
as i talked to graduate students coming
up their stability and creativity versus
kind of a faster creativity and a risk
but not yes but but again one one of the
lessons and this is perhaps it's it's
really interesting because people all
the time when i'm giving this talk you
know say things like but you're an
academic
isn't that one of the safest jobs ever
to which you know anyone who has seen as
a ten post-tenure is one of the safest
jobs ever and and those jobs are getting
in some fields getting fewer and farther
between what's what's interesting is to
think about ecologies where that looks
different right so joining a startup in
Silicon Valley where fully and I always
get the number wrong but I want to say
something like thirty percent in San
Mateo County work in technology simply
you have multiple choices right you have
multiple options you know whereas if
you're working in other cities where
there aren't those kind of options given
a downsize or layoffs you would have a
harder time finding a job so so there's
so there are different ways to think
about stability right one of the things
that I rail about in the book is this
notion that big can't be creative right
so one of the overwhelming rhetorics
that came out of the dot-com era was
this idea that any place with carpet and
central air walls you know any place
that wasn't aloft that you had to go up
through a rickety fire hazard staircase
was a place that was an uncreated place
to work and I think that's one of the
other key ways that we can think about
what it makes to what it means to make
good jobs now is to start to tackle that
question building on comparison where
with academia and Jacobs comparison with
restaurants maybe there are it seems a
lot of kinds of professions or career is
where where some of the same thing that
you people are accepting terrible
conditions and high risk in exchange for
possibly higher words and maybe saw some
romanticism are prevalent very sorry
academia as one is the
Mandy's right so you get your PhD in
English art history or you you have a
low chance of ever getting a tenured job
in your lifetime how can you how can
anyone say this is not risky right or or
publishing or or politics you know have
been tour organizer which the Obama
campaign in 2008 this with their
full-time job and and you know if ya yes
McCain wins and like what do you do for
your next job right hey right right
what's what's what's specific to
entrepreneurship for our technology
entrepreneurship so um I think it's only
specifically um readily visible right
and it was where I studied it was like
shooting fish in a barrel so once once I
began framing out this idea of venture
labor I'm beginning to see it in many
places certainly in cultural industries
we've long had a tradition in media of
as William Goldman's as you're only as
good as your last project right this
idea of project-based work where the
market reception for the product is
really tightly tied to how people's own
individual salary or worth the scene so
yeah I don't I don't think it's I think
I don't think I think we I think we
actually see the rise of a workforce
willing to work in comms as a response
to larger economic changes that are
going throughout the economy not not
simply it's it's happening in this morn
entrepreneurship listen perspective that
people are being fooled into into taking
excessive risks or the word man to
sizing too much for our own collective
good is this equally if I understand you
right yeah no of the other fields or the
more or less oh no I would actually say
there's something else so I don't think
there's a bit of trickery tomfoolery or
false consciousness going on right I
think people are making pretty good
choices they're doing them in different
ways
but these are you know let's let's be
honest in the in the recession of the
mid-1990s when the first wave of dot-com
pioneers in New York City were building
these companies they really were
inventing their own jobs I mean they
were under employed they were
under-inflated folks so did the fact
that they might be unemployed in six
months seemed like a big risk it seemed
like not a risk at all did the fact that
they might be unemployed in six months
also keep out a lot of potentially
really interesting folks who could have
been a part of that innovation including
some business expertise that might have
helped grow companies to a stable place
yeah I probably did okay just a Tulsa
games on that I think part of what makes
this different is that the cultural
mythology around this industry in
particular is so dominant and it's
pitched as where America's innovation is
coming from it's all in the center or if
I think what you say is true that very
similar patterns can be seen in other
workforces but this one has a very
particular kind of cultural waiting
which makes it really interesting to see
these logics player but the question
they had for you generous thinking of
you can hear about people like Andrew
Ross's work and no collar for example
studied very similar groups at around
the same time as you and thinking about
whether there is some relationship
between organized labor adventure labor
other to essentially anathemas is there
some are we near future where this kind
of venture labor is going to be
organized into some kind of room type
structure given the way that we also
1920s and 30s and what happened in terms
of post-recession economies we slower
growth hormones did I plan you you could
you could pay me 50 later so um so
that's actually what we do in this
edited collection my co-editors on this
small collection are both union
organizers and traditional media
companies and what we set out to do was
basically asked what can big unionized
media industries learn from this growing
new media workforce and vice versa
and and we frame I'm being recorded I'm
we fry realized they're things that i
can say i will say later um we we frame
a labor history of the united states in
the beginning and in the introductory in
concluding chapters of that book that
basically says we have to change unions
in this country now now that we're at
private sector unionization of six
percent in the United States I mean I
think unionism in the United States is
for all it has been called over the only
place where it is still a viable option
is in public sector so the question then
will then remain can what's what is a
post Union world going to look like a
minute seeds okay so maybe this
my experience by graduated 2003
basically worked through pretty much
some form of recession ever since I
graduated what do you think are the big
stable industries because to me this is
just like what life is like now for
workers like everybody kind of has to do
this like used to think that like
lawyers and doctors maybe but now like
all of the law firms kind of my own work
to do in the book that was very
interesting I mean a huge thing to
shattered in like weeks I would love to
turn the question back to you what do
you and your friends what does your
cohort thing is a good job now of course
Microsoft of course Microsoft Research
oh this is interesting because my actual
my labor history is advertising and
creative industries right so I mean I
guess I don't I mean this is the thing
cuz I've been thinking about this and
for me it then don't like you know
relatively late entrant into the
academia career path I mean that doesn't
even seem stable to me you know like
that doesn't mess I'm not like oh yeah
I'm heading into you know I just talked
with my friends about this i mean the
company man just doesn't really exist
anymore i think for anybody right and so
i don't i don't know maybe maybe being a
doctor but even that is incredibly
difficult especially if you're going
into private practice and even n even
doctors now would argue yeah i mean i
think this is this is part of what is
that is part of what i'm trying to do in
the book is to say that these larger
economic shifts have happened and yet
what I saw in this cohort of young
workers was a way in which they talked
about risk and uncertainty as their own
problem something they needed to figure
out they needed to find the right jobs
they needed to solve the right they
needed to find the surefire product that
would make their career they needed to
find the you know the company that was
going to hit it big
discourses in general sort of the whole
for ratio Alger story self-sufficiency
and all of that because I mean I
certainly feel like my career's my
responsibility as violently even if it
is a societal problem like i stopped so
like ultimately but if you were 20 years
older ratio Alger would still have
happened but that wouldn't be what you
were hearing about yeah you would have
heard a different you would have heard
something different you would have heard
in the well or or 40 years old 40 years
or 40 years would have heard something
totally so the Graduate right oh you
know a young college graduates
struggling to figure out how to be self
actualized plastics oh that's the future
we're getting close to at a time but I
have seen a couple of hands Kate well I
was going to suggest if we would like to
to move to the next room we have snacks
and drinks and we continue to have
conversations and ask you know lots of
questions but I would just like to stop
here his horses thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
