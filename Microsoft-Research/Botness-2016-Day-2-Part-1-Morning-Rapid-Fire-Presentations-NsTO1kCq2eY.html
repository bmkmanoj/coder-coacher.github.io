six speakers time you teach we're going
to just do rapid-fire presentations and
then all six speakers will be up here
and answering questions and the theme of
this morning's talk will be about
developer ecosystem / developer tools
and a little bit of a different
perspective from each each one of us
this morning
it's full now my progress bar is full
is mr. did your slide Stan all right
Dan's going first no slides so please
just write down your questions and then
we're it's going to rapid fire
presentations and at the end will hold
its answer questions all in the front
morning everybody I'll try and keep it
high energy and moving quickly and yeah
we'll do questions at the end so my name
is Dan Driscoll I'm a developer at
Microsoft Research we publish the bot
framework I can tell you about what the
bot framework is but you have web
browsers you can just go to the website
and you can see it and so I'm going to
talk a little bit about the services
that we include in there and why and I
think the why is the more important
piece why you'd want to put these
services in a bot so to start out with
let's think about some of the bots that
we're familiar with right we know of
like chatty bots that seem like they
have a lot of magic in them and we can
almost like put those into one category
and then you can also think about really
simple bots-bots-botswana intelligent
bots at the other end and I think this
spectrum where we have simple bots on
one end and intelligent bots on the
other end is a bit of a myth that this
spectrum even though I may exist is not
actually all that important and I don't
want you to think about bots as being
simple or intelligent the reason why I
think this think about the interactions
that you have with people day to day and
think about you know you have deep
emotional connections with your friends
and colleagues where you have share a
lot of context with them and they have
like sometimes they will have authority
to act on your behalf um you may also
have transactional interactions with
people who you only interact with for 30
seconds or more right folks like you
know when you're buying a coffee or wait
staff at a restaurant you have
transactional interactions and you have
more emotional interactions but in both
cases these are intelligent interactions
and I think BOTS can be the same way if
you imagine what people would were like
if they were like the bots that we have
right now you would go to a you know a
coffee shop and if it was your first
time in a particular coffee shop and you
had a question about something on the
menu they would say I'm sorry I can't
help you
or if you were writing transit in a city
that you have never been to before and
you you know got on the bust and had a
question the bus driver would be able to
you know let you on the bus but if you
had a question they wouldn't be able to
help you out so I think intelligence is
something we should put in all bots and
that intelligence isn't like this magic
a I you know magic chat pod stuff its
individual things to solve its
individual features to solve individual
problems and the Microsoft bot framework
has a lot of tools to do this we have
cognitive intelligence tools so that if
your user type something in in a way
that you didn't expect we can correctly
classify that if you have like hashtags
that committee need to break those apart
we have tools for that it's not this
magic a I sprinkle that you put all over
everything its individual purpose built
tools and and Ben's gmail so I think
that was kind of my rapid-fire
high-level pitch for I think why you
should think about putting a I in every
single pot that's out there not just the
ones that are full up artificial
intelligence that all bots should be
intelligent and I think that our tools
are great but honestly like the ones
from IBM are fantastic the runs from wit
that they are fantastic look at them and
find the ones that work for you and if
there are some of ours from the
Microsoft bot framework and the
cognitive services teams let me know and
I want to make them better so I think
that's that's it for me are you ready to
go now not yet we're gonna hold
questions until all six are done right
thank you Dan I think what I just want
to echo what Dan just said like none of
no one of the tools that you will
probably see today or any of the things
that we've built is like the
comprehensive solution this is going to
be something that you have to compose
your own solution for so definitely like
try all these different things different
approaches so I'm gonna just talk really
quick about bot kit the thing that by
built and is powering some of the more
successful bots out there right now i'm
ben Brown I run how da I it's a slack
bot and bot building tool this is a
quote that I made up you know BOTS
should be making but should be fun and
easy and not not too technical I think
that that's you know
important thing like the people who
build bots are not all going to be hard
core software engineers or AI people
they're coming from web development or
mobile app development and things like
that so you know I you know and I think
we have an opportunity for to sort of
improve the way these things are made so
that's why we built bought kid you know
I just want lots of bots out there I
want bots to be ubiquitous sohbat kit
you know really what we look we focus on
with pocket is like can you get your bot
up online on slack or on facebook or on
you know twilio or kick and things like
that very very quickly so you're talking
to your like magical you know robot
friend like that's the the coolest thing
that you can do and I think we're fairly
successful we get tweets like this all
the time like you know you know this guy
they had a job just just started coding
and he's like two months in using bot
kit you know building building bots you
know people are like saying like oh I
have so much fun doing this stuff like
it's a JavaScript framework you know
these people are that they're talking
about they're having have fun and then
there's like tons and tons of stuff out
on medium and all over the place that
are like example apps in bot kit and
like how to do bot kit stuff so there's
a lot a lot of resources out there
already for pocket so you can build box
right now with for slack facebook and
twitter IP messaging and here's hear the
details so you can just npm install bot
kit you can get you can clone it from
github there's a ton of example code in
the repo that will like literally you
just get a token from slack run this app
it's online same thing for facebook and
aunt Willie oh so this is how we how we
basically boil it down right BOTS do
basically three things they here
triggers that could be like a pattern or
it could be an event or can be you know
file being uploaded they reply to
messages so simple replies like I say hi
the bot says hi and then they conduct
conversations you know multiple messages
questions and questions and answers
going back and forth so you know to do
that you know it seems fairly simple but
like to do that you have to do all of
these things before your bot comes on
right and each platform is very slightly
different and kind of a pain in many
ways to get these things started for
example twilio has like five different
API tokens that you need to get before
you can you know get your thing online
you have to configure all the stuff blah
blah blah so vodka takes care of all
that stuff you know it provides the web
server it provides the web hook end
point it does the OAuth it does the
dealings with the api's it provides
tools for pattern matching it has
plugins to tie into you know wit da I
and Lewis and API de AI for natural
language it does all of that stuff and
sort of moves it into the background so
the developer can focus on you know
building a user experience and building
you know application that they want to
build so this is like a hello world bot
kit app and this is like the most
verbose setting because this is twilio
with his five keys so like that's all of
the code you run this app it's online
it's talking to twilio and sending
receiving messages just a hello world
thing here but you know you can see that
it's it's fairly straightforward and and
like so I'm just going to dive into a
couple of these little things so BOTS
but like I said BOTS hear things so in
in Pocket we have a here's function and
you pass in the thing that it hears and
that can be a set of patterns it can be
intense that you want to match it can be
any any matter of things and then
there's the second parameter there is
like what type of message that is so
message received is basically any
message you can also have like in slack
you could have a direct message you
could have a mention like at BOTS so and
so you can have things like ambient
messages which are messages that are not
directly to the bot and that's it so you
build your here's pattern and now the
bot is going to respond to those things
you see none of the other messages that
don't match these patterns you don't
have to deal with them which is
particularly important in slackware you
receive a fire hose of messages so oh
and then so there you can see reply so
the bot replies to that message right so
I somebody said something and the bot
says got it in this example very very
simple
here's an example of this conversation
so I'm a message comes in the same thing
right somebody said something and we're
going to start a conversation say oh
hello what is your name and there's an
ask function so what does that do it
like sends the message and then waits
for the person to respond and instead of
having to deal with that response and
connect it yourself to the question that
you asked for but many of the pit seen
people who organized this are involved
in our event call talk about it's a
two-day series of talks from Bob makers
and people who are enthusiastic about
bots and a day of workshops where we're
going to get really really technical
about this stuff we have some super
awesome speakers including the founders
of active buddy which are which was
about from the early aughts one of whom
is going to be here today people from
purple people from pull-string Darius
Kazemi who's a Twitter bot maker and you
know about 15 other people and we'd love
to if you guys want to talk talk to me
we have a submission form on our website
talk about a I that's it
good morning good morning went to start
at the top so I my name is my name is
Rob I work on superscript as's i work at
slack and on superscript this is a
passion project since about 2013 so
there's a lot of people writing bots and
this is just another way of doing it so
how do you is another great platform and
this is very similar in a lot of
respects and I'll just kind of walk
through some of the basic stuff and then
we'll call today we get back to writing
bots so superscript is a multi-platform
dialogue management creating tool for
building conversational interfaces and I
built it because natural language read
natural language is hard so this is like
a common trigger and a lot of systems
under the hood what they'll do is
they'll take your input and then they'll
basically build a regular expression or
you have to supply regular expression
but building regular expressions is not
easy so in this case the word natural is
optional there's also the star so means
anything before this is fine we want to
see language is in either hard or tough
so right to write the regular expression
you've got to kind of do something like
this so in this case there's word
boundary detection there's optionals you
got to deal with maybe there's more
input at the end maybe that's required
maybe it's not all of these blocks are
actually non capturing with the
exception of the last one so I want to
get tough or hardback and know what that
is so maybe I could put that into my
reply later on down the road there's
also so much more to just building a bot
you need to be able to normalize your
input and superscript does that so
there's over 1700 different words that
we convert from Commonwealth English to
us english we also you know fix all all
of the concatenation there's thousands
and thousands of common typos we take
care of all of that even before the
input comes in and even after the input
comes in we end up doing some parsing on
it so if anyone's familiar with with
natural language processing their their
stemming and you can either just put
like a like a porter summer or a
lancaster stemmer on the end
put to remove the inflections but that's
actually pretty aggressive because you
end up with words that aren't actually
words so we go one step up and limit
eyes the entire input so it basically it
brings it back to something that's
that's actually usable and you end up
getting better matches so here's an
example of a conversation so this is
essentially the first one is if I see
anything I want to reply so the minus is
a key word that means just reply with
this what is your favorite color and
then on the next line there's like any
input that comes in any one word that
comes in and if the last thing said was
what is your favorite color I'm going to
reply with the actual color captured
from from here and say it's my favorite
color too so I mean this is a very
simple example of just like writing
actually using something that someone
familiar with writing a natural language
and then it actually works and it'll
handle like is it all the inflections
all of the other hard stuff is kind of
taken care of moving on sorry natural
scroll it's the system is very
extensible so we have a concept of
plugin and there's a very rich plug-in
architecture because we're using nodejs
everything is asynchronous so in this
case I'm actually calling out to a
function that looks at the weather and
it takes the assuming is the city
passing it into this function to look up
the weather and then you've got
essentially a note or a javascript file
somewhere else on your system that will
process and they'll call it essentially
anything in node land so any sort of NPM
modules available to you and again it's
asynchronous you can go and get the
weather you can do a database lookup
what's going to cool is inside these
functions the this operator so the
actual object itself the scope you have
that a user object so the user that said
this you have a very rich set of
information about who they are when the
lot was the last thing they said was
lost 15 things have said the last things
they match there's there's topics as
well where they've navigated to and from
as well as the message itself so the
message that we get in here is not
necessarily just a string it's actually
a very rich object with
we do parts of speech tagging on it we
do so light parsing we have multiple
different forms and we'll pull out some
entities like the names the nouns to
verbs all that good stuff and then we
call out to the service and then reply
back and at the end of the day there's
also states so you can get into some
really complicated things for example if
you want to be able to save a user's
name it's as simple as just calling a
function not to do that and it stores it
for later on and then as well you can
you can get and recall these things as
well there's a it's a triple store built
in so if you want to do more complicated
not just key value but subject verb
object graph style knowledge extraction
and knowledge fulfillment you can do
that as well and that's going to all
built in using level graph which is part
of the Google one of Google's tools
basically anything you want to do you
can probably do it with super script
thanks Jess thanks buddy alright I've
got a really slick super polished
presentation here in the form of
markdown file alright so I got to talk
about serverless slack lot people been
talking about serverless thing for a
little while and I think it's
interesting so we've seen these big
ships can you guys see this at all no I
didn't think so is that better
one more I'm losing my eyesight to its
cool then your computer is weird they're
good ok so we've seen these things
happen and we'd like to think the
messaging is going to be a thing I hope
it's a thing I'm betting on it and we're
seeing all these different terms but
what we're talking about is BOTS and
BOTS effectively are this ephemeral
agent that acts on your behalf it
doesn't have to be this long form
conversational thing and part of the
reason this is interesting is because
we're getting these platforms and all
these platforms share an interesting
characteristic in that they're
effectively web hooks slack hipchat
messenger and telegram kick whatever so
it's kind of like a pendulum in the 90s
we were really stoked on servers because
of the web in the early 2000s we were
stoked on clients because JavaScript
became possibly acceptable to use on the
client the Google Maps mid-2000s api's
became big deal we swung back to the
server around 2007 mobile became a big
deal when we got back on the client and
now we're writing servers again bots are
just freaky web servers which is kind of
interesting so simultaneously the
smallest unit of compute has become a
function and this is really significant
the metaphor that we've used in the
cloud up to this point has been a server
which kind of makes no sense when we're
scaling we end up having a whole bunch
of these things behind a web behind a
load balancer and you know it's it's a
pain to scale so the cloud came along
and with the cloud we've got these ideas
of lambda functions and it's
accelerating if you look at this thing
on the side we're getting more and more
of these things as time goes on
functions are cheap you get about a
million requests per month for free so
let that sink in it's free to do
computing now it's kind of big deal I
totally don't understand Microsoft's
pricing by the way to talk to someone
about that so I'm working I think I'll
begin we chose lambda we didn't choose
because we think it's better we chose it
because it was easy and accessible I
think you would be fine to choose any of
these solutions if you're interested in
them so i recommend you actually try
them all people think that they're you
know
exciting thing is that compute just got
free the exciting thing to me is that
not so much that's free to do this
because there's always a business case
to build a server excited thing to me is
that my deployment time is now in
seconds so let that one sink in so right
now if I want to deploy a new bot
instance it takes me roughly three to
five seconds that's a huge accelerant to
market that's unheard of up to this
point this is a competitive advantage
for your team and this means that BOTS
actually have an advantage over
traditional delivery vehicles for
software so yeah that's really all I had
to talk about lots of freaky web servers
except for you don't need to run a
server anymore thanks everybody huh Iver
from kick so I'm going to start off not
with the slides my bad and just talk a
little bit about kind of our history
with bots so we started with a promoted
chats system about three years ago and
the the take on that was we checked out
these official accounts so we're like Oh
brands one presence on messaging so we
created this presence we're a brand
would go to a website put in some
strings put its responses and we
launched it so we had really simple
simple BOTS launched and we know there
was definitely a attraction to to the
idea and brands you'll gravitate towards
it so we launched it got some good
exposure but then usage sucked because
it was you know there was no dialogue
and about two years ago Ted our CEO took
the initiative and said look we gotta do
something a little more powerful and we
created a platform first use internally
and which we launched early April and
the idea there was you know Ted 12 just
double down and said that promote chats
as just you know broadcast messages to
users is just wasn't going to cut it and
we needed to kind of innovate have
innovate
should happen elsewhere so that's why he
built the he started the buck platform
initiative and our approach there has
been um for us particular has been
entertainment BOTS because teenagers are
a main audience and I can't wait for the
the session the afternoon I think the
reason why a lot of developers here
today and nice today are asking like why
art wise like Microsoft here and slack
and kick and now Facebook like why are
they all here shouldn't they be like in
there you know trenches and competing
against each other the main reason i
think is because the reason we're all
here we're all looking for killer
experiences and we don't we don't want
to have the environment built with just
these broadcasting bots that nobody
likes and so that's the reason I'm here
and that's the reason why I think a lot
of you are here and yeah all right so
why kick there's probably not a lot of
you unless you're thirteen to twenty
three years old that use kik but the if
you have a nephew or niece they probably
do you use kik so some of our aggregate
stats are you know we're really teenager
focus so seventy percent of our user
base is thirteen to twenty three year
olds so if you're you know if you're
bought bought you're applying to make is
within that demographic please talk to
me and my partner sergio and we'd be
happy to help you out so what makes
teenagers different than the rest of us
when they use messaging the main thing
is there they just very chatty so 65
messages on average per day and they
spend a lot of time on their phones we
ran an internal survey with our users
and forty-two percent of them said they
want a direct conversation with their
brands and we're definitely seeing that
in our engagement and retention numbers
what's really worked well is
and a brand or a movie studio creates a
character that users can resonate and
feel like they're having a conversation
with so just like all the other positive
reasons people have talked about box
this morning same thing with the kick
ecosystem so in case anyone hasn't tried
to playing a button kick it's pretty
much the same process you know send and
receive API probably one thing that we
have like slack has is a we do have a
curated pot shop so would you what you
would do is you would create the bot
test it and then you would submit it for
approval in the bot shop and eat for
testing internal testing there is no
approvals but if you want in the bot
shop it goes through a editorial process
and will increase your discoverability
by having it approved these are some of
the best practices we've had since
building this for about a year
internally and if a couple months
externally the authentic make it easy so
we try to for for the AI BOTS which we
don't have a lot of most of our BOTS we
try to tell our developers as the best
practice to shell buttons and suggest
the responses even though it feels on it
may sound like it's ivr like but it's um
it's not because the experience was kind
of talking to a bot and having a
pre-populated canned response it feels
conversational in the in the
context of suggest responses
that's it I just emailed the
presentation see if it shows up here so
I'm Mike before I found her a beep boop
which is a platform for hosting slack
and messenger BOTS we're focused on
developers and giving developers the
freedom to build BOTS as they want so we
launched BOTS as containers we autoscale
those containers we handle like key and
token management and continuous
integration continuous delivery similar
to like a Heroku type experience or even
like the lambda timeline you do a get
push we build and rapidly auto deploy
your bought within seconds so what I'm
going to talk about today actually so
this is me again beep boop so slack and
messenger bots some of these slides may
look different cuz I just realized I
don't have the fonts on Ben's computer
so we'll see how that turns out and
again we launched BOTS as containers so
as developers you can bring whatever
framework whatever language you want and
we'll build and deploy your code and so
but I want to talk about beep boop want
to talk about something a little bit
different and that we're always
challenged with this idea the Box need
to be intelligent and the expectations
that were held to is these BOTS need to
be really intelligent her users get
really frustrated when they're not
intelligent and i think you know i love
this quote from yong lacuna who made
this comment after the Alpha go
occurrence where he basically said if
intelligence was a cake and if
unsupervised learning was the cake and
supervised learning was the icing on the
cake and reinforced learning was the
cherry we can make we can't make the
cake like we can make the icing and the
cherry but we can't even make the cake
like in reality and so the expectations
that people have and even we're putting
on ourselves and what everybody else is
saying that should happen with bots like
we can't even make the cake and so this
is real like you're a I chopped bout
that's supposed to be this spaceship
this amazing spaceship and everybody
when they have a chat bot they put AI
before it they're like my my AI chat bot
is really like this cart with bicycle
wheels that looks like it's been sitting
in a yard for 42 years maybe it's it's
close to that and so maybe we're just
doing it wrong like we're thinking about
these things in the wrong way and so I'd
like to encourage us to kind of start to
think differently about these things and
so Arthur Kessler in the ghost in the
machine coined this term called a hole
on which was concept of something that
was simultaneously apart and a hole that
was autonomous and self-reliant and had
a degree of Independence but could
participate sort of in a network of
things but handle contingencies without
higher authority etc and so with that in
mind if you take you know this is common
use case of here's this body doesn't
even give you the weather he just gives
you the temperature all right and what's
here you have a user that asks in
natural language for the temperature in
the bottle respond to the temperature
and what is oops my fonts are gone so
you can't see my bolt highlighting but
what's significant here is you know we
do basic intent matching and the
extraction to say you're looking for the
temperature at this particular time at
this particular place and the bot
responds with some pleasantries but
basically with the temperature and so if
you take a step back and say well what
if it wasn't a human asking that in
natural language achat perspective what
if what if it's just another body and we
kind of flipped the script right so we
say that our BOTS need to understand
natural language but we respond in
language as well and so what if the bot
asks the question of what the
temperature is and maybe in a more
structured way that's actually easier to
understand uncen you could conceivably
see that you could have some BOTS and
this one's name the task for what the
temperature is and the bot responds and
he does you know Nou on the response and
parses out the temperature super simple
use case though and let's say we want to
do something a little bit more involved
or interesting which is just like I want
to ask the bot just hey do something
because I think we focus so much on the
conversation with bill box so we
miss the fact that you know BOTS can be
these great things that are like sight
unseen I think like the best
conversation you could have is the one
that you don't have to have and we focus
so much in the conversation I want BOTS
to do things for me that I don't have to
talk to unless it's really important or
high-value so what if I ask the bot to
say hey tell me when I should just dress
for the weather like watch out for me be
my agent and do that for me you got it
Candace and then some time later the bot
says yo Candace don't forget your
umbrella today we can say well how did
how did how did um no this and how could
we actually build this and just so
here's a thought experiment so what if
we have this back channel and we have
these multiple bots in the back channel
and one is called Cal and colleges
chimes in every time Candice has an
appointment upcoming for the day and
like oh look Candice has a meeting is
meeting your brother for lunch in the
mission today and Tempe sees that and
sees the location is like oh wait the
temperature in San Francisco around
lunch time is going to be 64 degrees and
we have yet another Bob that's that's in
this back channel that sees that and
goes up there's an eighty-five percent
chance of rain today in San Francisco
something's happening in San Francisco
they're just reacting to what's
happening in this channel and responding
and um goes oh wait San Francisco chance
of rain I better tell Candace that she's
going to need her umbrella and then she
messed his Candice to say yo Candice
bring your umbrella today thank you
you're the best right and that happened
by this sort of riddle composition of
things happening in this back channel
and you can see you know other things
could just sort of happen as well but
it's I like to refer like think about
this is kind of this ticker tape right
and if you remember the old ticker tape
stock quotes getting printed and if a
channel is like a ticker-tape you could
have both BOTS observing and humans
observing or writing and observing to
the ticker tape so anybody could write
to this tape and it's just this history
that's happened right so bots in people
and so this the example I gave was just
bots in a channel but you could think
about what a human can jump into that
channel as well and it's actually the
way that we're building the inner
workings of beep boop we're building
we're out but we don't have any
administrative UI and we're building all
of administrative functions as little
box
go and do things we can iterate is or we
could sort of integrate and talk to
those BOTS especially when we don't have
functions that humans do at the moment
we talked to bots and trigger things and
then we figure out what language works
and how it works and we were starting to
add bots to do things that we're doing
like generating invoicing at the end of
the month and so you know this is maybe
what that looks like is I can just just
these um and talks to it one very
specific things does sort of Helana core
like monadic of like does one thing and
do it one thing well button behind of
this is sort of chaos that's happening
and reacting and then so if you could
let yourself assume that that's possible
you know then even you know greater and
greater more complex things can be
created out of composition of this style
of development and you know I go back to
Marvin Minsky who wrote in the Society
of mine and talks about intelligence
that we're trying to create this it's
it's not this one thing it's not like
the intelligent AI Siri chat bot that
can do everything answer every question
for me under every scenario it's not any
one trick but it really stems from this
vast diversity and not like one single
perfect principle and so back to you
know Kessler with his idea of this whole
on that if we think of these BOTS
potentially the chair of these channels
on talk to each other that we under
forming these like synaptic networks or
these these whole are keys of bots that
communicate with each other which is
like what the like are you kidding me
right like this is either like
terrifying or absolutely ridiculous it's
very it's potentially very brittle it
brings all sorts of questions about
privacy and like where they have
first-party data third-party data etc
right now we're expending experimenting
with this and it's actually been a lot
of fun it's been interesting very much
in a first-party way in our own trusted
channel and in addition you have to be
aware of things like the left pad bot if
any news familiar with happened a few
months ago in the node community there
but anyway we're sort of on this journey
we're building beep boop as a way for
people and developers to be able to
build and share BOTS and we think it's
really interesting and
what to do so join us on the journey
we've got kind of a long way to go so
thanks everybody so we're going to
answer questions so just just a quick
run through we had me for microsoft
research and the bot framework team
who's after me there was Ben was in here
yeah ben Brown from howdy I've are
talked about kick Mike you talked about
beep boop just now Rob talked about
superscript from slack right Brian
talked about server low spots and for
your name got your from gupshup that's
right yes so any questions for all of us
or individuals second row our third row
sorry
oh yes hey anyone want to jump in yeah
so so the most advanced part on the gup
shup platform so we working with sage
sage is a global accounting software
company kind of like into it so they're
launching an income and expense capture
reporting and so on essentially
accounting software one of the most
boring and dull categories but they want
to enable you know users worldwide
capture these things so there's a NLP
interface you know just in the moment
you can say I paid 50 bucks fifty
dollars at starbucks for a client
meeting and it just captures that
inserts it in the record or received one
hundred thousand dollars for web design
whatever it is right so in the moment
you capture all these events but behind
the scenes it's aggregating into the
into the accounting software that's one
example but we work in Barclays Bank for
support you know NBC sort of movie
recommendation but a recruiting company
building a whole sort of recruiting
workflow and so on plus lots and on
thousands of self-serve bought some of
which I may not even be aware of but
they just use the platform to do things
so so lots of it yeah yeah I guess from
our perspective since we launched bots
as containers and you any language any
platform so it's really like what those
frameworks provide and what you could do
and so what we see is especially on our
platform a lot of people doing like be
spook bespoke custom integrations with
all sorts like on slack with whatever
systems that use for example we're
building or helping build a secret
shopper app for a particular brand that
does secret shopper has secret shoppers
that go into stores and so they're
helping facilitate and coordinate and
gather feedback from all those shoppers
in slack because they're you slack and
there's a mobile app for slack and so
it's you know what it's the same sort of
mix match burn kind of experience with
API is that you would call like on our
platform and since you know we get
developers full control to be able to
code the bots they want in the language
and the framework they want they could
do sort of whatever they want whenever
is possible but we're built most of our
people tend to bill Watson note on
pocket we have a lot of other people to
build in Python but it's primarily known
bucket so
the most advanced features I I would say
like it's less about the features and
more about the compelling experiences
that's right now so in terms of features
a lot of the brainstorming I've heard
yesterday and I think a lot of the
platforms are going to head towards the
direction is the group box what can bots
do within a group and it makes perfect
sense so but i would say like right this
very moment some of the most compelling
bots we have on cake are the narrative
bots a lot to tell a story and with kick
you can do comp combine bots +
interactive html5 web pages so we have
this block called survival which you
know has you in a zombie apocalypse
situation and you have to escape that
situation by a combination of
storytelling and real you know quick
action a quick action type of our k type
of experiences so it's a it's a
combination of a narrative plus fast
action game and it's i would seems more
compelling than feature-rich i think
many of you know some of the smart chat
BOTS we've launched on microsoft's
platform caption bot which captions
images we have lots of swap faces and
you may also be thinking of some of our
other chat BOTS I won't belabor all but
I like we do have a lot of bots at
various layers of our second you
actually play around with a lot of them
on skype and other data platforms we
support but yeah your guys stuff has
like actually more primitive sort of
elements than than any other platforms I
think like you have like integer types
and like dates and stuff that you can
actually like expose and conversations
for what's worth like so i think the
microsoft one is very like fully
featured like app development thing i
mean III think you know where our thing
is a node application so you can do
basically anything you want you know
that your application logic lives in
between the messages being sent right so
it's there's not really limit you can
have very very complex conversations
with just a couple of tears deep of calm
of callbacks and ours but like i would
point out like Kip is running on bot kit
you know stat spot is running on
unbought kit how he is running on pocket
you know these are things that operate
in many channels and coordinate activity
across direct messages and pub
channels and aggregate the information
and send it out to api's and send them
to internal services and all that stuff
so I don't think there's any like hard
limit on what any of these things can do
a great question I am I don't know i can
i can certainly hook up with the Lewis
Lewis folks and we do have slop filling
a two different levels so we have slop
filling at the natural language level
and we also have a form filling system
where if you define your data types we
have a conversation engine that walks
over that and puts fields in essentially
your raw data types but i'll connect
with lowest section don't know which one
sure so the user my favorite color is
green then you end up with a response
that looks very Eliza life right
absolutely yes about you
so the question is do we parse units
semantically and under the hood and the
answer is not in the traditional sense
so there's no deep or shallow semantic
parsing happening or any like parse
trees that are being constructed that
particular example is fairly contrived
but in that case I was looking for one
word after so is expecting one color
unit but you could essentially put in
some sort of entity extraction that
would understand Alyssa or host of
colors and then pull that unit out you
know very specifically if you wanted to
or you could plug in a parser
so in our case on the capture platform
what we've done is you know we try to do
the combination of sort of
cross-platform as well as native if
that's the word okay because different
messages render differently right so you
can have structured messages and
Facebook the templates the carousel
slack is talking about structured
messages you know telegram and cake have
custom keyboards and so on so our goal
is to have a single common API that
still renders differently or natively in
each of the messaging platforms right so
wherever possible you can still
normalize the API without normalizing
the the actual rendering in our case
yeah we take kind of a very similar
approach in the bat framework we've
taken the concepts that seem to apply
kind of generically and uniformly across
all the platforms everyone has a concept
of a message and we we model those in
ways that seem to be conventional across
all those platforms and then in cases
where certain platforms have extra
functionality we have a hook through you
know our approach to this has been that
if we build a platform that hides
features in facebook and slack and kick
and others that you're not going to
write to our API you're just going to
write directly to those and so we have
passed through for all those mechanisms
and then we also conventional eyes the
stuff that everyone seems to agree on
I would just say mmm dramatically more
of all of those things you know probably
oh it's on our platform so you had the
brand's and you had the retail what was
the first one native services i would
say brands would be sixty percent retail
20 and the rest 20 you know i think i
see i see Bart's not sort of as a
special use case that applies to some
verticals but i see them as just the
latest reincarnation of of a website or
a nap right so if you look at if you ask
the same questions about websites right
what's the distribution between brands
and use cases and verticals I mean I
don't know the answer but but it's just
a lot of each of those and and frankly
you know to me what's driving the bot
phenomena is the fact that you have a
ton of eyeballs right three to four
billion you mobile users worldwide
opening the messaging app dozens of
times a day so every website every app
will have to repurpose reinvent reformat
itself for the bot ecosystem and you're
just gonna have I don't know millions of
of parts because it just makes sense
it's a convenient format now of course
there'll be a lot of unique and new
innovations that we haven't yet
anticipated or can even think of right
but I would resist this thing about okay
here are these 12 use cases that are
good for BOTS while others are for other
things I think you just go know it tips
over right for the first hundred of the
first thousand use cases once they're
covered by BOTS suddenly consumers are
there and they expect to be there and
they expect every other brand to be
there too and then everyone has to be
there right and it's so reminiscent of
what happened in the mid-90s with
websites where we said okay you know
we'll keep office and PowerPoint and so
on on the desktop but we'll move some of
the thing what is the website good for
well maybe
marketing or broadcasting or something
and then it just became everything right
and accept barring a few exceptions it
just transforms everything and I my god
does it's going to be the same with bots
alright just quick I think if I were to
hazard a quick quest I think it would be
the long tail use cases they'll jump
onto it faster because if you think
about uber it's already a top ten app or
something right and for them botched is
just an extra channel but there are so
many other apps that it's really hard to
get downloaded but bots provides a huge
venue so they're going to jump onto it
with both feet and and so on so anyway
slightly alternate view bots aren't
really knew that kind of old they've
been around for a while and for the most
part they've been kind of RT said a
different scene and reminds me of the
early web there's a lot of sort of
freaky art show experimental bots on my
place like Twitter and IRC so games
could end up being a huge venue for the
early world of bots I don't know I don't
know what I'm talking about all right
let's thank you all thank everybody huh
oh no no no sorry if you have what more
questions find us okay I think where is
a mirror there you are shirts coming 11
right all right so we'll have like a
little short break oh one more so sorry
this is like a last-minute addition
Robert come on up so we you know a lot
of people have been talking about like
oh we're going to find a killer bot
we're going to find a killer bod like
what's going to be the killer bot nobody
has more than you know 10,000 teams or
whatever on their on their BOTS in 2000
2001 Robert and his peers had a bot on
AOL Instant Messenger called a smarter
child and it had 30 million people use
it and they built brand bots for
Radiohead and a bunch of other brands
that did things like the radiohead bot
did I think nine ninety million messages
during the six-month campaign on AOL
Instant Messenger in 2001 so I'm really
excited to have him here to just give a
quick sort of address I won't play this
video because it is filled with cuss
words but you
go in Google their launch video yeah
well you can cost but Peter like is a
very foul mouth person in this video but
it's amazing to watch and it's a it's
like an incredible historical document
for this world that we are now again in
that I that I would HIGHLY encourage you
to to to look at so smarter child launch
video on youtube I should have just
played the video no no no
ok
okay hi hi I'm Robert offer by way of
introduction I've been doing stuff in
the computer industry for many many many
years I used to be the youngest person
in the room now I'm one of the oldest
when I say that my first product was a
long time ago a thing called Sargon
which was the first micro computer chess
program in 1981 so I dropped out of
Columbia much to my parents chagrin so
that I could take a job at a company
called Hayden publishing so they could
test video games which we loaded on I
think the biggest computer we had was an
apple to at the time that year we won
the microcomputer international chess
tournament and we out sold a product
called visicalc which meant we sold
100,000 units and my dad had started a
computer store which was the first Apple
dealership in New Jersey so I grew up in
an apple dealership so I was at the Mac
launch and my Macintosh is signed by
Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs and a whole
bunch of other people and I keep it in
my garage and it's cool i have a whole
career museum in my garage and so here
we are in 2015 and the movie 2001 a
Space Odyssey which I just saw a couple
of weeks ago is still the most boring
movie in the entire world it goes on
forever and forever and forever and the
only cool thing about it is the
artificially intelligent robot who goes
rogue Hal I'm sorry Dave and in 2001 we
launched a product called smarter child
smarter child was sort of a bot Odyssey
for us we launched it on to America
Online the instant messaging thing of
the day at that time I think at America
Online they had a huge user community a
hundred million maybe 150 million users
smarter child was natural language bot
and I came up with the idea for a
natural language bot while I was sitting
in the movie Bicentennial man with Robin
Williams and and what I wanted another
boring two-and-a-half-hour movie like
while Robin Williams doesn't age we all
did and but what it was was like Robin
Williams was a bot who
like Pinocchio wanted to be human so
what happened with smarter child was we
designed all kinds of different
applications which we called knowledge
domains we built a complete development
environment called buddy script and we
launched the bot within about six months
so we grew we grew and we grew when we
grew and we grew our guys went to Exodus
at the time which was a network
operations center and there was this
little company called Google and Google
was having these servers these 1u rack
servers built and we saw those and my
partner Tim k who is my brother-in-law
Caltech PhD who won the Academy Award
for science and technology looked at
their service and said hey those are
cool can we have some of those and so in
order to support 30 million users we
were the second largest site in Exodus
after Google so we were using their
stuff and just trying to grow to support
the traffic and we'd have to order
servers like two weeks in advance
because they had to build them and and
rack them up and that problems gone away
we were I don't know at least five
percent of all of the instant message in
traffic in the world was then a bod and
this was when AOL didn't want our bot
online and the reason was we were
breaking AOL it was a problem with
presents detection that they couldn't
solve right and presence detection is
like a urinal when you stand there it
knows you're there when you leave it
flushes so with us it was like the bots
knew when you were there and then when
you were there we would talk to you and
there was no download so you added it to
the buddy list there was nothing as an
impediment to stopping this from
happening and so we found a distribution
mechanism that at the time was very
difficult because everybody was worried
because the download was fat and it was
hard to get things downloaded so we
already had a download we had AOL I am
aim and icq and msn messenger and so AOL
would periodically rate limit us and
stop us from going on the network and we
had a kid his name is Adam fritzler that
was literally a kid he was 17 years old
that we found online and he had broken
the protocols online and open sourced
him at pissed off a while tremendously
we hired him and his job was to sit
there and every time they would change
the rate limiting schema at AOL he would
break it and then we would go back on
let me hack day well in order to get
there and then the guys from Radiohead
saw what we were doing and called this
up on the phone and said hey we want to
launch a Radiohead bot and it turned out
that Raoul Mujica who was running AOL
instant messenger at the time a really
good guy loved Radiohead so we said hey
we'll do the radio had bought if you let
this little thing we have called smarter
child on the network and he said okay so
we did that oh just in terms of traffic
we were doing billions of messages and
it was all teens then it's all teens now
we knew that because we had the
statistics we should tell you we have
the statistics and we watched it from
every single of the major platforms and
what would happen is we would have
spikes of traffic when people would come
home at three o'clock on the east coast
from school the traffic would spike when
they dialed in the traffic dialed up you
know key dialed up and then the traffic
would spike again three hours later why
because the kids were coming home on the
other coast and then it would spike
again at like midnight and what we
figured out was happening was that all
their other friends were going to sleep
and the only person left to talk with
was smarter child and what they did
mainly was not what we thought okay but
let's talk a little bit more about
smarter child so here's what happened
Microsoft did due diligence on us they
sent a team of really talented guys
Steve lithic and a whole bunch of really
smart people from Microsoft showed up
they beat the heck out of pure Buerkle
up in our engineering team our
engineering team was up to the task and
ultimately after a whole bunch of years
of trying to build something other than
smarter child which were instant
messaging bots for customer service for
time warner and Major League Baseball
and every client you could ever possibly
imagine we built hundreds and hundreds
of these things Microsoft decided hey
customer service might be a really good
thing to use this for cuz it'll reduce
our cost of customer service is an
actual return on investment we grew the
thing after I don't know 20 million
dollars of investment from
Reuters corporation and you know we were
the darlings of the internet I went to
the White House Correspondents Dinner as
the guest of Reuters i sat next to Jerry
Yang it was George W Bush was the guy
that was in office then it's a very
weird time for me so they paid some
money for this guy I think they didn't
really pay money for smarter child
because here's what happened by 2007
Microsoft realizing that smarter child
might be a little bit of a problem
because he was snarky if you've ever
talked to him you'll know that and I can
prove it in a second smart child is an
editorial problem bots are not a
technical problem but sour neda torial
problem because bots have a personality
when you're talking about something
which doesn't have a personality which
runs around behind the scenes and does
stuff for you that's not a bad that's an
agent agents don't need personalities I
offer you the matrix no personality
their BOTS need personalities that was
the key to the success of smarter child
he had a personality in fact a friend of
mine who was a lead character animator
by the numba Doug Frankel who is still a
lead character animator one of the top
lead character animators at Pixar was
also an investor in our company and when
he came and talked to smarter child the
first thing that he said is he said to
me Hoff's ki we'd known each other for a
very long time your bod is more popular
than the simpsons in terms of audience
share we were bigger than the biggest
television show in the history of
television and he said and the reason
was because your BOTS got an attitude
problem we were all from new york and
new jersey lots got an attitude problem
so they lobotomize smarter child in 2009
smarter child was murdered they removed
him from the network they killed my baby
we were all very saddened by this
because bot lives matter when smarter
child was pulled from the network I went
back to talk with Microsoft and
Microsoft had a tendency to buy things
back in the day and in a moment of
austerity what happened was ray ozzie
and Bill Gates sat down with the team
that was leading bot development and
they had just purchased a company called
tell me you may know tell me as
integrated voice response system which
was really a question-and-answer
menu-driven type of product they spent
800 million dollars on the acquisition
and when they sat down and looked at the
technology at Microsoft Research ray
ozzie and Bill Gates looked at our
technology which was basically scripted
okay it was one way to skin the boat at
the time no machine learning a limited
amount of that we had translated into
eight languages at Microsoft the mission
was to translate into 38 languages we
had only gotten to eight including
simple Mandarin we thought that was
pretty good nobody else even had one so
eight we thought was all right so Bill
Gates said to ray ozzie hey don't we
already have something like this
andreozzi said no we have six of these
and so they killed it rest in peace I am
I bought back the technology from
Microsoft on a license agreement in 2009
and i did a road show on Sand Hill Road
and I called every venture capitalist I
know and I know every venture capitalist
and they're all nice guys and I went
with the original engineer Pierre
Buerkle off and my co-founder Peter
leviton and we explained to them that
cell phones are coming cell phones are
coming and they're going to have these
things when Sean Carlin who was an
investor in Cyre one of the early
investors what he said was when we first
came up with the idea of series smarter
child already had 15 million users and
was growing by twenty percent a week the
market was talking so they knew in fact
Siri was the first purchase of an app
that Apple ever made they had lots of
apps in fact at the WWDC yesterday they
talked about it Tim said they have two
million apps that's a lot of apps it's
more apps than we need it's more apps
than I can fit on my phone I can only
use about one at a time I use like maybe
six apps I'm not sure that the paradigm
of bots being apps or BOTS being web
pages is an accurate paradigm because
that's two domain-specific for a
conversational bot see a bot can do lots
of things in a nap properly done only
does one thing very well
so there's a big difference between a
conversational bot and an app for a
website so i like to think it i don't
know if this is true that we were one of
the first memes what was the meme the
meme was what we called the captain kirk
problem which is trying to come in
smarter child to have sex with you and
that was sixty percent of all of our
traffic and remember the amount of
traffic we had this was a lot of traffic
and so we had a guy who would sit there
all day long and he would watch people
cursing at the bot and come up with a
curse word filter which by the way we
sold to Microsoft alongside now that guy
um his name is Chris Bray I don't know
if anyone has heard of Chris Bray he
runs a little website now called apple
com when the venture capitalists took
over smarter child they fired Chris
almost immediately because what did he
do SAT around and develop methods of
keeping people from convincing the bots
to have sex with them Microsoft had the
technology to prevent the Tay problem
from happening where if your bot talks
back your end users will have a lot of
fun hacking the bots I promise they will
try they will also succeed just like
Captain Kirk was able to defeat landrieu
on the computer planet they will get him
in a logical loop and we had a problem
with a Santa bot because you know if you
said to this antibody you know I want to
sit on your lap it got a little kinky
that was a problem you have to be
careful of those kinds of things so fast
forward welcome five minutes welcome
smarter children you're all children of
smarter child we weren't even the first
pot right the the first concepts of
these things goes Alan Turing back right
it's way way back natural language
processing is one of those things like
you know flying cars we know there's
going to be a flying car and until you
on builds it we won't have it right so
when I was a kid really young I saw a
guy by the name of Alan Kay who was an
apple fellow and he played the piano
during his speech and what he talked
about was creating the future by
inventing it
and that's what you guys are doing right
it took 15 years for this to swing
around and become a fat again and is
there a bot phenomenon I'm looking
around the room I'm thinking yeah there
is we tried to do this we launched a
platform we got some users now there are
10,000 people building BOTS when your
platform does something that you don't
expect to do it's mature that's what
Steve lithic and microsoft said when he
saw our product so why are your BOTS
different than all other BOTS don't
guess my religion like there are four
kinds of bots right the dull the foolish
the heedless and the wise and what I
want to counsel you guys to do is don't
build dull BOTS and by dull BOTS I mean
like dory the fish Dory the fish doesn't
remember what she had for lunch this
morning if you if you ask Alexa which is
a coupon will talk about Alexa in a
second if you ask Alexa I'm interested
in the weather in Miami it'll tell you
the weather in Miami if you say can you
put me some flights there it doesn't
know the anaphora of what does they're
mean and smarter child did we had phatak
expression we had an afro we had all the
natural language processing stuff that
you need to maintain a full conversation
and we were keeping profiles on every
single user in depth you see intimacy is
a matter of shared remembrance and
experience and if your bot doesn't
remember day to day or month to month
what your what your customer was saying
then your your BOTS an idiot it's a Dory
bot don't build buri pots build wise
BOTS okay if you ink up that doremi our
problem was we never really even wanted
a business model of the venture
capitalists behind the company was a guy
by the name of Andrew Weissman and the
Weissman's at union square ventures
partners in New York is a dear friend of
mine our plan was never to write a
business plan and to sell this thing to
AOL for hundreds of millions of dollars
before anybody realized what had
happened that didn't happen so we were
forced to look at business models what
are the business models
the business models are transactions
advertising subscriptions and
development most of you I think are on
the d-side developing bots for a living
for somebody else there probably are
spots for each of these types of models
but I think there's another way to go
Alexa has sold over 4 million units to
date closing in on 5 200 bucks each 2
billion dollars it's by far the highest
revenue generator they have taken a firm
lead I was at the WWDC listening to what
was said what they said was something
sad what they said was series now going
to be opened up Apple has chosen now to
be number two we're opening up why cus
who else opened up Alexa is open so you
can go and you can program Alexa you can
do your home entertainment system with
Alexa you can control your Phillips you
lighting but the problem now is this
your business our business the business
we're all in is like Frogger okay you're
if you're hopping across the street in
Frogger you're going to get hit by one
side of or another and so there's a
platform problem no slide presentation
would be complete without the compulsory
slide of logos my compulsory slide of
logos I'm sure you all know which ones
they are are the platform choices that
you guys have to make I wish I could
inform you which was the better choice I
can't i can tell you something about
distribution though and that's how i'd
like to close today dependent is
unsustainable that's what we found we
were dependent on microsoft on AOL and
on yahoo to have our product up you guys
who will likewise be dependent upon
Microsoft and Facebook and Google you
must find an independent path and you
must find independent distribution paths
there are several distribution models
and I'll close with this so the
distribution models I call them star
trek go where no one has gone before and
the world will follow you there
potentially do something new new is
important don't just do what everybody
else is doing Field of Dreams this
really actually work
our business if you build it they will
come that's what happened with smarter
child in fact we used all of these the
other distribution model is the
Manchurian Candidate you're building
sleeper agents when you launch and you
have traffic we got traffic through sex
chat we were then able to use it to
generate millions of dollars of
advertising revenue it wasn't our plan
but guess what once you're talking with
somebody and in conversation with them
you might be able to do something else
Manchurian Candidate and then finally
the craze a hard day's night what
happened with smarter child was word of
mouth distribution picked up and we
became a virus and so the reason for our
growth of traffic is these for
distribution models and so I urge you to
consider don't be dependent upon one
platform and consider your distribution
models look for ways to make money and i
should say in Silicon Valley have been
doing this a very long time for all of
you who know winter is coming so do it
quickly do it now and thank you for your
time
so you guys want to ask me anything so
we were going to talk for a few minutes
about a kind of what we do a baby works
but but from a data perspective for lots
of people are building so for those of
you don't know us we do two things at
beta works we build companies and
independently but highly related we make
seed-stage investments and so one of
those things in the category investing
is we're doing this thing bought camp
which which we mentioned so what I
wanted to do was share some data from
how what we're seeing in terms of there
was a question earlier about what's
being built categories specifically
without sort of going deep into specific
companies talking about which talking
about some data from the bot perspective
and then also we built a bot and so I
want to share some day with how people
were interacting with it yeah so we'll
keep it short but Matt and I are the
co-creators of something called bought
camp which is a program that we're doing
at beta works it's a program we're going
to take in 10 chatbot startups do sort
of like a precede accelerator program
with them and the inst the sort of
inspiration for this is that since i
joined beta works sorry about a year ago
Matt and I have had a conversation about
BOTS I think like a two-hour
conversation about BOTS like every day
since I started and then about three
months ago we just came up with the idea
for bach am thinking about how excited
we were about the space we had already
obviously made an investment in howdy
with been almost a year ago actually now
and wanted to learn a lot more about the
space and frankly make a bet on chat
BOTS being a big thing and and trying to
figure out what the opportunities there
were so we opened it up we got 346
startups applied all bots and we're
going to pick 10 of those for the
program and the program will be 12 weeks
of product development branding user
acquisition data science fundraising all
sort of typical stuff you see an
accelerator but all focused around bots
and conversational interfaces and we
have an awesome set of partners which
you can see on this obligatory
logo slide and now we can jump in sort
of to the data which i think is the most
interesting part for everyone here and
Matt you want to dig in on this so this
is kind of hard to see from up there but
I think we're going to show this more
publicly so the most fifteen percent of
the applications were enterprise and I
don't think it's a surprise slack is a
big platform for distribution and so I
think that sees case on enterprise we've
creation tools and platforms as the
second biggest category nine percent the
third biggest categories assistant /
concierge a percent health care and
wellness seven percent commerce six
percent finance six percent news and
media and then we have kind of
entertainment travel education to me the
interesting thing here is that if you
take out assistance constant which /
concierge is eight percent and if you
look at travel which is five percent and
maybe one other category those are the
only human assisted categories
everything else is what we think about
is like actual BOTS things that aren't
just sending you to some sending you to
someone and then routing it to a human
and then routing back and responding
some things are probably hybrids but I
think it's interesting that there was
real kind of technology there yeah and
then we managed to tally together the
different platforms that everyone was
building for you'll notice that these
add up to more than one hundred percent
because a lot of the bots built for
multiple platforms which is not
surprising but what might have been
noteworthy is that SMS still the most
popular platform of people to build for
obviously I think a hundred percent of
those are using twilio as far as we
could tell i think the the weighting of
enterprise-focused bots meant that a lot
of the bots that we saw we're building
for slack and I think showed a lot of
the maturity of the ecosystem there okay
yes I mean we can again will circulate
they seem to have questions specifically
we can we can hit them should we I mean
do I'm sorry
yeah so this sort of depending on how
you think about it so this is like they
actually built an app but they had then
the notion of bots inside of it and then
and then you have sort of at the far end
we had a few on Alexa fewer than
actually I thought I thought would apply
we had above some of that were online
and then and then kick and in Twitter
surgery to the next one so the next
thing we want to talk about was we built
this kind of fun bot called bought with
the CEO beta works is John borthwick so
he's British so everything's a pun and
so bot wick is a bun so you can text
this number to see it and I have
included the number on the subsequent
slide so I can kind of keep going but
some data that we got from this is that
people said hello 19 different ways
hello hello bot wick hello mr. Bott
hello world hello hello oh hello what is
low so all these different kind so yo
bot wick why you know home is my
favorite so so the intro message we
found was actually pretty important when
you think about not being able to
communicate what the drop-down menus are
like what the thing can do the intro
matches becomes really important so just
so that you can see it it says how are
you today what would you like to discuss
you can ask me the weather just say
whether plus zip or the news or ask me
what podcasts the boss is listening to i
get to hit them to or about a joke how
about a joke i highlighted in bold the
things that work sort of keywords for
categories and so we have on the back
end we use dexter to do regex
expressions and just save a sense this
is a relatively dumb bot it is literally
an Excel spreadsheet we're on column a
it's a regex match and column B is the
response to that question just to give
you a kind of a sense of the simplicity
of this so 200 Peter we had nineteen
hundred messages to give you a cent to
the denominator 206 weather news
podcasts and then we have people asking
questions that aren't necessarily
directly here so how old are you how dot
star you read it what are you reading
was reading time
what time is it and then ask people ask
for a joke a lot of most popular ones
were weather and joke which were the
anticipated ones the one of the things
that came up yesterday so I kind of ran
a bunch of data last night because I
thought it was interesting to to hear
this various a little bit cut off but
I'll read them out people were talking
about the length of search queries and
so I went back into the bot way clogs
and just looked at what the what the
lengths were and how people were
interacting with this thing which people
kind of fundamentally know is actually
about keywords even though they're
asking these questions we're basically
doing these red X masters to figure out
which keywords so on average the length
of a request was 13 characters the
shortest was to the longest was 50 now
keep in mind this is mostly done during
herbs all done through text message so
that probably influences the way that
people are asking the questions or the
length of questions but what's
interesting was just looking at one
example the weather category people
would ask what's the weather in a
particular zip code tell me the weather
in a zip code weather zip code weather
and so people were kind of you can see
this in a much different categories
people are trying to figure out what uh
what kind of what the keyboard wasn't
just going directly to it we could also
this sort of looks another piece of 514
questions didn't have answers you can
start to see people trying to poke
around to see whether there's keywords
or easter eggs in this so we have
various emoji lots of profanity people
ask questions like Alan Turing are you
happy are you my friend and then people
like Bernie Sanders drums equals
mc-squared happy birthday I think
somewhere in there was like Trump and I
think that was that was good I want to
just go through that really quickly but
if you guys are any of you have specific
questions around any of this data we're
happy to answer them
thanks
talk to ur top 30
so so we haven't actually finished that
process so we're right in the very end
of the process so we are getting 2 i'll
i'll tell you sort of a broad view that
we have taken from on the investments
productive and tell me if you have
something to add here peter is that we
were looking for bots where there was
some level of depth somewhere so meaning
that like oh I was using kind of
internally uber as an example like
that's a bot but then it has like a most
step there are cars driving around and
stuff like supporting that bot right and
so whether that sort of deep data
science or a bunch of a bunch of data
that they're gathering or AI or some
kind of network that's being built that
was sort of the a bunch of how we were
thinking about competitive moats I think
the other thing is um since it's a
precede program it's also meant for
people very very early and almost most
stuff was pre product or pre launch not
pre product but not everything was and
we were you know there was a pretty wide
breadth of where people were in the
product process that applied and we
didn't want it just to be stuff that was
we could have just picked stuff that was
out in market and had users and we
deliberately didn't want to do that and
the stuff we selected another question
whether any of that sort of surprised
you two targets for two hours a day
well that's amazing oh there's off I
mean there's a lot well we saw a lot of
the same ideas over and over again not
surprisingly i think that some of the
things that surprised us were around i
would say that the beta works
historically has been maybe more
consumer focused in the way that we've
approached everything but that a lot of
the the the most fully formed products
were around enterprise and it and i
think part of that was that the use
cases around bots and and when they make
sense our most fully realized in the
enterprise space specifically really
around slack and people being able to
integrate there and be able to have a
bot which is able to integrate into
their workflow or into some aspect of
the business and so we were I think
we're a little surprised by I mean maybe
surprised ourselves how much we came
around to seeing the utility of bots in
the enterprise space rather than I think
our original intentions that we were
going to have a lot more consumer
well the the that we had people from all
over the world that was something that
was really encouraging i mean people
from West Africa people from South Asia
Southeast Asia China South America a lot
from the US and so there was I think
what surprised us maybe not surprises
but I think what was interesting was
seeing that there are people building
bots all over the world and that it's
not something that's localized to the
Bay Area or just people who are you know
sort of within the this network that
it's people all over the world see it as
an opportunity to build and innovate and
make cool stuff and so I think that
because it was an open filter we were
able to get people that wouldn't
necessarily be part of the traditional
fundraising process that you know that
that startups go through so that was
pretty pretty awesome I think everyone
wants lunch I know I do but one more
question
I mean I think that the the so first so
we didn't we didn't bowl anything
there's a there's a bot called purple
which maybe you're referring to which
which has all caps which i think is it
they'll make a sentence and then
anything in all caps you can respond
with just that I think it's actually a
really good UI and a good user
experience to just subtly say if you
want to respond to this you can and here
and there will be more behind there I've
seen ones that say text em for more so
they'll send you one message and then
kind of weight to pull I don't know that
we have answers yet I think it sort of
raised more questions about how you
indicate what these things are supposed
to do one of the things that we've
learned from I think making the the bot
kampot from bot wick from seeing data
and inside of products like Pancho is
that some we need to be all of us need
to be thoughtful about how to about
weather like where our lane is like are
we staying in our lane or we how do we
react to things that are outside of this
core kind of vertical scope other
conversations yesterday in the AI and
machine learning group were about about
the opportunities in go to go deep in
verticals that sort of necessarily means
you're not going to be able to answer
every question and I think that's I
think that having a personality to be
able to respond to things that are
outside can be helpful for the for the
bot wick Bok hee hee John I think has
like a random on magic 8-ball answer
that comes through for the bot camp bak
we just said this is a dumb bot and so
we want you to help me help us make it
smarter any other questions thank you so
much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
