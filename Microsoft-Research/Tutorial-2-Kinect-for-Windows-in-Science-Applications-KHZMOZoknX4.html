hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
so a finger amazing for less involved in
the new kinect for windows project
because just such an incredible
diversity you've seen there some of the
business scenarios weren't going to talk
about now some of the science scenarios
that we see that this technology can be
used to them what if you took the people
like yourselves are telling us that it
can be usable and i hope that you come
away from them but all that talks today
inspired to try what you would like to
try to clean it to that it really not so
much about what we might stop the saying
is what you can bring with your
applications your ideas to this amazing
technology
just hasn't area again as you can see
myself its collection let me give
context before I is reply to this to
tell you I am where I'm from while you
might disagree right amount of research
admission is very bored I pure research
organization in a company which is
extremely rare we do or some people
could be our research where the focus is
on research it's about publishing
research papers collaborating openly
with the academic world as peers and
many of our our researchers are
academics rights activist themselves we
were very lucky having had with academia
this conference is very exemplification
of that so if we're really quite a
different organization for what many
people think of as a research lab at a
company we don't really work on products
we work on technologies technologies
that may begin to products that's true
right off the emissions there at the top
there so it's not about product
development we don't work on
technologies that one day maybe not only
to products or features with a Microsoft
technologies but also entire new
businesses and then connect one of these
levels what we've helped such a
technology definitely I'm from the most
often such connections group which is a
bridging group between the makeup
researchers that are working on their on
their research papers and their patterns
where their innovations and working with
academics with our group in my top
research connections where our focus is
to bridge those researchers and academia
so very dizzy do their own research and
their own practice hardships we try and
help amplify what the researchers can do
how they engage in partner with
academics work in another different
areas there are five main areas i'm
responsible long i have the natural user
interface area as you've just been
hearing from cherry we call the type of
technology that connect is hey 688
enabler of natural user interface
technology an expansion of the current
thinking in user interfaces to really
bring in multiple modality
simultaneously working a speech spectrum
to work in their division to look at
gestures and integrate that so that you
can interact with a computer system in a
much more natural way where you don't
have to think about the interaction that
you're doing with the computer you saw
in that last scenario with the video i'm
showing the shopper at a store trying on
clothes she doesn't have to think about
she's interacting with a computer she
just tried virtually on her different
place it's a metal using
so I won't go into a lot of detail about
context i'll show you want to about the
science for the last piece on on context
that's user interface connected just one
example it is a dominant example for us
is it represents that's the pinnacle of
naches reach space capability but we
think about natural user interface even
beyond connect as well but let's stick
to connect today another area that i
feel involved with in our groups
involved with is in science and we are
co-host of this with this conference I
was particularly co-author of a
co-editor of a book for the fourth
paradigm which is a book written a
couple years ago explaining the state of
the art in what data intensive science
is all about we really see it was
observed by a very famous sub-ceo
scientist for Jim Gray and others that
was emerging a new paradigm of how
science was being done today the fourth
paradigm before paradigm represents that
that approach to science which may be
many of you are involved with we're now
data is dominant within your science the
amount of data coming from the
instruments that modern scientists use
is extraordinary we have a few gigabytes
are easy now tera bytes are somewhat
somewhat normal we're getting into
petabytes of data that is now even out
quite challenging to process and
data-intensive science is a important to
challenge for our scientists today so
important challenge also for computer
scientists like me to imagine how we can
help scientists there's a lot of words
on these slides and let me go through
today but you can you can look at the
other words after there's a talk but I'm
happy to answer any questions as well if
I give you a taste at first there's a
famous data-intensive scientist LOL
excuse me let's do it into a little bit
more detail about data intensive science
explain how natural user interface play
the part how has a role to play for this
diagram written by a colleague of mine
it captures a number of our thinking
thinking summing up what the workflow in
the process of of data intensive science
means today you can start basically the
top or acquisition and modeling data is
a non-trivial problem getting a lot of
danger of senses and lots of different
kinds my sensors might be offensive
network in a you know you know for the
field in a forest or in a stream of
water I maybe it's on a satellite maybe
it's a probe on Mars of the planet but
i'm getting a data and I'm feeling like
that David I have to feed that into an
enormous process in itself I won't go
into that today the collaboration and
visualization is important part of data
intensive science and you can see there
a hint that in visualizing data
especially large amounts of data we have
a non non trivial problem again and how
do I collaborate with these large
amounts of data so i have the physical
problem how do i get data a large
amounts of data thing for one place to
another using of the data centers today
we can posit further in the cloud and
how i can collaborate what
communications make this is do i use
what's my user interface to that that
data how does the collaboration user
interface look like there's analysis and
data mining another non-trivial problem
all these are non-trivial i won't go
through the more I hope there's
contemporary scientists you're very
familiar with these areas the data is
dominant in the center customized
obvious opportunity for natural user
interface and technologies like connect
for data-intensive science is in
collaboration and visualizations I
we think that by bringing technology is
like connect into the picture of data
intensive science it can help in how
scientists communicate and collaborate
how in particular I can visualize data
you may have seen them I'm sure you've
seen some of the you've seen the movies
at a cherry just showed of connecting
how we interact of connectivity
non-science inarius today but I'm sure
you've heard of that the movie am that
that famously showed the gesture
interfaces that have been showing of the
number of years but but some ways it
inspired this idea of gesturing to a a
screen gesturing to a computer as a
novel way to interact with the data what
started to happen is that with so many
people experimenting with with Kinect
now it's become so accessible there are
other technologies like connect but that
connect is still the most popular
scientists and others are also
experimenting with with what it's like
to gesture to its interactive screen and
experiment with with with nipple aids in
large amounts of data if we've got time
I'll show you a demonstration of our
worldwide telescope that has a prototype
connect interface on the world wide
telescope shows astronomical data the
data is coming from many different
satellites the Hubble Space Telescope
all sorts of things but you can interact
with that large amount of data with just
a mouse and keyboard I could use just a
trackball or a dimensional using face
but it transforms the experience when I
congest you to the telescope with with
my my whole body and and move around the
planets move around the stars with with
gestures I also because it's a match
user interface can integrate speech into
that interface so I can speak to the
screen just like again we chose in the
fashion video with a lady that
speaking to the system as well as
gesturing we see natural ease or impetus
combinations of those modalities it's
not just about gesture gesture is just
one of the modalities the gesture speech
and the other ways coming together is
how we see a role for nui and natural
interface to play in collaboration and
visualization for data-intensive style
but I don't think it's not safe I think
you can imagine that as you visualize
data eyeballing the data has in trying
to understand and navigate the data
trying to identify features within that
data plotting that data analysis through
the visual medium aika gesture to that
Pat data represents an important part of
what they do in terms of science does
and we think that natural user interface
has a role to play equally in data
mining trying to extract interesting
data and interesting features from large
data sets throw a natural user interface
I would like to hypothesize with you
today is a good wet realm of
experimentation and I encourage you to
explore how technologies i connect to be
you in that kind of the area of david
exercise lastly on this slide the
dissemination and sharing what if you
could hand your data sets in a easy to
navigate easy to explore way with a
natural user interface to your
colleagues or to the general public many
many daily 10 societies many scientists
also have an important outreach role
they would need and if you want to
explain their data to the general public
part of the reason for showing you
things like the fashion video is not to
to suggest that that this is directly
relevant to your science but think about
it it can also apply to your fire
because the way that we're showing at
user interface is a good way to interact
with the general public who are
unfamiliar with a sister may don't know
how to interact with your system if you
think about natural usual into
that's enabled by today to remember the
general public or to government bodies
or two people funding grants even that
can help explain your science explain
your data to those who have folks that
are not familiar with with the
scientific data interfaces school so I
think these three areas really represent
crime opportunities o thy hypothesize
and we have seen some expert
experimentation already some of which
we've done ourselves are very important
opportunities for Matthews in its face I
think there are also opportunities even
beyond in these other two areas are
going to go into so much detail in
probing these again I'm happy to answer
any questions you might have but I do
wonder in acquisition and modeling with
as you deployed census there may be
interesting natural user interface ways
to gesture to a an interruption
environment to to deploy senses in a
central Network I've seen taking
interesting scenarios and archiving
presence preserving we have other
thoughts about that in a web page today
but happy to ask you answer any
questions if you want to get into a
dollar to sum up I think that the entire
space of data intensive care science
represents opportunities for natural
user interface I've not come here today
to present you solutions that are off
the shelf and you can just use straight
away in your site but i think the state
of the art is there for any company or
any platform today
what we do have just as cherry
highlighted with the kinect for windows
technology it is ready now it is mature
technology which researchers and
companies companies are relying on this
technology now to build businesses on
some of these companies that cherry show
the startup businesses are starting up
their own own businesses using Kinect
technologies but there's also big brands
like coca-cola using this technology and
listen was another video that junk
ohhhhh didn't show but big companies and
smaller using these technologies proven
technology this technology is mature
enough to to use in many different
fields what we would encourage you to do
today if you are are inspired by Turner
think we're saying is for you to explore
what you can do with your gaming chance
of science access I think our
opportunities all over the map here the
scale of data I highlighted earlier this
is a term that little sources from the
Southampton University in the UK there
are petabytes of data and queens this
building the amount of data you missed
in the field of data intensive science
is just incredible we are trying to
empower through our computer science
research not just at microsoft research
but beyond in the field of computer
scientists collaborating with these
scientists we're trying to help
scientists actually be scientists so
today on the left hand side the
scientists if it's using convention
technology is getting overwhelmed by the
amount of data
on a man um but tomorrow and what we
think that we are collaborating with
with scientists I galaxy joined us at a
min ago the current state of data
intensive science really enables a
paradigm shift to bring the ability to
address these petabytes of data I think
that knowing has a key role to play in
the three areas i highlighted a minute
ago and there are options of your next
one of the documents that is in the the
kicks that comes with Kinect windows
Kinect for Windows is both the hardware
the sensor itself for tools you'll see
see that from white wave in in a few
moments there's also a software
development kit as well but importantly
as we built up this gate capability over
the past couple years we've got
extensive documentation now and this is
the front page of the human interface
guidelines that we released with the the
latest version of the software
development commission 1.8 she's just
release clicking August right with a
gorgeous better the human interface
guidelines is 140 your cages of of
diagrams and guidelines helping you as
the developer to understand how to write
the best user interfaces using a
connector there's a large handful here
now how to build you
so you're not alone you don't just get
the sensor device and some some api's
and your software development here and
then have to go to write code you've got
extensive documentation built on years
way beyond just the kinetic windows
project includes a lot of the experience
in xbox and be developing and foot to
next longer than anybody um that really
helps you build that user interfaces
today so there's a lot of experience
being builder there's also a large
number of samples in me in a software
development kit that can help you get me
started as well so don't be afraid of
dipping your toe in the water and trying
it why will the way we'll talk a little
bit more about that sure a lot more
about that shortly as another piece to
connect we spent time the last 40
minutes or so talking about connect as a
natural user interface technology that's
what it was designed for originally in a
gaming situation designed to be a new
way to attract the games but we very
quickly saw the much broader potential
to use in all sorts of applications in
retail and advertising and in science in
the areas of a highlight the Kinect also
can be used and in a rather other
interesting ways specifically of
interest to scientists and this is that
by taking away things like the what's
called a skeletal tractor the technology
that identifies you as a human being
with with gestures if you just point the
sensor at any object you if you still
can do some interesting things with it
and in particular scientists the applied
scientists are exploring how connect can
be using this way using a technology
that we've released for Kinect fusion
connect fusion is about surface
reconstruction that's the technical term
for what you and I if you're on computer
scientist Michael real-time 3d scanning
so I can use the Kinect as
sir to not now just scan people and
understand their gestures but I can scan
objects and understand their 3d and
surface I can build a 3d model of an
object in real time very quickly some of
the example scenarios that we've worked
with universities to explore include
archaeology to scan archaeological digs
and objects artifacts criminology and
exploring crime scenes very quickly to
to scan a crime scene or the evidence
the scene a biology took monitor things
like plant growth if I can scan a plant
that's growing over time and then scan
it over different intervals I can build
up a growth model for that fact that
fall there are other ways to do these
scans this is not a technology that is
is novel with you like in in those
scenarios each of these these scenarios
have existing 3d scanners but those 3d
scanners are very different to connect
they're very expensive pistol those are
thousands of dollars in general enough
they're also extremely slow they're very
precise scanners but they're very slow
you can take you a day to scan a room in
criminology and in a crime scene to
accurately scan away I think that's
great you get a good accurate scan but
it's a it's a day to do this it takes
long time now the crime scene one is it
won't think about because imagine a
crime scene you'll see in crime scenes
on TV
you going to dance in real life remember
there's a lot of people interacting with
that scene then it's very important
where the evidence is in that in that
scene so it's very important to capture
that scene quickly as I've just
explained I just go take a day to scare
all right I can't have coupons milling
around and moving around in Matthew not
see why I'm scanning I've got to clear
out the room this is not a very good
situation so webconnect could be useful
is not only is it inexpensive so I can
deploy it much more easily and much more
quickly I can give it to two people on
the scene very quickly the people in the
field but it's also good for sketching
and 3d scenes I think of it as as it's
an orientation of a powerful
multi-thousand dollar high-resolution
scanner what we're giving you is a
sketching scale a scanner that can just
produce a quick an approximate model
which is good for as a sketchbook
through the reference later there's a
very good augmentation of the existing
some of these these applications might
just use Kinect alone but others might
use it in this complimentary way to
exist including snails and there are a
lot more we ended up talking to about
term or exploring about 30 different
applications of scanning but these three
work with certainly some of the top ones
so I call that 3d sketching and we're
going to give you a demo I have a
greenie scanning reflect fusion later if
you have not seen it before it's pretty
fun so to wrap up and get on with it
we'll have a quick break and then we'll
we'll do a technical tutorial on on
connect on windows how do you get
started well at the top this is just
explain and how you figure to learn more
about how we collaborate in microsoft
research with scientists lesson starting
links and again you can have this back
afterwards we have a whole community
interaction them ok Bella tivity go to a
worse places and I know you can't get
facebooking in China but there are other
other ways to interact with us but
really my my punch line for you is for
you to feel empowered to go explore this
yourself their technology is ready for
you to you so no longer part of the
research lab the product group is
supporting if developed a multiple
businesses at one point eight now there
is a new type essential on its way
that's already been announced that will
have even more capabilities for more
high performance and we have to expand
the scenarios that I've already
described but it's certainly right for
your excellent exploration to try your
ideas in it that becomes available in
the coming
the due to count the kinect for windows
side if you've not done so to get one of
these sensors they're very low-cost try
it out experiment and see how you can
apply to your sign this is what the
website looks like if you not seen it
now you know when you land a kinect
windows you're at the right place that
is the end of my talk today thank you
very much
so before we hand up to where what why
good way I think we should have a quick
break but for less let's pause for
questions to see if there any question
say it who's inspired our ganache yo
Craig who's inspired to try this connect
technology out for your science is there
anybody in the room that will will say
they're going to give this a try in
their size Alex yes have you ever you
have you have you used it for any
applications today Alex now this is a
famous astronomer
cosmology haha have you used it on large
screens
so
how big was your screen
right do you know any people have tried
connecting a cave environment with a
large surrounds
with microsoft itself is getting into
the large screen displays technologies
for the acquisition of our perceptive
pixel companies large touchscreen
display and I think remembering cherries
point that that new e natural user
interface is very much about multiple
modalities it's not just about gesture
if you imagine how you could bring in
gesture at the
at a distance from a large screen but
also touch that combination of
modalities is going to be
and you'll start to see these very large
touch distance
the lobsters
if you have another cup
no what happens though yeah
I thank you guys so where are they the
examples that time I get the equation
set correctly
things are how it started at the
University of California Berkeley you
can do these gesture interfaces with
some historical technologies and
previous legacy technology where you
need things like a stick or an
additional component to the interface
and one of the neat things about connect
remember is that that it just works on
vision and speech and audio so the
center itself can and detect what's
going on in the room you don't have to
bring an augmentation if you have to
bring a device to that you just put your
connect up in the room yes you do need
to do a bit of programming but the
system can understand that there's
people at work
and couldn't do things like cherry put
up early on the human interface
guidelines things like engagement with
the system Donna determine whether the
person is his facing the screen or
facing the other person in the room
another important point about that has
so much to say but of potential of
kissing that remember connect is also
good not just for single person
interactions one person with the screen
one person of the system but it's
multiple party inherited it was built
that way the game it was always going to
be two to four players in the game as
well as one person so a neat side effect
of using connectors you get four person
up to four first interactivity
capability with with two men and that
that I think is really good to my
collaboration point in the in the
science opportunities
them have questions that sorry
yes that's the Cherokee craft me or
awake
so I'm wrong in fact you will just
answers I'll get the number wrong is it
how many cadets when we do
simultaneously
but it's
simultaneous to the bathroom now
I think remember there was no jacket for
but certainly one of the challenges you
end up with is not just the physical
light interference or so you need to
manage that it does work it seems
the support is worth something too but
you will run out of us beef and with on
a regular basis if you need to have a
dedicated USB host controller
but that doesn't change it in the
university sent to just even more
dangerous delicate usb3
but it's very possible
yes another question sir
what's or the Ranger you thinking of
about the room with the regular living
rooms spell
ok I don't I don't foresee that myself I
think that that still represents a sweet
spot of of the sorts of interactivity
that it's designed for both in a gaming
environment but also put a source of
interactivity of interactivity I've been
speaking about today and how you
interacted through the large data set
precisely did you have a particular
application in line
oh yeah
it's not a it's not a driving use case
for us as we say it's not a particular
direction a factor that we're going
after but I hear you the product team
hears you what they'll do is listen to
potential customers like yourself
existing customers like yourself and
it's out they'll they'll evaluate
whether this is a priority to develop it
but at the moment it's not something
take the strong demand
I think number of people is is it's
particularly challenging but to cherry
do you want to comment on any of these
Corrections
there will be small increases these are
not things that are going to be order of
magnitude changes the technology's not
going up with with the directions of
where
so there's a little bit of a Moore's Law
thing here which there's always
improvement but it's not dramatic sorry
charity
there's a bit of a consensus where we've
seen in the computer science fields so
many different sensors now that you have
to choose from and connect is
dysregulated particularly sophisticated
sensor integration
but there are many differences a census
to
these choices do have to think about not
necessary just because connects then
using it for a fifth person I there are
other senses that make if I was just saw
try and address the the very large
number of person problem at a distance
which it sounds like living may I will
be using computer vision using just
regular cameras I wouldn't necessarily
thinking about using tener connects is a
convenient technologist view but I don't
know that yet really brings you strong
values I'm not sure what the depths of
something like you just use a regular
visual camera may be multiple vision
cameras and forever
that means connect
that's true
any last questions before we take a
break
and how about
okay well just throw it to a close we'll
be able two questions for as long as
we're all here until this evening let's
take a five-minute break if you need it
yes well ways going to get set up so
there'll be a little bit of delay here
yesterday thank you for listening so far
thank you hope you're doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
