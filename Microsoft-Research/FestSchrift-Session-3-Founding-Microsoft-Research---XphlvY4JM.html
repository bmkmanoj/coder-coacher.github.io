hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
Nathan Merv old and like avi nason was
not able to be here in person so we
recorded some footage and did a little
bit of editing to produce the video that
you're about to see so Nathan Myhrvold
is currently the CEO of intellectual
ventures which he co-founded in two
thousand prior to intellectual ventures
he worked at Microsoft for 13 years
during which time he founded Microsoft
Research and he'll be telling that story
so let's see here is Nathan in 1990 i
started scheming as to how Microsoft
could have a research lab at the time
that was kind of a crazy proposition no
Silicon Valley company had a research
lab even though all of Silicon Valley
sort of came from Xerox PARC which was a
research lab and the contradiction was
sort of explained in a book called
fumbling the future which sort of
explained every 10 you should never
should have done Jacques shouldn't have
done this research lab even though
that's what gave rise to personal
computers and everything else so it was
kind of a strange environment to be
asking for research lab but I persevered
and i wrote a big memo on it and i
convinced bill and then everybody else
and so we were in business to have a
research lab only we needed somebody to
run it so I'd met Gordon Bell and Gordon
was both a guy who had had a great
history in research and he just might be
crazy enough to help out on this well
the second part was certainly to he was
crazy enough and he helped so Gordon and
I went on this pilgrimage around the
country meeting with some of the great
names of computer science to see could
we convince them to come to Microsoft
and run research and it was interesting
there's a lot of people that were very
famous that i had read their papers i
knew all about them and we come in and
gordon i would walk out and we'd be like
shaking our heads like oh my god no way
know how sometimes they would tell us up
front that they weren't interested of
course that was presupposing we were
interested we were interested in talking
to them so finally we decided to go see
Rick rash at at CMU and he was maybe
halfway through the whole process not
not all the way at the end the half way
through so we Pittsburgh isn't really on
the way to anywhere except Pittsburgh so
we go to Pittsburgh and we go we meet
with Rick and Rick was fantastic he was
funny he was had a great research track
record he he had a property that
actually I would find he kept all you
for years and years and years at
microsoft also where he could talk about
very high level computer science things
but he also would tell you how many
instructions a loop took cuz he knew cuz
he actually wrote the code now I
actually wrote codes I thought that was
kind of cool um a lot of these other
people had sort of gone on to what they
viewed as a higher plane of existence
where they could be a head of a
department or a Dean or a even a big
researcher in a big research lab and not
have to pet dude petty little things
like writing code well that was annoyed
me because we like wrote code for living
at Microsoft and if you don't love
writing the code how are you gonna
actually do anything else well Rick
clearly loved writing code but he also
still could be an academic of the first
water as as opposed to many of these
guys who thought that being a great
academic and being a great researcher or
a great research administrator meant
that they should never get their hands
dirty so Gordon and I walk out of the of
meeting with rick more like yes this is
the guy now wicked was sort of polite to
us and was a little bit with the whole
thing of course if you know Rick you
know that that's often the way Rick
seems a little bemused with the whole
thing because anybody is bemused with
pretty much everything but he'd not set
our expectations pretty low nevertheless
Gordon and I were
high-fiving it all the way out to the
car we drove like lunatics to get to the
pittsburgh airport so he wouldn't have
to spend the night there and the whole
way back for thing this is great this is
great we found the guy we're going to
talk to a couple the guys but we find
that found the guy so we make a formal
offer to Rick and he turns us down so I
call him up and say surely I can talk
about it he turns me down again I was at
a bookstore actually back in the early
90s we had these things called
bookstores I remember I bought this book
I still have it it's called getting past
know how to deal with difficult people
well I went through that damn book and
mostly it was about a kind of guy that
was difficult but wasn't the kind of guy
Rick was it wasn't clear it was really
there and so Gordon and I got together
and I started talking he started talking
of course Gordon interrupted me than
Gordon interrupted himself and we got in
a fever pitch at one point gordon says
we can't let him make this mistake we
owe it to him so he said okay let's
figure out what to do so we each wrote a
letter to him and Gordon was
particularly heavy handed in his letter
because he felt he could be pointing out
that if you are worked successfully
technology you can do all kinds of crazy
things like start Computer History
Museum's whether that was the line that
actually made the difference or not I'm
not sure but it was in there well damn
we got Rick to reconsider and that is
you know one of the single best hires
I've ever made in my life for hiring
somebody it was one of the single best
thing I ever did for microsoft research
as soon as jet is Rick joins microsoft
research we all of a sudden have to get
other people to join microsoft research
now i'd actually hired a speech
recognition group into my
soft research before Microsoft Research
existed so we had a few folks already we
had I had a group called advanced
development and so we had a few people
there but we really needed to build a
research team and so we then embarked on
a very similar sort of pilgrimage to a
bunch of places that Gordon and I had
done to say well who else can we recruit
how can we get them to come here and
some of those people said no much to
their later regret but gradually we
found people that we could convince to
come and one of the principles that Rick
and I developed early on in Microsoft
Research is we wanted to hire people who
I say that they were narrowly insane
meaning that they wanted to solve a
really hard ambitious problem a problem
that other people might think that's
that's kind of crazy you couldn't solve
it but you wouldn't want them to be so
risk seeking that they were totally
wacko you just want him to think their
problem was something they can make
progress on and one of the interesting
things in managing research as a result
in something rick became a master of is
of course one guy is working his problem
it's really hard but he thinks he can
solve it another person over here she
thinks she can solve her a problem well
you asking about each other's problems
oh no that's hard are you kidding
oh my god you may be able failed at that
that the same person who knows in their
heart that they can make their problem
work is deeply skeptical about everybody
else's that's what I meant by narrowly
insane they have to be sensible enough
that they can make progress and be
generally sensible people but they have
to be just crazy enough to think they
can do something no one on earth has
ever done before Microsoft Research is a
huge collection of those people
organized in a way that we could really
make some progress and my favorite
higher in the whole era was actually Jim
cacia you know before Jim we would have
people come and mostly there are people
I knew or people that Rick knew that we
would sort of heavily twist their arm
and come and we'd pitch for all we were
worth and talk about the wonderful
future and that was
fantastic and it was this very intensive
thing and it was really future tense
oriented okay it was we couldn't sell
him on the present we had to say hey
we're going to build this great thing
just just imagine it so Jim cacia was on
our list but what Jim wanted to do was
come and hang out for a week at
Microsoft Research I said Rick can
we do that I mean do we have enough of a
Microsoft researches isn't he gonna see
that the emperor has no clothes I mean
God we only have a half a dozen a dozen
people some of them are still unpacking
their boxes you know the this is
disaster no I think it'll work I said
then if it is a disaster he's going to
all each other I won't be able to go to
siggraph again because people all
snicker when I come in the room which
frankly they were doing before that but
uh so is this really gonna work and work
see how he had some reservations will
try it so Jim is there for the week and
he's scheduled to see me at like 330 on
friday and i'm hearing from rick and
from dan who was also trying to manage
the whole thing then it's going ok we
think it's going okay it's like well you
know that you seemed like this guy but
we're not sure so Jim comes in to see me
and he said so how did it go he says
well I thought we just cut to the chase
and try to convince you the five reasons
you ought to hire me god damn that is so
excellent I I made it seem like he was
trying to sell me a little bit but in
fact we had gotten over the hump enough
that it got like Jim cacia who is at the
top of his game had this great position
at Caltech the Chi after spending a week
with us he actually wanted to be there
that that we were moving from an
organization that was all about future
tense do something where we had a little
bit at least of present tense so that
was a terrific moment you know as we
started to build Microsoft Research up
to the point that we got research
publications remember the first year
that we were
we really had a big showing at siggraph
and we had gone from like nothing about
twenty-five percent of the conference
and you know then as other key
conferences came up suddenly we had
people who were there and there was this
amazing sense that was going to work so
as Microsoft Research progressed and
grew we got more adventuresome with the
things that we would research initially
we were to focus on things that really
part of the core software mission that
we thought was about Microsoft was about
but over time we said you know we could
have afford to spend some time on things
a little bit more theoretical a little
bit more out there well in the early 80s
I was a graduate student at Princeton in
theoretical physics and one thing about
theoretical physics in general but
particularly then is there weren't a lot
of girls in the class but there were
there too in in the class that I was
there and one was a Jennifer chase and
yeah although Jennifer certainly
attracted the notice of everyone in the
department he was only noticed from afar
because Jennifer's husband was also in
the class and he was a punk in in every
sense of the word he was a punk actually
Jennifer was too she would come to
parties wearing a black dog collar with
big thick metal sharp metal spikes on
him so you were in very intrigued with
Jennifer but but you're also a little
afraid to just flat out so as we started
looking at doing more mathematical and
theoretically oriented computer science
I was at the time on the board of the
Institute for Advanced Study and
Jennifer was visiting there so Jennifer
and I talked we talked about her
research we talked about a variety of
other things I went to visit her at UCLA
where she also was then again at the
Institute and I said hey Jennifer maybe
you should come to Microsoft and of
course this was his crazy fort to ask
someone who was at the time thought of
herself as more of a mathematician
really this is crazy to think about that
as it was to hire the original
researchers into into Microsoft in the
place but I persevered and I got her to
come out there yeah she got intrigued
which is but there's a problem my
husband and she said I've got this
husband but he lives in Germany really
how does that work she's well not very
well and of course while she's
describing Christian to me initially I'm
thinking yeah she sure can pick them
let's see what this one's like but in
fact we managed to hire both Jennifer
and Christian to Microsoft and they then
went and hired a whole bunch of other
people and we might management Microsoft
Research an institution that was not
just great at pounding out code is
anything wrong with that and not just
great about things that are fairly
fairly applied aspects of computer
science you're making a better operating
system or better file system it's pretty
easy to see how that directly would
benefit a customer so even if its
research is research that has a pretty
short path to application not so with
all aspects of abstract computer science
and discrete mathematics but in fact
many of those ideas even though they're
more remote they're also more powerful
and so they've become a part of the
whole microsoft research portfolio
because rick really was this great
combination of somebody who understood
computer science at any level of
abstraction that that you could imagine
but he also really like computers and he
really liked to code and he also uh
strangely this is one thing was quite
different like computers i like the code
to Rick likes people better than I like
people and so we'd have won a
frustrating personnel such a situation
another and Rick would always have a way
of dealing with it mean he'd have these
great set of stories we had a big issue
lunch with these people that were
bickering and so he told us the story of
the imaginary nickel his kids were
fighting in the back of the car and he
said you know you kids are squabbling so
much if I told you I gave one of you and
imaginary
nikhil you'd fight over it whereupon
this is exactly what they did well that
story was really useful in getting these
two bickering pretty high level people
at Microsoft to maybe consider they
should stop bickering and there was
something that was more at stake than
maybe an imaginary nickel another one of
the the favorite stories that Rick would
pull out we were talking to people about
the pace of technology is he tell the
story of one of his sons that would ask
him to tell a story before bedtime just
pretty much as a way of delaying bedtime
is as kids are want to do and then he
asked or he asked a question so he'd say
yeah well here's a question here's a
question so one night he stuck him in
and he said dad when you were my age did
they only have 8-bit computers and of
course recast explained actually he was
in college before he ever saw an 8-bit
computer baby c'mere was a hell of a
thing but to a child growing up then you
know 32 bits was normal so no matter how
antediluvian no matter how ancient dad
was he couldn't have been before the
8-bit era right but a court of course it
he was so over the years rick has been
incredible friend he's been incredible
researcher he's built microsoft research
into one of the great institutions in
the world and besides all of the value
that's given to microsoft myself
customers my gosh Cheryl's that's very
substantial research has made an
incredible contribution because the
ideas in research have changed the lives
of millions of people that was one of
the lines actually I used on Rick to try
to recruit him it didn't work but but
the line went like this if you want to
affect the lives of millions of people
Microsoft is the best place to do it
because if we have great ideas there we
can get them more clearly more directly
into products well it didn't work but
then it came and he made the whole thing
true so he actually did have effect
lives of millions and millions of people
so it's been an incredible experiment
this memo I wrote in nineteen
one sort of laid out all of the things
that research was going to do and almost
every one of them we did in the sort of
the highest level since it says will
open up one in Asia within 10 years we
did that it says will open up one in
Europe while we did that I said said we
consider other parts the world of course
we did I say we after I left in India
and a variety of other places even even
places like California we're at it just
just to show how how far we would go and
so it rick is yeah I just can't imagine
a better research executive than Rick
ration alright so that was Nathan
jennifer and Christian I hope you'll
forgive me for leaving in that anecdote
you know it was tempting to edit it out
and actually I really want to leave it
in so now we have Linda all right do you
have a mic yet window let me get you a
mic here's one you can put on alright so
Linda stone is a writer speaker and
consultant focused on trends and their
strategic and consumer implications in
1993 Nathan recruited Linda stone to
Microsoft after she'd spent seven years
at Apple while at Microsoft Linda worked
for Nathan Rick and Steve Ballmer and
she has a few remarks that kind of like
the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost
innocence I mean scary right so you know
perfect that I'm following Nathan here I
really think one of nathan's bet very
best decisions was to hire Ric and and
Nathan didn't exactly tell the entire
story of recruiting Rick I don't know if
any of you remember the whole Charles
simoni love bombing aspect of recruiting
no you don't okay well i think nathan is
probably busy patenting that process if
he hasn't already but there was really
there was a lot that went on and in that
particular and that particular recruit
so i started getting to know Rick when
we went to the Cambridge lab together
and I was along on a lot of meetings
with Nathan and Rick was assigned to do
a lot of Nathan follow-up which included
hours on the phone all night long with
people like Michael Friedman who
Jennifer chaise had decided Microsoft
really needed to hire and then Rick got
very involved in that process and you
know I was meanwhile with Nathan I was
mentioning this to Rick at lunch at
places like British Telecom where Nathan
and the CTO there we're talking about
world domination and could it be shared
or whatever anyway so as Nathan was
preparing to move into the CTO role he
at one point he he said you know he
didn't mention to me that he was you
know that things were shifting but he
said could you imagine working for and
he named a particular executive and
without thinking just totally uncensored
I looked at him and I said I can't work
for him he doesn't read fiction and you
can imagine Nathan looked at me and said
that's the most ridiculous thing I've
ever heard you guys have heard him say
things like that before you know what do
you mean and I only read one or two
fiction books a year anyway and I looked
at Nathan and I said you know it's kind
of about suspending disbelief especially
in research or with creative people if
someone only reads the Wall Street
Journal you know how dimensional is that
and so Nathan when he when he did tell
me that he was going to take a different
position in that and that I'd be
shifting to work for Rick he said Linda
he said you're going to be fine I know
this because Rick was an English major
and maybe maybe that's Rick secret that
he was an English major and along with
his incredible technical background
it makes for a really extraordinary
combination rick is very very capable of
suspending disbelief he's as Nathan
remarked amused by almost everything in
fact more often amused than stressed he
doesn't take himself or any of the rest
of us too seriously than that' nesting
lots and lots of wisdom and adventurous
spirit and Rick think we've all been
very very lucky to know you and work
with you over the years Thanks all right
Thank You Linda so next up we have Eric
and while Eric is making his way down
I'll introduce him so Eric Horvitz is a
distinguished scientist and deputy
managing director of the MSR redman lab
Eric joined MSR in 1993 along with his
colleagues Jack briefs and David hecker
minh you can pick
I think it's number four it's my on my
Mike tier just all right great thanks
thanks rich so in preparing the to make
some comments I was actually reading up
on operating systems last couple of
weeks and uh I found the learnings very
interesting I actually had a chance to
talk to Rick about some of the
principles and his thoughts and
reflections in working on accent and
later mock and he mentioned to me that
he came kington has come to know himself
over the years as someone who tends to
find similarities and things rather than
differences and that this leads him to
simplify complexity into parsimonious
sets of principles and in looking at the
work on accent and mock you see quite a
quite a beauty there in fact I really
enjoyed looking at this idea kind of
core concept of decoupling mechanism
from specifications of policy which
which hadn't been done very much earlier
almost that that was a kind of a trend
also a machine intelligence that
separately separate out knowledge bases
or domain-specific knowledge from the
pure parsimonious inference engines that
could be reused in a number of places
right around the time that Mauch was
blossoming into the open world we heard
mommy earlier as a platform that would
catalyze a great deal of innovation
shifted his focus from operating systems
to to formulating the operating
principles of a research laboratory in
computer science me executing on a dream
of a fundamental computer science
laboratory and formulated some simple
and parsimonious sets of principles some
are very explicit and rick talks about
them all the time and some are quite
implicit but there's still principles
that's the way this organization works
and he's not wavered on these principles
since the inception of MSR
any way that I can tell so moving from
accents and mock to my first encounter
along with earlier with Jack breeze and
david herman in july of 1992 when we
received a strange request to think
through David because David was high
school friends with Nathan Myhrvold
maybe we want to come up and talk about
the things our startup was doing at a
Stanford era grad school start up
working on bayesian inference we were
going to change the world we were
excited about that and here's a screen
capture thank david for getting this
video off the what have you got it off
of but the screen capture of rick
introducing me as a speaker lebryk was
young man there and i was so excited
about Bayesian Bayes theorem and I was
talking how wonderful that would be for
the future and then there's David Jack
and I reflecting about working talk
aspirin questions Kiba day after our
talk but we actually had no idea what on
earth Microsoft wanted with us was a
microsoft research team we said this is
that really what's a few people here and
they're all very nice and very exciting
and they've exciting ideas but where
were the David deck and I are the people
you heard about from Nathan just now
early intense arm-twisting era and of
people whom he knew in this case he had
known David and boy I just heard but
first time but that book that Nathan
read now I'm getting a better idea what
was going on that's like we can Jack and
David understand that this week Nathan
would not give up we were just not
interested in coming from Microsoft but
if anything the strange place to the
north of cool hip you know California
Avenue or start up at Stanford and so on
so but if anything moved us really
deeply it was the principles we heard
from Nathan and more so from Rick about
the idea of enabling some sort of a
platform for long-term research and Rick
made it very clear from the beginning
that that which is again we were in this
belief that the primary mission of the
organization would be to expand this
to the art in the areas that we do
research in at MSR across the breadth of
computing and at the time it didn't seem
like an obvious thing for Microsoft to
be doing but it turns out that this
unwavering commitment to fundamental
computer science makes a great deal of
sense in in terms of the transfer of new
ideas to such a large-scale operation as
Microsoft such a broad array of of
technologies and products and I've come
to really believe this and see how this
works in terms of pursuing the
fundamental ideas fundamental computer
science is the way to get to all sorts
of applications new kinds of products
and directions new ideas about services
and I've had this debate with people in
this room who are visiting today from
other places that this is not a crazy
idea they try to convince me otherwise
even today now so that's a big important
goal here and mission I remember this
really smacked me in the face when I
actually had my first review and Rick's
office my first annual review and I SAT
with him and I was so excited we had
come up come up here even though he had
done some I think some nice theoretical
work no dissertations when it came to
our startup we were really gung-ho about
getting stuff into the real world and I
was we were so stoked and excited about
stuff we do an office and windows and
how I was just chatting the storm with
Rick about how wonderful the the
engagements had been with the product
teams and Rick just listened and smiled
and thought this was all very nice and
so on but then said after a pause are
you sure you want to get the product
teams so used to this kind of service
these features and I mean we want to
think they'd be think water turtle
long-term I mean you might want to pull
back a bit I thought wow you he's
walking that you know the talk this is
like but let's really push on he's not
impressed by the stuff that we thought
would blow away somebody and maybe an
applied Peter science lab the actual
engagement who were
so really really underscored that for me
now you see here it says in the areas
that we do research and you say well
wait a second who decides about what we
do and I guess rictus mentioned on
Monday I Tuesday it was the public via
text fest we had he's asked all the time
well how do you decide what what area to
pursue and actually listen to a video of
rectus on Monday and he said that he
here so answers this question I don't
invest in specific research projects I
don't invest in specific areas I invest
in people we try and hire the best and
brightest people wherever we can find
them because that's what really drives
long-term research that's what drives
the innovation and breakthroughs so
these comments reflect another of Rick's
elegant organizing principles of the
operating rules of a laboratory identify
great people show them great trust give
them great independence and get out of
their way so as in mock policy would be
separated and in fact largely removed
from the mechanism of MSR so research
directions will be defined by
researchers themselves more generally
people throughout the organization we
treated like adults with respect and in
power to make all decisions and this
kind of distribution of responsibility
plays a central role in msrs personality
in all of our labs today such freedom of
decision making cuts down to the core
freedom of an academic scholarship of
publishing decisions people are often
surprised that there are absolutely no
controls on publications at Microsoft
Research there's no Tower of lawyers
researchers don't ask the research
managers can I publish this or that this
has been not only a fabulous reflection
of the way we
work but it's been an incredible
recruiting tool to hire the best and the
brightest because people seek the best
in election our field seek that kind of
academic freedom while being in a place
where the fulcrum is at the horizon and
the lever can move the world so let me
just mention a third and stated
principle that's others have mentioned
in passing I think it's a core operating
principle of microsoft research and this
is on positivity optimism playfulness
and humor you don't see that in our
slides we say what do we do it Mike we
know what is ms are about but it's
critical the importance of humor
lightheartedness and whimsy really
cannot be understated or underestimated
in an organization like Microsoft
Research for its health as well being as
productivity I've long been actually
impressed with the words of John Adams
if you look at the his reflection about
the Commonwealth he wrote thus far the
Constitution of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts he actually mentions that
the importance of honesty sincerity and
good humor among people in building a
nation and beyond the importance of in
the design of societies and Nations a
number of sites by psychologists have
found that having fun being a good
spirits laughing enhances creative
invention connections and discovery so
what Microsoft Research the the standard
the playfulness and lightheartedness
come right from the top I've always been
thrilled by what it's like to walk into
Rick's office let me do a simulation
haven't been there yet
I mean rick has the best collection of
Star Trek stuff you can you can imagine
he has a signed picture sitting with
james doohan Scotty who's live in
redmond and thank God you've made a
connection with with Rick before beaming
out and and you can go to the first
Halloween parties i went to at microsoft
there was Rick in full regalia as
Captain Picard beaming down for a brief
visit with his with his with his crew
his humor and spirit of lightheartedness
is is always on hand and permeates the
organization I have to say that we just
had a recent about maybe moving room
that's very clearly about 4-5 months ago
it was we had a researcher and a product
team person who had a difference of
opinion about how they would engage and
both sides wanted Rick to come up with a
policy Microsoft Research to say
something about this with different
opinions of course and i sat in on the
meeting and Rick was deliberating and
reflecting a bit about about this and
Rick said I could I could intervene I
can help you out here but you know why
do you make the decision yourself it's
really this really up to you and but if
there was agreement that would happen
Rick said the great words with great
power comes great responsibility i'll
see if thinking okay this must be fdr's
it john f kennedy you know and then with
a smile Rick said said bye spider-man
actually actually I checked into that it
was Uncle Ben who mentioned this
originally the spider-man so I'll just
say it before finishing up here that
another on the lightheartedness front I
would love walking past bricks walkathon
what happened to this poster but this
poster was outside box office for these
couple of years and it was just kind of
interesting that basically think about
the you know the the the pet the rules
here that comes from this poster all I
need to know I live out in life I learn
from Star Trek i love this poster they
contained important things of short
break agrees with like
non-interference is the best policy keep
your phaser set on stun and don't put
all your wrecking officers in one ship
however no doubt he agreed most deeply
with the main charter one that resonates
with the mission his mission and mission
of Microsoft Research which is to boldly
go where no man has gone before and on
the special occasion I my colleagues
like to say to Rick and Tim SR may you
live long and prosper stuff here all
right thanks Eric that was wonderful all
right so next we have Jim lares and
Jimmy should be up there something so
while Jim is coming down let me
introduce him Jim lares is a principal
researcher at MSR he recently returned
to the Redmond lab after four years in
the extreme computing group as their
director of research and strategy Jim
joined MSR in 1998 from the University
of Wisconsin where he was an associate
professor it's one of these many cables
and you can use the pc for set up there
countdown timers now let's try that
again
don't push the sleep button when you
mean to project always good advice so
just to provide a counterpoint to all
the discussions of operating systems
this morning I thought I would talk
about one of the other really big groups
and research areas at Microsoft Research
which has been software tools and
software engineering this is prepared
with help of a number of other people
Bob Davidson joerger rich and well from
Schulte it's actually very significant I
think when I put up some of the efforts
you'll see sort of the large amount of
impact this has had on both Microsoft
and the research community as a whole
you know one of the most interesting
things is that in this area our customer
our Microsoft not Microsoft's customers
and so unlike a lot of the parts of the
company we're actually dealing with the
people who are using the results of the
research directly on Microsoft's
products as opposed to doing it through
the intermediary of the product group
and I think one of the real values of
this work is that it demonstrated to the
company the value of having a research
lab particularly at various points
inside Microsoft's history where we had
great deal of trouble trying to get
windows 2k shipped dealing with the
security problems in the early 2000s MSR
was there with a lot of useful
technology things that wouldn't have
been a very hard for the rest of the
company to devise on its own a lot of
times you know you met people in a while
ago it's not so much to anymore and you
said you're from Microsoft and they
occurred p PRC not Microsoft because
where they would produced the tools that
a good number of the developers with
inside the company were very familiar
with and they said MSR but the words
were p PRC and then also point out that
it wasn't just an internal effort the
research agenda in the fields that I
came from programming languages and
formal methods was pretty well set by
the research that was done at MSR you
know we did some pioneering work on
fixing device drivers the community is
still working on fixing device drivers
and just came for now splotze this week
the one of the high rank papers there
was a survey of the linux device drivers
all 2,000 whatever of them looking at
them in terms of categories and so forth
and you know the large community of
people are still very much following in
the footsteps of work that was done here
originally um just go back look at some
of the early histories some of the early
groups inside MSR and I wasn't here so I
can't really put them in proper
chronological order was the ADT group
but with Bob Davidson who's still
sitting in the back there their tool BBT
which was called lego in the early days
improved windows paging performance by
basically taking all the code that you
never used like our handling and putting
it out of line interestingly it was done
so you could run on very small machines
four to eight megabytes almost
unimaginably small machines that problem
is still here the problem now is that
you've got to do this on your four to
eight megabyte l3 caches and you still
have the same problem as you had before
it just never gone away it's just
migrated to a different level of the
memory hierarchy you know Charles simoni
had the IP group which was looking at
improving programming basically in the
idea that you would want a
domain-specific language that idea is
still very current there's a great deal
of work on domain specific programming
languages these days in fact it's one of
the hot topics in several different
fields so you know this basically sort
of says that when you know Rick was here
and setting up Microsoft Research he was
picking the right problems these were
deep hard problems that we were trying
to tackle in those days Daniel wives set
up the SPT group which was the precursor
to the group that I set up the work they
did on scalable program analysis and the
ast toolkit was really essential to
Microsoft on the early 2000s when the
security problems came because ast
toolkit was the precursor to pre fast
which was the tool that we use to find a
lot of the buffer overruns in our code
you know I longer term effort says oh
and i joined Microsoft Research actually
in 97 I came for a year on sabbatical
and I should talk about Rick's
recruiting methods and so everybody
seems to have a story
so we're in building nine and you know I
had an office there I think I had an
office with an intern at the time and
you know several times a week Rick would
show up in the afternoon in the office
and just sort of sit down it's not start
talking to me and I thought this is nice
you know he's got a lot of time on his
hands to to talk to me and you know he
had this very interesting recruiting
strategy which I've never tried on
anybody but might work he you know I was
you know kind from the University ie I'd
used unix all my professional career and
so I was trying to figure out those
windows and visual studio and so I had a
large pile of programming manuals on my
desk and Rick would come in and say you
know I never used those I've never
looked at one of those programming
manuals you know I'm right you know
thousands and thousands of lines of code
but I don't even need any of that stuff
and I'm like thinking really how could
he do that he must know this stuff a lot
better than I do and he just sort of you
know intrigued me that there was really
something there to this windows thing at
the time which didn't wasn't quite clear
to me with my exposure to it and so you
know that and the combination of sort of
the research lab made it very appealing
to switch directions I hadn't been doing
software tools I looked around Microsoft
and so this great opportunity I set up
the SBT group and started trying to
answer the hard question as one of the
previous speakers said you know why were
the developers at the world's largest
software company using exactly the same
tools as you know undergraduates or
graduate students at a university who
were using free tools at the time we did
a lot of work on scalable program
analysis a whole new software analysis
technique called counterexample driven
refinement and then I think another
really significant thing we started
looking at the human interactions of
programming which is something that was
very different from the technical
analysis of software but extremely
important to really understand what the
root causes all the problems were at
roughly the same time Yuri joined MSR
and set up the foundations of software
engineering which was a much more
theoretical view of software engineering
and actually
very nicely complimented tools group
that I was running and Wolfram would
join very early on and then took over
leadership of it and they're at work on
executable specification and model-based
testing actually paid off about a decade
later when we gotten a lot of trouble
with the EU and had to document and
specify the windows interface is very
carefully and this provided the
technology that satisfied a lot of
Europeans and save microsoft our great
deal of trouble and obviously around the
same time we set up in eternal tools
group PPR see under amitabh which
produced a very large number of tools
that were pretty universally used with
inside microsoft for doing software
development in fact many of them still
are used with inside Microsoft you know
the combination of these groups really
were crucial at various points inside
Microsoft's early history you know
getting over the hump of shipping
windows 2000 dealing with the security
problems that came up helping to get
vista out the door and solving some of
the really hard problems there and i
think it's a real testimony to rick and
the other people who set up microsoft
research is that they were willing to
invest in what is I think an endless
quest to eliminate bugs and software and
that you know they picked people who
picked the right problems and these
problems actually really did pay off for
the company as a whole thank you
alright greats thanks Jim all right so
next we've got edolas aska edge already
has this mic and looks like you're
speaking without power point which is
great so edolas elska holds the Bill and
Melinda Gates chair in computer science
and engineering at the University of
Washington so they must be very
important ed is actually a founding
member of ms ours technical advisory
board I think offhand you must be the
only member to actually stayed on
advisory board consultant Raj was very
the beginning with Tanya yeah yeah so he
was me back now but or was it was back
for a while but anyway so it's still on
you're still going strong ed and I feel
like I'm in the control booth of the
Starship Enterprise here it's
unbelievably great so you know one of
the honestly the great privileges of my
professional life has been my
involvement with MSR since the beginning
sort of before the beginning Nathan came
to talk to me I hope it wasn't to reject
me as as the leader of this thing and
you know said that he had this loony
idea he was going to hire some guy who's
going to create a world-class
fundamental research organization at
Microsoft this is a typical Nathan esque
audacious idea and invited me to sort of
act as an advisor on that night I left
at the chance and Gordon was involved at
that time and it really has been a
remarkable now 21 years I guess and you
know the changes are astonishing so
within a year Nathan had recruited Rick
one of the problems as you go later in
the afternoon it's other people have
already said all of your comments but
you know this effort included recruiting
Rick's kids I'm sure you remember this i
remember nathan was on the board of the
of the Woodland Park Zoo and he would go
and procure enormous boxes full of zoo
paraphernalia and mail them to Rick's
kids in Pittsburgh I think when you're
being recruited by Nathan when he
decides that you're the one you'd better
be prepared for the full court press not
just on you but on the entire family
anyway the rest is history right in its
20th year Microsoft Research is clearly
the strongest
eating research organization in the
world and it's the house that Rick built
we heard about the recruiting of Jim
cacia a bit from Nathan there's a part
of that story that Nathan didn't tell I
remember that Nathan invited a bunch of
us over to dinner at his house and he
had recently acquired a BBQ rib that was
about the size of a city bus and Nathan
spent the entire day stoking the fire
and barbecuing stuff all in in aid of
showing hajia good time so this is
typical of what Nathan did and the sort
of recruiting skills that Rick inherited
anyway I'm not really going to talk
about the history I I want to talk about
the role that microsoft research has
played in strengthening academia and
Rick's role in making sure that that
happened and I'll give you a couple of
examples Eric Corbett's talked about the
fact that of course all the publication
4ms r is open and I don't imagine that
was a foregone conclusion I figure that
was a a principle that Rick laid down
early on and it's important to
understand that Microsoft's financial
investment in microsoft research on an
annual basis is about what the National
Science Foundation spends on computing
research right so you know it's a
significant amount of money it makes an
enormous difference to the worldwide
progress of the field and the fact that
essentially none of this work is
proprietary that almost all of it is
published in the open literature and
that MSR researchers all 800 and some of
them are part of the international
computing research community is just an
extraordinary contribution so MSR drives
Microsoft forward but it drives the
field forward as well and you know the
way I tell this story is if you go back
30 35 years the the computer science gdp
in the country was a whole lot smaller
and there were three big wedges AT&amp;amp;T and
Xerox and IBM each had major fundamental
research organizations and today that
GDP pie of the industry is far far
bigger butt of all those new companies
to first approximation only Microsoft is
making a serious investment in work that
goes out beyond one product cycle and
that's a remarkable contribution
when Nathan and Rick started this right
in 1991 Microsoft had just crossed a
billion dollars in annual revenue and
had 5,000 employees so Microsoft was not
at the time in a position where it could
necessarily afford an investment on that
scale so it was just an incredibly gutsy
thing to do to realize that Microsoft
was approaching the forefront of the
industry despite its relatively small
size and that meant that in order to
grow it had to move the forefront
forward so just a remarkable commitment
so Microsoft contributes hugely to the
field Microsoft Research and you know I
could talk about all the little things
which are really quite big the PhD
fellowship program the faculty
fellowship program the graduate women's
program the connect sdk internship
programs research grants support of the
National Center for Women and
information technology it goes on and on
but what I want to do is focus on Rick's
particular effort and MSRs effort to
build the strength of universities
directly and I'm just going to give you
two examples and then I'll be done the
first is blind from the University of
Washington when Rick first arrived here
we had a discussion about the University
of Washington's computer science program
we were a lot smaller than and a lot
more fragile and Rick made a commitment
that he would not recruit faculty from
the University of Washington and that's
a commitment that he has scrupulously
adhered to and it's extremely admirable
we're a lot stronger now we could afford
to lose some people but in 1991 that
wasn't the case in Rick realized and was
just emphatic that having a strong
program in Seattle strong academic
program was important to the region and
important to ms are so you know there
are lots of people in MSR from lots of
university former faculty members jim is
a great example and and rick has just
stuck to his to his commitment in the
beginning not only not to recruit from
the University of Washington but to do
many many things to make it a stronger
program and it's paid off enormously for
us Microsoft and Microsoft Research are
by far our single biggest strategic
advantage and together we're really
doing a lot to make the region a
stronger center for technology when i
moved here in 1977
technology here was bowing and some
electronics manufacturers and of course
the landscape has changed totally in
that time largely thanks to microsoft
and in computer science also thanks to
microsoft research i want to mention one
example to reinforce this in the late
1990s microsoft purchased a startup
company done by david Salas and a
faculty member of ours and they
purchased david along with that startup
company so that's the one migration of
UW faculty member to microsoft research
but Rick immediately turned around and
granted half of David's time back to us
alright and you know that that
relationship paid off years later in
collaborations with Rick Zaleski that
led to things like photosynth so you
know it's just amazing for us this same
sort of what I'll call enlightened
integrity was really evident in the
approach that Microsoft took in Asia
when MSR Asia was established in 1998
the chinese university system was still
in recovery and you can imagine that
there are three approaches that
Microsoft could take one is to extract
the few really top computer scientists
from Chinese universities to stack to
stock the lab another was to stock the
lab with expats and wait for the chinese
university system to improve and the
third was to take aggressive steps to
improve the chinese university system
and what MSR asia did is i think most of
you know is institute this program for
what we're called I think associate
researchers and these were essentially
postdocs some of the best graduates of
the chinese university system would be
brought into msra for a period of a few
years and then by and large return to
the chinese university system to make
their program stronger and so I think
Microsoft Research Asia again under
Rick's leadership deserves an enormous
amount of credit for the upsurge in the
computer science graduate programs at
Chinese universities so it's a clear act
of contribution to strengthening those
programs recognizing in the long term
that benefits the nation and the world
Microsoft is
well so the bottom line is rick has his
head screwed on right and we've all been
beneficiaries of that those of us in
Seattle those of us at Microsoft all of
you really the national and global
computing research community so rip
thank you very much for having your head
screwed on right thanks ed so now we
have Peter here he comes oh we need to
get your microphone back yep so Peter
Lee is corporate vice president of
Microsoft Research Redmond he started
MSR in 2010 so maybe the most recent
hire you're going to hear from today
actually after many years at Carnegie
Mellon and a short stint at DARPA great
thanks so it's a really fun to hear all
these old stories i started in 1987 at
carnegie mellon finish my PhD at
michigan and then was hired at Carnegie
Mellon and that's when I first met Rick
I don't remember my job interview with
Rick I remember distinctively my job
interview with satya I also remember the
most memorable job interview was with
Alfred Spector because after some
questions of a technical nature Alfred
finding out that I was still signal
single told me about the landscape for
single people is a very uh I didn't know
quite how to take that I don't know if
that was a good sign for my interview or
a bad sign that is good but of course it
didn't take long to become of course
very very familiar with what was going
on there and you know it was this it was
an amazing place at that time you
literally felt like
were coming into a place and living in
the future I remember vividly sitting
down in the first computer i got was
this strange workstation running the
strange thing called mock which at that
time I think was only sort of half
working I was trying to do things with
this language called scheme it was
really pounding on the virtual memory
subsystem which somehow as far as I
could tell wasn't really working at the
time and and we were running on these
strange file systems this thing called
AFS and it was all of this kind of semi
home-brewed stitch together research
software but we were dogfooding in fact
it was the first real experience with
dog food there so very very exciting
like Jim lares I wanted to provide some
counterbalance to all of the systems
stuff and in that year and 87 explain a
little bit about how my research career
started and then how is fundamental
influence in fact I would say that the
direction that my research career and
the successes I've had in research I
think would not have happened had I not
had the contact with the systems work
that that rook really played such a big
role in at CMU so let me try to paint
that over the picture and I also thought
well in light of all these other talks I
was going to talk about tech transfer
and a management talk and that's the
subject of my written contribution to
the fest rift but I thought you guys all
need to be subjected to some math here
and so I'm going to show you some math
all right so and all of this is a little
if you're an expert all I'm peppering
this with a few white lies here and
there but let me say that when i started
carnegie mellon 87 i was doing fairly
theoretical work and applied logic and
formal semantics and to just sketch out
a very simple logical system what you
see here are what are referred to as
inference rules so if you have
propositions the proposition is a
statement that can be true or false so
let's just call this ABC and so on and
then each one of these things for the
horizontal line is
a different rule where you have kind of
the preconditions above the horizontal
line and then what you can conclude
underneath the horizontal line so in the
upper left you have the simple rule if
you know that a is true and you know
that B is true then you know that the
logical proposition a and B is true so
it's a very simple kind of rule in the
middle top if you know that the
statement a and B is true then you know
that a is true and so on in the lower
left that's a little more complicated
one in the squirt back because that
means let's just imagine that AE is true
and if you imagine that a is true and
from that you're able to derive that B
is true then you know that a implies B
and so on ok so logicians and the kind
of work that I was doing as a PhD
student and then there's an early
faculty member at Carnegie Mellon was
this style of work now what I was
actually working on is in the domain
that part of which was called formal
logic and the word formal really for
systems person would beam can we write a
ASCII friendly language for writing down
math ok and that's what's meant by
formal logic and you can and so we'll
make a syntax and so if we have a
proposition you know logical statement a
and if we have a proof of that statement
P then we'll write in ascii p colon a
the colon means p is a proof of a and so
with that we can rewrite all of those
rules that we had before so let's look
at the upper left inference rule if we
have a proof p that a is true and we
also have a proof q that b is true then
underneath horizontal line we know that
a and B is true and you know for an I'm
going to use an asterisk just be a ski
friendly and furthermore we can have a
syntax for what does that proof look
like and so the syntax for that proof is
open parenthesis right down the first
proof for a put a comma then write down
the second proof for B and then close
parenthesis and that's that's the
utterance of the proof of a and B and
and then all these other inference rules
go the same way
alright so now we can do all of our
proof writing on a teletype machine and
so let's do some math so suppose we want
to prove the little tautology that a and
B implies B and a and so what do you do
well let's assume that we have a proof
that a and B is true we'll call that
proof x well then we know that we have a
proof that a is true and so the way we
write that proof is FST of X we also
have a proof that B is true and so we
write that proof s and D of X according
to those inference rules i showed in the
previous slide that means that if we
write down the proof open parenthesis
snd of x comma f st of x close
parenthesis that that is a proof of B
and a and since we started with this
assumption of the proof X then we have
the full proof of a and B implies bna
and I've written it here all right so
it's a strange way to do math but what's
wonderful about this and what I found
incredibly and in fact beautifully
painful about this is that that is a
piece of code in fact that's a piece of
code in a programming language called in
this case ml although it's the same type
system as the Microsoft programming
language of sharp and so proofs when
written this way our programs you can
actually execute them but most
importantly for a mathematician like me
checking whether a proof is correct is
simply type checking just your
garden-variety ordinary type checker
that you find your compiler can be used
to do type checking and furthermore you
can have a smart blackboard that just by
using a type checker every time you
write the next step of your proof you
can't go wrong the type checker will
tell you if the next step in your proof
is wrong and at Carnegie Mellon at the
time there were luminaries such as Dana
Scott and John Reynolds and and so on
who
had really laid out this field and I was
completely sucked in to this and that's
why I joined the faculty I in fact I
think this is so beautiful that this
must be the right way to think about
software if it isn't it's the cruelest
hoax by God that you could ever imagine
and so it's got to be the right way now
man in fact the Microsoft of sharp
language which has its origins in
microsoft research concludes the same
way and it's based on the same design
principles all right so what does this
have to do with Rick well so i came to
connie melon and I was kind of across
the hall from HD Kong and next to sach
on one side and eric cooper on the other
and Rick was just a little bit around
the corner them hall and i would get
questions about what is this stuff good
for anyway and i would learn something
but micro kernels and the kind of
beautiful modularity in operating system
design that will be afforded by this
portability and modularity advantages so
all of that was really beautiful and the
design was interesting to me because it
created value for mechanisms for
software safety and security in other
words the microkernel design would make
or show some greater advantages if there
were ways to safely inject code for
example into the kernel in ways that
would provide certain safety guarantees
and that idea completely changed the
direction of my research because i
realized at that point that these proofs
these types that were proofs of the
properties of programs in the context of
a microkernel operating system design
could actually have significant
practical value and in the mid-1990s
early to mid-1990s i changed directions
my work to focus on that and that led to
a long series of collaborations with
Bryan Mills who then went off to
during the startup called Amazon then
Doug or who double-dated with me and was
the best man in my wedding is now
running a big part of Google Seattle and
in Bryan Burchett he was running the one
of the operations here also and and then
Steve leuco who is in the Internet
Explorer team Dave card ed he's a midori
team here microsoft and and all of these
really directed towards developing
techniques to allow you to attach
certificates or provide other inherent
guarantees in code to have much much
lighter weight and more modular
operating systems and so the conclusion
is if you get too close to rick you end
up coming out to seattle in and ruling
some part of the world here all right so
let me just wrap up here for me that
direction of research made my research
career and I don't believe would have
happened anywhere else in any other
context I would not have gotten there it
has been and in fact the highest
accolades have not been in the
theoretical community but in the
operating system community such as with
the sig ops hall of fame award and at
Microsoft Research and this is something
i think that Jim lares really emphasized
it hasn't been just about systems
research it's been in everything from
graphics and AI machine learning as well
as software development in security in
fact some of the most important
practical outcomes have been in the area
of software development so let me
conclude there and just say Rick thank
you if I look back on it man I was lucky
to have run into your ideas I I don't
know where I would be today without it
great
thanks Peter alright so next we have XD
so XD is a chief architect in
Microsoft's online services division
also it has the title of distinguished
engineer there he joined Microsoft
Research in 1993 prior to that he was on
the faculty of Carnegie Mellon where he
worked with with Raj ready and others on
speech recognition there are multiple
plox here yeah I use you can use the pc
for this will piss a little courage when
you all right it's not protecting
all right okay and if he's my problem
when you use if you want to use the
clicker than you need to plug in USB
cable and countdown timers over there
okay thank you I think it's going to be
very hard for me to speak after Peter
because you know he is the guy running
research I was kicked out many years ago
I recover but i will try anyway you
know i joined microsoft research in 93
in a week had this wonderful
contribution to so many things i'm not
going to talk about that at all but i
just cannot resist to such ricocheted
i'm being she's beautiful picture you
know just for everything is there i want
to share some personal story of my 19
years and Microsoft so I joined the
research that was 93 created the team
was the most important thing Rick told
me so we went to the west and switch the
you know the cowboys who could have and
we actually build the team we had a you
know we were equipped so that was the
team we created 93 it's just amazing
many of the must be around today I don't
know if you can recognize some of them
and that's no that's the test you know
really most of knowledge really playing
very important role because of weeks
help because of the unbounding
experience of microsoft research in the
early days the second thing I want to
talk about is really the passion and the
vision Rick had and that had profound
personal impact on me and to so many
friends around me and just I remember
the division we had for speech was to
make a speech mainstream Rick really
inspired all of us we ship the first
speech API in 95 we were the first to
bring speech to the public and the since
then we have been shifting speech from
research since 2000 roughly ninety nine
I don't remember the date Microsoft
decided to establish the size for
product
our speech and we actually you know I
had the privilege to leave research we
really got a lot of help from research
we even embedded a host speech research
group into the product and that really
was a great example of practicing Rick
philosophy now the tech transfer is a
full-contact sports so over the years I
have been in research and out of
research I always remember the Rick's
philosophy take risks and look for art
and I was very impressed that that the
mission statement of MSR has not changed
for all those years one thing that I
remember actually I want to talk about
is really what we did I just social I'm
being again you know one of the things
that really caught my eyes was my pad if
you actually just watch that out my pact
you know you know also what app is
trying to do because the Chinese company
is shipping iPad they have real blocking
that company from using your pad I think
you know when you talk about long-term
research you cannot talk about long-term
research on tier you wait after 10 years
or so and my part of you you know you
have you don't know what it is that was
the research which started incubated
working with HTC in two thousand and the
Bill Gates showed this off in the CES in
2001 I've been what I talked about to
the press in two thousand we want to
sell this as a vision not only to
Microsoft but to the whole industry I
have no idea if you're Steve Jobs watch
that and they just remove them and from
that name I have no idea i can approve
that but that a vision leave down
because of the research we're doing
another thing i've really want to talk
about is really after i left the
research we have been working with a lot
of great italian cinemas on thanks to
Rick's leadership we are really think
about the next web in taxi metaphor
hypertext define what web interaction is
today that's text-based but moving
forward this hyper tag-based one is
really based on the touch based on the
entity based on the contextual
information you can explore and you know
browse search beyond the city box so we
have you no way this a lot of great
technology I think we have waited for
another year to talk about if the next
generation web B into action is going to
be happy tag-based or hypertext space so
this is the picture I took when we
celebrated our achievements and I think
the dealership is really what matters
that inspired all of us and helped all
of us support it all of us thank you
