welcome to my hometown I shall grew up
here and went to school here spending
many my formative years here so it's
really glad to have actually have the
faculties and the distinguished guests
from all over the world come here to
Shanghai for this faculty summit we have
one hour for this session it's about
Internet of Things and what I'm going to
do is to spend a minute to to talk a
little bit about some of those the
historical background I think it's
useful to actually where we discussed
the future and the potential
opportunities is searching useful to
think a little bit about history and I
think as such Chuck Thatcher etihad a
very nicely done in the earlier session
is that you know I am reminded by Gordon
Bell who are many of you know that who
is a pioneer in computing and earlier
worked as a chief designer for the for
the effects machine at the deck and that
good umbrella tree posits that every
decade or so does a new computing client
device come to to life and from the
earlier say you know 1960s the
mainframes to the mini computers to the
personal computer and a 2ds increasingly
smaller and cheaper and and more
affordable devices such as you know the
smartphones the cell phone devices and
what gordon says is that one of the
things that's emerging is sensors or
networks of these embedded sensing
devices now the sensors edge accounting
various forms you know the one name that
people have been using to refer to this
field is why the sensor networks there's
a few other names and other devices such
as I fib these are radiofrequency ID
tags you know tiny electronic tags that
you attached to objects that if you
actually shine a electromagnetic way to
that it will actually send you a various
information about what the tag has
recorded more recently they also this
ocean of cyber physical systems now
cyber-physical system referred to these
collection of these sensors and more
importantly there's also actuation
devices so in a sense it actually
combined sensing and the computation
reasoning with actions on the physical
world so it's in sometimes occurs in a
loop of the FDA system now this entire
field of sensors and stats CPS and so on
often the time also referred to as I OT
the Internet of Things so this is the
topic of today's panel discussion a few
years back the Stanford Research
International had published a report it
describes a few of these interesting
application scenarios and also it
predicts some of those future
trajectories or possible trajectories
for the IOT technology and it can
clearly tell that that the technology LG
starts with some niche areas areas that
has to do with for the ample supply
chain management tracking goods
inventories warehouse you know in a good
set of movement and the two things like
surveillance securities so these are
able to say very niche very vertical
areas where sensors i phi these IOT
technology could find its home now as a
technology become more and more mature
you expect that that's going to actually
move out to reach more and more audience
in particular to reach the consumer
market so things like locating people
locating objects and to be able to
actually play a critical role in health
care in transportation in things that
has to do is actually helping people
managing daily tasks interacting with
the world go about doing things so this
is what one of the prediction of IOT may
come about in the next step 10 to 20
years now with all these different
terminologies of sensor net RFI these
CPS the
cyber physical systems and the Internet
of Things what I think some of the
really interesting components that as a
research community as technologists that
we need to actually think about I really
three things I think the first is really
about these sensor devices you know
whether these are taxed these are tiny
wireless sensor modes these are notes
that need to be affordable because you
actually wanted to deploy quite large
number of them if you want them to be
small in many cases because the form
factor H matters in those cases and in
many cases also you're going to operate
untethered so you need that should be
very power conscious or power efficient
and you want them to last for years
without human have to a change battery
and to replenish them I think the second
part is really important to think about
how you're going to network all these
points or these devices together to be
able to collect the information to be
able to act on your physical world so
isolated points the sensor nodes are not
very useful unless they are choked
collected and become an ensemble that
you be able to sense a fairly large
patch of the physical world that we
interact with as in the same piece
that's I think probably the most
important one is really about the data
the device is going to get a lot of
these real-time information about
environment around us and how do we turn
these multitude of those signals into
very valuable insights about the world
and more importantly something that we
can act on now two things to keep in
mind when we actually think about taking
technologies from research from the labs
into innovations that are into the real
world applications is to actually think
about some of the things that the golden
belt mentioned in the earlier slide is
that when technology come about to be a
mass production you need something
that's called a standardization that
allows innovation to occur in parallel
on different parts of this entire system
so that when all these things come
together
can work with the community to find the
interfaces so I think that's one of
those that really key ingredient he
actually for us to think about when we
actually think about I OTS and the
applications I think the other ones
really think about the driving
applications a few killer applications
is really important to actually move the
field forward to be the ecosystem of all
these different things from hardware
components to the design communities to
the people who are writing apps and the
developed tools for for supporting these
so with this i'm going to introduce our
distinguished panel we have four
panelists and they are David color from
UCLA I'm sorry from university of
california berkeley and a heyday from
carroll university japan and professor
turn gray high from nanjing university
and a Katherine ray England from
Microsoft Research remnants so let us
say invited the appendix to come to the
stage
this
and at the app the first step panel
presentation is as to be given by a
David color and a very quick
introduction of with David David is a
professor of computer science and also
the chair of the computer science
division of our UC Berkeley and he's
going to talk about the intelligent
energy and how I OT sensors a technology
like this could actually change it away
we think about energy production
transmission and consumption so is that
David
wireless sensor
and I take it the that time is not not
just mine thank you so in in large part
in my view the technology of internet
working devices embedded in the physical
world we've been working at it for 15
years it's largely from a research point
of view a solved problem which is that
really to say that the technology now
gets to live in the world and make a
difference and that's a lot of the
emphasis that I'm going to take here if
you step back and think for a second at
the electric grid a paragon of the
Industrial Age and industrial age design
amazing the way we produce this precious
commodity and deliver it through an
energy supply chain from generation
transmission distribution and demand to
millions of customers over thousands of
miles and oh by the way nobody ever
places an order there's no inventory
anywhere in the supply chain you know
synchronize phenomenal accomplishment of
a world when energy was cheap and
information was dear so in some sense
that's the situation's been reversed we
see the fragility of this as we start
thinking about going beyond a carefully
controlled portfolio of generation
supplies what we call dispatchable
resources to renewable resources the Sun
shines when the Sun shines the wind
blows when it blows that this notion
that we can carefully generate supplies
that are tailored to a predicted demand
starts to disappear the only way we'll
get the overall system to solve again is
if you can imagine creating a new kind
of load a set of dispatchable loads that
are able to consume energy when it's
available hopefully in precious amounts
and in order to do that fundamentally
that means that they the loads need to
begin to communicate with the supplies
the supplies need to be able to
communicate with the loads in effect
that we start to think about an energy
network rather than just an energy grid
so this is a set of questions that for
the last few years we begin
investigating in the locale project
that's both localized and hopefully
low-calorie
in that sense at Berkeley I wanted to
just give you a sense of that in a
couple of minutes to T this up so
question here is where to start how to
start how do we begin to transform these
fundamental institutional
infrastructures one answer is buildings
three quarters that electricity is spent
there so you know like banks that's
where the money is so you might start
there it's about half of the overall
footprint and doubling it is also where
many of the from a greenhouse gas point
of view that the most serious sources
are used it's also the primary target
for renewable supplies much easier than
cars they stay put their predictable
their great big sources so in some sense
we're both focusing on the network and
the clients of the network of which
buildings are the dominant one so then
how do we start so we might imagine
we'll go build a complete new electric
grid from scratch and how many decades
will that take the answer is no and so
the real message of my talk is that the
internet way of thinking about large
scale system design is going to be as
influential as any of the technologies
that we develop along the way and for
example the internet began as an overlay
on the phone network well the grid
exists the internet exists the future
energy network in some sense already
exists if we think about it as an
overlay on both of those networks that
map down to where we can talk about
energy subnets we can talk about
horizontal layering we can talk about
technology transformation and we utilize
the underlying grid to move the
electrons the underlying internet to
move the bits in fact the way that we
can begin to innovate rapidly because
the other part of the Internet is
distributed innovation is to take that
all the way to begin thinking about
virtual private grids where you get
collections of sources classic portfolio
resources renewable and communities of
loads that actually work together and
communicate the real issue here is
bringing in a style of design
were rather than vertical integration at
some particular point of time which
dominates things we begin to think about
horizontal stratification around a
narrow waist we think about how is it
that we structure the design so that
while it may be suboptimal at any point
in time technology underneath can evolve
rapidly with the existing body of uses
and equally importantly the new
applications can come into existence on
the technology and that those can now
drive forward in a virtuous cycle and
one of distribute innovation this is a
sense of some of what we put together we
focused all the way down yes of course
little teeny devices the thing that you
left you see is an internet-capable very
high-quality digital electric meter we
can sense anything but of course all of
the legacy equipment in skatin networks
and the rest of it need to be brought
into a common web-based infrastructure
and the sense on the right is the huge
innovation of application development
Facebook yes becomes place book for
buildings undergraduates taking cell
phones you point their camera to extract
a QR code to get the energy consumption
of the building the environment the
things you care about this rich body of
information which now it begins to give
you a framework for optimizing in a
context where things are what really
matters with that I think I'd like to
stop just end with the concept that each
of the endpoints need to monitor model
and mitigate their demand the smart grid
is smart endpoints with a dumb core and
that can communicate to supplies and
front supplies so that forecasting
tracking marketing and conforming to
availability price become the norm
rather than the exception as it is with
all of our other networks thank
thank you David our next step plantation
is by Professor he dated kuda professor
tokuda is the Dean of the Graduate
School of Media and governance and
professor of the faculty of environment
and information studies at the KL
university his statement presentation is
a sensor enabled cyber physical coupling
for everyday objects ok thank you thank
you very much for our kind introduction
my group have been working on ubiquitous
and pervasive computing in last 10 years
and then in five minutes I trying to
talk about sense i enabled cyber
physical coupling for everyday object
when i was in carnegie mellon many years
ago I was working with Rick ratchet and
I was very happy to see him again I did
notice he we had the same type but
anyway my main question here is is
literal or costs while a sensor node is
better than RFID or not in terms of IOT
some people think about RFID but claim
here is I argue that coming future
ultra-low-cost while a sensor node is
much much better than RFID let's look at
my old work this is about five years ago
we attached a bunch of local sensors to
every object maybe one is like orange
like this no one by though and who is
the sensors but we wanted to attach
everything okay then not only the
traceability of the object we really
look at the state of the object in the
real
space so in some sense we did you would
like to look at the data object or
everyday object in our deal space okay I
classified into the following zones at
the bottom you can see the deal space at
the very end you can see the body and
then do we call the a zone and building
we call the bezel and then out the door
in season and then outer door and then
these on the DS DS on these stands for
disconnected zones C stands for
connected zones when you create the many
services we really would like to go back
and forth between to some cases some
services are available only under
seasons where you are connected to
internet or connected to the GPS so the
season is most easy to implement the
services but we really would like to go
back and forth okay another aspect is
suppose X is object like this water
bottle of water you really would like to
know this water comes from where so as
Frances if I have a mobile phone I can
look at the QR code and the one click
away I can get the attribute of the
other object in a cyberspace so the
cyber physical coupling is indicated by
this kind of bad culero at the same time
if X is location like a Shanghai why is
the airport I really would like to move
from X to Y I have to search the past in
the deal space by looking at the Google
who are being you can look at the past
from location X to location Y so these
are the one is the attribute of object
or state of object data type is like
movement of the object and many things
you'd like to couple by cutting the
between two object running their space
one in cyberspace you did you'd like to
create
services okay so my concern for the
future internet of the things is by
having a literal low cost what a sensor
node may create better services better
innovations so so my answer is yes for
better cyber physical coupling so let me
look at the some of the services we
created five years ago it's called the
smart object services UK applications
these things are challenging ones like a
binding problem in ordinary house we
have northern few thousand items if you
attach neutral low-cost sensor node to
every object how can i bind between two
and then how can you deploy yourself Do
It Yourself deployment how about privacy
issues who are personal behavior
modeling monitoring and a lot these are
the technical issues we have some scheme
for the spot and snap these are the
object these are the web camera and then
with the light when you take a photo of
this kind of object we call the smart
object which should with the light and
then these are other sensors but only
this sensor will have a high body in a
light sensor okay then we capture at the
same time we capture the still image so
we transfer that yellow space to the
risk real space to the cyberspace so by
having this kind of beer you can see the
state of the object if you turn off the
room light you can see everything is at
the bottom okay so let's look up the one
example here
you care with you care users can watch
over elderly person living alone you can
oliva's usage status of elder person's
belongings to users who are his or her
family or caretaker these are the tiny
senseless
so this is for debugging mode but all
you need is behavioral model once
something is different from the ordinary
case you can send a lot message to him
continue to care users may recognize
elderly persons of normality whether
there is difference abuse estate is
compared with use of stairs
alternatively you here is a potential
provide an ordinary communication
between Holly and elderly person okay so
these are many years ago nowadays you
have a social media so you can this
event yes and then you can have some
kind of little mining we should be ace
much better sophisticated the services
so let me stop here and then pass
through the next speaker thank you
Thank You tokuda son our next speaker is
a professor hungry hi from Nanjing
University and he's going to speak on
the internet things in China some of you
probably heard that the in China does
actually a terminology in Chinese is
called omoi which is the older age in
the last year or so and of course
there's a lot of people behind it is
actually working on the research park so
professor saying is going to talk a
little bit about that
and that is energy animated model so i
come from local universities i'm going
to talk about to the internet of scenes
in china first I Queen Maya present
understanding the internet of things I
think the Internet of Things is going to
make everything as intelligent as our
people so the Internet of Things should
have the four basic functions such as an
earring sensing processing and
communications for doing that is to say
everything should have and then for
assessing I think everything should have
sensing ability just an where you have
five sensing organs for processing I
think everything should have processing
ability as we have blamed for thinking
for communication everything should be
connected for communicating as we have
can use the language to talk to each
other in human society so my I can give
a simple definition of IOT that is IOT
is a communication network connecting
things which have them in sensing and
processing abilities accordingly based
on the four basic functions we point up
to the four fundamental challenges which
you are determining we are determining
the future of the Internet of Things we
further consider four challenges we can
have more issues under each challenge
due to thermal imaging I have to go
schiphol with details next this is about
two sins in China maybe you once you
have heard since in China because our
internet of sins is very hot currently
in China you know 2009 is especially
event for Europe for Internet of Things
because our Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao
visited who she said Russia city in
Jiangsu Province in ox the seventh nine
2009 he made a very important speech in
the proposed that since in China why do
we need a sense in China because there
are many other countries for example of
Navy neighboring countries Japan and the
career have some similar actions also
United States as the smart planet
accordingly our channel should have some
similar action some national level
action because it is a scientific the
year I mean that science is the most
dominating factor for growth for growth
of economy China has become in the
second largest economy so our channel
should have is all strategy to continue
its economical growth that's why we
would have since in China to do
something along the developing internet
rural scenes in China we have determined
to build a center for single scenes in
challenging ug city the government has
already some very detailed plan to build
the center of sins in China actually
China many departments is following up
with our premier wen jiabao
importing the speech for example unless
air for has already discussed with some
very important topics of all the next
ten years among this list we can see
since in China and CBS and the something
like that as a professor in China we
usually have three channels to apply for
research funding they are National
Science Foundation's and Ministry of
Science in the technology and the
ministry of industry in the information
technology all of such departments have
set up special projects or internet of
sins also universities in China are
acting you see Nanjing University of
posts and the telecommunications is the
first the university to establish
ecology of Internet of Things just the
one month after Premier Wen Jiabao made
an important speech also just not long
ago the Ministry of Education has
approved 30 universities have the rights
to establish the ecology of the internet
of things
I think for the future I have one
prediction and maybe in the near future
we will have the University of Internet
of sins because here is the reason we
have three alleles for the internet of
things they need called revelations of
many departments such as computer
science communications and control and
the electronics button these are the
small videos I proposed dicks real ales
which covers technology economy and the
culture we need a white cooperating of
experts not only coming from native
science and technology but also coming
from social science economy and the
business owning in this way we can
support we can realize our regime we can
have some hundreds or even hundreds of
billions revenue from the internet or
since industry so today we come together
but this is just the beginning we need
to keep together in order to gather the
progress most importantly we need to
work in together we need to the white
cooperating of expose coming from our
experts or our fields to ensure the
final success finally aubergine one day
everything is a computer or everything
is a piece of service our computer
scientists to shudder what paired with
other people for the gym for this gene
for the internet of things singing
Thank You professor t'en our next
speaker is a Katherine baingan and she's
a partner software architect in the
microsoft research in science group and
she'll speak about assigns and a sensor
data Thank you Thank I've been asked to
use the microphone there we go I wanted
to say a few words about how the
Internet of Things is changing not only
how we go about doing science but also
the science that's actually being done
for the past year I've been working with
a number of collaborators attempting a
very modern sort of science synthesis
science now synthesis science is really
two different aspects first it uses a
lot of data from a lot of different
kinds of places shown on this slide is
the data that we're using for one of our
computations it includes sensor data
from the flux net group it's a number of
towers around the world it includes
field data people going out digging pits
taking tree rings as well as historical
events such as fires it includes
satellite data from the NASA website it
includes the results of computer
simulation because while satellites are
great they don't see well through clouds
you have to get Phil simulation is the
way of doing the gap fill it also
includes two different categorical maps
that have been assembled by group wisdom
over the past century one associated
with the current plant coverage and the
other a climate classification so lots
of different data all coming together
the other characteristic of synthesis
science is the breadth of the science
one of my colleagues says physics wins
but biology is how you work it the
collaboration that I'm working with has
Bayern meteorologists plant scientists
soil scientist
I thought at first they were all the
same in fact they're all quite different
our ability to work together is what
enables computations to span the
disciplines and lead us to new
understanding one of the examples of the
internet things is the availability of
data we've been running flux date org
since about 2007 when a collaboration of
400 scientists around the world got
together donated data to build a global
sensor data set for carbon client
climate science that's really
understanding how plants interact with
carbon change you can see the network of
networks it's 400 well actually 500
sites these days it's as far as i know
the larger census data a sensor database
on the planet from academic sources if
you know of one please let us know the
year was common processing each Network
maintains its autonomy here in Asia
there's Asia flux and co flux co flux in
Korea Asia flux here in China there's
also Oz flux down in Australia I'm
showing you one of the sites in the
Chinese plaintain a key learning here
was that in addition to making data
available it's extremely important to
enable virtual conversations between
scientists formula scientists are
working on this data many of them have
not met one another we communicate we
track papers we share information and
share data learning through the
communications portal looking today we
began work the science computation I
talked about in the first slide that's a
case where we cannot simply move the
data to the desktop it's extremely
important to move the computation to the
data given the size of the data so we
built working together a four-stage
processing pipeline the first two stages
are common and hide all of the grunge
associated with the geospatial look up
temporal download
a harmonization of the imagery from the
scientists the scientists see only the
last two stages we added the last stage
because we realized that when you do a
computation at the kind of scale that
we're doing it's important to derive the
scientist artifacts the graphs the maps
that you see here also in the cloud also
at scale when I think about the future
the challenges that Internet of Things
is presenting to us is how to work
together once we have done a computation
that is at the global scale how should
we interpret it I grew up in California
I can look at the California map I have
knowledge of California on a very little
knowledge of what the rainforests really
look like at the level of detail the
same thing is true for our results in
China how do we work together to
understand the results to take the next
step for science how do we engage with
the machine learning community so that
we don't have to become machine learning
experts and secondly one of the things
that we've realized is the dominant cost
by far is people not computers what does
it mean to do science when computers are
free thank you
Thank You Catherine so we have just
heard the opening statement from our
panelists ranging from the interesting
really harvesting these rich data sets
from all these sensors for scientific
research to in some of the interesting
applications such as the energy problem
that the David had been identified as
well as the having sensors in everyday
objects that can interacting with the
you know healthcare and other things and
all the way to opportunities that the
nation's government satirized to seize
these these IOT technology in order to
achieve gain advantaging economic growth
so with that we actually have we have
about 20 minutes for the audience to ask
questions and have a dialogue with our
panelists and I believe that there are
microphones that we have two microphones
hold them out by all staff please raise
your hand you have a question on the
back room will be to your head all right
so you see in the aisles there are two
microphones being passed around the
first question yes yes I'm cheating from
national chiao tung university I think
the speakers have covered many things
like energy science and health and even
internet hand so the title of the pen
know is called Internet of Things which
may in price that our internet might be
the protocol for connecting all these
things so I'm wondering are do we need
to make any change to the current
Internet Protocol the current internet
structure or maybe software on to make a
IOT passport in the future thank you
great so we
two microphones at a table and I'll have
the panelists that take take a turn to
share their thoughts David so I think I
I probably need to lead on the response
to that I've spent the last two years
chairing a working group in the IETF a
new experience for some of us so the
short answer is the Internet Protocol
already has advanced in fact I think
we're going to look back in 2010 will be
really the the watershed year in some
sense we spent 15 years in research as
Andy Grove said letting chaos reign and
we have now reigned in the chaos there
were probably half a dozen really
important changes we had to make within
the IETF body of IP protocols and next
month in Beijing the ripple protocol out
of the role working group will be nailed
down before long i triple e 15 4e will
nail the link layer so the answer is yes
modifications had to be made they have
been made and now that real explosion of
industrial activity can take off because
there's a foundations to start with just
to add that David is co-chaired the IETF
working group on that sensor net proto
Coast based on IP i guess i should say
it's routing / low power and lossy
network so it includes power line and
many other nasty links i have a very
short quiz show dancer but my answer is
yes and no if you look at the many
information appliances in the house each
vendor have a different type of
protocols for collaborating among
different types of appliances so yes
between object and object where you may
say machine to machine interaction space
we need higher level protocols we still
need unified machine to machine or
object to object to object protocols but
in terms of transport layer or link
layer may be well prepared in some sense
but in the long run we may need the
future internet protocol overall all
this credit for this question answer is
we need a new protocol for the internet
of sins at least tcp/ip first rate is
VIP have already been used for many
years but for the past three years
tcp/ip Technic considers a resource
limitation in the Internet of Things
everything is limited so for example we
cannot have baffling for sending and
receiving data we cannot use silly where
handshaking for reliable transmission so
tcp/ip are seeing is a heavy burden for
the Internet of sins so we need to some
new protocol to replace the tcp/ip in
the future thank you I'm going to be I'm
going to respond as a user all I know is
you can't take back what I have today
yeah there's there's been many a times
where we bet we bet against IP if you
have won that bet if you will win it in
the future in fact even today we have
very high quality low power TCP and UDP
and of course what happens is that where
TCP doesn't end up being the right
solution then you end up building an
application specific protocol on UDP and
what's so powerful is that you have a
homogeneous ation across a wide body of
underlying link technologies and that
you can bring together different
information representations regardless
of what link you care that is such a
powerful way of thinking that separation
that you know the Internet is dead or IP
is dead long live IP I would be more
than happy
I'm sure that well back be back here in
ten years and I'm quite sure that UDP
and ID and TCP will be down in ten
billion of ninety percent of what the
internet is like in its variants that
will evolve but I also agree that
Katherine's right it's really all about
the data that that's where the value is
and that you need to make sense of it
makes sense out of context make sense
out of the representation of it and that
that's where the it real importance and
ensuring continued access we spend a lot
of our time harmonizing what is very
different services so they look as
though they're the same let's take a
another question from audience looks
like a where do that one and then two
deer to the left oh yeah I'm from the
Chinese tourists or Hong Kong my
question is that I think could you
please stand up said that you know the
IOT thing is science i think we all
appreciate that but I think more to that
is and technology is an engineering
problem and then one of the thing in
popular popularizing this particular
technology is actually on how to promote
it in the society for example like
changing the protocol for example using
ipv6 for example I would like to know
how the panelists the respective
countries handled the sort of
application problem what you promote IOT
in the industry
anyone from the Pentagon to take it up
well then I will lead the first answer
then I guess each industrial segment has
a momentum some company Bay eager to
move on to ipv6 because of large amount
of devices they would like to install
some company very much happy with the
private IP before and so on so for
instance some of the RFID based
applications some companies periyar for
instance one interesting application is
you have a many clothes and that they
embedded the stick type RFID to the
clothes and when you watch the things
you can actually easily inventory you
know what clothes should be fair and so
on so the large amount of clothes
controlling the location and so on they
use the stick type RFID and some of
applications actually you can live with
the current IP v4 and v6 and they again
each industrial segment has a different
culture some company just stick with the
private ID and that's fine but some
companies they really would like to have
a global address then you have to move
on to the v6 and so on fortunately some
of the Japanese ISP providers they
support some of the v6 traffic and then
again if your ISPs are very conservative
then maybe it's very difficult to
penetrate into the nationwide and so on
but what about the government is the
government doing something because if
you if it is a bit is a commercial deal
is usually they are not interested in
investing these are a very risky thing
you really need some kind of government
support I mean however other government
so I think there are a couple of pieces
of the question I'd like to go back to
the beginning of it
when you observed that there's a
relationship between the technology
we're talking about the Internet of
Things and the role of science in
serving society and I think that's the
more important one than the plumbing
that's here that fundamentally what this
technology has done is introduced a new
kind of scientific instrument let's call
it a macroscope you know when we have
the telescope we came to understand the
laws of the heavens when we had the
microscope all of a sudden diseases were
things we could visualize where Theory
far outpaces measurement that
relationship now is turning around and
that's where the real value is is you
know it's like the Dewey Decimal System
is meeting Google in so many of these
domains that have been extremely limited
in their information content up until
now and I think it's a much more
powerful driver if I could say a little
bit more as well David in addition to
just sharing data we work on it in a
national group so the language barrier
is a very real problem when we want to
do science together the internet enables
communication not only through email
very often the simplest way to actually
communicate with someone with a
different language but also by being
able to post pictures post graphs post
even simple movies to help communicate
across time space and culture okay let's
take a next question from the audience
there is a question from yeah yeah yes
she'll find jake microsoft research so
actuation has been mentioned many times
as a important part of Internet of
Things so however unlike sensing where
there are really a few only a few
different modes of sensors you can often
actually integrate a lot of these
sensors in a single mode for actuation
it's often device specific so my
question to the panel
are what is the approach or the right
approach so that we can finally reach
this sort of the final layer of internet
internet of things to complete this
feedback loop any want to take on this
question about actuations integrated
into this network of sensors okay on one
example you are working on is hooking up
robot into the Internet of Things indeed
robot can actually open your door or
move around in a real space and then do
many things however the people who are
controlling the robot doesn't have a
universal communication protocol or
coordination protocol so I agree with
you in some sense by creating the better
CPS system we need more coordinated
protocol suite for coordinating the
actuators in that space okay so it's on
the way I think many companies trying to
in terms of robot trying to unify some
of the collaboration protocols so you
can or even in the building's if I want
turn off that light it's not easy right
now so there are issues but again many
things will be collaborated together and
you in terms of standard and so on okay
I think the one thing I add is that once
you have actuators in a network you
typically actually have a very
interesting loop that's close that that
is that you're taking the data you make
sense of it and then you act on it so
sometimes if this is a very critical
piece of information you have to act on
within you know a fraction of a second
the other is actually really draws a lot
more power than actually sensing in many
modalities so you have the more mass you
have to actually go about moving things
so think about no power initiation is
actually one of important issues there
I'd like to take that question on a
couple of other places so we tend to
focus and I think your question focus on
the specific actuator the transducer the
the key lesson i think is its layers of
feedback system so in fact today that
mean at the lowest level in fact
actuators are quite simple most of them
are binary and few are linear that's the
direct feedback the direct control
system invariably sophisticated
complexes of things are what are called
supervisory control we're really about
coordination and those are in some
larger control loop about how it is that
we schedule they use for example this
room is now full of a lot of people
whereas 20 minutes ago it had had nobody
so the real important thing is that
these layers of interacting feedback
loops come together not that it's
difficult to turn something on and turn
something off in fact if anything we've
lived for a hundred years trying to
match the transfer function of our
sensors to broken actuators so that
things were stable in a mechanical world
what's really going on is it's all
digital and oh my god it's so much
easier but if you're going to act you're
going to affect the world around you
you're going to take action so securing
it protecting it challenge-response all
the way down to the physical devices the
kind of things that we do everywhere
else in information technology now need
to be brought to a whole world of
mechanical disciplines where they've
been locking up to now along that line
one of my favorite extra Reuters is the
human behind a cell phone when the cell
phone is used as a sensor almost every
one of these actuation feedback loops
close around some body of human beings
and we talked about the health care
system the issue you know it's not hard
to control that IV system what's really
important is that's tied in with
understanding the health of
patient the particular patient the
rotation through the hospital of the
doctors it's these much bigger things
actually you know tweaking the device
that's not hard thank you very much okay
let's take another question I see a
hands over there hi Yoshi Toto be from
Tokyo decade ago three it seems that a
concept or another thing is still
ambiguous so what's the key challenge
which we haven't seen in researcher
ubicomp class dissonance so what's the
difference so this question is about the
key challenges that we have not seen
from the uniform sensor networks uniform
public meaning that a small patch of
nodes which are the same kind that's
carefully laid out by graduate students
from universities but how do we go from
from which is that the question or
whether it's difference from ubicomp you
become oh when did you become so of
course I think we've there's two aspects
of it I think to KU dhisan observed that
rfid may not be the right solution and a
tremendous amount of ubicomp has had to
do with that particular technology I
would agree with the position that I
believe rfid will be as exciting as drum
memory before long because and has none
of the right scaling properties and so
there's a set of problems that are just
not worth solving there that we might
have some but the much deeper thing I
think is that the Internet of Things is
approaching what we do in our everyday
lives and in our everyday cities it's
not just about waving my hand and having
my projection show up on this screen or
having some interesting entertainment
value that in some sense there's this
fundamental seriousness about the
complexity of the systems that we're in
menting and controlling and managing and
so it's not that it worked once in a
demo one day it's that the real world
there's no alt ctrl delete on the planet
right that it really has to work forever
so i would add few things related to the
previous question as well from the cps
cyber-physical systems point of view
some people often think that we were
looking into close to loop even though
