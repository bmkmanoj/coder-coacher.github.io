pleasure to be here
I'm Peter Lee and I'm the head of
Microsoft Research USA it is my great
pleasure and honor to introduce this
morning's plenary speaker dr. Hermann
Hauser dr. Houser is a physicist and I
hope you won't hold that against him he
he's actually a physicist of some some
quite nice distinction holding a PhD
from the University Cambridge and also a
fellow of Institute of Physics and the
Royal Academy of Engineering but what is
equally interesting about dr. Houser are
his entrepreneurial exploits and in 1997
he founded Amadeus Capital Partners and
from there founded or co-founded
numerous interesting and winning
technology companies maybe one of quite
some note and possibly having an impact
in all of your lives is a coin computers
which spun out the arm yesterday in
discussions with dr. Howser I was really
amazed to learn that last month alone
there were more ARM chips shipped than
in the entire history of Intel chips
which is quite an amazing fact and so
the impact and transformation of the
world has been quite stupendous of
course there are many other companies of
note including active book Tobey Virata
Cambridge Network limited and many more
in recognition for all of his
accomplishments in the transformation of
technologies on society
last year he became a fellow of the
Royal Society today I think you should
really look forward to a talk from a man
who has an established record and a
great nose for technologies that are
interesting transformational and maybe
most importantly of all winning and so
please join me in welcoming dr. Hermann
Hauser
thank you very much for this for these
kind words of introduction it's not
actually last month it's last year that
we sold nine billion arms and I'll go
into this a little later only on the
subject of investing in successful
companies I I'm in the position of
sharing with you the secret that I
learned of what really makes a
successful company since I'm one of the
very few people in the world who has
made more than a hundred investments and
therefore arguably I have a better data
set than most and the secret that I want
to share with you is that it's random so
here is the pretentious part of title of
my talk you know it's the sixth wave is
really machine learning but you know the
pretentious way of thinking about it is
really reducing the the human a part of
the kamagra of complexity of whatever
you're doing so here is the content as
every good computer scientist when
you've got six waves of computing you
start with the 0th then I'll talk about
the the six about the clash of waves you
know four people have been around for a
little while it's quite interesting that
in you stand stand back and you look at
these waves then you can actually
discern wave characteristics that are
the same wave after wave after wave and
one of the most interesting ones is the
the change between the leading companies
in these waves and there is no historic
incidence or occasion where a lead
company in one wave ever makes a
significant contribution to the next
wave and I'll go into this when we talk
about the relationship between Intel and
arm so let's start with the 0th wave and
we're rebuilding the EDSAC some of you
might know about the edge tech is of
course the world's first computer there
are so many people claiming the world's
first
computer well it's the first computer
that was designed for users hmm heads X
stands for electronic delay storage
automatic calculator some of you might
know what a computer was in those days
of course it was a person who did the
computing so these things were
calculators it was constructed by a
famous computer scientist called maurice
wilkes the main memory in there was a
mercury delay lines it was also the
first computer that had stored programs
there was a very another famous
professor at Cambridge called David
wheeler who invented the subroutine and
concepts like job queue for example came
from the EDSAC because there's a
wonderful picture of people queuing up
with their paper tapes to put the paper
tape into the paper tape reader and that
was the job queue of the people that
queued up to do their paper tips what
interesting sort of statistic on the
EDSAC is that it had 650 apes these are
instructions per second not mips as
we're used to million instructions per
second which isn't a lot although it
clocked at the at a megahertz which is
interesting of course it was a serial
computer one bit computer as one of the
reasons why it slowed down but the other
one was that the main memory was this
mercury delay line so the way you
executed the the next instruction or you
waited for the next data is you had to
wait for the sound waves in the in the
mercury delay line to make it make it
all the way round to get the next datum
so that's where it's 650 instructions
per second however arguably at that time
the increase in compute power that was
available to users was a factor of 1,500
and arguably this was the biggest step
increase in compute power that we ever
had from when we year to the next
because you know Moore's law and factor
of two every two years or so but this
was a factor of 1,500 over they the hand
computers that we had another important
aspect of the EDSAC
is you know the fact that it really was
constructed for users not for computer
scientists to do demos and it actually
contributed to three Nobel Prizes and
here it is it's of course vacuum tubes
is this a laser pointer net here pen you
see the mercury delay line remarkable
how this worked so this was the only
storage in in this design and the way
it's thought the data is there was these
long pipes of mercury and you banged it
at one end and this this wave this
acoustic wave traveled to the other end
you know and there was a pH or electric
receiver and you could get the data out
and it held total storage capacity of a
kilobyte I think but what I really want
to concentrate on today talking about
these six waves is the way it felt to
the user and that's where the big shift
is coming in and that's where I think
machine learning really is the next step
in the in the evolution of computing
because we're moving closer to the human
will will you know have interfaces that
are just better suited to human
interface but starting off the user
interface was not very human friendly
because the only way you could put any
data in there is with me a paper tape
the only way you could program it was in
machine code and the only help you got
expressing your thoughts is David's
wheel wheelers invention of the
subroutine you know somebody had to
invent the subroutine it was David so
it's a bit better you know if you if you
wanted to calculate squares and you had
a subroutine that that the squares it's
safety a little bit of time but not a
lot a lot so here is there's the six
real waves of computing if you like
mainframe mini computer workstation
personal computers very unexpectedly
smartphones and the cloud really become
the main computing platform now in terms
of usage and of course the whole talk is
that that the next big evolution in
terms of the usage of computing
worldwide is this you
quitting ubiquitous computing sometimes
called the Internet of Things but
actually the key enabler the key driver
is the the ease-of-use that will result
from machine learning so let's take a
whistle-stop tour of what what happened
so far some of you might remember the
IBM 370 it cost about a million pounds
there were about a thousand of them per
year and note those two there they're
sort of wave characteristics everything
roughly changes path by an order of
magnitude as we go through the waves
Nessus interesting pendulum between
multi use of computers where the
computing is done somewhere centrally
and then personal computers where you do
the computing locally the way you
interfaced with it was first punch cards
than terminals and there was a very
interesting lock-in effect and this is a
wave characteristic you started off with
a bunch of companies it was literally
the bunch Burroughs UNIVAC NCR control
data I think and Honeywell that you
often end up with a monopoly in this
case IBM and I remember Rob Wilmot who
ran ICL the British computer company at
the time complaining bitterly that there
was no way of attacking IBM because IBM
had the the the the hardware interface
to the dasty disk and they weren't
allowed to use that interface and you
may remember the court cases at the time
that finally forced IBM to open up the
vast interface specification and
whenever you've got these court cases
and you'll see where I'm going through
the waves you can see them now this
normally marks the end of a wave and
when somebody wins the court case
against IBM here or against other
companies now it just chose the end of a
way if that actually it has become
irrelevant and another thing is really
becoming a new driver so what was the
user interface to these mainframes well
it was punch cards and teletypes in
terms of the input but what what
user Saul really was Fortran and COBOL
and maybe some science libraries you
know when I was a PhD student but doing
my PhD I used you know splice functions
and things that that they made available
and of course on the business side it
was the business forums but then came
the mini computer again dominated by a
company called Dec absolutely wonderful
company at the time if anybody had said
the deck was going to get into trouble
with the domination of many computers
that they had all the bright people that
they had it was completely laughable and
yet tech is no more so what happened
price reduced by a factor of 10 from a
million to 100,000 units went up by a
factor of 10 from 1,000 per annum to
10,000 per annum but really the the most
important thing was the widening of the
use of computers and changes in the user
interface so the news appeared cat tools
appeared both mechanical electrical and
software tools of course this was the
time when the when the the car industry
started adopting mechanical cat tools
and some of that actually happened in in
Cambridge most of the BMW or Mercedes
cars are produced with software that was
actually in invented in Cambridge and
networks appeared like the Ethernet but
then there was a new bell du jour called
a workstation and this is the iconic
computer of the time of course the Sun
SPARC station which was really a sort of
development of the the Alto at Xerox
PARC pen and same thing happened again
price went down by a factor of 10 units
went up by a factor of 10 and the use
space widened there's also the first
appearance of risk in in the workstation
and if you look at the user interface
the desktop appeared with the mouse it
became a sort of impersonal
machine really more than multi-user
machine and there was this this famous
3m concept I think it was first basket
who characterized that one MIPS 1
million instructions per second 1
megabyte of memory and 1 megapixel of
display so that you had high quality
display that and some people added 1/4
which was a mega penny and again
Ethernet played an important role and
then unexpectedly the personal computer
appeared and if you allow me a little
trip down memory lane this is my first
company a Chrome computers which
produced the BBC micro
and although arm is probably the company
that I'm best known for as the the
godfather of the arm it's actually the
BBC micro that I'm most proud of because
it became the standard in British
schools and created a whole generation
of programmers in Britain at the time we
arguably had more programmers and more
people who are being taught programming
than any other country in the world and
many of our games companies or companies
like autonomy Mike Lynch still remembers
the all the assembler codes for the 65
or - which was the microprocessor at the
time and those of you are interested
that this period of history there is
actually a BBC docudrama as they call it
called micro man which which shows what
happened during that period there's a
very interesting follow-on to the BBC
micro which is called raspberry pie that
has when the raspberry pie people came
to me and said look this is this is
really what we need of the BBC micro
that educates people on how to use
computers how to use Hardware how to
create the next generation of
programmers not just in Britain in the
world we want to have this $25 computer
that can do everything
you know computers do aye-aye-aye
they asked me for advice and my advice
was this is a stupid idea
first of all you've got to change the
name nobody will ever remember raspberry
pi it's a stupid name and secondly why
would people want to buy $25 computers
that you know that looked like a bear
circuit board of course I so often my
predictions were totally wrong Raspberry
Pi has actually become a fantastic brand
we expect it to as we did with the BBC
back sure we're expected to sell about
10 to 100,000 in the first year well
they've sold well over over a million
it's become a real phenomenon lots of
people are building lots of things
around the Raspberry Pi the PI by the
way stands for for Python say actually
you should have a wire but anyway and
and it's a great success is very very
successful
however the in Connick product during
the PC wave was this machine the IBM PC
and to just give you a feeling for how
and this is not very long ago on how
primitive this machine was look at the
user interface here this is what you saw
when you switch to the IBM PC there's a
green screen it was a command line there
wasn't really any any desktop yet
because Windows hadn't had the period
but the most the best demonstration of
how fast our computers have developed
and how fast Hardware has improved
really is the main storage of this
computer there are two floppy discs in
there does anybody remember the the
memory capacity of a floppy disk no it
was about 200 kilobytes so both of them
would give you 400 kilobytes which was
the total main storage of the PC just to
remind you this is not enough to
a single picture that you take with your
mobile phones everyday you couldn't
store a single picture in the entire
computer
so again wave characteristics price went
down by a factor of ten to two
a killer dollar numbers went up to 100
million again by a factor of a hundred
the interesting thing was that the news
case changed again and productivity
tools became the driver of computer
sales as of course you know very well
with office and I remember going to
Esther Dyson's conference and we had
where these conferences that were all
about feature Wars and the future wars
were between the different productivity
tools war was between Lotus 1-2-3 and
Microsoft Excel and every every year you
know bill would get up and said this is
what Excel now does is so much better
than Lotus 1-2-3 and then Mitch Kapoor
gets up and says now I know we now have
a better Lotus 1-2-3 because you know we
can do pivot tables or something so this
this this fascinated the PC industry
again something that do you think you
know what's the big deal is this it's
not really where the action is it was
what's interesting but this was what
where the action was and what was
interesting at the time we also towards
the end of the personal computer wave as
always we have almost monopoly suppliers
in this case Intel on the CPU and of
course Microsoft with Windows but what's
the user interface which has come a
little bit closer to the human there's
the desktop user interface office I
talked about but it's not such office
there was then a great plethora of
heavyweight applications I would say
like Photoshop or you know again care
applications but then a new thing
happened which completely changed the
use base of of PCs which was the
Internet and the browser and things that
you could do on top of that and of
course
research and their social but there were
also a breakthroughs again that of
course you know a lot about like connect
you know people got used to the mass and
the and the keyboard but to be able to
interface with the computer through
gestures and and and in your body was
really something quite revolutionary and
and it is wonderful what you've done
with connect introducing this to the
computing environment there is another
thing that's happening with a company
called to be that we have made an
investment in just to disclose this
clearly and this is eye tracking it will
be as the world's leading eye tracking
company with about a 50% market share
it's a little company 50 million dollar
company not not a start-up anymore and
for for over a decade they have refined
this this ability to track your eyes eye
tracking is actually not the correct
term the correct term is gaze tracking
because it doesn't track your eyes it
actually tracks where you look and again
along the path of making computers
closer to humans
I tracking or gaze tracking turns out to
be very important in human to human
interactions because you know if I gave
the talk like this it you know you you
and I would feel uncomfortable about
this you just expect me to look at you
and I expect you to look at me but you
don't always do that so the next next
big wave which really and then these
wave always come left field this is
another interesting thing they the
reason why the incumbents why the the
the monopoly suppliers towards an end of
the wave always missed the next wave is
that it's not always an unexpected wave
and who would have thought that phones
would become the main computing
environment it was just a very alien
thought because that's not what
computers where computers where you know
laptops towards the end of the
but this guy you know not the nicest guy
when you've met him but in he almost
single-handedly really revolutionized
the the phone industry with the with the
iPhone so let's go back to the wave
characteristics price well went down to
zero you can get a phone for free now if
you're willing to sign up to a contract
numbers again went up by a factor of ten
from hundreds of millions to now
billions last year it was about one and
a half billion use case widened voice of
course was the starting point with
phones but with smartphones I think it
has just happened that more people now
access the internet by a smartphone that
than pcs and then again very unexpected
crap video from YouTube became became
the main application that's what people
do with you know their timers which
these silly videos and and consume all
our our bandwidth but you know that's
that's what happens and that's what
they're willing to pay money for so but
it's really everything that you sort of
want to do and and the key enabler of
that was the fact that you have it in
your pocket so one of the one of the
better thoughts that I had in my life
favorite if I say so myself I was when I
was vice president of research for
Olivetti in the days of of Olivetti's
heydays when Olivia T was the number one
PC producer in the US and I in the in
the in Europe and I categorized
computers not by their CPU or memory or
even a user interface or a software but
I categorized them by where they lived
so it was the computers that lived in
the air-conditioned room the computers
that lived at the desktop the computers
would lived in the in the briefcase
which were the laptops the computers
that I thought were going to live in
yeah so they're wearing your jacket I
was wrong they actually live in a pocket
you know smart films and then the
computers that live on your wrist and
maybe we'll just see that around the
corner gives a lot talk about eye
watches or these Nike bands which are
really very primitive and they could be
a lot more interesting and they I think
they will be next year so one of the
many ways I made incorrect projections
was this thing about mobile phones and
Europe remember just a few years back
Europe had it all we had a company that
have provided 40% of the world's phones
with Nokia it was a totally dominant the
dominant mobile phone company not only
that we dominated and still do the
infrastructure Ericsson is the number
one provider of mobile infrastructure in
the world and that at that time I
thought that with a Symbian we had a
reasonable operating system that could
dominate that as well so I was convinced
that it was Europe's time in the Sun and
we're going to take this away from
America that is normally the technology
lead and I was wrong because Apple
completely changed the game and Europe
which of course had be leading
infrastructure as well you mustn't
forget 3G first rolled out well first of
all is a European technology and was
filled first rolled out in Europe so we
actually had the better mobile
infrastructure for a very long time also
better data infrastructure again that
has moved to the US with 4G and LTE very
satisfyingly for for me as the godfather
of the arm is that when the wave changed
from the PC to the smartphone wave there
was a change in processor as well from
Intel to arm and I'll go into this in a
moment
this is a smartphone on steroids
which is all that tablets are it is not
a shrunk down PC actually it's a you
know a smartphone on steroids most
tablets that being shipped at the moment
are basically have a smartphone
architecture and there is a new entrance
to the computing environment because the
smartphone itself is is really a
hopeless computer and a useless computer
that nobody would would really pay the
amount of money for that they are
worried not for the mobile data
connectivity back to data centers so
really all the interesting things that
smart phones are used for happen in
there and as you see there preferably
built in places where there is a lot of
snow because the number one problem that
data centers have now is not performance
is not storage its energy consumption
and that is one of the reasons why at
arm we're also very keen to produce
server CPU and you'll see a number of
arm based servers also appearing in data
center for the sole reason of much lower
power consumption and both HP and Dell
now produce ARM based service but
there's also again a move towards the
human in the in the user interface so
voice recognition has really become good
enough now to be useful a serious a good
example but any of you who know a little
Cambridge company called Evie which is a
much better version of Siri because it
has you know a fancy ontology of 20,000
concepts and can as I've demonstrated to
some of you and happy to demonstrate it
later to those of you who were
interested you you can ask it questions
like who was President of the United
States when Obama was a teenager not
only is it very impressive that it
recognizes your your voice you know
because it's this quite a fancy sentence
but disambiguating or or interpreting
what what this means and giving you the
right answer is you know is interesting
that you can do this on a on a mobile
phone now but there's also been a
revolution with touch as as you well
know and I tracking is about to I think
make a major entry into user interfaces
we're beginning to see it with the
galaxy for whether it's very very
primitive eye tracking as you probably
know if you look away from a galaxy 4 it
shuts down and since power consumption
and battery life is such a key thing
that's actually quite a nice thing to
have the other thing that's nice is if
you you know if you come towards the
bottom of what you're reading wouldn't
it be nice if it scrolled up well our
tracking can do that for you but not
only do we have touch and with a
tracking we're actually beginning to
have lots of other things that make a
smartphones much more usable
accelerometers GPS maps and an explosion
of apps there are now I think over
650,000 apps are both on the on the
iPhone and on on Android and the browser
of course has become the sort of main
interface of doing interesting things
with smart phone and you know the story
about their search and and social and a
new phenomenon has come up one of the
things I always look for when making an
investment in a company is whether
whether they're clean interfaces both at
the top and at the bottom and at the top
so is their clean interface to the
suppliers that the company buys things
from and is there a clean interface in
terms of selling their products that
people can build things on top off and
it's it's very the this Facebook home
thing is an interesting new phenomenon
where a company that is you know quite
widely known and widely used is got a
billion users may be able to
recruit all the infrastructure that has
been built up from you know hardware to
software operating systems browsers
everything and just do the top layer and
pinch the the user from all the people
that have done the hard work underneath
whether it really will be as successful
as they hope or not I don't know but the
fact that it is possible to put a veneer
on top and pretend to the user that what
they're using is actually all Facebook
went really they've they've just done a
tiny tiny sliver on the top is an
interesting new phenomenon Twitter of
course is another one I have a very
exciting little investment in a company
called data sift in in the UK which has
access to the entire Twitter firehose
and but and they they give you an answer
within a hundred milliseconds to the
following question so they've got very
very fancy filters on the entire
firehose and all the tweets in the world
they'll be able to tell you who in Ohio
mail between 25 and 45 has just seen a
Mitt Romney ad and did a negative or
positive tweet about it and this was of
some interest to the Obama campaign but
it does it in real time it also has two
years of history of the of the tweets
now and can use a slider to go back in
time over two years to see when Mitt
Romney ads had run in the past or when
Nike had a an ad in the past and how
people reacted to that and and plot the
time series and it's actually the time
series that might be of greater interest
and then a single data point however the
biggest thing in my opinion going
forward and again you know it's very
difficult to make predictions especially
if it's about a future is about health
yeah you know we all care a lot about
our own health and the health of our of
our loved ones and for the first time I
think the whole computing infrastructure
will make a huge difference
to both health costs but also our
ability to provide health support for
people for healthy lives you're just
beginning to see it with health sensors
on mobile phones that do heartrate they
- you know your running speeds they they
do ECG Vinodh showed me immuno Koslow
showed me a very interesting very
impressive application where you
basically take your two thumbs at the
back of a upper smartphone and on the
front you get really quite an accurate
ECG a glucose levels etc but the
important thing is it's 24/7 you can do
you can measure all these things 24/7
and my my guess so my gut feel is that
the that the the really interesting
thing going forward is not the times
here is 24/7 of say your heart rate or
your glucose level or your your blood
gas your blood gas levels but the
changes in the vector so it's really the
signature of maybe half a dozen of these
very simple health parameters that that
might contain the really useful
information for you and it's that where
machine learning I think will have a
field day because we'll have the data
you know we'll have these time series
people haven't had these time series I
mean even even a 24/7 heartrate time
series is quite hard to get hold off if
this becomes automated because it's just
one of the things that people buy with
their smart phones and all of a sudden
you've got thousands and millions of
them just imagine what machine learning
can do with that especially if it's
correlated with you know glucose levels
blood respiration you're running rate or
whatever because you know if your heart
rate goes up because you've just been
running up at the stairs
you know what's the big deal of course
it has it
but when your heart rate really you know
your heart starts racing and you're
sitting by a desk you know what is going
on why why is this so I think that's
that's very exciting and we do have one
example of this already I don't know how
many of you heard that lovely story of
Siri the people in Scotland compared a
complained bitterly about Siri not
working very well in Edinburgh and they
rang up an EOS and said you know why
does theirs not work for a Scottish
accent and they said just wait a few
weeks and of course what happens is the
speech recognition is not done in
Edinburgh or on your smartphone the
speech recognition is done in Boston at
at the new yours and they are collecting
all the speech samples so as Siri as
more and more people have used Siri and
voice recognition in Edinburgh it
collected all the speech samples from
Scottish people and could tune itself to
when they is so another one coming in
from Edinburgh the NIA is one of those
funny guys you know and so you know the
data sets are important so let's come to
the meat of the talk which is why I
think machine learning you know I've got
a really hard task here I've got to
convince you that machine learning is
very important for machine for the
computing industry same story again it's
not 1 billion but tens of billions of
things per year it's all about big data
interesting point about the price you
know I told you phones are available at
zero cost really so when you go from
there you can't really go below zero
well in a way you can and the thing that
is happening with the price in the
Internet of Things in the and the
ubiquitous thing is that the price
actually is no longer associated with
with the computing element the price is
the thing that you'd buy anyway like a
car or glasses that you need or you know
or a thermostat it's just that now it
has these these nice
you functionalities that that make it
really useful because it becomes part of
the environment and and the machine
learning bit is is is is you know just
listing a few of them and then I'll talk
about biology which i think is that is
the really exciting bit but before we go
on to that Pete Earley provided this
slide for me which is the only slide
I've managed to dig up on software
complexity because this thing is all
about complexity as well if you remember
my pretentious part of my talk and in
the beginning and there are lots and
lots of graphs that I can show you on
the exponential growth of processing
power of memory of networking speeds but
it's very hard to get hold of of slides
on software complexity and the red one
is integrated circuits and there it
seems to be something very magic about a
billion you know once you get above a
billion things get really interesting be
in neurons billion instructions per
second gigabyte you know a gigabit per
second things get interesting and we're
just getting to the billion you know the
the latest Xeon processor the is Vala a
billion lines of code I understand
Windows is now at sixty million lines of
code and interestingly you see that the
design integration in texting in months
it's actually being quite constant so
we've made fantastic progress with with
tools to allow this additional
complexity to not a cripple the the
production of it with one exception
which is the aerospace industry which is
the the blue bit the the green bit by
the way is the is the car industry which
is interesting they're actually doing
very complex things but they're doing it
more and more efficiently here you've
got the Google glasses which I'm very
excited about because and the thing that
excites me about it is not the first
version which I'm wearing here but the
one
I tracking because if and I don't know
how many of you followed the Google
classes but it's it's not glasses that
give you a virtual reality or are things
that you or augmented reality but it's a
it's a display up here on the right that
you look up that's why I have this funny
look on my face and and the thing that
I'm really excited about is actually
that with eye tracking this allows you
to make selections not in a virtual
world but in the real world so if I look
at the light here I might get the menu
of things that I can do with the light
so I can turn it down I can switch it
off when I look at the TV I can change
the channel if I look at the air
conditioning you know I can change the
temperature etc so it allows a more
human interface with with the real world
similar thing with the Google car or
with lots of cars that that now appear
that can drive themselves you know
there's there's tremendous amount of
machine learning but also a tremendous
amount of data that needs available
because Google currently is which I
which I drove in recently can only drive
along roads where there is a lot of good
street street you information and you
know very iconic little Silicon Valley
company that there's thermostats yeah
you know you've gotta have a thermostat
but this one learns you know whenever
you you tweak and it remembers what
would you have done so what is the big
what's the big deal about machine
learning well it really makes the makes
the the internet of things the everyday
things that your interact with so far
much more user-friendly much more human
but the big thing which is the rest of
my talk is the the effect this will have
on health so quickly stepping back and
looking at the clashes between these
waves why does the new wave always win
over the old one higher volume lower
prize performance good enough it doesn't
need to be as good as the the best
performance of the last wave new and
more apps and new users in
more human PC mobile phone is just the
the change that we're seeing right now
and the last point here is actually an
interesting one who would have thought
that SD cards would become the main
storage device but 64 gigabytes hey ya
can do lots of things with 64 gigabytes
Intel versus arm is a risk versus sisk
story actually the only reason why the
arm exists is that win went to Intel and
I asked them if we could have the 286
which we thought was a you know
perfectly reasonable process processor
they just screwed out the pin out
because they put both the address and
the database on the same pins and we
said nobody can make a sensible computer
out of that but if you give us the chip
itself we'll do our own pin out and
maybe we can make something of it and
they said get lost so we said well you
get lost well to our realm it's the only
reason where the arm exists and then I
gave two advantages to the design team
that neither Intel no Motorola nor a MD
ever managed to give to their design
teams and the two advantages were number
one I gave them no people so it's the
only processor in the world that was
designed by two people albeit very smart
one Steve Furber and Sophie Wilson and
the second advantage I gave them was no
money because we didn't have any so the
only way they could do this is keep it
really really simple this the arm the
original arm was 30,000 transistors
which was the same number of transistors
as the Zed Zed 80 at the time which was
the main 8-bit processor the difference
was that we managed to get 20 times the
performance out of those 30,000
transistors that the z80 did so it was a
real architectural breakthrough which
led to a world record of making us the
world record holder of MIPS per watt
which was not a design team it was a
design goal it was a side effect I mean
the our econ computers were mains
powered we didn't care about the power
of the of the processor but it was so so
simple and if you allow me one anecdote
we we actually may after you know the
arm came back and I bought two bottles
of champagne and
in expectation that the arm would work
first time it just shows the naivety we
had at the time this was completely new
process and it never run before and we
put it in the circuit board and and two
hours after this chip arrived it said
hello world I'm unarmed
which meant the process of work the
instructions had worked the the basic
interpreter that we wrote if an
instruction said that we never had
worked well enough to and the video
interface worked well enough that an
hour after the processor that had never
existed before arrived as its first
piece of silicon and up there and I
opened the bottles of champagne and we
were all very happy about that and then
we measured the power consumption so we
unsold at the the power pin put an amp
meter between the power pin and the
power supply and measured it and the
recording was zero so we thought well
you know as a physicist you you don't
believe measurements like that and they
said why would that be and then we
realized that the power pin actually
wasn't connected to anything it was a
fault on the on the board there was no
power there carrying to the ship so why
did it work and the answer was that the
leakage currents from from the database
and all the other buses was enough to
power up with the chip and make it work
so we knew we were on a good thing on
the power consumption section sir intel
versus arm well we we have a good market
share in mobile phones now and you know
if you if you round it up if you're a
mathematician and you you round things
up if they're more than 0.5 we actually
have a hundred percent market share in
in 2012 we shipped over 9 billion arms
which is more than people on earth and
more than pin Intel has shipped in its
entire history we have an ambition of
shipping over a hundred billion in the
next 10 years and if you multiply 9 by
10 this is not an impossible task it's
out there's 20 billion dollar company
but the thing that people sort of least
realize is that although arm has become
the world's most successful
IP company if you translate this into
dollars because we know exactly the
value of ARM chips that are being
shipped through 330 licensees now the
value of the ARM chip overtook Intel
sales in the year 2010 so even in dollar
terms arm is now more important
architecture than the Intel Architecture
and these are all the ice licensees by
the way spot in the middle of it Intel
Intel is also a licensed ear farm it's
the only microprocessors that they've
ever licensed in so I end up on biology
some of you might have followed encode
which i think is possibly the most
important publication this century it's
a nature publication basically brought
about by another investment of mine
called celexa you all know about Moore's
law which is the white line the cost of
gene sequencing followed Moore's law
very accurately for a very long time
until two outstanding profs at Cambridge
shankha balasubrahmanyam and David
Clemen invented sequencing by synthesis
which was is the Selective technology
which we sold to Illumina and look at
this it reduced the cost of doing a
human genome from 10 million dollars to
now just above $1,000 so it's a factor
of 10,000 in five years I've never seen
anything like it
the result of this was a total explosion
of available information genomic data
information it's here is a a slide that
John West who who ran celexa for us
produced for me it's 22 petabytes a year
so this is one of the reasons why I'm
become such a believer in machine
learning we do not have enough people on
earth to analyze this data we've got to
have automatic ways of making these gene
Association studies with phenotypes so
why am i is so excited about encode but
well it explains what 80% of the DNA
does just to remind you when we did the
first genome sequence you know the
famous
announcement with Bill Clinton and in
Tony Blair when we finally had the first
sequence of the human genome that
explained what one percent of the DNA
does because only one percent of the DNA
gets translated it's a big it sits there
there are 32 Institute's that
contributed to that so big science is
alive
you know just enormous amounts of data
really good stuff here but interestingly
they also used machine learning
techniques so one of the most
interesting bits is that they have
defined seven states of the DNA and one
interesting one is that w/e it's the
weak enhancement thing that nobody
really expected to pop up in the
classification analysis of encode these
weak enhancers are you sure you remember
the genes are sort of regulated by
promoter sites just in front of those
genes and then there are enhancers
they're a little bit upstream from from
the promoter sites that enhance the the
gene expression but they're weak
enhancers there are about a hundred
million base pairs away from it but
they're still clusters so there's still
enhancers that have a significant they
they would not have shown up had it not
been for machine learning and then
there's there's a fun story to tell with
a seminar that I run in Cambridge where
I like mixing up computer scientists
with biologists and Chris came to the
last one just two weeks ago and we
learned the following thing from shank
analyst and shank Appaloosa pramana and
one of the people who did celexa with me
he discovered a way of distinguishing
between hm cyst I decide to say there's
another four basic pairs only one of
them gets modified to affect epigenetic
things and later on they found out that
they don't just get methylated there is
an additional modification that can
happen which is hydroxy methylation
which enhances gene expression again
where methylation inhibits it there are
thousand papers out there on methylation
of cytosine most of them say well it's
inhibitory but some of them say well we
see some enhancing effects as well
now all these papers were published
before it was known that there was
actually a modification to this
methylation there was also an HM version
of cytosine and Schanker just a few
months ago found a way of clearly
distinguishing between these two states
so what do you do with all the papers
the thousands of papers that are out
there some of which clearly will be
wrong because they thought they had an
MC when actually they were doing their
research on HM see you know how do you
go back to the data the data themselves
might still be interesting it's just the
conclusion was wrong so what you need is
an evidence engine so if any of you are
willing to engage in in this even in in
maybe it's frivolous instantiation of
what what I call a sort of TV evidence
engine or a TV veracity engine which I
would like to see where you at the
bottom of the TV screen you have a
little graph that goes between 0 &amp;amp; 1
when politicians talk and one means that
you know what they say you can actually
find some evidence for 0 is you find
some evidence against what they've just
said and I'm sure most of it it would be
at 1/2 because you can find neither
evidence for or against what they have
said because most of their talk is
content free as we know hmm so it
wouldn't it be nice to have that in real
time speech recognition certainly is
good enough to do that and I think we
ought to be able to find evidence for or
against in real time I just want to end
my talk with one of the reasons why I
got so interested in in machine learning
and it's gaseum processes and it's this
unicycle that Karl Rossmann produced
this unicycle knows nothing about
physics the only thing it knows about is
that it's good to stay upright is a bad
idea to fall over the control engineers
have been trying to make progress with
that doing all the fancy differential
equations and haven't gotten anywhere
and Carl has a a Gaussian process with
in parameters and as you can see on
trial number five this thing stays up
for an amazing period of time so this
convinced me that here we've got
something which humans are very good at
and when it comes to riding a bicycles
we are the kings it's very hard to make
a computer ride a bicycle very well here
we've got a machine learning environment
that for the first time can learn how to
ride a unicycle faster than a human so I
told you a little bit about the EDSAC
six ways of computing the clashes
between these waves and that you know
they are significant that in my opinion
machine learning is the sort of key
technique that will unlock the six wave
and if any of you is interesting
interested in building the evidence
engine that I described I would be happy
to finance it thank you very much
well thank you that's really very
interesting I think we have some time
for for a few questions maybe if I can
start I was struck early in the talk
where you've made a little jab at the
old future Wars in the PC wave so is
there something equally distracting
today are there things that we're
focusing on too much today that well if
you they're quite a few of these for
example well it's just seeing the end of
it that people buy PCs on the clock rate
of the processor I think it was Butler
in a conversation yesterday that says
you know is it important that we have
more and more processing power and the
answer is probably no because the
important thing is you need to reach a
certain threshold and once you're above
that threshold this really doesn't
become the key issue anymore and it's
one of the reasons for the success of
the arm there is no doubt that the Intel
processor is a more powerful processor
but is it really needed you know can you
do most of the things that you can do
with an arm and there are lots of these
stories also in software and the
environment and you know cameras and and
videos right so questions yes actually
now this is a great talk thank you and
we all agree machine learning is
important for the application where
would you actually bet on the
application for the next big wave health
thank you any other questions
giving up just elaborate on that the
reason why I say this is one is in
biology it's so hard to get solid data
and genomic data now is very solid you
know we really can call base pairs with
great accuracy we can get these hunt
down these snips and you know it's one
of the few things where a whole you know
science like biology all of a sudden
found a very sound hard data set and on
the other said on the other hand we've
got the the enormous amount of medical
records which characterize phenotypes so
you've got two humungous data sets and
we don't really know how to how to link
them up and there isn't enough brain
power in humans you know and enough
humans to do that so doing that
correlation and you know starting off
with association studies but there is
there's a lot more apologies and says
the association studies i think is where
the real meat is because if you look at
the the amount of money that people are
willing to spend on their own health it
will you know make our spend on
computers or anything else pale into
insignificance that's where the money is
you know each during your talk each wave
was getting more and more human so to
speak and so health certainly goes in
that direction that another one that
some people might argue would be towards
social can see do you see that also yes
absolutely
well yeah you know facebook of course
and and twitter a good good examples of
that but how much money would you spend
on social compared on your own health if
you knew that it works because at the
moment and only of you know about that a
rather distressing statistic that if you
take a drug any drug on average it works
on thirty percent of you seventy percent
of the time it it either doesn't work or
you get negative side effects it's one
of the dirty secrets of the of the drug
industry right yes there's a question
here
Herman yeah very exciting talk very
optimistic but there's no sign in your
talk about the sort of dark side the
malware the botnets Stuxnet cyber
warfare what's your take on that very
worried i I didn't since I'm a perennial
optimist I don't dwell on this but there
are two things that really worried me
one it is all that dark cybersecurity
thing and as you know the the cyber
attacks such as exponentially increasing
and it's actually one of our investment
focuses is cyber security and the trust
zone in in the arm is an initiative that
we started ten years ago to help with
that because you really owes also one
but a hardware anchor for for whatever
you do in cyber security but there is
there isn't there is another thing which
is drones you know drones are so easy to
build now again like with you know with
a with a with a Facebook homepage all
the the building blocks are out there so
if you're a smart guy you can build
yourself a drone for a few hundred
dollars now if you can build a drone for
a few hundred dollars you can build
thousands of drones and then you know
make them do things together like you
know invade a city or something and II
just can't shoot them all down so there
are quite a few scenarios which are
quite worrying a general way of
expressing this fear is is one of
intrinsic timescales a trinsic time
constants and this is something this is
a thought that I actually first had some
twenty years ago at a Harvard same
seminar where it struck me and in it's
obvious the minute you think about it
that whenever you want to control
anything you've gotta have levers with
time constants they're shorter than the
system that you're trying to control and
what we've done here is we we've put so
much effort in energy and money
into building a system that has shorter
and shorter time constants so things can
happen faster and faster and faster but
we have not made almost any investment
in investing in the levers that will
allow us to stop the system going awry
you know in all kinds of ways at that
time 20 years ago I thought of you know
a mad Israeli or other tank commander
you know it needs to be somebody who is
a bit mad but also very intelligent you
know putting out on the on the Internet
you've seen this horrible thing that has
just happened send me a hundred dollars
and I sorted out and you know a few
minutes later he's got a hundred million
dollars and with a hundred million
dollars you can do a lot of damage
building you know a thousand drones or
so Sarah I've gone gone on for long
enough there are lots of bad I think we
have time for one more question yes oh
thanks for you talk so every wave is
defined by both the user interface a
soft well a usage and a hardware and I
was wondering in general is there one of
these three elements that leads the way
and begs the need for the other two so
do we have new use user interface and
from these new user interfaces we can
think of new usages which packs the need
for new hardware or do we have advances
in hardware which suddenly opens the way
for new I think users I think the right
way to think about is this is this
threshold way you know while the under
layers below good enough so they can
build whatever you want to build on top
of it and but the really exciting bit is
the appearance of new user interfaces or
new api's wear and that's why I rather
cheekily
talked about the Kolmogorov complexity
in the beginning of the talk that what
you really want is you you want a model
you want a a set of you'll be able to
express yourself at such a high level
that with with very few you know
commands you can rely on those
I'm doing the right thing for you and
you can express yourself at a very high
level so you shift the complexity
towards the system away from what you
have to do and figuring out the clever
clean interfaces that allow you to do
that I think is the is the agenda well
with that thank you very much and I
guess we'll all be looking for our next
great investments thank you very much
