little maybe a little bit off the record
I thought I gonna give a talk on Xiao
Weis I think most of you've probably
heard of show ice it's a chatbot that we
built that's been really popular on
WeChat assuming I can log in once and
then I was going to talk a little bit
about the a version what it's not though
it's not what is me that's it isn't me
it's not me
what's it the music I love it but you
know keeps us all exciting alright it is
closed you like that but I thought I'd
give a little bling alright so I'm gonna
give a little story of how shall I
started and some of the usage and what's
been really interesting and then talk
about Thai and some of the tools and
things that we've been working on so
shall I see
started I most of you guys know Qi Liu
he runs a bunch of the company and he we
have a group in China and we've been
just I don't know about the music good
let's start singing later the karaoke
will come in a minute
so we chat we chats super popular in one
of the channels that isn't here today I
don't listen to this music so I don't
think it's me do you guys know what the
music is
let me see how it is for me
browser it's the browser window I
thought
all right so shall ways actually means
little Bing and it began as a hackathon
project by some folks in the China
search team and it their goal was just
to create a fun chat bot something that
was interesting and they embedded it in
WeChat to begin with and they extended
it with a bunch of intelligent services
and it began as a collaboration between
the Bing team and the Microsoft Research
Asia team and I don't know if you know
much about the msre team but they have
some of the most amazing natural
language machine learning scientists
anywhere and show it released in China
in 2014 and within the first 72 hours it
just started going viral so it got into
1.5 million chat groups and had about 10
million users and WeChat immediately
shut it down as a result and people were
you know people it kind of increased the
hype actually by shutting it down
immediately because people were like
what was this what was that the
demographic were really you know young
Chinese you know Internet users around
20 years old and so today there about 40
million users after the Chinese version
we released a japanese version called
rena and one of the things that we were
interested in and that's really unique
about Xiao Weis is the conversation
pairs like how long people talk and
converse with Xiao Weis and that was
actually something that we started to
measure like can the quality is the
length of conversation may be an
indicator of quality of conversation and
user engagement so it's most active
pretty similar to WeChat hours so later
in the evening kind of Peaks on
Wednesday where we release new features
so they're sort of the new chalets
feature on Wednesday and you know in the
weekends and then also the Chinese and
the Japanese audience is a little bit
different
Chinese audience is much more male
probably because the Chinese demographic
is normal or Internet users and then we
found that males tend to have more
sessions and females tend to talk for a
little bit longer so one of the things
that is kind of interesting as Xiao Weis
has sort of a variety of skills and they
kind of range from things that you can
do one-on-one with Xiao Weis to things
that you can do in groups and then also
things that range from knowledge and
very you know practical almost work like
things to very silly silly things there
was one on here called toilet time I'm
not quite sure what that means so don't
report on that I took it off the slide
just in case I get in trouble so let me
talk about some of the skills and parts
of Xiao Weis so the first thing is this
thing that we call chit chat and chit
chat is derived from mining
conversations online in Chinese and
trying to model what you might say in
response to what a user set and it
basically the brain of Xiao Weis is you
know it's only as good as the the data
set it begins with so one of the
challenges I think to these kinds of
BOTS is the day you release it's
actually not that great and over time
they would become smarter because you
can start to use the own your your data
from people talking to your bot as input
data so I'm not gonna I don't know if
you can you know things like the user
says show us good afternoon and she says
things like I'm here Thanks
you know have you had lunch not yet
people like me should not eat and so
it's kind of you know that kind of
banter so the next skill that's really
important is search
so obviously search team so the thing
that choice can do is she can combine
chit chat together with search so if
you're querying for something she can
answer questions so things like you know
search the Beijing Subway price increase
and she can say about the beijing subway
price increase here's some information
so this is very just practical things
that people ask and maybe a more
conversational way to do search so
then on top of that another service that
the team released was the ability to do
maybe work like things so the ability to
do things like reminders so remind me
that I have a report due on Thursday
please write down what you want me to
remind you here's an example you know
remind me not to sleep over the day
after tomorrow anyway she's she's kind
of like can can do reminders another
thing that's pretty popular in China in
the sense we had a lot of these services
that we had released the api's to so we
have a really great translation service
or a real-time translation service and
so people just started to kind of
package these services that we have into
the bots so translation a lot of people
like to speak English for example so
they might say shall I start translation
and they type Chinese and and you can
specify what language you want so she
would do translation or things like Q&amp;amp;A
people might ask about you know what
they need movie star and she can kind of
dialogue about questions and answers
pairs that you have then there begins to
be you know other things so mathematic
skills so basically the team in China
every week they release a skill and it
could kind of be anything and I think
this is where we start to see the
silliness and fun emerge so things like
math you know give me three consecutive
integers that have a sum of 36 find the
numbers so she can do like little math
challenges or people might ask things
like why is 1 plus 1 equal to 2 and she
might say something like there are many
such mysteries and math is both hard and
easy so she's not trying to just be
factual she definitely tries to joke
around and and make you laugh horoscope
and fortune-telling I just get counting
sheep this was one of the easier skills
I think to build you basically start
with one and then you say - you know and
she kind of makes fun of you and keeps
track of how many sheep you've counted
people like to do this late at night
it's silly but it's kind of popular she
can give you emotional support so
a lot of the users are students
especially during times of exams and
things like that they're just stressed
out and they kind of just want someone
to listen you know your friends are kind
of busy they don't really feel like
giving you emotional support during
exams and you know show ice is always
there for you then there's other things
like dog recognition so I don't know if
you guys knew this but we had released a
dog recognizer
and shows how ice incorporated the dog
recognizer so you know I heard you're
very good at recognizing dogs and she
says that's true and so the user says
show me your dog recognition skill and
she asked him to upload a picture of a
dog and you know can answer but one of
the things that the Chinese team did
there's a guy named Lee ding who
actually leads the son he's a marketing
guy so he he has a really good sense of
how to get audience and how just to make
things fun so rather than just saying
you know that's a Labrador which is
exciting but not really that exciting
and they started to kind of combine
chitchat and dog recognition and just
what might be more fun and engaging for
the users so basically they have a lot
of training data they get a lot of dot
okay when they skip through this show so
one of the things that they did is when
people send pictures of dogs rather than
just saying what kind of dog it is
they'll combine that with a query
looking at the database so so they might
say how do you know my favorite dog is a
bull terrier it's adorable and looks
like you know this famous actor so it
was just unexpected for people for the
bot to be combining dogs with you know
pop culture and just basically making it
more engaging and interesting than a
skills test that you would give your bot
yeah so basically the picture goes to
the dog recognizer it knows that it's a
bull terrier but then we feed it back
into the chat engine and she can say
things that are more that are more
interesting for people he kind of does
look like that dog I guess
also we use the human input to help
train so a lot of times shallow ice will
get things wrong or our dog recognizer
isn't perfect and we found that people
like to correct it as long as and we can
use that feedback to feed back into the
algorithms and make them better so
there's a user says how ice you need to
enhance your skill this dog is an Afghan
hound
so she said it's probably a golden
retriever but you know maybe I'm wrong
and then we do find people and one of
the really interesting things is show
ice can either be a one-on-one
experience or a group experience and she
does have memory of the user so
sometimes she will reveal things that
she's not supposed to reveal in groups
so that's definitely an interesting
challenge of does the bot the bot might
know you but do you want it to reveal
what you're doing when you're talking
with friends but one of the nice things
is it's also a great way to introduce
show eyes to other users so here the
user uploads a picture of a dog Xiao
Weis recognizes it as a dot as a
Labrador and then another user is like
who's this person and they say you know
I don't know it's a popular guy who
recognizes dogs on Weibo my gosh and
then someone else is like no it's a
Microsoft chat bot show just how whether
or not you're willing to introduce a bot
to your group of friends I think is a
really good indicator of do you find it
interesting because you probably
wouldn't add a chat bot to a group and
have it reply to your friends if it
wasn't adding to the conversation and so
we released this with a lot of skills
and it started to it was growing the
audience really loves Wednesdays because
that's when new features are announced
and then we started to have companies
actually come and ask us to integrate
their services into show ice so JD is
sort of like Amazon in China it's like
the number two seller I think and so
we've been working with them to
incorporate their sort of database of
goods into show eyes so she can start
you know working with businesses and
part
with them and and kind of expanding out
her skills there is also I think it's
like a television show she's now like a
newscaster she gives like the weather or
something or the news quite remember so
she's you know become a TV personality
just kind of become a star and so we
have a lot of people like this this
journalist basically interviewed her and
then shared out everything the interview
and you know posted it and things like
that show
I guess the learning from show eyes it
was really unexpected I mean we started
it as a hackathon project we didn't
really expect it to grow and as people
have used it we've just kind of poured
more energy and fuel into it and it's
really been great for the researchers to
be able to release these bite-sized
skills and just see how they are used so
here's just some examples of some vision
skills we have a really strong vision
group in China also you know so there
were the dogs then they did you know
book titles and things like that so she
can recognize books and say things like
you know it's so easy this book is
creativity people who like this book are
trying their best to be big bosses right
trying to be silly so you know you can
upload pictures of you know clothing and
she says you know this looks like your
pants are broken maybe you want me to
help you fix it or just people uploading
pictures that you guys are probably seen
- how old are you how old it's a little
game I guess you can post a picture of
yourself on the internet so we have a
bunch of image recognition technology
that can determine gender of people
emotion how old you are you know a
variety of things and so what they do is
rather than just say we think you're 29
and they'll sort of editorialize the
comments that are pasted back on the
photos based on on the data that they
get back from the service so we've been
we were super excited you know shy wise
was unexpected
we got like all these write-ups we
release it in Japan it was very popular
and so we thought we would try a u.s.
experiment what could possibly go wrong
and so with Tay we really began again
with okay Tay is probably going to be
really different in the u.s. than in
China and so we were thinking of like
well what's her personality and
character and how does it match kind of
the u.s. audience same age great age
range but you know different culture and
so we were really loved kind of this
internet glitchy kind of memes and that
we thought that it would match today's
capabilities because like I said before
your chat bot is really only as smart as
the data corpus that you have for
chitchat and when you first release it's
not that smart because you don't have
that much data and so you're relying a
lot more on editorial and you know as
Microsoft I think one of the things that
we learned is it's kind of hard to roll
out an experiment our biggest worry with
day I think when we launched it was that
no one would pay attention that wasn't
really the case and probably sometimes
that will be the case exactly when we
don't want it so we were trying to think
how do we kind of match internet culture
so we had like all these kind of visual
images that we thought about when we
thought of Tay because we wanted to try
to set expectations that because we knew
when we first launched it wouldn't it
wouldn't be as good as show eyes so if
you haven't seen stay one of the things
that we did with Tay also is we really
design Tay to work one-on-one and with
small groups so we had tested it a ton
on students and actually kick Ivor in
folks there were some of our best
partners because they really have that
age demographic so kick and group me
where the chip were the channels that we
launched on and again we were trying to
be kind of low-key and we decided to add
Twitter kind of at the end because we
thought you know people might not be
using group me and kick and people would
want to be able to see what was going on
so so this is kind of an interesting
graph so we launched Twitter and I think
people kind of know what happened
launched Tay and it was kind of amazing
like
we were expecting the audience when we
launched it - we were actually gonna
initially release it on April Fool's Day
because we thought that way we could be
more experimental and we decided to
release it before build and I think the
first like 10 hours were amazing
actually people were using it in ways
that we weren't expecting it Twitter was
actually really popular so Twitter for
Reena and Xiao Weis is extremely boring
it really doesn't get used and you could
kind of see what people were doing in
Twitter and it was really exciting and
then probably around 6 o'clock it just
started to started exploding in a super
negative way and so Gilad I don't know
if you guys know Gilad so that you know
Twitter all the data is public and so we
had different people sort of looking at
some of the data analysis of like who's
using Tay what happened you know just to
understand and so it was pretty
interesting because we found that there
was kind of this so this is just a
picture of his data analysis which was
really interesting for us to see with a
you know kind of troll gamer trolls were
sort of at the core of a lot of
misbehavior but then we had a lot of
anti-feminist there were a lot of Trump
supporters and then a lot of attack
people so it was kind of a strange
mixture of Trump supporters mean
anti-feminists and gamers and
technologists but I think it just
reinforces for us it was a surprise that
it was up so much interest so I think
one of the questions that we've had
today is is this all hype is it not hype
you know where are we going with this
and I think that the general public is
actually just really interested in this
topic and so how we capitalize on that
going forward I think is really
interesting and also how we I mean there
are any of you from Twitter here but I
think the difference between a chat bot
that you interact with with your friends
in a small group and something that's
really public on the internet just
surprised us we probably should have
thought more about it and we will you
know next time just a note - the other
thing is we have this system for
combining and I think someone said this
in the last
sort of writing editorial in sort of an
improv style together with algorithmic
chat and so one of the things that we
did is we actually hired a lot of improv
artists to come in and teach us how do
you do improv how do you structure the
sentences and what are some rules that
we could learn from and one thing that
improv artists do is they don't end
sentences in ways they want to keep the
conversation going and they want to
engage the user so for example one thing
that an improv writer would do is they
would maybe end a sentence with
something that's going to bring you back
in so we used kind of we would break up
sentences sometimes where part of it
might be algorithmic and then part of it
might be editorialized to kind of bring
to keep the users going and we could
kind of watch how that improved over
time kind of like Xiao Weis we were
really looking to to be like what people
trust about and what does that mean so
initially we had rolled teh out to a lot
of student groups and we had a lot of
students using Tay and like the Shou ice
example you can't really see this was
people initially thought it was a human
being an AI bot so they were you know I
thought that was pretty interesting that
students are we're onto the fact that a
lot of times chat bots are humans it was
it was a fairly common thing that people
would think that Tay was actually driven
by a human we thought that that was a
great sign that maybe you know we were
doing we were onto something so this is
just an example of our image reco that
we did we did the same thing that you
saw with Shou ice but we kind of styled
it in a different way so people could
share a photo and then Tay might say
something back that was kind of snarky
and edgy we had a lot of arguments
actually in the team of how edgy to be I
I was probably the most conservative and
I'd always be like I hate it when she
calls me like when you call it cooter
Tate would always be like cougar and the
Cougar in the house and I think that's
just rude it should be nicer or she
would like yeah so we would so what's
funny though is is actually maybe not so
funny for you the user if you're using
it one on one but it's actually
funny in the group to have take ein dove
be edgy and somewhat insulting she
wasn't insulting to the youngsters but
um you know so that was just fun for
people to see what she would say back is
super popular feature and basically they
were using gender age emotion and things
like that to editorialize comments that
they would put over the images like I
said we built a using a bunch of
components that we had in-house so we
have you know natural language tools we
actually have a whole range of natural
language tools we have things like the
image commenting we have vision
technologies and we released it on group
me kik and Twitter and so what we did
and that was sort of the genesis of the
bot framework we thought well let's make
a lot of these tools open to other
people so the cognitive services are
sort of a you know build on a lot of
Cortana intelligence and so those are
we're already public to people and so we
decided to make the bot framework part
of it also public and release that so
one of the things that we were finding
in our own team is we have you know a
bunch of these chat BOTS that we were
designing and we needed to have a
developer on each channel and each
Channel and I think we talked about this
earlier is shifting constantly and so
was just expensive to have a developer
per channel per chat bot we have a bunch
of like different kinds of bots that
we're building and so we thought if we
could somehow standardize that even for
ourselves it would be really helpful and
we kind of open-source that within the
company and people were really
interested in using that and either
connecting in a channel or connecting in
bots
and being able to make things work
across in a more scalable way for
developers was something that we were
doing across the board so so one thing
and this is I just wanted to bring this
up like we've been talking a lot about
chat channels and we have like you know
other kinds of channels too that you
might want to think about so one of the
channels that we actually have that we
didn't talk about is this thing called
direct line and direct line just
basically gives you a REST API and then
point to your bot and so we've had some
people who have client apps like
Minecraft or things like that be like oh
I could just use that too
ad bots and chat to my app we also have
a web chat control that people like to
just embed on their web page in addition
to supporting channels like you know
Skype and greet me and slack and
telegram and you know others so we we
aren't so this isn't really like plan of
record or anything but I think that this
is really interesting for us to think
about because games are hugely popular
and I think just thinking more broadly
about where chat and BOTS might happen
could be kind of cool so our scenario
here was like it would be really cool if
kids were learning to code and they
could do it from their phone and kind of
control their their Minecraft world and
this is just Lars actually did this in a
hackathon that we had where we were
saying like okay if you can talk across
channels maybe there's other kinds of
things that you could do besides just
talking in that channel so today when
you create a group you know we're all
like should we create a slack group or a
Google group or should we do email or
where should we be so this idea was that
the bot could kind of let different
people be on whatever channel they want
to be and could kind of route the
messages to you in different ways so we
haven't really brainstorm that much on
what could you do across channels that
you can't do very easily today and how
could we facilitate this but these I
think I just want to put some ideas out
there for things that we could do maybe
that we haven't talked about that much
today and then finally I just wanted to
end on something that we did 20 years
ago
so this is comic chat and so we started
my very first job at Microsoft was
working on comic chat and I still I've
been looking for the source code so who
for you guys said you know not only
startup code sometimes gets lost but
actual product code also gets lost it's
from 20 years ago but this was a really
cool graphical UI on top of IRC and we
worked with this amazing comic artist
named Jim would ring and we basically
let you pick a character and it would
create a comic book history of your
conversation as you chatted following
comic book rules so like if you waved it
would kind of like show the character
waving and you could have a range of
gestures and it would kind of build
these comic books for you just very cool
so yeah looking for the source code so
if anybody has it let me know but um but
you know I think there's a lot to that
we could do combining and the user
experience and the interactions that
people are having I'm automatically the
funny thing about this is you know for
IE 3.0 and I think if you guys remember
ie 3.0 was a long time ago but this
actually shipped as the default chat
client in IE so IE actually shipped with
a chat client and it was comic chat
which is really weird I don't know how
they convinced people to do that so
there's a way where you can turn off the
graphics and it's just IRC chat which
it's kind of weird to ship IRC with IE
anyway but um I just thought that was
funny funny funny trivia from the past
so um so that's it thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
