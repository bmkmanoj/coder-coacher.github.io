okay so good morning everyone this talk
will be on a part of the thing I'm doing
during my PhD on improving efficiency in
range squaring in distributed online
games so massively distributed massively
multiplayer online games or mmm oh jeez
offer a vast virtual environment which
players are able to freely explore any
player in the game is able to interact
with virtually any object or other
player in the game however at each given
moment it only sees object that are
located inside the so-called area of
interest that surrounds the player and
the mmog application has to guarantee
responsiveness of the area of interest
for each player that is all objects that
are located inside the area of interest
of a player should be displayed with
very very low latency a range query is a
basic operation that allows to retrieve
all the objects or update all the
objects located inside a particular area
of the game space therefore range
squaring is very well suited to retrieve
the area of interest of players and in
the context of multiplayer online games
should be very responsive and massively
multiplayer online games has has been
very popular over the first order over
the past few years here we can see
applaud that shot that the accumulated
population of mm oh geez has reached 16
million in the 10 years that followed
the emergence of mm oh jeez the market
income has been estimated to 2.7 billion
dollars in
2010 and still grow however
paradoxically the main problem of
current mmm oh jeez is that they don't
scale to support the huge amount of
players the mm oh jeez split the whole
population in two separate gaming
instances called charts and each shard
is held by one server the populations
that are located in different charts are
unable to communicate with each other
and each charts population is limited to
only a few hundreds of players which
results in a poor gaming experience
moreover since the popularity of the
shards is not uniform some of the of the
game instances are very popular and
almost overloaded whereas others are
left almost empty which leads to a
substantial financial loss for the game
provider such a poor got good suit such
a poor architectural choice comes from
the fact that the key risky requirement
of mm oh jeez the responsiveness of the
of the display of the area of interest
is pretty hard to ensure at large scale
the game has to the architecture has to
provide very low latency for some key
mechanisms of mm oh jeez such as routing
range query or publish-subscribe which
is hard to do at large scale also
security is one of the main concerns
even if it will be outside of this
outside of the scope of this talk so
these are these are complicated
challenges and over over the past few
years a whole lot of academical work has
been addressing these problems sometimes
with very good idea
but still all the existing mm oh jeez
our steel server-based which means that
there is virtually no impact of these
academical works from the market I state
that these such few impact comes from
the fact that only a few solutions
proposed in the state of the art are
really adapted to mmog workload so in
this talk there will be two parts that
will explain to my two main
contributions of my work in the first
part I will describe how we can improve
routing in peer-to-peer mm oh jeez
wisnan with non-uniform peer
distributions that will be main part of
the talk and for the part 2 I will
explain you my current work which is
density aware range partitioning for
scalable low latency range wearing so
first part on the peer-to-peer and
emojis one of the ways to address
scalability in emojis is to use
peer-to-peer range query overlays such
range query overlays game part range
partition the game space that is each
peer has coordinate in the game space
and stores objects that are the closest
to its coordinate and to peers that are
close to each other in the game space
will be neighbors inside the overlay so
here we have an example of a partition
of the game space following a voronoi
diagram and the underlying delon a graph
such kind of peer-to-peer overlays are
extremely well-suited for mmm oh jeez
because they preserve data locality and
therefore they enable efficient range
query they also inherent
provide decentralized greedy routing and
the peer-to-peer para Deegan ensures
that the overlay has a good fault
resilience and low cost for the game
provider since the whole architecture
relies on the players there are a few
example of such kinds of overlays in the
state of the art our goal is to improve
the routing process inside a range query
overlays the since they preserve data
locality the routing process is not
needed for local interactions of the
player however it is still need for a
few mechanisms of mmm oh jeez namely the
routing efficient routing is needed when
appear joins the overlay since it has to
be routed to its coordinate we also have
load balancing because some areas of the
game space may be overloaded and under
loaded Pierre may be asked to join the
overlay in that particular point which
will incur routing and also many
existing mm oh jeez provides
teleportation to their players because
they are often the game space is often
partitioned into several zones we have
for example player versus player
battlegrounds or barter areas or
exploration areas and players have to
have to be allowed to move quickly from
one zone to another so here for example
a player wants to teleport in that
particular area and it has to wait for
the message to be routed to reach it the
problem is that non-uniform Pierre
distributions degrade routing
performance in range query overlays
now why is it happening and Kleinberg
showed that it is possible to add
shortcuts to the graph of the of the
overlay to enable poly logarithmic
routing so if the shortcuts of each
player are chosen with a particular
distribution then the whole graph will
exhibit the so-called small world
property that enables the poly
logarithmic routing and it is very easy
to build such shortcuts if the pure
distribution is uniform so here we have
a simple example of a peer that has
shortcuts in the overlay however
building such shortcuts is challenging
when the distribution is non-uniform so
there is basically a proof for that but
an intuition is that a player that is
not aware of the distribution will miss
some of the density hot spots while do
well wiring its shortcuts so for example
here if we have a density zone the
shortcuts of the pier a will completely
miss the densities on and therefore will
not be a small world anymore there is a
known result that shows that with
non-uniform data distributions it is
possible to build small world links but
only if the distribution is known to
each pier which is kind of challenging
unfortunately we we have evidence of the
fact that the distribution inside mm oh
geez inside existing mm oh jeez is
highly imbalanced here for example and
basic analysis we did on traces from
second life which is a popular MMOG and
so we divided the game space into cells
and counted the number of players inside
each cell
and one what can we actually see is that
there are a few cells that I highly
overloaded whereas the rest of them is
more or less empty and other this is
consistent with other studies that has
been done for other mm oh jeez so the
distribution inside mmog game space is
highly imbalance which in turn degrades
the the rooting process sorry if I
recall maybe 128 or something yeah so
our solution is to make the Pierce
density aware and on each peer we will
build a map of the density distribution
and then we will use this map to create
density of our shortcuts that will
enable small world property there are
several solutions to make Pierce density
aware a first native solution is to
locally collect all the coordinates of
all the peers so that the pier will be
able to construct that kind of
distribution which when in which each
dot represents a peer coordinate and
then it will use it to estimate the
density however this approach is not
scalable because the overlays we are
targeting our very large scale scale so
there will be probably many thousands of
peers and also since it is peer-to-peer
overlay we have possibly high churn
rates that means that coordinates of the
peers will be updated very frequently so
storing up to date coordinates of all
the peers is not scalable
therefore we need to approximate the
distribution so for the approximation we
use a local quadtree that is local to
each peer so here we have an example of
the non-uniform density distribution in
which each dot represents a peer
coordinate when we have to identify high
density zones and on the right is the
corresponding approximation of the
density of the game space and we can
clearly see that here we have the two
hot spots with high density clearly
identified and since it is an
approximation the density inside each
zone is considered to be uniform now
first when the pier joined the overlay
the it's local map is completely empty
because it has no information about the
density distribution however as it
joined the overlay it has direct
neighbors in inside the overlay and no
knows the coordinates of these neighbors
therefore it is able to locally compute
the local density of the key space so it
adds this information to its local map
then the peers share the local
information to acquire a global state we
use two mechanisms to acquire the global
state the first one is that we are
piggybacking density information to
existing messages and we are also using
gossipy algorithm that propagates
recently modified regions
and since this distribution is dynamic
because points of interest inside the
game can change and oblique objects can
be created or removed the density map
inside each peer is able to adapt by
overwriting recent information however
writing all the information when new
information is available the second step
is to use the the map the approximation
of the density distribution to create
small world shortcuts on each peer so a
well-known technique to do that is so
called the log partitioning which
consists in partitioning the graph
starting from the coordinate of the peer
into log n partition and each inner
partition will split the outer partition
into half so each time the distance
decrease by half and it has been proven
that if the pier managed to partition
the graph in that way and chooses one
random peer inside each partition then
they upped the obtained distribution of
shortcuts will be a small one however to
create these shortcuts to use the log
partition we need either to have the
whole graph or to accurately estimate
hop distances to be able to create these
partitions
so we use our map to estimate hope
distances inside the the graph so a peer
has its map and wants to estimate hop
distance between a and B it first finds
the regions of the mud that intersect
this segment a B then it estimates the
hop the hops in each region and since
the density distribution in each region
is uniform estimating Hobbs inside the
inside one region is straightforward and
then it sums all the results for all the
regions to obtain a global estimation of
the hub distance then this technique is
used to sample the map in order to find
the coordinate that is the fattest from
the PS coordinate in terms of hops so
the map is sampled with this system
defined number of samples number of
samplings and each time it does a sample
it estimates the hub distance to the
sample and finally take the maximum as
the farthest coordinate from the peer
inside the the game space so here the
fattest coordinate is considered to be
here because the Pierre has found that
there is a big hot spot that is located
in between the position of a and the
coordinate which means that there will
be a lot of hops to reach this
coordinate and once we have this
estimation we approximate log partitions
that is the we compute the maximal this
inside the the game space so it is the
distance between the coordinate of a and
the farthest coordinate and then this
distance then the the map is used to
find the distance that is halfway to the
pier then one fourth way to the pier and
so on which basically leads to
approximate the log partition this
particular this particular algorithm is
completely done locally so the only cost
we have is the local computational cost
of the sampling which is a user-defined
parameter and once all this coordinate
has been determined the pier routes a
connect message to each of these
coordinates and the pier that answer to
the connect message becomes the shortcut
of the pier and if the distances hop
distances have been accurately estimated
then the obtained shortcut distribution
will enable the small world property to
evaluate our mechanism we used
simulation based on real data so we
implemented the whole system in the
simulator and then we injected real
traces we have various number of traces
we have latency traces collected from
peers between peers from the internet we
have turned traces from several systems
that are peer to peer or also cooperate
desktops and for game density traces we
use traces that we derived from the
second left second life avatar
distribution
and we compared our mechanism in the
simulator 2 different rewiring
techniques that build short cuts through
the overlay first a very simple random
approach which is pro which has been
proven to not enable small world poly
logarithmic routing and then three other
rewiring technique that are known to
enable small world properties first now
I'm taking random from the coordinates
in the game space so it means that
basically the random will not be able to
capture the distribution yeah the small
word shortcut me rewiring mechanisms
first a mechanism that enables to lock
partition in the space but without
taking into account the density
distribution so we create create log
partitions by assuming that the
distribution is uniform then we used we
compared to Oscar which is a
state-of-the-art system in which the
sampling of the keys of the game space
is done by random walks and finally the
so-called optimal one for which HP holds
the whole overlay graph and so it is
able to accurately know the hub distance
to other peers first we wanted to know
if our mechanism enabled small world
shortcuts so we evaluated the average
average root length in Hobbs versus the
overlay size compared to a simple
logarithm function and what we can see
is that donut clearly exhibit exhibits
logarithmic routing which means that the
links that we that the shortcuts that we
create with our mechanism enables a
small world property a second important
result is that donut
our contribution is very close to
optimal strategy that means that the hot
distances are accurate enough to be
close to distances obtained by going
through the graph basically this is a
very good news that donut is within ten
percent of the optimal then the next
surprising result is that Oscar behaves
pretty well they're pretty badly sorry
and we hope that comes from the fact
that it uses peer sampling that it uses
random walk for peer something and
random walks behave badly if the
underlying graph is not an expander and
we believe that the Dillon a graph which
we use for our simulation was not an
expander so random works led to a non
uniform approximation of the game space
then we used our latency traces to
estimate the the latency of the rooting
process with an overlay size of 2500
peers and here again we can see that
doughnut is really close to the optimal
strategy and enables average rooting
within 300 milliseconds through the
overlay one might say that collecting
the global state is expensive so we
estimated the band which bandwidth usage
that is needed to propagate the global
state so we evaluated the consumption
per peer during a whole week and at the
end of each day we completely change the
distribution so the coordinates of the
hot spots were changing every even and
here we can see that as the distribution
changes
the mechanism struggles to acquire the
new updated view of the distribution
which happens every day and the main
information of this plot is that the
consumption is of only a few bytes per
second per node which is really low and
may be considered negligible even for
peer-to-peer systems with low bandwidth
and we can see a slight increase of the
consumption over the days which we
believe comes from the fact that the
distribution complex suffice since we
are changing the hot spots so all hot
spots still haven't vanished and new hot
spots are emerging so since the key
space the game space becomes more and
more complex the amount of information
to exchange grows however at a certain
point if it becomes unaffordable to
propagate the whole information of the
of the game space the precision of the
map can be can be fixed so the
information appropriated information
will be fixed with any distribution so
to conclude this first part the
contribution in pewter Pierre mm oh geez
are completely decentralized technique
to aggregate distributed game space
information which is really cheap
because it costs only a few bytes per
second per Pierre and yet it is accurate
enough because it can be used to build
small wall shortcuts that are density
aware which improved state of the art by
twenty percent and are ten percent
within the optimal
so this concludes the first part of the
top yes basically because new
information of the right salt
information so at some point if a zone
has changed the pier will propagate new
information and the if before there was
a deep part of the tree it will
overwrite and prove the this part ok ok
so the second part would be on the work
I'm doing now so it's still a work in
progress so there won't be any results
showing here still I find that it is a
promising work so it works it mentioned
to be mentioned it will be on density
aware partitioning in server oriented mm
oh jeez so we're not in the peer-to-peer
context anymore what we want is to
partition the game space among servers
since the whole game space maybe to
having to maintain by a unique server
and when we partition what we want is to
first enter fair load balancing do not
overload any nodes and also which is
very important we want to minimize
multi-server range queries because we
have a long latency requirement on the
range on the range query in forum emojis
and range queries that span over
multiple servers will will have higher
latency so we want to avoid we want to
get all the range queries possibly on
one server on so we use range
partitioning
as in the previous part because it's a
good choice for mmm oh jeez because it
preserved data locality the problem is
that optimal partitioning depends on the
current game state so here is a simple
example of a simple game distributions
here we have three zones in the game and
three servers to partition them on the
left we have a bad partition why is it
bad it is bad because it partitioned
each zone between several servers and
more particularly it splits this zone
which is which happens to be high
density because of the game state
between three servers and since it is a
high density zone there will be a lot of
range query inside because there are a
lot of players and all of these queries
will span over three servers which will
incur bad performance so a good
partition of this particular game space
would be to partition into distinctly
each zone and affect them each zone 21
server so that this hotspot will be
located only one one server and range
queries are will be there for very
responsive however we can clearly see
that the this this partition the the
performance of the partitioning depends
on the game state so our contribution is
to use density aware partition this
comes from a simple observation the
simple observation is that most range
queries are happening in to high density
zones whereas the low there's a low
density desert zones
have almost no range queries happening
inside so we would like to ideally
purple and do the partition only inside
the low-density zones without splitting
the high-density hotspot we currently
have a prototype running on on a cluster
we have the the architecture is
organized into a ring of servers and
each server is given a slice of the game
space depending on the position on its
position into the ring we have a
coordinator that approximates the global
density distribution of the game space
and then maintains dynamic partitioning
according to that distribution
to acquire a global state each server
samples the distribution of the
partition that it is in charge of and
then all the approximations are sent to
the coordinator the coordinator
aggregates this knowledge to obtain a
global view of the game space
distribution and according to that
initiates load balancing this the load
balancing partitioning mechanism is
inspired by recursive by section which
means that the game space is recursively
split into slots which sloppy each slot
contain approximately the same number of
objects and then each server gets a fair
amount of contiguous slots I said fair
amount and plot equal amount because the
coordinator may choose to give more
slots to one server if it prevents the
partitioning of a hotspot for instance
here we have a bad partition in which
which is perfectly load balanced because
each server receives four slots however
it is bad because a density hot spot has
been partitioned between server be and
server a and on the contrary a good
partition would be to allow slight low
in balance because server c and server
be receive only three slots and server a
receive six slots however it is
considered to be good because the
density hotspot here is preserved in is
entirely start on pier on on server a
so how do we avoid bad partition the
coordinator is aware of the global
density distribution it also knows the
current load of each server so it runs
through the distribution through the
density distribution by trying to detect
partitioned hotspots and once the
partitioned hotspot has been detected
like here if the nodes if the servers
that hold that hot spots are not
overloaded it tried to adjust the
partition in order to avoid splitting
the the hotspot so for instance it tries
to affect the partition the hotspot to
the server a and since it achieves that
without overloading server a it
considers that the partition is good so
it applies that partition to the system
and here we can see that a rather
significant load imbalance is allowed is
allowed because the main goal is not to
partition one of the density hot spots
but since none of the server none of the
server's is overloaded it is accepted so
this is an ongoing work so we don't have
any results yet but we have a prototype
which is basically a distributed
in-memory database which is written in
Java it can be and can be accessed
through G DBC connector on each server
we have h2 in-memory database that is
used to provide consistent consistent to
the range queries we also have inter
partition queries which has which are
also kept consistent we are now
evaluating our system on grid 5000 which
is the French academical dedicated
cluster and also for we want to use
planetlab to simulate high client client
activity and finally we managed to
contact provider of world of warcraft
server which is a known and very popular
MMOG which accepted to log the activity
from his error for us so we are now
collecting traces from a real world of
warcraft server with approximately 800
players playing at all the time so to
conclude my talk will sum up the
contributions first in the first pad I
presented a scalable technique to
acquire a global knowledge about the
game space density distribution which
has can be performed at low cost in a
fully decentralized context then I
presented a technique to converge to a
small world overlay with non uniform
distributions by using the this global
knowledge and finally I presented a
system that allows density aware
partitioning that minimize inter
partition range queries therefore making
them much more responsive so the
conclusion to the talk is that
integrated real work load
characteristics into the system is the
key impact is the key to impact mmog
design thank you
you already used somewhat some others
ended provide you with Lauren I have
overlay okay yeah so if you want to just
locally there is no run yes so this is
only teleporting load balancing and
James yeah but if you below yeah but if
some of the some of the region's support
is becoming overloaded we might choose
to take an under loaded node and join it
to the to this position in order to
support the whole hot spot we have to
locate a low unknown download that node
and then route it to the Oval auditors
oh yeah sure it's probably on a desert
zone somewhere opposite so you show what
is the advantage how after your piece
when you decide that you want to
I don't have numbers but players often
move from a zone to another if they want
to fight with each other or if they want
to just trade so they have to move from
one zone to another and also there are
some crowd phenomena that can form if
there is a battle so a zone can become
rapidly overloaded so they will need it
will need fast load balancing and
related question with you so you use
some kind of overlay algorithm
underneath which essentially will give
you some partition with depending on
what it does yep excuse me so when the
eval atleast Lenny said that you were
changing zones overnight and so on did
you take into account the actual
behavior of the underlying / algorithm
and how it affects the basically we
changed the we only took into account
the pier distributions so with natural
turn from our traces piers disconnected
from one hot spot and connected to
another so the pier distribution were
naturally long uniform because of some
quality as you said
point to have something which is more
Jenny's been harping at the same time I
supposed to these turning on and off so
you could have a bigger changing apology
how would that reflect the convergence
of your outing I think we will see we
would see a peak of the bandwidth since
the map struggles to adapt sorry yes
you're essentially moving when you move
to a new stage you are essentially want
to communicate with the coordinator of
that celebrate yes that's right so so
why do we need party happening can't you
just have one out routing and you
mentioned a number of coordinators are
on the order of that state any hundred
you PA so is it to gain information
about all the coordinators in the first
look off in the first part we have a
peer-to-peer overly which basically has
many thousands of peers so important but
the coordinator I'm sorry this that
might be a misunderstanding and
misunderstanding the coordinator is only
for the second part of the talk which is
non peer-to-peer we have first part
about peer-to-peer system which is
completely decentralized and then on the
second part we have a server based
system with coordinators
to a new cell you would talk to any
random loading capsule and in establish
connection or you would be bored I have
to find the coat the coordinate di have
to find the pier that is responsible for
that it is done by greedy routing so I
want to move to a particular coordinate
so I wrote a message with this
coordinate and the overlay greedy
routing enables that the message will
arrive to the pier that is the closest
to the coordinate which is basically the
coordinate ok ok
for the moment it's under evaluation so
I don't have any precise results but we
are
we might have to move several several
partitions for London's
for the four which part so if I'm sorry
could you
if a player moves from one zone to
another yeah hi I'm that case it it
depends only on the time it takes for
the group to move because if we have a
crowd phenomenon with a lot of user
gathering together to move somewhere if
it takes if they stay together for a
long time the coordinator may identify
is it as a hotspot and try to move a
server to to accompany the whole crowd
but if it's a fast phenomenon so just
people crossing well then it does not
encouragement of partitions
the video
we still waiting we're still waiting for
up traces they are currently being done
I how specifically are the partitioning
techniques the server assignment to have
enough for database could you summarize
a generalized you didn't have a natural
coordinate space for buddy application
but
for the moment this is this really
targets and images because we have
identified specific work load patterns
so we are addressing this but that might
be used for some for pop subsystems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
