okay I'd like to welcome query for sites
he's an adjunct faculty from the ITP
program at NYU he's also an expert at
ember j/s he helped out the fuse labs
group at MSR with some work that we were
doing over in New York City with Katie
London and he's come here today to share
some of his knowledge about ember Jess
Thank You Corey thanks in here nice to
meet you all my name is Corey Forsythe
I'm Mantic on Twitter and I run a
consulting company in New York called
201 created anyone have an idea of why
we're called that close that would be
Jersey which is very close it is the
it's the HTTP status code for creating a
new object yeah we use that sort of like
as a litmus test sometimes for our
clients if they can figure it out then
we know we can work with them yeah and
as Laura said we used to be called 404
but that just didn't work out so yeah so
today I'm going to talk about single
page applications sort of like go a
little bit over like what they are why
why they're popular now what what they
do why we build them and then
specifically talk about my tool of
choice ember Jas for creating single
page apps and what it provides us and
then I'm going to show a little bit
about the project that we worked on with
fuse to make a number of application
within Microsoft here so single page
applications sometimes abbreviated as
spas this I've I've had people talk to
me about this and I always surprised me
until I sort of figured out what it
meant last year and but they are let's
see so what is a single page application
exactly and how does it differ from this
so the typical sort of you know browser
experience that we have had for most of
the time that we've had browsers on the
web is like Colin result response server
we make a request and sends off some
data or a request to the server server
does a little bit of processing and
sends back a full page so it was very
much like a page-by-page experience
and we're we're sort of moving now into
a new mode of being I think on the web
the the primary part about single page
apps is the single page part refers to
the fact that we are now able to build
web applications that don't rely on page
reloads full page reloads before it's
more of a sort of a long-lived
application in the browser and a lot of
the things that that entails meaning we
start to have to think about memory
management and synchronization of data
between what we're showing on the client
end to what other clients may be
creating also what's on the back end
stuff like that there are a lot of new
complexities sort of this this brings to
the table we still work within the
context of the web so we have to like
manage URL and browser history and we we
think more now I think in terms of flows
than just in screens so rather than
moving from screen to screen we think
about like a real low latency UI where
different actions that the user takes
will change other other things that they
see on the screen it's not simply
throwing down all the state to the
server and then rebuilding a write back
up on the next page request here's a
example of sort of a canonical single
page applications that you do manager a
to do MVC comm they this is like the
Rosetta Stone I think of to do apps and
and application JavaScript frameworks
for the front end you can see this is
the amber example they all work exactly
the same way but it shows you'll see you
can the top of the screen is a little
bit cut off but you can see how the URL
changes that was we move around all this
stuff is happening without any server
implementation having to happen at all
so why so now that we have an idea of
what some of edge applications are
question is why why do we build them at
all what what do they give us that we
don't get normally and I think there are
a few major reasons the very big one is
mobile so a low latency UI which is what
we can have when we don't have to fetch
the entire state from the server every
time is that's what we get
we can avoid that call response cycle
and especially for mobile where
bandwidth is at a real premium and
there's high latency between the server
the cloud and your phone or your tablet
it makes a lot of sense to build an
application that can run for a long time
that can be responsive and snappy and
increasingly I think there's a
marketplace expectation now users are
used to AB sitting more and more
powerful they're used to native apps and
so they want to see the same experience
on the web
and the reason why we build these in
HTML instead of proprietarily though in
native apps is that we can we can share
everywhere so the project I'm gonna show
you here here is the same codebase then
it works mobile tablet web and we also
get to take advantage of a lot of the
great things that the open web gives us
like shareable URLs and just being able
to sort of like see and freely
distribute these things distribute
updates and stuff like that so now that
we have a motivation for why we build
them and what they are the question is
how my choice is Ember
and that's what I'll be talking about
for a little while now if you've seen
much about ember or read about it before
you I'm sure you've seen the slogan it's
a framework for creating ambitious web
applications it's pretty much it's on
the front page of the ember website and
something you see pretty much every time
you get involved with ember it can it
can sort of like wash over you I think
if you've seen it too many times but I
think it's worth taking a second to like
unpack exactly what that means so first
of all ember is a framework unabashedly
a framework the creators Tom Dale and
yahuda katz gave a talk at fluent conf
recently called in defensive frameworks
and they they made the case for the fact
that for what what frameworks bring to
the table and specifically what amber
does but the idea is that we are sort of
all the similarities between web
applications outweigh the differences
and we're all climbing the same mountain
so ember really works hard to provide a
structure to what you're doing but also
giving you all the tools all the hooks
and stuff like that to modify it to your
own needs and I think we're seeing that
at that out in the ecosystem no one is
being constrained by the framework of
ember and in fact I'm gonna argue in a
little bit that the predictability and
structure of that framework actually a
very positive thing the second part is
that it is for creating ambitious web
applications which i think is an
important word and to think about in
that slogan the web is Google web
applications are increasingly getting
very complex and I think ember
developers and ember framework creators
sort of have a healthy respect for that
complexity they're like originally
JavaScript was sort of like a toy
language that you would throw on add to
a web page just sprinkle on a little bit
of extra a little bit of extra form
validation or like alert messages or
something like that but increasingly
it's coming into its own as a first
class language that can be used to build
really important and powerful things and
we want to respect that complexity and
want to pave over as many of the common
challenges as we can so we can really
like reach far where their applications
and not settle for too complicated
solutions or sacrificing features
instead it's a community driven project
it's open source and it's very much
growing I just came from a conference in
Portland the first major ember conf
continuing to grow these are some of the
meetups I was able to find at meetup
calm and it's sort of spreading and
getting more and more popular around the
world I think there's a lot of interest
in the ember community to continue to
spread that and help make web developers
all over the world more productive ok at
first demo I'd like to talk about so
I'll show a couple things actually I'm
gonna go ahead and show the code for
this one because it's so simple
if you've used an ember tutorial you've
probably seen something like this before
it's the canonical use case maybe for
Amber a bind so what this is showing is
where
little template binding a property
called name to a text input field and
then displaying that same property this
is literally all the code other than
maybe like two lines of JavaScript to
set up the application this is the
entire code that handles binding those
properties from one to the other
I'll show show how it works here cool so
if I type in my name here see it just
live updating we can change it as much
as we want and it continues to update
the value that's shown on the screen
again this is this is sort of one of
their very core features that's built
into ember you never have to touch
jQuery there's no manual Dom
manipulation or anything to do this and
the nice part is that the Ember sort of
thinks of things of having like a single
source of truth I suppose for the data
so there's a controller that internally
is going to back this and store that
property name and so anywhere that
changes that name property whether it's
through user interaction on the client
side or through application code as it's
running it's going to instantly reflect
all those changes everywhere that
property is being used so this button
will set it on an application side code
and you will watch the values just
immediately propagate to the server and
likewise as many times this is just the
same template over and over again it's
the same property without having to do
anything else every other place that
it's bound will just automatically
update the same code just repeated four
times down below cool so that's a little
example of data binding another thing I
want to show is a computed properties so
this is another way Ember sort of as I
mentioned there's like the single sort
of truth single source of truth rather
for properties in code in templates they
and they live in code computed
properties allow us to maintain the
dependencies between different different
different properties that we have in our
app and combine them in logical ways so
for an example if I want to think about
taking a hike today and
Cascades I would say whether it's
raining or not as I understand it's sort
of a toll the tall order to ask for not
to be raining around here but I will say
if it weren't raining I would want to go
and if it is warm out I would want to go
don't be too cold and then I can't go
unless I have fuel in the car but if I
do then now all of a sudden the property
is just updated and I'll show the code
so we can change any combination of
these we'll continue to say no until we
get to the right one here the code for
this is also pretty simple so we're able
to use embers computed properties and
and the not to transform our raw
properties has fuel is warm and is
raining into a logical condition called
should hike and again ember justice will
continue to update the value of should
hike every time any of its dependent
properties changes these things sort of
cascade through your application they
allow you to write really expressive
communicative code and you very rarely
get into synchronization issues we have
to remember to update another dependent
property as you change one alright so I
want to show a little bit more advanced
example of data binding I mentioned that
the the properties here will just
propagate the bound of first name
property to one text input field and the
last name property to the other and
they'll combine I have them combining to
a full name property let's do this again
and they combine to a full name property
like that and ember allows you to not
just read those properties as they're
being changed by the by the user in the
interface and and react to them you can
actually react as they're being set and
decompose the computed property here
which is the abraham lincoln if I change
it here you'll notice that the name
itself changes and I'll show you the
code for how that works too
so now yes are we have a property called
full name which just combines the first
than last but it functions as both a
Sutter and a getter and so when it's
being set with the new property when I
was changing the combined property there
it was able to decompose the first name
and the last name from the component
parts and set those properties and it
again you just set these things in your
application code and they propagate to
your templates automatically and vice
versa
finally one one thing that's really nice
about members that are they're very
actively embracing the future of the web
in particular does anyone has anyone
heard of the web components w3c spec
this is a it's a spec that they're
building to is looking to find more ways
to make the web shareable and extensible
for web developers it's a spec to allow
people to write consult it's like it's
mostly based around widgets so the idea
of like a date picker for instance would
be a good candidate for a component
which has its own little maybe
JavaScript functionality the way it
reacts when you click different things
in a small calendar and it would have a
UI that displays this calendar and stuff
like that and they're all sort of
combined together you can imagine
wanting to reuse this through a lot of
different applications ember has is
embracing this is not fully built into
browsers yet but it's being actively
expect an ember is like looking to the
future and they've sort of made their
own polyfill just to allow people to use
it before it's fully ready
components okay so I made a component
that wraps around all the functionality
needed to instantiate and show a big map
so here is our Bing map and because of
embers data bindings we can bind
properties into the map and change them
live so if I can for instance change the
zoom than the map instantly updates and
zoom in here on Microsoft I can change
things that don't relate to the actual
map code like the width of the thing and
then the real power gears because this
is a component all these actions are
isolated and contained within the ember
component so I can just sprinkle it
Renne or arbitrarily wherever I would
like in my pages so for instance when I
click this it's the same map because
it's all bound to the same properties
but I'm able to just add it anywhere I
want with a little bit of template code
once I've defined what the functionality
of that is and oh they all behave the
same way so they will all instantly
update to when I change that I'll show
that code here so this is just a little
snippet from the map component but ember
has these lifecycle hooks for its
components where you can call it a bit
of code as they when it gets inserted
into the Dom so this this function
create map gets called when we called it
insert element it calls out to the
Microsoft Bing Maps
Ajax API sets up the map and then this
update map it hooks into the data
binding and the and the property chain
that I had mentioned before anytime any
of the dependent properties there Center
zoom or map type ID not type ID was
actually not shown but either if we
change the latitude and longitude or the
zoom it will immediately update the map
with the new properties and so that's
how we sort of are able to bind that and
I actually I have some an example code
for this that I have shared and people
are able to just basically take my code
and then they can drop a big map
component into their own ember out this
way and embers continuing to work on
sort of capturing and capsulated stuff
so it becomes a more shareable between
ember apps and this is the template part
I just have to specify that I'm using
the big map component and then I can
bind in any values that I want so I'm
I'm reading a zoom value in from the
outside scope and setting it to
zooom of the map cool so ember has a lot
of small I've sir just a lot of little
like nifty tricks and the different
pieces of ember that make it useful to
use but it wouldn't be that it wouldn't
it wouldn't be a framework if it weren't
giving you a structure to sort of
combine these things all together so
ember really follows in it so it's
definitely inspired by Rails the
creators of one of the creators in
particular of ember came from rails
before this and they had that same
philosophy of giving you a lot of good
defaults out of the box it's the
convention over configuration sort of
idea and amber did it sort of prescribes
a lot of things to you telling you where
things should go I'm not gonna say it
forces you but it like very strongly
encourages you to use a certain
predictable structure it gives you five
sort of basic primitives like routes
which handle serializing your
application state as you enter the
application then controllers which was
the ones that handle showing and
reacting to events in your in your UI
and then models which are your data
properties views which react to Dom
events like clicking and dragging and
stuff like that and then the templates
which actually show what's displayed
there and so ember gives you all this
like that is very predictable structure
and sort of a prescription of where all
these things should live and how they
should interact with each other why is
it important to have this predictable
structure alright before I answer that
question I'll I want to show you a
little bit one more thing the Ember
inspector is a an extension for chrome
and firefox that was recently released
and i'll just move right into it here it
allows you to inspect in any in any app
even a production app you can inspect an
ember application as it's running and
here is a screenshot of it showing i'm
i'm hovering over in the bottom part
this is the inspector i'm hovering over
one of the templates and controller and
it shows me on the screen what template
is actually being displayed there what
controller is using to
the properties and so on and the great
part about this see there we go
the great part about this is that
because it's a live application you are
able to just use the Ember inspector as
I said there's a single source of truth
for data and ember and if I change it in
the amber inspector it will instantly
update in the UI also so it's again it's
the same thing you this was sort of an
aha moment for me when I was using ember
you it feels a lot more like application
development you when you're using a 90
percent of the time you're not thinking
about how you are interacting how you
never like using jQuery to find things
or set things so there gets much more of
it like a declarative sort of formalized
structure it's really nice and this sort
of things so I said that ember has a
very productive ole structure and that's
the sort of thing that makes something
like this possible
if ember didn't have that specified
structure then you wouldn't be able to
make like a really high level tool like
this that works for all ember apps and
allows you to sort of see them change
them debug them that's the running it's
really nice the predictability in
addition it gives you very predictable
or at least much smoother PAMP ramp for
onboarding someone so anytime you come
into an ember API you know roughly where
you're going to find the files that
control the different parts of the UI if
you don't you just open up the ember
inspector and it will show you basically
tell you which template controller and
router covering any different part that
you're looking and it's a really easy to
get very productive fast on a new
project to bring new people in and
really really get going it's a nice it's
a great thing about ember I think cool
so talk a little bit about whatever
development feels like but first talk
about what now on number development
feels like and so before really using
ember the I mean we should say that
today is it's 2014 now and we still
really don't have a package manager for
a client-side JavaScript on the web
we've got Bower but it's not by no means
like a comprehensive solution it still
requires a lot of manual work to
integrate that and so there's this
awareness I think that there's still
a lot of room that we have to go the
tools for doing client-side development
have improved a lot but the default
still is to throw things into global
scope try to make sure they don't
conflict with each other edit CSS files
to match what your JavaScript expects
all this type coupling between different
parts of your application and so amber
is really trying to leapfrog that and
they're working on the tooling as well
as the application structure to sort of
get us beyond that to something that
works a little bit better so as I said
ember development feels a lot more like
first-class app development there
they're working on a lot of good tooling
for it including I'm looking forward to
ECMO script 6 syntax as much as possible
they use something called a an es6
module transpiler which allows you to
write Eknath script 6 code which looks
like the way you would actually expect
to write real JavaScript programs or any
program in any language which allows you
to define a an object or a class or
something inside a file and then export
it and then require it from another file
here use typescript so typescript is
trying to do the same thing right it's
like it's um there's unfortunately type
scripts module syntax in es6 module
syntax are not the same but I believe in
one one of type script they are going to
try to converge to be the same and I
think that'll be a really important
point to to sort of like texture will
really come into its own as in regards
to working within the greater atmos
crypt 6 community at that point but
anyway writing writing ember apps feels
a lot like that when you write your code
you write your class your model class in
one file you write your route class in
another file if you need one in the
other you just import it and use it and
then ember has a nice build pipeline
that runs through grunt runs on node to
build all the files and sort of gives
you that all out-of-the-box feels a lot
like iOS app development because you've
got or Windows presentation foundation
or what is that right yeah I haven't
used it myself but I've been told that
it offers a lot of the same data binding
and like controller and action handling
that ember does and so if you if you use
that Ember may be familiar or
for you to use also but so dimmer is
really looking toward the future and I
think they have a pretty good line on
sort of like where things are going and
how to converge on that to really make
make application development on the web
feel like real application development
rather than just sort of messing around
there are a lot of companies that use
ember now there are many more that are
not listed on that slide it's a growing
community and there's just a few of some
of the headliners there were more all
the time
and as of about a month ago also
Microsoft Research
these December and I to my knowledge it
may be the first publicly deployed ember
app from Microsoft I'm not sure if there
are others great yeah so I hope there
will be more it's ours the one we made
is called hear hear that comb go through
the people in this room Larson and mine
hear hear
gentleman see here here at the tech fest
demo it was about a month ago okay so
here here takes three one one data from
NYC which is a three one one is the
number we call for non-emergency public
issue reporting somewhere like a
streetlight out fire hydrant missing
graffiti or a pothole and it runs it
through another project from fuse called
the sentient data server which is a
something that Maps data to emotions we
take all the public 3-1-1 data that the
city gives us normalizes it sort of run
through the sentient Attah server and it
spits us out emotions for different
neighborhoods based on what they have
seen happening so if there was like a
lot of graffiti today that there wasn't
yesterday the Upper East Side might be
particularly upset about that yeah but I
feel like the Upper East Side has a very
stodgy personality so we get like fussy
and upset whereas in the Lower East Side
if there are a bunch of street lights
out that get angry and sex is much more
gritty and hardcore down there we take
all these things and we build daily
neighborhood statuses out of it and I'll
sort of walk you through a few things
and the client side this is here here
the client side UI is all built in ember
and it I think it allowed us we had a
lot to do in this project from there's a
lot of data work a lot of big data sort
of
hi data hygiene work to do with bringing
the three one one date of running
through the sentient data server and so
we wanted to be able to iterate very
quickly on the front end as we explore
different ideas for generating
neighborhood statuses and stuff like
that and ember allowed us to sort of
define a URL structure and allow us to
change different pieces in it pretty
quickly so we sort of halfway through
the project we really did a big refactor
of the sort of data we were showing and
how we were displaying it and ember
allowed us to handle that pretty easily
it manages all the URLs for you so as
you move around and move to a different
neighborhood you'll see that the
neighborhood changes up here that's nice
because it allows you to share these
things very easily if you refresh the
page then it will come right back to the
one you were at because it because it
uses the native web URL for something
like this about page where we've we've
got this map living in the background
for performance reasons we don't want to
tear down this map and rebuild it every
time we if we're only simply switching
from one screen to another and the map
lives below it so our routing structural
has a route that comes in builds up the
map and then shows the about page and
that route is the parent of the
neighborhood routes also so they seem as
they can move back and forth it won't
rebuild that code it's a performance and
it makes it easier for things like
mobile where it really matters we read
downloading all of those tiles
cool yeah so I mentioned a bunch of
these things we also were able
encapsulate a lot of client-side
authentication through ember ember uses
the JavaScript concept of promises
it's a way of managing asynchronous
behavior without having to nest in a lot
of callbacks promise represents an
eventual value so that you can you can
use promises as though they are roughly
you can sort of lay out your code
roughly as over synchronous but they
will actually sort of move from one step
to another with asynchronous sectioning
happening in between
it's a powerful abstraction it's not
unique to ember but ember was maybe sort
of a front-facing leader in sort of
bringing it into their framework and
they definitely use it for all of their
asynchronous behavior but it allows us
to manage something like a client-side
login pop-up that pops up a window
allows you to go in there forget your
password try to sign in a couple times
and finally complete it before it closes
and that's managed just through a single
line of JavaScript on the client side
well it basically says while I'm waiting
for this promise to finish do nothing
and then can continue it gives us a lot
of nice abstractions that allow us to do
things like that fairly easily and
allows us to add a bunch of other
authentication strategies without having
to change our application code in
addition ember has a really nice testing
story these are our tests some of our
tests running stuff like this also
helped us refactor ember is increasingly
putting focus on making the testing
primitives nice and easy to use but the
ones that are there now are still pretty
good and they allowed us to as I said we
had this big refactor halfway through
and a lot of this allowed us to keep the
complex client-side interactions between
different parts of the page working
while we change other parts of the
application code it sounds pretty easy
so earlier I asked who who uses ember
and I hope that at the end of this talk
you are at least inspired to check it
out and maybe the next
the news ember will be you so thanks a
lot for questions yeah can you compare
ember with knockout which seems sure
yeah actually knockout is one of the few
free minutes I really have very little
experience I probably should have looked
at more because I know it's very popular
within Microsoft knockout also has data
bindings correct yeah I'm not I'm not
sure would it would not be more of a
library or a framework
sort of a little okay all right yeah so
yeah I guess I don't really know a whole
lot about it I know that ember really
tries to be incredibly comprehensive
like it does as much as it possibly can
for you it probably goes further than
knockout does in terms of things that
you would have to solve problems it
would leave for you to solve but yeah I
don't really know too much bigger sign
application that takes a lot of dropping
again and I support that like one gate
one application growth and have so many
I'll issues on that no this is I mean
this is definitely something that the
ember folks are working on the lot is
making that easy so one thing that
they're spending a lot of time doing now
is actually improving the build pipeline
so I mentioned that you you write ember
more like a real application with files
that all live separately and sort of
like logically contained their
functionality but then they all have to
get combined and we're still working at
the web so you end up you want to end up
with one big concatenated javascript
file and takes a long time to rebuild
that pipeline so there's a lot of work
now going on to make that very fast when
you get to tens like thousands of files
that can really slow down so but I think
it's gonna get a lot faster with it they
have a new tool called broccoli which
takes trees of data sources and then
combines them intelligently and quickly
now as far as structure I
I'm not sure of the best example of a
really large complicated app yeah I'm
not sure I'm not sure what the most
complicated ones are but the some of the
ones I showed there's I think squares
app is fairly complicated the company
that funds or the the consulting company
that the creators of ember have killed a
they have a product called skylight
which is a performance monitoring tool
that has a lot of complicated routes I
believe these issues where like the
browser between a lot of memory and oh
that's sighs um yeah I'm not I'm not
totally sure I do know that they are
working in on intelligent route loading
so that's that's one of the new things
that's going to come to ember which
makes a lot of sense because the way
like the way in iOS that ported work is
you would download the entire thing one
time then you could run it forever but
web apps you're basically downloading
the entire app every time you visit that
page and so they're working a lot on
being able to easily split those parts
about so you wouldn't load up any of the
admin routes for instance if you weren't
an admin user or until you visited that
part I think that will help a lot with
memory management just the the data
bindings themselves I think actually
make a lot of that stuff easier it's a
lot harder to accidentally create a leak
when ember is managing managing that
memory for you already you know yeah
you'd have to manually do it you showed
the Ember inspector it's really
interesting I know that there are
several applications that that people
are building that use PhoneGap it's
Cordova and foam grab the same yeah to
package them up and distribute them
there's a company that whose entire
their yeah their entire company
basically runs on building apps through
phone guys it's called the app and they
allow people to generate their own apps
through a like a drag-and-drop you user
interface online and it packages it up
into an amber app runs that through
PhoneGap that actually makes it
something available that you can
download through app distribution
channels
and so I I think that they because it's
their core business they've spent a lot
of time optimizing for mobile and there
are a lot of people in general that are
optimizing for mobile like ember
because it has that repeatable structure
it gives you the ability to share common
solution patterns so for instance
there's a lot of stuff that involves
virtualizing list views that you can
share and that was built because
handling 10,000 like Dom list nodes and
in mobile is pretty tough and so well it
will automatically manage hiding them
removing them from Dom as they move out
of screen or reusing them like reusing
table cells as they shift off popping
them back on the bottom with the new
things in the grid so yeah I think that
story's going to continue to improve
member tried to use typescript and say
it wasn't quite compatible one before
trying to do member in typescript
together I think maybe that there may be
two things that make typescript a little
bit tough one is that the the static
type checking the typescript gives you
amber Amber uses like what's called a
uniform access principle for it's for
getting properties from different pieces
of the application you ask for it by
like a path name and I think the
typescript compiler is gonna be it's
gonna be really difficult for it to
infer what type of property is going to
come back from that because it would
have to introspect a string and the
string could be dynamically created so
that part of it will be sort of tough
but I think as I understand it the
intellisense will still work well in
terms of just giving you what parameters
and functions are available to you at
time so that'll help but then yeah the
typescript
the compilation as I understand it has
basically two modes like a node mode
where it says I'm gonna take typescript
files make them into common j/s style
individual files for export or web mode
where it does the compilation but also
then the bill
process for you and I the last time we
tried to use it it creates anonymous AMD
modules which do not work well with
ember because number expects to be able
it can work with AMD modules that's the
way it actually transpires down but it
needs them to be named so it can resolve
them uses dependency injection pretty
heavily so it looks up a lot of these
dependencies at runtime or as it's going
and so that part I think is the most
complicated we actually in our work we
released an open-source compilation step
4 typescript that runs through like the
grunt build pipeline but it's it's still
hard yeah I wish it were I wish were
easy to use we actually really enjoyed
using typescript we had a little bit of
trouble with it for that reason yeah
yeah I think it will be when typescript
modules match javascript echo 6 it
should actually really easy to use I
think yeah like server-side integration
for anything and make it more or less to
do certain server-side frameworks or as
long as you have a lot of line API
doesn't really matter yeah
so ember data is the official like data
layer solution for number it's the least
complete of the Ember ecosystem
partially because I would say it's the
hardest part to get perfectly right in a
generalized way it has it does work
pretty well but it is very it is the
most opinionated part of the amber
ecosystem in terms of like how it
expects things to work and be structured
and there are a lot of a lot of concerns
that come up when you're fetching data
in terms of keeping them in sync when
you have dependent resources if if a
post has many comments and a comment
changes does the post also become dirty
what needs to get sent back to the
server when new data is coming in
through like WebSockets or something
like that how do you make sure that
everything stays in sync so that's hard
and ember data does give you sort of
like a paved happy path but it is pretty
narrow at the moment they're getting a
lot better at at giving you hooks to
normalize and transform like Jason
responses from a server so you can sort
of work with an API that you don't own
transform it into the responses that I
expect but it's definitely a hard part
it gives you I would say all the hooks
Ness
to do it but it is a bit hard yeah this
is there they are perpetually this far
from like a 1.0 official release it I'm
sure it will happen and it's not too far
off but they've been sort of on the cusp
for a while I think cause they're
working really hard to try to get it
right and when it when it is released I
think will be really good yeah you talk
about the role of community here are
they contributing only to the framework
are there packages the way notice
packages that are community generated
right yeah there are definitely there's
a sort of a small ecosystem of packages
there are a lot there are a fair number
of really popular and common ones like
internationalization libraries form
validation libraries there's some
authentication libraries and those are
those are shared but like as I said it's
still even the best we have I think for
sharing this stuff is still Bower the
package management system which is
really just a download tool you know it
doesn't actually integrate it into your
app but I think this will be a thing
that comes pretty quickly an ember is a
good plug in system so they already have
sort of like a bare basic one where you
can add your own dependency injections
like register a service set and
initialize or function on your
application that will set it up and add
it to the parts of the app that it needs
but it's not totally automatic it still
requires a little bit of manual support
probably the most excitement in the
community is still around the framework
and like ironing out things particularly
it's moving into the periphery though I
would say so like the build pipeline is
getting really popular people doing a
lot of work there testing strategies and
tools are getting a lot of interest
right now and then yeah I think the next
sort of layer is this sooner or later
life is like an explosion of like
plugins once once the components as I
said the components really encapsulate
functionality so in theory they're very
easy to just sort of spread and take one
from another place and use it in yours
and that's I think where we're gonna see
a lot of things happening there's
there's a pretty good there probably
like maybe a couple dozen or something
like 3040 good libraries out there that
have reusable so there
package of I think we'll see a lot more
pretty soon yeah
thanks a lot cool yeah thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
