the computational ecology group and
microsoft research and our mission in
the computational ecology group is to
combine models and data to make
predictions about the planet so today i
want to show you two things a bit of
software and a bit of hardware that
we've been working on to make it easier
and hassle-free for people to extract
information about how why and where
animals move in their environment so the
first thing that i want to show you is a
bit of software now available on our
website called zoo tracer that's really
an arbitrary object detection computer
vision application that allows you to
track objects in video taken from pretty
much anywhere so here i have some video
of bumble bees pollinating artificial
flowers and i just want to show you how
quickly and easily i'm able to extract
the tracks using this software now this
software has no idea what Abby looks
like or how it moves so I'm going to
teach this software to recognize Abby
and to figure out how and where it moves
so I clicked on the be one time and you
can see it immediately starts getting
the track wrong so I'll go down to the
end of the frame sequence and I'll click
again and you can see the software is
doing a little bit better this time but
it's going to be that third click
hopefully where I get the magic and the
software fully figures out just what
that be looks like and where it's moving
so you can see really quickly and easily
I've extracted the track of that single
be but we're also interested in tracking
much larger animals over much longer
distances and so to do that we've been
developing some custom hardware GPS
trackers that are unprecedented Lee
light cheap and easy to program it has a
small GPS module on it a radio
transceiver and a tri-axial
accelerometer so we can tell how fast an
animal is moving as well when you put a
device on an animal not only is it
collecting information about the
environment that it's in but it's also
listening to and downloading data from
all the devices on animals in its
surrounding environment so that's really
great and really interesting but still
you're relying on animals to come within
maybe 100 to 300 meters of each other
for that data downloading process to
happen so to ensure that we actually get
the data back that we so desperately
want we've been working to build custom
drones putting these devices on those
drones so the drones can be listening
for these devices on animals when they
hear them fly over download the data and
then really excitingly they can take the
GPS data the spatial coordinates that's
streaming off the device on perhaps an
elephant for example and switch over to
its autopilot software so that that
drone is now locked on to that elephant
and can turn on other sensors like
high-definition video cameras or
temperature and pressure sensors which
we've been developing with dotnet
gadgeteer modules so I hope after seeing
these two short demos that you're just
as excited as I am about the way that
new hardware and new software are
combining to allow us to monitor natural
environments in ways previously
impossible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
