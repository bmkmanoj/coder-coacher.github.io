hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
so it's about time to start this
afternoon session my name is a George 2g
now and chairing this session so in the
field of medical science or biology we
have the only huge amount of data images
are scattered around in different
institutions hospitals are and so on but
but also our immediate different types
of our texts are in terms of medical
record scientific publications as a
scientific heritage so in order to
advance our the science in this field it
is really unnecessary to correlate those
huge amount of data and text in a
coherent manner this is a kind of a new
challenge for a science so this session
are will address on those are issues by
five speakers dr. Simon marcelin
microsoft research professor lie the
president of China pharmaceutical
university dr john dr. poon from
Microsoft Research and professor Hogan
queensland university of technology so
we have up a 10 and half minute of half
an hour for this session and up
basically for our different talks so we
don't have much time to have other
speakers so I just give our displays to
the first speaker the first speaker is a
dr. Mercer of Microsoft
good afternoon I'm going to talk very
quickly I'm only going to give you a 10
minute talk today and the reason is
because I don't really have any results
to report but what I'd like to do is I'd
like to tell you about a project that
we've started in the microsoft research
connections team the same team that
organizes this workshop and I'd like to
invite you to participate in it if if
it's a interest to you to do so now for
those of you who heard Kenji Takeda's
talk this morning about what is e
science you'll have heard something that
he said there which is particularly
relevant here and that was that it is
part of the goal of the microsoft
research connections team to build
software which is applicable in many
different areas of a science and i'm
about to describe to you some examples
of that which although i applying it in
the area of medical imaging has much
broader application and may be helpful
to you all the software i'm going to
discuss here is also freely available
under open source license for any of you
to use for for academic purposes so
medical imaging one of the things that
people don't realize is just how much
data is actually out there in terms of
medical images of medical images are a
real problem to store anybody who goes
to a hospital will have CT MRI
histopathology range of other types of
images collected about them and by some
estimates it's the single largest data
sort the single largest digital and data
source that humanity collects but it's
worse than that it's also legally
protected because it's medical data and
it has all sorts of legal constraints on
its use because it can identify people
or it can it can affect your privacy and
and other things so it's very hard to
get a set of medical data that you can
easily share with people and so what
we're interested in doing is trying to
free up the stream of medical data right
the way from the patient all the way
through to the development of betting
for better
medical imaging algorithms and the
reason why we care about that is we
believe fundamentally the better
algorithms pace of research is
accelerated by having more data more
freely available to a larger number of
scientists so that they can analyze it
they can compare their results and they
can develop new hypotheses and do
algorithms to solve new challenges and
so everything I talked about here
related to medical imaging could also
apply of course equally well to natural
language processing or to any other area
where one or more scientists wish to
compare the information that they have
between them to figure out who is has
the best techniques for analyzing a
certain set of data so the reason why we
were interested in this actually comes
from the development of the connect the
the microsoft sensor that can you can
control a gaming device for example with
what the algorithms that underlie
connect were developed we required a
very large data set of body position
images so that we could train the
algorithms to detect the body position
of someone wishing to play a game we had
tens of thousands of such images
available to us but we found that when
we ran this training sadly it wasn't it
wasn't really succeeding in training the
algorithm as well as we would like so
what we ended up doing actually is
creating a means of generating large
amounts of synthetic body position data
and as soon as we broke down the barrier
that limited us instead of just having
tens of thousands of images to having
millions of images to train our
algorithms we were capable of producing
extremely good algorithms and producing
the Kinect which of course has been a
highly successful product today so the
goal here as we see it is if you free
the data you accelerate the research and
in the area of medical imaging there's
three different stages if you see my
slide here you'll see there's a yellow
band across the top indicating we can
think of medical imaging is having three
different stages which are relevant to
us here the first is acquisition
actually collecting data the second is
annotation okay so you've got tons and
tons of data what
you going to do with it you're going to
need new tools because you have more
data that you need to analyze now and
the third is collaboration it's all very
well having it as a wonderful set of
medical data but if you're the only
person that can access that data you
can't use it to compare the success of
your algorithms with the success of
other people's very often in the medical
field you will find scientific papers
that describe extremely good algorithms
and if you want to download the training
data set so that you can compare and you
know verify that the performance of
those algorithms you'll find that that's
very hard to do perhaps because the the
data set isn't publicly available or
perhaps because it's available only for
research purposes so you don't go to a
website and you download the data
instead what you have to do is phone up
the researcher and ask for their
permission and maybe fill out a form
that's a barrier to research we want to
make sure that data is freely
exchangeable and that's what
collaboration is about so in terms of
data acquisition I won't really talk
about that because I have a very limited
amount of time today please feel free to
talk to me this evening or talk to me
after the session I'll be happy to talk
about our approaches to date acquisition
which will help streamline the process
data annotation though is interesting
because we have a tool which enables the
semi automated segmentation of medical
images in other words we have a tool
that if you need to create a set of
ground truth data data which you know is
correct so you can train your algorithms
appropriately then what you need to do
is take each medical image and manually
draw around the different structures on
that image a process called segmentation
the problem with doing that is that in
order to do this correctly you need to
be a medical expert and medical experts
are rare and they have really often
quite expensive so it's very hard to
create large well annotated data set to
train your algorithms now I'll show you
in a minute gios which is one of the
tools that we've created to deal with
that if I just move on here here's a
slide Freddy
not very readable from there but let me
tell you about it Geoff's uses a GOG
sick image segmentation an algorithm
which essentially the way it works is as
a user if you have the image in front of
you save a heart then you take a
paintbrush and you mark a piece of the
heart any piece will do it doesn't
matter then you take a second brush and
you mark an area which is not the heart
and then you push a button and
everything else happens automatically
for a 3d CT volume for example it will
detect all of the heart in one layer
then move to the next layer and detect
all of the heart and so on and so on
until it's filled out a
three-dimensional view of the heart and
it does it all automatically we've run
this algorithm we've actually shared
this this application with radiologists
who are practicing physicians and they
say that it accelerates the time it
takes them to annotate a medical image
from one hour to one minute now you can
take that literally or you could just
regarded ozio at least an order of
magnitude time-saving which is quite
remarkable now it's exactly this kind of
time-saving but you need if you've got a
human in the loop to generate your large
annotated medical data set quite clearly
you need to you need to find ways of
making that human more efficient
otherwise you can't generate enough data
to train your algorithms but let's
imagine you've succeeded let's imagine
you have your data you've generated a
large well annotated data set from that
data what do you do next now well you
don't push the button and move forward
two slides on secure
okay the next stage this stage of
collaboration is koda lab coat of lab is
a web-based actually a cloud-based
platform for the analysis of medical
images and for the comparison and
comparative benchmarking of medical
image analysis algorithms what you can
do is you can run a competition if you
wish to do so if for example I have a an
algorithm which is really good at
recognizing the heart in medical images
it can do it automatically and let's say
someone else has an algorithm which can
also recognize the hard my algorithm i
believe is eighty-five percent accurate
their algorithm they believe is ninety
percent accurate well in order to
compare the algorithm and know which one
of us is correct what we need is we need
a common set of data and its set of
parameters where we know how we're going
to evaluate the data properly in other
words a set of agreed metrics once we've
got the set of data and the set of
agreed of metrics I can run my algorithm
and get some results they can run their
algorithm and get some results on the
same data and now we can determine who
has the better algorithm these
competitions are quite standard in
machine learning quite standard in the
medical imaging community today and
coder lab is a platform that supports
exactly that kind of competition so the
many different groups could collaborate
on a common data set and actually
determine who is doing the best job of
image segmentation learn from each other
discuss the results and share the
algorithms as well there's a workflow
system built in here that's various
other things I don't have time to talk
about but I would encourage you to visit
the website that we have which is
research microsoft com microsoft
research of course / med imaging if you
go there you'll find links to the geo
sap lakay shin that i that i showed you
earlier which is freely available for
academic use so long as you don't
diagnose patients it's it's primitive to
do that and also you'll find details of
koda lab and you'll be able to go and
visit a coder lab instance and take a
look at it
and try uploading your own data building
competitions and if you really like it
please come and talk to us because it's
open source project and what we're doing
is we're building it and extending with
the help of other academics because at
the end of the day Microsoft does not
know what medical image analysis people
need as well as the medical image
analysis people do so it's far better
for them to build the features that they
need with our help rather than we build
the features without scientific input so
the whole idea of this is not all on the
Microsoft platform it's freely shareable
and it's open source so we're trying to
encourage a community to build around
medical imaging to accelerate algorithms
for everybody okay that's my talk thank
you very much
oh yes I didn't really cover that point
on the slide there are a range of
approaches to generating medical images
synthetically there are a number of
algorithms that exists today that will
create believable medical images but
they're not very accurate we believe and
so at the moment what we're doing is
we're working with Adam Brooks hospital
in Cambridge in the UK actually where
we've applied for some some funding for
this I believe we will be successful
shortly to hire a postdoc to use a very
large set of radiological images that
have been collected Adam Brooks hospital
to create to train an algorithm which
will emit synthetic images of the brain
actually is our main interest at the
moment the idea is if we can actually
create millions of medical images rather
than simply be limited to tens of
thousands perhaps that you would collect
from real patients then we would succeed
in our goal of liberating the data and
making much larger training data sets
for people to build better algorithms
the dancing question okay any other
questions or comments but it's kind of
our initiative the community involvement
is very needed so we are welcome for
your participation Oh to part as a
website to see the detail thank you very
much so the next one is a joint talk by
Professor lie and also dr. eric chan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
