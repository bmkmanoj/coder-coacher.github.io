here at the microsoft research faculty
summit 2015 and i'm here with these two
distinguished gentlemen let's start with
the first thing computational
rationality I've heard that term before
what does it mean from the cognitive
psychology perspective and then from the
machine perspective for me there's sort
of three components to this idea that
are really in common I see them as
representing a kind of a synergy or a
synthesis of convergence of ideas in
cognitive science in AI and also to some
extent in neuroscience and to me those
three ideas are one the idea that we can
understand intelligent behavior as a
certain kind of rational action but I
think coming to both of us is an idea
that maybe you could associate with like
the foundations of economics and early
the mathematics of probability the idea
that intelligence is something about
forming beliefs and using those beliefs
to achieve your desires and then
formalizing beliefs and desires in terms
of the mathematics of probability and
utility theory and that but then there's
the idea that if you're going to build
an intelligent agent either artificial
or natural that tries to it has its
overarching goal to maximize expect
utility in the real world for the kinds
of problems that confront us that is
incredibly difficult and then there's
this third idea that you want to be
smart and even rational about how you
approximate your rationality in the 20th
century saw some really interesting
thinking that went on outside the realm
of computability or computation and one
theory for what one does in
complex world where we as people or a
machine as an agent is uncertain about
what's going to happen what the world
looks like in considering actions
there's a model of ideal action to take
that came out of theoretical foundations
of what was called utility theory and
over the decades there was a bifurcation
early on in AI because it didn't seem
those formal models could be computed
very easily where did the probabilities
about different states of the world come
from what's the objective function how
do you compute these things in you know
with the scarce resources we had to
compute and so some of the interesting
motivating work that came out of the
1950s and 1960s and 70s looked at
bounded rational system systems that
couldn't possibly from the point of view
of the designers do the right thing
collect enough evidence or information
to be rational and there's kind of a
discarding of that whole view point is
that must be think about machinery that
helps a a person get through life with
your wrist Ock's what works well what
are some patterns of logic that might be
useful what kind of patterns might be
matched in a very very ad hoc way you
might say but what happened in the 80s
late 80s was the rise of interest in
science of bounded rationality and the
way Josh I look at this is what happens
when you put a computational lens on
scientific theories of rationality you
start saying well listen I need to come
up with certain kinds of approximations
I need to offline or in real time have a
layer that reflects about how to do
things but I can't do it all I needin
have to worry about how complex that is
in itself and then I need to sort of
learn and figure out where I put
resources of various kinds collecting
information looking data thinking more
is there evidence in human cognition
that that's how humans behave that they
have this fast model and this slow model
and they they actually decide when they
use either or I mean
you threw some combination of evolution
and early development you know in some
sense our brave like vision is something
we're heavily optimized for right and
the trade-offs of how you combine the
bottom of the fast bottom-up system and
the slower top-down model based system
in some sense evolution already like the
meta rationality there is done by
evolution but then there's things which
are more like what we think of as
thinking right like planning like
deciding okay you know how am I going to
get you know when i wake up from where i
was staying last night how am i going to
get her today am i going to drive down
the highway or am i going to take the
slow route does the human mind operate
in a way that at times will resort to
richer slower potentially more precise
or less familiar situations in a more
computationally intensive way yeah vs
sometimes flipping to a quick reflex and
recognition for example and I think
there's evidence and people have been
studying in psychology and have results
along these lines that there are some
fast twitch and slow deliberative
systems and it's unclear you know what
all the machinery is that guides you you
can see this in that in navigation
though right i mean like because you you
know when you're you sometimes you're
just sticking to the roots that you know
and other times you have to actually
have to stop and think and look at a map
and plan and think about it are going to
be more or less traffic I mean this
money that's one so that's one example
which is inciting in humans and other
animals and there are different brain
systems there are some systems which you
know what some parts of the brain which
really do a kind of planning many people
core AI researchers yeah researchers I'd
say I want to do artificial intelligence
and make that my career are
foundationally motivated by mysteries of
the human mind that they find within
themselves within people they work with
even their their pets they're you know
the vertebrate animals we what we have
in our homes are just incredible and if
you're if you study physics or biology
or chemistry it's often a huge gap to
explaining what was going on with the
mysteries of human mind it's clearly a
biological system but we have very
little understanding from the point of
view of the foundations that was true
for me early in my life where I went up
to neuroscience and biophysics into
neurosciences but quickly said you know
I'm going to computational because I
think that that's the best path to
figuring things out and
day yeah I thought could it be a it
might be a hundred years it might be a
thousand years I want to come back to
the mysteries of mind should I not
understand them yet through computation
and come look at human minds and other
other verbal creatures and match that
have naturally evolved it's unclear as
to when the reentry for the I researcher
would be to look at results from ecology
we that's the claim you both think now
yeah like now there's a two way and it's
not one way it's a it's a two-way street
yeah where the prospect for a unifying
vision and one that we propose as one
potential perspective is one of
computational rationality where we have
systems whether they be human or
biological i should say more generally
or machine are grappling under great
uncertainty they're trying to do the
best they can there is some
representation of belief or likelihood
in the world and the some notion of an
objective functions being cared about
overtime and all sorts of limitations in
resources the ability to think how much
time is left to before you need to make
a decision cost-benefit trade-offs in
timely action versus delayed action in
the world and we can maybe understand
both the pile out the biology and the
computation has a broader computational
framework will call it competition
rationality sort of finish up yeah 30
seconds future of AI each of you I've
you AI as kind of a the crest of the
crashing crest of the wave of computer
science so you look at at how much
computation has done for our society for
socio economics
in applications like health care the
broader biomedical sciences been
incredible AI we're doing more we're
doing we're doing more and more of the
things people consider only smart people
could do will change so many things with
that comes a lot of hope a lot of
possible benefits and also some concerns
with potential disruptions of a variety
of pines will this technology remove
different whole sectors of jobs in the
future will machines become so powerful
and smart that they can't be turned off
and they come to outwit man these are
important and interesting questions that
need to be solved along the way but I
expect largely positive beneficial
results coming out of this research
largely because we guided these
technologies in the hands of humans and
we've got the technology if we've
learned anything from the past history
of AI it's that trying to predict the
future history of AI is kind of losing
game right um it's hard to know where
you're going or how long it's going to
take or even when you'll know that
you've gotten there right but I think
look you know looking both at the past
and what we see going on right now
that's most exciting and next steps you
know again I'm sort of an optimist about
these things I I'm not going to make
predictions about what we're going to
get to when but this idea that AI is
both an engineering discipline and the
science or you might think of it as
providing a lot of the technical
foundations behind the science of how
the mind works right there sort of
artificial intelligence and there's
biological intelligence and I think
we've we've learned this a few times now
and I think what we know what I hope is
that we've learned it in a deeply
internalized way that will stay with us
through the future is that these fields
have a lot to say to each other and that
if we keep them in register right if we
keep if AI researchers keep looking at
biological intelligence for inspiration
about the problems to solve and the
kinds of solutions and if the people
studying biological intelligence keep
looking to AI and engineering for the
for the tools and the language in which
to form their theories and to think
about their experiments right then I
think that's going to be a really
productive synergy that can take us to
many interesting place this is awesome
thanks so much for spending some time
with us thanks for watching and we will
catch you next time take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
