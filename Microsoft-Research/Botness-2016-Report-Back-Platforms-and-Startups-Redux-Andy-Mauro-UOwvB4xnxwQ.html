it was basically the same session as
yesterday but we made it a little
further so I'm gonna there's a bunch of
new faces here so I'm going to recap
some of it fairly quickly hopefully
which is so we met with platform
companies and startups and the question
was you know to the platform companies
how are you helping the companies that
are trying to build value on top your
platform and then the question to the
startups was what do you guys actually
need so we had just to recap it twilio
Microsoft Twitter slack kick IBM and
then today Facebook which is cool and
basically on the how are companies
supporting startups and people building
value is sort of showing up to this
stuff working together providing great
tools open sourcing stuff that should be
open source having open road maps
providing sort of enterprise sales
support intro to companies and then
there was funding and then on the what
do we need it was sort of money the
platforms need more foundational
thinking they're pretty half hazard and
pulled together right now you know it's
the the thing that we kept talking about
was you know webhead HTML mobile had 20
year old objective c and java api is in
bots have send receive so how do we
actually build something on top of that
a lot of complaints about you know
everything is shifting under our feet
that's not going to change anytime soon
but it's sort of how do we manage it
better there was a lot of talk about
official partner programs and actually
having some structure and repeatability
and predictability put in their
discovery monetization keep coming up
and then where we ended today that was
different as we went through a bunch of
other startups who basically just
corroborated that same stuff that we had
heard yesterday but we actually got to a
really nice practical next step which
was creating a set of botanist channels
right so the consensus the broad
consensus was is that if you found this
way your way into this room then you're
probably in a leadership position in the
botton messaging space it's hard I mean
there's probably probably missing people
we in fact for sure are missing people
but we have to keep it to sort of a
tractable size right now so we decided
this we would create a set of channels
in botanist so we were these are the
ones that we agreed on one was features
so this is a place where you can go and
say I need features
is what I want here's what we're looking
for the request from the platform teens
was like please be specific give us use
cases tell us why if you've got
customers that's even better strategy
this is really like how do I need
business help write everything isn't
just features it's like how can you help
me from a business and strategy
perspective what do we need from you
guys and then roadmap so a place to
express roadmap be transparent about
roadmap talk about changes to roadmap
and then best practices best practices
is you know what do what should we be
doing what a platform companies think we
should be doing maybe get some help from
designers was talked about and then the
contentious one was emergency support so
there's no way the botanist channel is
going to turn into tech support for all
of us but there was a complaint of like
my bot is down it's broken I don't know
where to go can I get some help and so
we'll see how that pans out so you know
we had Sergio Brian Lily a mirror we'll
talk to the folks that were here
yesterday but aren't here today to join
or have somebody who represents them
join those channels will get those
created lily after you know whatever and
you guys join them and then it's we're
going to Lily suggested I think great
suggestion that we're going to take sort
of a pilot project what came up was
maybe the UI primitives for messaging
and just see if we can use that as a way
to begin a conversation across the
different platform companies with a
subset of us as a sort of startup
community and see if we can actually
make some progress so I think that was
you know again I think total applause
the platform companies for being open to
this because it's a nice practical step
towards helping us and collaborating in
a practical way sit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
