live in south africa hi I thought my
life was over the first time I came to
South Africa I was completely unprepared
I had no idea of the extent of the
epidemic it's really hard to put this
project down at night to leave the
office I know that just the time i'm
going to sleep thousands of individuals
will die from HIV people told us that if
you hiv-positive you you did i'm not
going to live this project is very
personal to me having gone down to South
Africa with Bruce to visit the
hospital's down there and just people's
homes people infected with HIV it's
absolutely horrible to see what it's
doing to their lives and that's really
what led us through our collaborators to
launch a more aggressive effort at
trying to bring solutions to the problem
so one of the biggest challenges in
building a vaccine for HIV is that HIV
mutates a lot you can't just take a
single individual and look at the HIV
that they have and maybe following over
time and figure out what's going on
so what Bruce and his team has been able
to do is to get data from many many
different individuals
so in South Africa women bear the brunt
of the HIV epidemic so much so that if
you look at pregnant woman walking into
the clinic that by age 21 in three
already have HIV infection I mean it's a
striking figure purity is an amazing
young woman and she started treatment
when she was really sick she's a very
positive mind and somebody very
enthusiastic about life has big goals
and ambitions and excitement about life
which when we man here it was at the
stage where she felt like my life has
just been shattered it's about the
breakdown in family structure it is a
legacy of apartheid it is a legacy of
colonialism that what you had was you
had the destruction of family life my
parent died and left us with noble here
in this house
I'm so painful for muscle we didn't have
food don't have nobody was reeking then
until my sister got a job she is an
orphan who made it possible for her
siblings to leave a manageable life so
that to me tells me that purity is a
woman of power woman of strength and I
really admire her courage they always
hope these always only and maybe you
today and you here with me I'm fine so
the collaboration with Bruce and the
South Africa team it's very fluid
there's so much data being generated I
realized that we had this algorithm that
could help him so he gave us the problem
one Friday night and by Monday morning
we had a solution for him and that's the
sort of thing that that David and others
have been able to bring to this problem
is to take massive computing power and
novel innovative algorithms and allow us
then with a vaccine to try and make the
virus something it can't be force it to
become what it doesn't want to be there
by crippling it and thereby hopefully
getting the upper hand if I meant
somebody with HIV oh I would tell him to
hold on dance tonight please hope
did they must drill that because that
just kidding me go dreams dreams and
dreams hopes yeah I firmly believe this
is a solvable problem and I and many
other people have devoted our careers to
this and we're going to continue working
on it until we succeed I love my job I
get to come to work every day and to
work on things that have high impact to
society HIV vaccine design and we're
making great progress it it will be true
a dream come true it should be dream
come true for me yeah they say anything
is possible
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
