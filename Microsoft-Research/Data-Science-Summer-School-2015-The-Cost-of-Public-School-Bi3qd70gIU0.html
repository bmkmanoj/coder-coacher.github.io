you
we're on to our second presentation
which is about the implicit costs of
public school in New York City and
Thomas is going to kick things off and
he's missing the clicker cuz somebody
stole it from you good afternoon
everyone my name is Thomas Pitino and I
go to Skidmore College and today we're
going to talk about the cause of public
school every child in America is
entitled to a free public education but
there are some hidden costs that each
parent kid that each parent has to pay
in order to send their kids to the best
schools today we're going to analyze
that so the New York City public school
system is one of the largest is the
largest school system in the entire
country enroll in over a million
students each year New York City is
known to have one of the best performing
schools in one of the worst performing
schools and entrance to these schools
are closely tied to where one lives so
as a parent you want to find out where
the best schools are in to enroll your
kids and we looked at the test scores of
the Regents exams the resistive stems
are taken from there 3 2 8th grade and
then taking in the subjects of English
and math so it we took this data found
in the from the Department of Education
and we find live devout they have the
mean scores for each grade at each
particular school so we took this data
and we parted it to see the distribution
among all of them other schools in the
newest in the new york state not just
New York City so we separated by the
each one each school by the Bureau and
each band represents how the number of
schools that they are that we converted
the mean score so percentiles to better
understand better compared and
contrasted different schools Sarah being
one of the worst performing schools and
100 being one of the best performing
schools and as you can see here there's
a huge disparity in the Bronx we found
that there's a large school number of
schools that are worst performing and
we'll see in my hand a huge this very a
huge gap we have 40 of the worst schools
in the entire state and 50 of the best
schools and they say but little in
between
so we wanted to figure out where this
with the schools where so we took this
ship files from the New York City open
data and each a line represents a school
zone boundary and we took this shape
file and we joined up with us with our
region exam data and we got this graph
so as you can see the red is that the
schools are in the bottom car tile and
the bloom is that the schools in the top
quartile and as you can see there are
some schools that are that are really
worst performing next to schools that
are really the best performing schools
and we can see this in midtown midtown
is very expensive to live in but yet
your school some boundary determines
whether you go to our worst performance
who are top performing schools so if we
zoom into that we can see PS 111 PS 59
fields 111 it's ranked worse than sixty
percent of all schools in the state and
in perform around it rains around 1300
of 2300 schools in the entire state of
New York meanwhile if you take a
10-minute walk just ten minutes you run
into PS 59 pier 39 was the best quality
nine percent of all schools in the state
ranking 19 of all elementary schools and
these are just next to each other and
you can see how parents can worry that
the school some boundaries can leave
their kids in a Wars performing school
or in a good performance school so and
you can see this year in the we redraw
they redid the boundaries of the park
slope area because PS 321 is a really
good performing schools william penn and
it was having issues with overcrowding
so they redrew the boundaries and some
kids went from being in one of the best
schools in the country to a less than
average school and a new school that
they didn't order to perform this not
only affects your kid but he could also
affect your home value so to talk about
this effect that it hasn't at home
rather my colleague and a session when i
talked about that
good afternoon everybody my name is
Anastasia and I go to Queens College so
let's continue the presentation the main
question we ask ourselves during our
research how much more expensive our
homes in high performing schools
estimates estamos mentioned earlier new
york city elementary schools are largely
retired with school zones metaphor we
look at home prices across various
school zones we found that there are
many factors tied to home location for
instance like quality of neighborhood
subways amenities and accessibilities
that made it was really difficult to
isolate isolate the school fair but we
use it the sharp changes in a school
quality for instance we computed the
average of math and english test scores
we look at achievement rating of
students environment rating of schools
to control these factors small small
geographical regions our little
experiment of course would be to sell
two identical apartments in two
different school zones so but we're just
right next to each other over the border
here and then basically measures a price
difference but as you know we cannot do
this in their life so what we could do
basically we just took the data we
observe and compare a historical sales
of similar apartments and then we could
control different factors such as
neighborhood school performance or
demographics our data comes from street
easy but it is one of the biggest New
York City real estate website and
basically we issued search by school you
can if we specify the school we can get
about 200 sales but as you know New York
City has 800 elementary schools so we
would have to perform 800 equal search
search requests but of course we are
scientists so we are too lazy we
wouldn't do that what we do
we build a Python web scraper but it is
really dirty Jap philosophy go ahead
after we collected our data we found
several big issues first of all some
square footage was missing and we have
negative amount of bedrooms and baths
friends yes but easy well but our main
issue was actually well but apartment
address was incorrectly mean much to
school zone so we had to create
basically we have to build another
python script to geocode addresses using
new york city to a client api's as you
can see here it's basically the thing is
the address so this is the output in a
JSON format basically we have all the
certain information regarding these
others but we were interested only in
latitude in latitude because we wanted
basically to map each apartment to its
corresponded school shapefile but cheap
while we got from New York City open
data for instance here you can see we
found latitude and longitude 411 Street
in Brooklyn and using this latitude and
longitude we basically complete we match
to the corresponding school zone and
also we computed the priceless purport
we divided total price by square foot
and please let us to compare a different
size of apartments in totally collected
40,000 distilled sales but only ten
thousands of them had complete details
and so much they could map to the
corresponding school zones as you can
see in this map it represents apartment
distribution by price and each dot
represents individual sale red color
represents the lowest price per square
foot and blue color represents the
highest price per foot we found that
there is a huge disparity among five in
price just were put in five Boris so for
instance you can see
woodlawn Bronx Brazil lowest-performing
schools the price to square food is
around 110 dollar cuz their fault while
in my head on in around Central Park
South the price is really high around
3400 so our next step it was actual to
compare apartment prices versus school
performance in this graph x axis
represents average price per square foot
and x-axis represents school performance
ever compared to each other school in
new york state 0 represents the lowest
performance and 100 the highest
performance and each dot represents
individual school viscera this red line
is a smooth average basically says as
price increases as price per square foot
increases school quality increases too
so basically and this great shadow
repeat is a confidence interval that
suggests very some uncertainty in our
prediction and as it grows wider it just
says varies more uncertainty in your
prediction let's look at bronze as you
can see prices don't grow really much
and bronze has the lowest performance in
the whole new york state but if you look
in my head and we can see what very is a
certain trend as the school quality
increases the price per square foot
increases tool but still we cannot say
confidently vet rice just where food
increases only because of low quality or
maybe there is some different factors
that affect it such as a neighborhood
quality or maybe location so our next
question was how do we actually
distinguish between the effect of
neighborhoods and schools and to answer
these questions my colleague Riley will
talk more about our model
alrighty so how can we actually get the
premium price associated just with this
school we know with infinite amounts of
sales data we could just average the
price in the each school zone and then
compare that to the neighboring school
zones to just grab this price associated
with school but with a limited amount of
data we need a model to estimate the
average sale price per square foot
accounting for the apartment the
neighborhood and various school features
and with those estimates we can compare
the price per square foot in one school
zone to those around it and so we define
this premium that we wanted to get in
theory as the average price in one's own
versus the average price in neighboring
zones and so we we built a model and
we're going to use this model to grab a
estimated a set of prices per square
foot in various school zones so what
we'd like to do is gather all possible
information about a neighborhood and
control for certain features so that we
can just isolate that portion associated
with the school we can't so we we used
regularization to try to select
important features and avoid unreliable
estimates of prices in that area so we
have a linear model to predict the sale
price per square foot which takes which
again spits out that and is reliant on
the number of bedrooms in the apartment
the number of
bathrooms the demographics in the local
school the test scores in the local
school the actual neighborhood the
school ID which is the school itself and
this interaction here of the number of
bedrooms and the school zone so why why
take an interaction you can imagine that
for say a studio somebody who's buying a
studio of doesn't really have a family
they're not thinking about you know what
the school in the area is so they're
there in that area they're going to be
less reliant on a they're not they're
not looking at the school where when
they're considering a move but for maybe
a two bedroom or a three bedroom
apartment you know you can expect those
people are more likely to have a family
to take up the extra space and thus they
will be more reliant on the school so
this particular interaction is trying to
capture the differences over the number
of bedrooms okay how well did our model
do um so if you look at the plot we have
here so this is the actual mean price by
school zone each one of these dots
represents a school zone so this is the
actual mean price calculated based on
the data versus our models prediction
price for that school zone like I said
as far as an average we've we've
separated them out by color for each
borough and as you can see manhattan
kind of rises to the top and the Bronx
you know settles there at the bottom and
if you would to pick an individual
school say around 1000 and we predicted
that school perfectly it should lie
exactly on this line so the fact that
all of our points here are kind of
gathered around the line is really
telling us that our prediction to do it
pretty well so for an individual sale we
had an immediate absolute deviation for
overall boroughs of a hundred and three
dollars per square foot so essentially
we just took our
our real number and subtracted from the
prediction and pick the middle one as a
good idea of how how well we were doing
on individual sales and as you can see
for each individual borough we're doing
a little bit better a little bit worse
for Brooklyn we were off by about 95
queen 60 70 and 71 Manhattan 138 and the
Bronx 48 so these numbers are nice but
you know you're looking at a lot of
tables it's kind of hard to see and then
the the numbers for the ID the school
are kind of obscure so um we wanted to
kind of plot autumn you know to see what
this looks like on a map to kind of make
sense of it and anybody who lives in New
York City kind of can look at this map
and understand you know the logic that
goes into this so as you can see up here
we're taking the predicted price for
only two bedrooms two bathrooms in each
school zone so as we we saw here where
we have in the Bronx you know um in the
Bronx here very north it's very cheap so
that's you know up to 500 per square
foot down here in South Brooklyn it's
also very cheap and as you kind of creep
in toward manhattan we're getting more
expensive so you can see we have like
little areas here very close to
manhattan that are getting more
expensive and of course midtown
Manhattan upper west and east sides are
really ridiculously priced yeah so up to
you know and over 1500 a square foot so
to try to to get a good estimate of the
ideal model that Anastasia mentioned
which kind of takes us like to 2
locations just over a boundary similar
neighborhoods very close together we
kind of zoomed in on Park Slope so just
to remind her that the premium for the
school in an area
the average price per square foot in
that zone minus the average price per
square foot in the neighboring zones so
we have to school zones in park slope
here the bottom one is PS 321 the top
one is PS 282 PS 321 is pretty much like
the school to be at in park slope and PS
282 is not as not not as good as 321 um
but right just north of here is the
major Atlantic Avenue hub um in Brooklyn
so essentially like that downtown
Brooklyn area right there but as we can
see despite the neighborhood being more
ideal because it's so much closer to
that that hub this is the the larger
price here you're paying a thousand
twenty nine dollars per square foot in
the 321 area and only 945 in the 282
area despite its you know its proximity
to the subway so for you know this may
be half mile distance extra it seems
right here that the difference in school
is is showing up pretty clearly so we
kind of zoomed out and took this for
each school zone based on the
neighboring school zones going through
all of New York City and we can kind of
see this this area right here that that
Thomas mentioned where the midtown west
area had a very poor performing school
but the area near the areas nearby had
much better performing school so you can
see that despite all of the prices here
being extremely expensive you actually
are paying less to be in this worst
school zone and well all of this is
really nice but it's kind of flat static
and so um I would really like maybe
interacting version of this and I will
leave it to glenda to take that away
from
hi hi guys I'm Glenda sensor asked you
so many areas in each borough has a
disproportionate prices compared to the
area around them recall the midtown west
apartment at a still expensive there but
there is a negative premium compared to
the surrounding areas in the beginning
this wasn't obvious by just looking at
the data tables but what he there was a
way to to see of the school zones and
fine an inherent see where in what is
persons we have a positive or negative
premium that would be cool to do so this
is why our group decided to create a nap
the that maps out all the school zones
in New York City and Colour coast and by
price
one might be wondering what motivates us
what motivated us to make this up and
the answer is really simple we wanted to
allow all the new year citizens to be
able to explore the average prices the
medium prices and the premium prices in
each school zone and at the same time we
also wanted to to make to make it
clearer and more we also wanted to
analyze the data because we saw in the
street ec there and they're like
Anastasia said that there were a lot of
repeated data and with this app we're
able to when we hover and click on a we
were able to see like where you saw a
lot of school districts or schools sons
together over there so you you saw a
mistake you saw that I was a mistake and
the app is really easy to use
yeah so you see we have the main panel
over here and we also have the features
that we can choose here when you go when
you are in this step in the average
price top you can just all right you can
just zoom in in the map and see what is
the average price in this school stone
in PS 234 and then let's see if you want
to go to this area you can also see how
much what is the average price which is
which is this one you can see that is
higher PS 30-34 is higher it has to have
a higher average price than the other
one which is ps3 and this is not the
only group and a cool thing around this
app but let's say that he been walking
on the street and then I found an
address let's see that is 4012 Fifth
Avenue Oh 641 six a linear I want to buy
the house and this apartment or this
area and I want to see what is the
average the average from price that i
have to pay and it takes a little bit
all right there so let's say that I
wanted by I'm a millionaire so I have I
want three bedrooms and I want want a
one bedroom so you can see here i can
just zoom in you can just zoom in in
here and click on it and you can see i
have to pay 1746 dollars and the same
thing you can do with the median price
some people think that the median price
is better than the average price because
yeah they just seem that is better so
that same thing you can see how much do
I have to pee on them and the medium
isn't 1700 and I Riley said do you want
to know what is the average price I mean
what is the premium in the area like
this is about
but that static map that Riley was
talking about so you can also do the
same you can just zoom in and you can
see how much is the premium which is
minus sixty seven dollars and if you if
you like to play around you can just
click on the areas and you're going to
see for all of them how much you have to
pay so in conclusion we find extreme
inequality in New York City in new york
city schools often over a small
geographic regions using this variation
we find substantial premiums for
neighboring school zones at different
quality and that you have to pay one
hundred dollars per square feet
yeah alright so in the future we would
like to include rental prices and our
model features limiting comparison to
some boundaries extending Donna and also
to send these analysis two additional
citizen if you're really interested to
see how we program how we did that
statistical analysis how we made the
game and everything you can just go to
github this and you click on public
school and you're going to see there if
you want to explore you know that that
map because you're looking for a house
to buy you can just go to this link it
is a ready holster there and hopefully
you can take it can be beneficial for
you and thank you so much for coming to
listen to our present
all right questions Andrews ready shoot
our Queens resident will answer as I
said before we had a lot of data issues
that easy didn't had a lot of required
data like square food or data was
repeated and also some because we did
our search by school zones so some did
some some areas of your own zone
basically this district doesn't have any
school zone so that's why a lot of of
our data is missing also about that one
of the issues that I brought up very
early on was about StreetEasy in
particular you know streeteasy is
looking to kind of make money so they
are focused on areas that are very dense
like park slope and manhattan which are
big big sales so queens not so much so
in some of the really expensive areas i
would assume that the parents send their
kids to private school did did you see
any correlation like any maybe even
negative premium because in some areas
they were so expensive that people
didn't care anymore about the quality
great so the quick yeah so the question
is in the private school areas I'll just
repeat so then your education department
is actually not required to live in
somewhere the data of the private
schools is very difficult to compare the
two and also they set up their own
standards in the New York City public
school they are too advised by Common
Core Sanders and the the particles due
to some extent but it they're not easily
comparable so we had to exclude those
one thing is that the 282 zone is
actually twenty percent of local
residents in their fifteen percent so
that zone that we showed is actually
heavily pride
another question Sheldon Adam so he
started off the talks mentioning the
park slope we donate do you have more
examples with that because it seems like
an opportunity to look at change and so
the question was about the rezoning and
how we might be able to use that anybody
have thoughts about that yeah so um so
there's what happened this rezoning the
cabin 2008 and they created a new school
and for those useful we have very little
historical data so and that in when if
we want to take a look at all with this
ring we would come up with the same
issue that these schools are new they
don't have a historical and so we don't
know how they perform in this hot it's
hard to compare them against other
schools David have you mentioned looking
at renters in action before you do
what's your intuition to the premium
that renters would pay relatives the
price of a peg prepare to home buyers so
the question is do we think we see the
same effect for renters versus buyers I
do think that we would see so the same
effects I think that they might
potentially be muted since you kind of
associate families with trying to buy
versus rent because of the associated
extra costs with renting so there might
be maybe a slight dampening but I think
in general will get similar results
especially because you just have to get
into kindergarten and then you're in the
school you can just rent in a zone and
you know get in and then say so it seems
like okay for people on the recording
amy has a good trick rental integrated
public school question in the back any
statistical outliers in any of the
schools because a super principal or
teaching staff or so the question is
could we attribute any of the
outstanding performance in the school to
a specific attribute of the school yeah
we actually heard ratio student /
teacher but we didn't include it in our
model because we didn't see because our
model basically didn't improve much but
we had average of English and math test
score and we also the plane wave
environment rating that is basically how
school well perform and achievement
rating how well students perform so this
was had some effect on our model but
still they are treated oh quit at the
end there was surprisingly sparse or
just bad ugly data for teachers or staff
in general like one of the things we
really wanted to look at was the staff
and we just could not find very much
that was reliable so that was another
yeah privacy laws so you know we had to
kind of mute that effect by just getting
some you know test scores maybe we'll
take one last question my question is
young scholars and college students when
you
to those disparities in high schools
what was your response to it how do you
feel about that so the question is what
do you think about the results you found
especially being students of the local
schools uh but lucky i think was one of
the first ones i mean these are
elementary schools I think that I went
to fairly good elementary school but it
was nowhere near where I lived I hadn't
I've never gone to a zone school before
and so I really can't imagine what you
know what it would be like to be a
student in one of those schools was just
like yeah you have to just go there um
well you know and but I wasn't surprised
I i expected it like pretty much what we
saw and sad and oh and also um what's
most important of all of this and this
is something that is cannot be
quantified but it's also that I board
with like a people can really change the
course of the students that the people
who are in the school board can decide
oh ok we're going to chunk up the school
divided and this affects people's lives
and not a lot of people have control
over that and that's something that we
found that it's troubling but in that
people should be more aware about in
addition like doing this research really
changed my life because I'm like now if
I ever have a Shia I'm gonna be sending
them in the best schools yeah so yeah
and I also hope that you can also send
them to a good school so they can have a
better education down older Riley has
one more quick thing one of the things
that we actually found kind of
interesting is that even though there's
not necessarily too much difference in
the school like one is maybe a little
bit better there were some zones where
the price actually kind of went a good
amount down so there might be some ways
to you know still get in a good school
zone but not pay the extra good school
zone price
so the students will be around there's
two posters out that have their results
summarized you should attack them all
and ask them all the questions you
didn't get to ask and enjoy some food
and refreshments thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
