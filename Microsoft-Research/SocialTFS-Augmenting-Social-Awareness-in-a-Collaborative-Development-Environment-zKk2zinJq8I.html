you
so welcome everyone it's my pleasure to
introduce Filippo la novela from
university of bari in italy and he's
actually one of the software engineering
innovation foundation of Audrina's from
last year and his project is about
social TFS to make Kiev asthma social
and today he will tell us about his
progress thank you darling ok so tom has
already introduced me and I can start
thank you from the second slide because
I tommy was saying is here is written
I'm from University of body so your
question might be what is bad nothing
Mary I many people in the US the noid so
buddy he's here the we are in South
Italy on the Adriatic Sea on the heel of
Italy it's a nice place and I can tell
you that do you might have a chance to
visit buddy if you attend the
international conference on global
software engineering on 2013 that will
be organized in valley ok the
presentation of today I will start
looking at the relationship between
software engineering and collaborative
supported cooperative work then I will
talk about the impact of distance in
collaboration I will introduce and
looking to the concept of group
awareness and that is something that was
proposed in cscw and this much interest
for software engineers I will provide
this a little survey of collaborative
development environments and compare
them with respect to house of the
support the group awareness and
especially the social awareness that is
the kind of awareness I'm going to talk
about
and then I would propose the I will
present our what was our proposal that
augmenting social awareness in a
collaborative development environments
specifically the team foundation server
then I will conclude and they may be
probably timing even for a demo okay I
start saying it's looking at software
development is an intense collaborative
process we actually had the year during
this week the workshop on the future of
collaborative software development and
probably the first one was talking about
software engineering as a collaborative
an intense collaborative process was
frederick brooks in the mythical man
month almost 40 years ago he was saying
that software development is an exercise
in complex interrelationships we have a
different types of collaboration within
a team we have communication which is an
exchange of information between members
of a team they we have a coordination
which is the orchestration of task so
that there are no holes and no
repetition and older task our goat to
achieve the same goal and we have
control with the process to other two
policies guidelines and can be done
formerly with standards formal meetings
or also informally as prepare pressure
and
computer supported cooperative work and
we have the conference here this week
that finished just yesterday emerged
from newman computer interaction to
address the problems of collaboration in
work groups because they were the
communication breakdowns there were
problems in coordination they were was
the lack of knowledge about activity of
colleagues and this is something that
actually actually it's the same problems
that the faces software developers in
large-scale teams and the and is
especially true for global this a good
lead project where the distance makes
collaboration more difficult this
explain having the same problems explain
why there are many researchers that work
at the intersection of consciously
Dublin software engineering of from this
cscw point of view software engineering
right becomes a domain-specific domain
of work so we have the speed you have
this conference there was one session
about software engineering at least for
for each time slot and and also we found
in the software engineering conferences
we found people that look at problems of
that from exia CW point of view about to
explain to introduce the problem of a
distance when people collaborate within
a team i usually use this this deal bad
strip where we have a program managers
with explaining to is software
engineering that they are outsourcing
there are half of the their programming
work to a bonilla an imaginary country
in the world so they can take advantage
of time difference
they even cuts in the costs and the
managers explain how it will be easy to
do this we will end off our requirements
at the end of our work day and get back
the finish coat coat the the next
morning and then we have a couple of
elbow nians somewhere in the world they
are one is saying reading the emails
from the manager once again have no idea
what they want and the other said let's
pretend we dive and so it's because this
book is the worst thing that can happen
when you collaborate on a global
software projects there are different
dimensions of distance we have do we can
consider geographical distance that is
usually what we think about when we talk
about distance people that are dispersed
in different sides and actually it can
be measured as the coast or effort to
move across site to have physical
meetings sometime it can be very costly
and unconnected we have temporal
distance that is a measure of a temporal
dispersion that is the effect of working
at different time zones actually can
also be the effect of living in
different places with different work
patterns for example in Italy and South
Italy we do lunch break at one or two
p.m. and North Italy people do make a
large bracket at noon so the the
intersection to organize meetings it
becomes reduced even if you work on the
same time zone then we have also the
social cultural distance which is a
measure of how difficult is to
understand the behavior of others and
what they are saying
and actually eating also includes the
linguistic differences that some time
can be a big problem I was making the
classification because there was a paper
appeared on computer communication of
the ACM that was classifying the
problems of working at a distance
considering the three dimension of
collaboration communication coordination
in control and the three dimensions of
of distance geographical temperance
social cultural actually in the original
paper the table was more rich this is a
simplified version and what I mean
tested here to highlight that bottom we
are addressing here are the problems
that we record didn't in coordination
when there is people work distance on a
geographical basis and the main problems
are the lack of awareness and reduce the
trust that what we are I will now talk
about since i'm talking about awareness
let's see what is awareness january
group awareness this is a a fundamental
concept that was defined by duration
Bilotti 20 years ago actually it was
celebrated this paper as a seminal paper
on this conference and this and they
define the group awareness as the
understanding the activities of others
which provide a context for your own
activity it is important because they
may make the individual contribution
relevant to the group and this relevant
the awareness information whatever the
task domain you
it is and basically awareness works with
two kind of actions the monitoring and
the displaying action on everybody
monitor what the others are doing if if
it's relevant for what you are doing and
in the same time they let their action
to be displayed so that the others can
be can monitor you and Samir later
called Goodwin and others define the
classification of awareness for
dimensions they said that the group
awareness could be the informed that is
the information that provide awareness
can be classified as informal awareness
that is the information about who is
around who is available that's very
common now with instant messaging
because it's the basic feature that is
the messaging introduced after the IRC
chat and then we have the group
structural awareness that is information
about who does what in a group which are
the task with child the roles then we
have the workspace awareness that is
information about who is creating and
changing the artifacts with which are
shared in the group and at the end we
have the social awareness that what we
are interested in this presentation that
is due in social awareness is the
information that we maintain about we
know about others while we are talking
with them or in a social or
conversational context if I'm talking
with something completely new to me my
social awareness is zero I don't know
nothing if I'm talking with Tom I know
the tongue
what tom is interested too why were his
friends and this can be useful at at
least makes can make the conversation
better and also the in more general the
collaboration what I will now present is
a short service of collaborative
development environments and how they
support group awareness and they will
see specifically social awareness here I
included some of these collaborative
development environments including both
the forks Fergus and tools that you can
install the name collaborative
development environments actually comes
from a paper from Grady Booch and brown
in almost 10 years ago that he was
talking about that the IDE should be
extended it was asking to extend the IDE
with collaborative features so that
program has should not switch back and
forth between different applications to
accomplish their work and then the first
collaborative development environments
were were proposed for open-source
software projects but then there have
been so many others they sometimes they
are called application lifecycle
management platforms the names can
change basically what they are project
workspace with this with a toolset that
usually include the tracker version
control the community some way to make
right documentation dashboards mechanism
for event notification and this can
usually it can work also as an
enrichment of the IDE
I can present just some of them trackers
became popular some a year ago
especially because was the first one
from what i know that introduces the
wiki tu tu tu mein to maintain to create
a maintain documentation and this was
something consider new at the time and
was also one of the first one to
introduce also the RSS feeds off for
event notification and google called is
popular but it's nothing special i mean
very basic as features for it's a very
simple to use but nothing that the
probably is the simplicity that makes
his success and we have called blacks
from microsoft when code blacks and
don't know if there's been the first one
that what I in I noted is something new
as web-based the collaborative
developments was the ability to follow
projects that is kind of awareness that
you can have so that you can have if you
assume it's a way to of it's an
alternative way to RSS feeds for an
event notification that you have the
events of the projects that you are
follow following in a common activity
stream which is part of your home of
your of your home page in the in the
complex we have also assembler I'm put
here are highlighted in bold some
features that are bored with from social
software that have been introduced in
this environment for example here you
can with assembler you can follow not
just projects but you
follow specific software artifacts first
Americans follow a work item so that can
be more present specific and then you
have a Activity Stream another thing new
that other than RSS feeds for event
notification you can also have a Riven
notification on Twitter using a plug-in
here is the IBM rational team concert
which has been upon a platformer called
the jazz at actually just was initially
proposed as to extend the Eclipse so the
IDE with the presence awareness a
synchronous communication then it became
much more became a comic and an
environment full environment but the at
the beginning this was was just it is
specifically for presents awareness and
something also borrow with from social
software there's been introducing in
rational team concert it is the ability
to tag work items to add three keywords
as a way of classification like you can
do in delicious for example and actually
there has been working a software
engineering by margaret story and chris
through droid and not sure to pronounce
well maybe not and where they have
followed how developers in IBM were
using tags and they were using tags in
mobile in work items not just for as a
classification way but they were using
as a form of indirect communication to
to see what was important about the work
item and or not if you have your team
foundation server it's and i will say it
doesn't add anything to what we have
seen before at least from what i know
well there is the sharepoint based
dashboards but we have features that
there is a I've never used a I know that
there is a plug-in for our presence
awareness and synchronous communication
and then you can use em msn or skype and
never tried it and finally we have a
github that is I will say it is a it was
developed as the fergie for project
using get as a decentralized the version
control system and but what is really
knew about github is how many different
ways you can use the follow features and
you can really develop as a social
networks or a social network of
programmers because you can ok follow
projects but you can also follows
specific the developers follow a
developer's it was something news it
means that I can see what developers
working on different projects do all
their events in my timeline and I can
also see what are the connection of
other developers which developers are
following other developers and this
something is also has been studied for
the first time the first report about
the usage of these features have been
reported on this conference just this
conference was there was a presentation
both at the workshop on collaborative
soft
development was organized by Andrew
bigger and there was also a paper on
cscw conference the buy from Carnegie
Mellon labra Dylan gym as blood and
somebody else that were they in they
perform the empirical investigation of
how developers use these follow features
within github it's made they perform 25
interviews and they and they provide at
the end lessons learned and guidelines
that that can be could be useful for
other environments that want to borrow
this kind of features that from what I
know was the first study about the these
features a specific on github
summarizing I I'm here I'm including the
collaborative development environments
that I presented and looking at how the
different kind of awareness are
supported and we can see that group
structural awareness and workspace
awareness are are supported in different
degrees but they are usually you
understand that these environments have
been developed for this for the group
structure and workspace awareness as
regards informal awareness or presence
awareness we have rational team concert
and the team foundation server let's
support it but as regards social
awareness we have just the get up that
partially support social awareness may I
remind you again that social awareness
is the information we know about other
people what what they do what how and
what who they know
and this I say partially because it's
partially done using the feature follow
developers activities in get up so the
question now that my this might be my t
something that is missing or actually
also might be maybe social awareness
it's not worth to be supported dead my
and so what I'm trying to do now is
introduce some empirical studies on the
these past years that support our our
hypothesis that social awareness can be
can benefit the developers work so the
first empirical study was presented at
Chi on last year by Costa Marcello
cataldo clayton de sousa this was a an
empirical study conducted over three
different companies big companies and
five large projects and what studying
the repositories doing interviews and
what they conclude that the twenty-five
percent of coordination of new chord
initial requirements so people which are
asked to coordinate with somebody else
because they are working at common as
work items involve project members that
don't often work together that don't
know each other or they have worked with
more than six months ago so they
conclude in this paper that supporting
the sharing of personal and contextual
information
will increase their the likelihood of
successful information because working
with unknown people it's common another
empirical study here it's a control
experiment to support the idea that
social awareness is needed that it's an
experimental study performed ten years
ago we're in a laboratory setting and
people were asked to collaborate at a
distance and hear and performing some
task the task were not specific of
software development and what was
observed that people being at a distance
they was affecting negatively the
willing least willingness to initially
cooperate was a kind of play to do was
negatively affecting the ability to put
persuade the other partner and there was
also a tendency to for deception of the
pattern and people pretending to be
better as of what they actually are but
this this effect was decreasing because
has interactions were repeating
after a while people were interacting
this this this negative effect could be
continued to stay or call decrease
depending on whether the people were
said they were living closer or not
actually this was an artificial setting
so people were in the same place but
they were said some Sun was a group
which was said they were living in two
completely two different cities very far
another group was said they were living
in the same city people living in the
same city but they were not working in
the same place had a feeling of being
close and this had a trust-building
effect just feeling to be close not
really be closed the third empirical
study the tango we are presenting is a
it was performed in a global company
probably IBM is not said but problem was
it was IBM because they there was a a an
expert research tool was introduced in
this global company and this will be as
this expertise search tool produced a
list of experts that could be contacted
and from this list of expert people had
to choose which one to contact and when
studying the reasons because people
developers were were choosing somebody
in this expert list they were choosing
on the basis of two reasons one was the
participation of the expert to be
contacted
in in forums or blogs because they had
the feeling that we were more likely to
respond how much they were actively
participating in social software and
also another reason this is is easier to
guess is how they were close socially
because they directly know them or
indirectly knowing it is because can
avoid the cold calls that are filled you
can feel embarrassed to contact somebody
that you haven't never met or you don't
know somebody that you can say you know
I know Tom Tom told me that I could ask
you something finally this last one last
study that support the thesis that
social awareness can be needed this
study is about how professional software
engineering were using an internal
social network that was introduced in
IBM and when interview it people were
saying that they were used the internal
social networks to build stronger bonds
with the weak ties or to reach
colleagues that they didn't know and so
the connection were were being created
for the to support that twenty five
percent of coordination requirements
that we I presented before and also
there were different motivation to
establish new connection this social
network not just gathering support for
project activities but also the desire
to connect professionally or even
to connect personally by sharing
pictures or our personal events so this
is our studies that I've reported that
provide motivation to to say that
augmenting a collaborative development
environment with social awareness
information can be worth and
specifically the our goal is to
facilitate the establishment of personal
connections by discovering a personal
interest of developers hey all their
competencies collecting from social
media this information here I should
show the hypothesis in a visual way our
importa si is that collecting
information from social networks can
work as a surrogate of the informal
communication that you exchange in a
cafeteria or in a pub restaurant in the
same way has a remote conferencing is
used to replace the physical meeting
room for formal meetings so I will say
that this is this is the lack of
informal communication and where the
informal communication also provides
information that is the tends to build
trust is what we what we want to fix so
this is social TFS social TFS is the
this the tool that we have developed
from with using the award from the
software engineering innovation a word
and it is an aggregator of
developers content collected from social
media and put in the developers
workspace specifically the developers
workspace is a team foundation server
and the ID in the visual studio we have
developed it as an extension of visual
studio for the for GUI and we have built
a social proxy which is which is the
aggregator we collect all the services
from the social networks microblogs and
also collects information from the
server side of a visual studio the team
foundation server I will present now
some screenshot to show how it appears
for example here this is visual studio
and social TFS appears as a view within
social studio here the story that is the
user stories as a developer I want to
share my past with other developers what
I do as a developer is to is choosing
which services I want to open for
example this is my profile I have open
information about codeplex Facebook
LinkedIn Twitter but and there are other
that are I'm not open like a hammer or
statusnet these are professional micro
blogs and you can see here okay there is
a number of posture that I I've provided
the number of people that I'm following
and and four and a number of people that
are I'm following in there and I'm
follow it by and actually this
information is a managed by on the
server side by the social proxy which
has a
purposes one is to store the users
credentials on be alpha the user but
without knowing the password because
fortunately now there are authorization
protocols like Oh out that we use and
and also other than storing users
credentials also post are cached this is
useful to avoid to provide the good
performance so that and and think it
worked well here we can see now the
current users not our active number of
pasta they are summarized because this
is the server side this is the in admin
panel is this is not for the developers
as regards privacy concerns user is full
control on not only on which services he
wants to open but also on which
information want to show for example
here if I if I click on one of the one
of the other service I think this case
it was Facebook I can choose which
information I want to provide for
example if I want to open facebook but
just to provide information about my
friends but not to provide information
about my post because I can think they
are too personal I can do that so this
is what appear when I mean I'm in the
visual studio interface and these are
the post the poster here appear in the
view and you can see these are the
people and following they are part of
and this is an aggregator so I can see
from where the poster coming from so now
the question is who to follow what are
the people i'm following and we have to
option one is a classic option i follow
people that i decide to follow this up
to me make the decision like it's
usually done in on a social network and
this so this is at the home timeline
that we provide because we have
different timelines in social TFS home
timeline is the people that I have
decided to follow can be suggested but
basically is something that I say yes I
want to follow this at its static second
option is dynamic kind of follow and
it's it takes the inspiration by a paper
which have appeared just last year and
by the clouds on the salsa and David
read miles is named the awareness
network to whom shall they display my
action and whose action shall day
monitor that address the problem of the
awareness network that is the people I
should be I should I shoulder follow I
should come be concerned of and
I was looking for sorry just thank you
sorry for the interruption so they were
arguing in this paper that the awareness
network is not something in the software
project is not something that is is the
same from the beginning to the end but
it changes continuously because they say
it depends on what are your assignments
and so which work items if we talk about
work item which work items have been
assigned to you and you might be you
might will be concerned about people who
have some something in common with work
items you have been assigned or that you
have commented some in some way and hear
what we call the iteration timeline I
will come back this is something very
dynamic because changes for every
iteration and another way to change the
ID the awareness network is to have
something an awareness network that
changed depending on what you are
watching on the on visual studio if you
are watching a source code file or a
work item and the awareness network
might change because the your interest
is changing I will present you this
timeline the first one who is the static
kind of timeline what we called home
home timeline where the following
depends depends on whom I decided to
follow here are the people in my
awareness network and they actually are
the people that have been registered to
have been registered and I can I can
distinguish between the people i'm
following the people that are follow
that i follow the people that are
following me and the people that are
suggested we see there is a little
recommender system that provides
suggestion i'm currently following just
fabio Calif Otto here and so in home
time line i will i will read just his
posts i was saying that we have a
recommender system for this very simple
actually because suggestions are from
people who are in taken from people if
you are in the same projects or you are
in the same TFS collection all the
people that are following you in one of
the social networks that have been
subscribed or if you are a follower of
those persons so the suggestions are are
modeled and are ranked based on the
number of links to those people for
example here we have here four nodes
which are the users and this is me and
I'm on the same project of with Fabio
I'm end with Nicola and I'm following
I'm I'm following Fabio and yo sepa on
Twitter and and I'm for know Fabian
supper I'm following me on
Twitter and I'm following Fabio on
Twitter and this is a weighted
multigraph you compute the number of
weights of the links that go to the same
node and then you get the rank at the
suggestion list the weights can be
changed by the administrator on the
server side so that can be because here
we have considered that being on the
same project in the code blacks or TFS
can beam his can be more important than
being a follower in some social network
but this can change and this is the
iteration timeline that were following I
was saying the pens and work items in
which a developer is involved in the
current iteration that means that we
took the active and fix at work items
and and look for each work item which
people have been involved as has been
assigned or ever commented or in those
work items or and this is the other way
of having a dynamic awareness network
which is the interactive timeline that
is depending of which tab is open in the
main editor space I will have a
different different people as in the
timeline depending on who have changed
the source code file or who has changed
the or commented the work item and if I
switch between the different tabs this
changes and it is quick because the the
post our cash
I don't need to to go far okay these to
press for presenting the features all
the project is on his part of the
complex so it's open source you can see
both the cold and end also the work
items because we used we we have we use
the assignments of work items to do this
we are we have a little some
documentation at least important how to
install because there is the
installation there is the client which
is the extension of visual studio and
there is the server side to install the
the proxy and some you will find it we
have also used the code contracts
something that I be yes we have a high
discovered in in Paris that were
presented so we we use them and these
are these are the people this is small
team it's me and postdoc a fabric a
lovato and to master of sia Meister of
science students juice epicenter Oh
Nikolas anakata was the picture as an
avatar in team in the taller but nothing
codeplex and I these are the conclusions
Justice summarize the research question
is how to we strengthen or build trust
among developers who were part of global
software teams that have few or no
chances at all to meet the airport is is
the information shared on social
networks if collected can work as a
surrogate of the social awareness which
we gained during the informal meetings
in the in the real life
and the social TFS does this work and
aggregate the social information from
into team foundation server it is ready
for demo end user and as a future work
we think that we will evolve social TFS
two directions AG one is that way is to
integrate the social information with
other types of information which are
related for example to work space
awareness because that is something we
have we have not mixed yet and we are
with but you cannot just mix you have to
think about how to one kind of
information can be used together with
others and also another thing that we
can do is the mobile version of social
TFS because for example except for the
interactive timeline the home timeline
and the iteration timeline might be used
on on a Windows Phone and so you can
maybe while is sitting at your desk you
are not looking at informa social
information about your colleagues but
while you are in the metro you might do
that and it can be different contests
and also what but most important that
you want to we have an I policies but we
have to test the hypothesis so that we
want to measure the actual benefit of
being personally connected to other
developers in the workplace for doing
this and for turnitin is not something
that we can do with the university
students I mean we need a large project
with real developers and that use
Microsoft
tools Mike then working with Microsoft
the development environment so I will
this one of the expectation is from this
dog to raise some interest about this
because I'm Annie this is the first
place where that I can think about of
course over at least you you can guide
me about this I think this was the last
slide here hi ever the the tool I mean
the ice we have how time is finished
okay time is VI have the tools because
since I have yes we have the same
meeting with some of you I i can
continue show some okay this if this is
i will show you
okay these were the people for example
year if I want to accept a suggestion I
can I can see for example before
accepting a suggestion know what kind of
what is doing I can also view present
with the skills about people they are
taken from LinkedIn just because
linkedin provides skill and if I decide
to follow him ok now
it's
then I had the iteration timeline it
changed that as I was saying changes
according to the active affixed and here
you see this is the interaction there
was the iteration time and this
interaction timeline if I open a file we
will be filled
soon
and if i open
same because basically information is
taken from here and if I come back to
the source code five this wish to also
and if I open another I that of course I
mean either here are the services that i
have open here about complexes if i want
to suggest the people that I mean I
won't be part of the suggestion of being
in the same projects and the feeling the
properties changes according
ok in the
okay I can also hide people if I don't
want to see there is not too much else
to to to show because that it possibly
have to be simple and not being
complicated the problem is now to
understand this while of course while
working and if I find this annoying I
can also close it I can reopen of course
I can reduce it these are part of the of
the features of all the e AI de it's
it's a big of you it's I can arrange it
as say I prefer okay this I nothing gets
to add about the the demo because they
and if you have questions ah just really
so one question I have is that I mean
you're putting this in a development
environment where presumably the person
when they're seeing that is doing some
cutting public at sort of debugging
but as demonstrated over there but many
of the comments are actually not related
to development at all at least in in
your particular context do you you
envision that like the purpose of this
is to become aware just to get to know
who you're working with like so you know
I've never met this guy but I looks like
he likes going to concerts for indie
music and has a girlfriend who's
pregnant or is it more like oh you
expect people that will be riding like
oh I fix this major bug in this thing
today usually tough so you have an idea
of what they're actually doing
undeveloped side of things there are
interesting questions up currently this
is about social awareness that there are
not no interaction with other kind of
awareness for example workspace
awareness of the other group structural
awareness it would will we can think
about this make the different kind of
awareness be dependent and for example I
was talking about the developers but
actually in the in the visual studio are
not just the developers as a program
they are the tester there is a project
currently I mean so the perspective can
be broadened and currently we are able
to include all of them of course but the
rows are not seen but yeah but might be
the benefits of viewing it's me the
perspective because just knowing what
people are up to in in their lives for a
very solid development can create like
and closer relationship position like
this is a real person and trusted thing
it would be interesting to know if
people's reaction to what they post
differs when they know that people are
following them within a tidy as well
would you post other information some
when i close on facebook right I know
who is looking at me in what context of
that kind of dictates what i write to
some degree yes part of this also why we
at the vm having done this there are so
many things that we might add but i
think that we are at a time that we also
need the feedback on actual usage before
deciding which kind of direction which
what is worth to add and its program now
you are saying it's a speculation of
what you might be useful to add with
what we would like is to get this
feedback from users that have tried that
this and saying look I have used this
but i will i will need to to do
something more or to know also this add
something to it but just like maybe just
watch how people use it and yeah yeah
this is what you what they're able to
yes yeah bigger i can imagine is an
empirical study is giving to people who
want to use it and then have
the questioners and interviews
structured interviews led to gather
information about some specific
questions that you are looking for about
to discover patterns
