hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
um we're going to talk about coaching
tips William arruda is here to talk
about personal branding and he is one of
the leading experts in personal branding
so very excited to have him here today
um over the lunch hour when we talk
about careers and network I have Brian
hall coming in to talk specifically
about VG careers and how he has cracked
his path and be an opportunity for Q&amp;amp;A
with him then at lunchtime I have
invited eight general managers to join
us for lunch they will be upstairs at
different tables I'll introduce them
quickly here they won't actually be here
but of where they are and how long
they've been here what kind of career
they've had and there's also information
in your folder that will show you who's
going to be here so you can pick one of
those to eat with and I would encourage
you to ask ask them the tough questions
that's what about you know their career
where they look for when they're
promoting people etc and then the
afternoon we're going to be spending
with the brave new workshop John Sweeney
it is an improvisational group and so
it's going to be a little bit different
and we're going to talk about agile
leadership agile communications how to
make communications dick it is people
here Microsoft has anybody done this
workshop before okay um people really
really get a lot out of it so I'm
excited so looking for your
open-mindedness and that is why we have
open space over there so I am going to
tell you a little bit about coaching so
how many of you have ever received or
given career advice me too I find it
they kind of come in one in three ways
either really obvious really vague or
just really confusing so what we want to
try and do here with coaching and
throughout today is to help you really
get a clear road map and
help you think about where do I want to
go with my marketing career here at
Microsoft and have it be specific to you
and that's what your coach can help you
do one of the things your cups me I'll
be over so all of you are also in a
coaching circle so one of the questions
we get a lot is well how is this
different I already have a coach and the
answer is yes you do that is a coaching
circle the goal of those is twofold one
is to deal with your business problems
as well as learn how to be a coach this
coach is all about you so this is about
your career and not about the other
people and it is private one-on-one so
you saw this in super weak probably and
but just to let you know what coaching
is and isn't it is personal it's
completely customized to you it will be
one hundred percent confidential so it
is a very safe place to have this
conversation and it's a collaborative
it's back and forth and the goal of
coaching is to help you move forward so
it's always about what's the next step
you're going to get you'll hear from
your coach so what's next what can you
do next to make that happen so it's
identifying where you want to go and how
you want to get there and the deep in
learning is sometimes there's a little
surface that we think about but there's
often a lot below it though um your
coach can help you explore is not
mentoring your coach will not have
advice for you and and it is not therapy
we do not look back we look forward and
it sometimes can feel therapeutic but it
is not there it's pirated but again it's
about you so there's two roles in this
relationship and the client the client
you will set the goals you're not going
to come in to your coaching and say okay
what should we talk about you need to
bring what you want to accomplish and
determine those topics and we really
want you to be open you know I know in
the coaching that I've had I am
continually challenged to think about
things in new ways
and you know approaching and a new way
that I haven't seen before and it could
be very very useful the other thing we
ask is if you agree to do something like
a homework assignment that you actually
do it and that when you sign up for a
coaching slot that you show up we know
that things happen and things shifted
last minute but we really want you to be
committed to this time and you know that
is it's not cheap to have a good and
there is a user to lose it so we do ask
that you do if you need to move
something to 48 hours in advance out of
courtesy for your coach and for the
people who are paying for the coaching
which would be so what the coach is
going to do is they're going to help you
drive the learning in the action and
although you are going to do the work
one of the really main tools that
coaches use this powerful questions as a
coach one of my favorite things I hear
back from a client in a session is huh
that's a really good question hadn't
thought about that so that's we're
really trying to get to ask them as
powerful questions that will help you
discover them some new things I will
make requests and inquire about things a
request might be okay you should meet
with with I'd like you to meet with four
new people this week okay big request as
the client you have three options you
can say sure I'll meet with four new
people this week or no I'm not going to
be with morning people like this week
that doesn't work for me or a
counteroffer gosh four and a week is too
many but I think for buy em in three
weeks is probably reasonable so that's
what I'll sign up for and that become
the commitment that you're making to
yourself and your coach to move your
action forward um insights this is when
your coach is listening for the words
that you say and also for the words that
you don't say and so they're going to
probably you know just kind of use their
intuition and say wow I'm kind of
hearing this and you know what they're
not always going to be right and that's
okay
and if they're not right you can tell
them you say yeah that is not really
right that's that doesn't work for me
you're not going to hurt their feelings
this is about you and what you need so
don't don't be shy about giving feedback
and saying uh you know you're going on a
direction i don't i don't really care
about that or i don't think that's
working for me let's do something else
and they are a code of ethics to
maintain confidentiality so you can feel
comfortable with that and who does the
work animation are you like who does the
work you do that's right and the visual
that I like to give myself is actually
like a track coach so if you're a track
coach and your athletes are running if
you actually do the running for them
they're not going to get stronger and
faster and better so they have to do the
work you can help guide the practice if
you will but you guys are going to do
the work I spent way too much time
trying to build on animations as well
you know so you can do low value
coaching um that's when you would show
up and say I don't really know what I
want to talk about or hey let me tell
you this great thing that I did it's
okay to celebrate because you're your
coach will be a great cheerleader for
you but continually talk about the
things you're already good at are not
going to give you the best value for
your coaching um other low value
coaching is if you're not really engaged
um I just want to have a conversation
waste of time and not useful it might be
a fun conversation but it's really not
going to help you move things forward so
to get high value coaching and hyphal
coaching scenario is when you say gosh
i'm really stuck on this issue i'd love
to think about it how to get through it
or I'm having this challenge with this
person or I don't want to get here and
I'm currently here how do i how do i get
there and just having a clear goal in
mind being really open and transparent
and again being fully present and to the
experience
so although I said more than once
probably it's all about you because it
is um but this is a program that
Microsoft provides so some of the things
that we do want to come out in with over
your four sessions in particular is your
career plan making sure that you have a
really clear career plan your know where
you're going you'll document it yourself
in the tools but and use your coach to
help you do that these other ones kind
of layer up into the career plan often
and these are topics that often come up
in our marketing bench coaching so
personal branding building your personal
brand you don't get a good start on that
today thank you about your network what
network do you need how do you build it
leadership coaching is not going to
teach you leadership that's what the
Microsoft bench is designed to do but
this is about finding your voice what
kind of leader do you want to be how are
you going to show up and there's extra
lots of exercises to do around that to
find your leader voice as you grow in
scope here at Microsoft work-life
balance that's often a topic that people
struggle with as they continue to rouse
in the race and potty trained and
everything else it's an option the last
one there is inspiration and this is
think about how do you get inspired like
what are your sources of inspiration is
it someone you listen to you read art
you know how are you continually feeding
yourself so it's not just spreadsheets
or it's not just weird documents and
presentations but to really keep
inspired with your life and and your
work here Microsoft so something to
explore so what you're going to get
you're going to get four sessions first
one will be an hour long and the
remaining free will be 45 minutes so it
gives you a clean our to schedule with a
little flushed I'm on either end which
is nice the industry standard for
coaching is on the phone and and I've
had lots of people say hey we're both
vocal can we meet in person
and if you and your coach agree that you
want to meet in person that's fine you
can absolutely do that I have done both
and I as a coach and a Kochi and i
actually prefer the phone and here's why
it's a little more if I'm able to as a
coach I'm able to really focus on what
people are saying and the listening and
I don't have the visual distractions of
you know am I sitting right can I take a
note you know it you don't have any of
that it's all just listening what they
say and there's a little bit of almost
privacy as well to be able to share as a
co chi or a client over the phone versus
in person you do want to be in a private
place when you have this call and you do
want to have a really good phone
connection if you're using linq and it's
not going to be a good coaching session
because your coach won't be able to hear
the nuances or if you're on a cell phone
and there's lots of background noise so
make sure you find a placement and can
be private and not a clear other thing
you'll get after each session you'll get
an email summary here's the you know the
main three takeaways and that will go
only to you will not go to your manager
or the program manager anybody else just
to you to kind of remind you of what you
agree to what the key topics were it
also gives your coach and opportunity to
go back for before the next session and
just refresh and say okay here's here's
where we ended up last time okay so
we've kind of covered this but um make
your first session count come with a
topic do your homework ahead of time you
only have four sessions so you don't
want to have that just via a lovely meet
and greet be honest that relentlessly
get your needs met that's where I am
saying if people are going to Direction
you don't want or this does not happen
but if you decide that you don't have a
fit with your coach don't feel like it's
a good fit for you let me know we will
rematch you with a new coach this is we
want it to be good experience we don't
want you just to drop out in that unit
recessions and because we can't find you
the right match but it hasn't happened
yet but we are open to it just from a
logistics standpoint try to get them all
on your calendar you know about once a
month is what we recommend January
through May and as you know you'll
probably need to move them around
you get them there just kind of helps
them helped you your coach will be
reaching out to schedule your first one
if you don't hear from them go ahead and
reach out you should have their contact
information if not you can ping me and
then in your first session try and get
them all agree to and use them use your
sessions there is a video that you can
watch as well to learn a little bit more
about coaching I will send the link up
all right who is the first question
about coaching it means your coach is
not an expert in your job or your
profession or you so they they may have
work experience or personal experience
but the most part is not them giving you
advice to be honest there may be times
where they say gosh I'm going to move
into mentoring mode here a little bit
because I kind of have an idea and it's
it you can give them permission to do
that or to not do that but ideally
they're throwing it back at you and to
help you come up with the answers and
again because you know they're not
subject matter experts any other
questions anyone had a coach before yeah
how you feeling about this you feeling
good excited good coach yeah alright
sounds good all right make sure its
first scheduled session is scheduled and
before your first session send in your
coaching action plan and that will be
helpful there is also a worksheet in
your binder or your folder today that is
a career worksheet I believe you see it
yeah um and that's just um it's not
required but as you as you're going
through today or over the next couple
weeks if you think think about things
that you would want to maybe cover in
your coaching or you need to work on um
it's just an easy way to track it so all
right so here's how the rest day is
going to lay out where I'm going to turn
it over to William in just a minute
and and he will have about two hours he
will give you a break we promise and
they weren't have Brian hall come in
with dodgy careers lunch lunch will be
an hour with the gyms then you'll have
15 minutes after they leave I've given
them travel time to get back for a1
o'clock so that we done it 1245 and then
we'll be back here at one o'clock to get
started again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
