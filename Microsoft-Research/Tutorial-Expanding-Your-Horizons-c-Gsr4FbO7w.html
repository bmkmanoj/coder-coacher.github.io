hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
okay so really want to thank also Pope
SP and also my employer microsoft
research but really wanted to just cover
a couple things in this in this talk and
this is I'll tell you in a second here
why I'm doing this it's going to be a
little bit different than anything else
hopefully you did today and hopefully
i'll keep you guys awake for it perfect
thank you so the I don't the title that
was originally published was when we
came out with on a fly so don't think
you're going to get any great insights
for me what we really want to do is
actually have a discussion about kind of
expanding the horizons of your research
of what you're doing of how you're
looking around and also hopefully get
your research or other activities more
broadly disseminate it so that's kind of
what I wanted to cover give you my
little full disclosure here so since I
work for Microsoft Research I'm familiar
with most of stuff we do and what the
company does so any of the samples I
kind of show will be based off of those
or the what we on does desk just discuss
about there's a link to both my blog and
to the e science blog that we also run
out of our group and my Twitter account
if you want to send something out only
if it's positive okay so good all right
one other little thing I wanted to try
today I put a link up there to a OneNote
notebook it's up on SkyDrive you can go
there right now I don't have everything
in there but what I wanted to do is
actually have this to be an interactive
discussion not me lecturing to you and
not with that I have all the knowledge
or info here but we are like anything
else in this day and age we learn from
each other we learn about new things
that are happening the the speed is
which some of the developments or new
technologies or new websites or new
sharing comes out happens very quickly
so keeping up to date with those as
tough how do we know and how do we keep
track of that and what are some new ways
of doing it so one also
cover some other little things this will
be the bulk of what I talk about but if
anyone okay so oops let me move this
over i'll show you that this is actually
live
alright so you guys can feel free to
actually add anything in here on any of
these lines as we're going around
talking and if I don't see anything
added by the end of the talk I'll just
keep talking and bore you to death so I
expect somebody to add something and
we'll check it later all right but
really you know this is kind of where
we're all at right now the kind of let's
say i'll say the typical model of what
we see of academic research you know
there's information that gets
disseminated through typical environment
of things like your papers through
journal articles through conferences
events workshops getting the information
out that way through posters and
depending on which domain your end
posters sometimes have a higher value
than some of the other information
that's one of the ways to get some of
the quickest information out or the most
timely information but how do you do
that in a way also that gets that out
and then obviously one of the typical
things as web pages so this is kind of
the current state we're all used to this
but are there other ways that we can do
this and other ways to get some
information out and so that's really
what i want to kind of see about and
talk about and one of the ways obviously
is you know with the papers getting
those out and one of the things we look
at is how you can get things wider
distribution of your information so in
this case there's and you'll hear about
it tomorrow from tony probably during
his keynote about using open access
publishing both through traditional
publishers and threw up and repositories
through the universities it's a way to
make it more available but there's also
can you leverage some of these little
icon paper sites places that you could
actually not only post your papers but
you can also post the links to them and
the citations about them and you know we
have one through the academic search
there's research gate which are you may
or may not be seeing seems to be growing
they just got 20 million dollars in
funding this week there's mendeley that
just got bought by elsevier but these
are all ways to not only track other
people's papers but what
kind of going on how quickly and see
those and there's a reason why this is
kind of also interesting is because when
you do actually participate in these
communities not only searching for other
information or participating or putting
up your own you end up creating profiles
and so you end up having ways of also
projecting yourself out more to a wider
community right so not only not only
about you about your work and getting
that also more visible so you know three
different versions of me up there and
actually none of them are totally up to
date because i always have a hard time
moving the citations around pushing them
out and putting them up but it's one
thing you want to do and you're in your
research i don't have to worry about
that as much as you will so I don't
update- as often but those are things
kind of also look at it's also a good
way to also track other people's papers
that you want to follow see what's
happening and see see how those go long
so that's one thing I actually and are
there others that you guys know about so
when I said it's interactive if anyone
has any other ones please any time
during this you can interrupt so
otherwise remember I'll just keep
talking and talking and talking and
talking right now so so think about
these actually and I don't how many I
participate in any of these and people
from Microsoft don't count so okay so
yeah so as you're also trying to grow
your career or interact with others or
find other people this is another way to
do that because the challenge always is
how do you find not only people in your
domain but across domains possibly in
other areas in other countries and other
institutions and the way you find most
of them nowadays but through the
traditional means is you find them
through either your work groups or the
conferences or the workshops that you
attend now this is actually a different
one right because you're bringing in
people not only from around the world
but also for many different domains and
so it's also a good opportunity to start
the networking across those
you find out about other activities
happening in other institutions has
anyone here introduce themselves to
somebody they didn't know before today
okay good you guys raised your hands
Jesus getting worried well it's late but
still people can your arms can't be that
tired so so those are some of the things
make sure that always happens growing
your network is one way to do that but
also figuring out growing on your online
kind of network and your your being your
persona that way as well did I go
there's also a different one that we
have also through bing so I always
highlight this one as well which is
there's I do in being called tagging
it's in beta right now but the idea is
tagging about your profile who you are
and pages other information about that
and it also helps them create that
profile so if somebody's doing a generic
search on a location they'll find those
as well so you can actually go there tag
that the nice part is even if you tag it
or you tag other people that you know
they have to approve them so they don't
automatically you know get pushed out
there so those embarrassing photos that
you have that are lingering out on the
Facebook or other places those won't
don't have to show up so think about
that as also other ways to get your
information out and there's many others
some that I know about some others then
you know there's also these things you
know the total social media they're all
their profiles as well and some can be
used for different pieces or another one
thing that's interesting just for you to
know I was trying to download the
facebook logo today here they block all
that wasn't even able to get the logo
which was really wasn't even from their
site anywhere so I thought that was
amusing so that's why that one's not up
there we were seeing also a lot more use
of LinkedIn for professional networks
and it's a good way also for post
schooling and others to keep connections
with folks also to fight other jobs and
other activities plus some of the
groupings that they have in there we use
it in fact in our org and also we use it
externally with groups for around and
things like e science other activities
communicating events activities that are
going on so it's another one that we
utilize as well one other one I want
just want to talk about when you're
talking about making data and not just
data information more accessible and
alann disseminated one of the ways
there's also Trant having the webpages
translated and making those available so
that others can get to those much easier
whatever language also the key thing is
you want them findable from search
engines so using some of the translation
products either that we have or other
companies have is a good way to actually
do that making sure that they're
findable and disseminate disseminated so
there's the translator piece actually if
you have any questions on it chris has
all the answers she's actually worked on
the product she's he and she knows how
it works so feel free to pin her in the
corner later and ask her any of this
also one of the cool things is if you're
working on a paper a document or article
even doing direct translations of those
in something like word there's the
functionality are already built in so
it'll send it off translated so you can
actually have the another language
version of it one of the ways you can
get search engines to find things that
you might want them to find is to do the
multiple learning multiple versions in
the other languages even in hidden pages
that they find and then the one of them
I actually find very useful is over
there on the right I even as you're
using a document or reading in the
document you can do the translations
directly in there on just a word so the
one over there on the right showing that
but translation is obviously a key thing
for you know getting it out beyond the
bounds of either your locale or language
multimedia in this generation as I'm
looking around much younger than I am
videos seem to be much more prevalent
we're seeing that in the trends and
usage patterns and things like that so
one of the things that's also very
useful and we we do this for some of the
work that we look at is telling the
story about the information or the
research is really important allowing
that to be consumable by someone else by
someone else and much more accessible so
that then then they dig into your paper
is really a good thing to do so doing it
either through videos even if it's a
podcast or other things for an auditory
type ways there's ways to kind of get
the information out so sometimes some of
the things I'm kind of talking about you
may think of are on kind of that
marketing edge and you know what as you
move forward in your career you're
essentially marketing yourself so how do
you market your information and stuff
about you the work you've done in
different ways and so think about that
as well as you're working on it but
disseminating the information is a
really key thing using video in this
case you know we're Microsoft Research
ourselves we publish out different ones
on this is on the luma share or
illumiroom and so its up on YouTube
having a subscription out there the
piece I didn't put in here also about
that we do on some of our sites with
videos is speech to text in the video so
we have a project called n'avez which is
about actually does the automatic
translation and it uses machine learning
to actually look at the words and so you
can actually do text-based searches into
the videos find the videos that you want
to and in fact the sections and jump to
those and actually do read and listen to
those that's a key thing when somebody's
looking for a specific term and if they
only find it once in a video probably
not what useful watching that even if
it's a three minute video right if it's
in there about ten times then probably
it's much more germane and especially as
you go down to more space
areas in the sciences the mavens project
we do it through our research sites and
and other product and other videos we
have but also we've been working with
the folks at Department of Energy all
their videos are actually now made
available that way as well as places
like JPL so they have all their videos a
text searchable as well and it's if it
actually changes how you start watching
videos as well jumping to the area's you
want to finding out if that's really
what you wanted to do much the way you
do for a texture search into a paper and
obviously you know photos are always a
good thing as well I couldn't find a
good one so I put that one in there you
don't really have to call me but you
know adding photos of the the projects
of the work because it does help
communicate across bounds across domains
lets people understand what you're
talking about there's sometimes a
challenge especially in the science
domains where you're publishing out
information that I'll say is a there is
sometimes a need to flex the mental
muscle and actually show everyone how
tough your big your muscle is and
sometimes that's harder for people cross
domains to actually be able to pick it
up and understand how it could be used
in their space so if you're also looking
in kind of a nice science type way of
how to make your information we're
broadly available think of in that terms
as well as that you know what's the that
you know the dummy handbook version of
it so think of the sometimes that how
can you present it in a way that's very
consumable and photos and others help
putting up information and the Flickr
groups or photo streams is a good as
well one of the other things we look at
as a way to project yourself out get
information out more broadly is through
things like you know guest speakers
either at workshops or other in areas
but we've also been looking at it how
can be worked with you know things like
Skype directly across and the skype team
actually their whole group has a skype
in the classroom activity which much
i'll say a lot of it focuses around
say the K through 12 the younger areas
getting information out that way but
they actually work across universities
and guest speakers and you can actually
have the video by doing it you get the
free video group sharing video sharing
group part for free it's a really neat
way of actually going interacting and
also disseminating information without
actually having to do sometimes all the
travel and or put up with some of the
other issues that you might have to the
one right there is actually when we did
an event South by Southwest in Austin
that was actually NASA in their clean
room so at Goddard Space sorry Johnson
has the largest clean room in the world
and we were able to actually have the
person walk around with a advice and
give the QA directly from there into an
area that no one gets to go to right so
this idea of also virtual tours and
actually being an expert showing
information about a place even if it's a
project or it's a method of how you do
it is really powerful and as we're
seeing more in this day and age the use
of video and that interactivity is a
really you know much more engaging kind
of a way of doing it so so think about
that sometimes may not be useful in all
those doing the virtual tours but if you
have a unique asset or you have a unique
piece that you're actually working on it
may be a way to get that out broader so
so again don't just limit yourself to
kind of some of the traditional ways and
really one of the things like I said
what are some of the other thoughts that
folks here might have I didn't go into
all of them because I wanted to leave
room for other folks as to what they
might have and did anyone add anything
hmm to find out nothing on the paper
site uh-huh nothing there okay so I
guess I'm gonna have to keep keep
talking
ok I'll make sure it's
laughs it should be yep should be 0
unless somebody's put some up there and
I don't now Chris is probably working
out so anyone have any other side or
things that they've tried all right
there we go
I'll repeat that so as far as
disseminating your work through software
that doesn't fit into allocation and
can't be made open source for very
reasons but you want to put an
executable out there do you have
suggestions for that for where to put
the executable or for how to actually
get it out and make it more visible I
guess okay so actually I don't that's
actually a good question I don't have it
for the executables the thing about just
getting it out there it's you're going
to use some of the same probably
techniques probably to make it more
visible and it'll be the output of
whatever you're trying to do will be in
the description around it will be the
piece that makes it more engaging for
others but part of it will be not as
much say was you delivering the ways out
but actually your collaborators that
would be using it you would hope that
they would also get the word out so yeah
it's you know the old thing about 10
years ago 15 years ago hoping something
got slashed on it and that would take
off the world you know it's tough still
right there are many different ways of
kind of doing it or do you get a YouTube
video and you do it with a musical dance
number in it and you'll probably get a
you know get people look at it so yeah
it depends on how it gets it gets so I
don't have if you have any or other
thoughts we actually as a company also
put a lot of our stuff out through
github which is also another place that
you can push the data but not i'm not
sure if you can just put the executables
out Roman as a software engineer like at
first github is the best now for
visibilities most cool open source site
of the day we also have caught place as
another open source repository for your
project profiles and this is a cheap way
to publish and get visibility
ok
any other question there was somebody
back there their way the neck oh Jesus
Carol oh I like microsomal can I also
use google scholar this is a computer
scientist I assigned so I doesn't crack
it with me but but but Michael sucky
don't make it's really bad for
misunderstanding who you are so you end
up with several personas in it which is
really really hard to combine and it
mistakes you for other people in a way
that Google doesn't is there any work
lightly to be done because on the other
hand it's much better for the quality of
the material you get backs when it gets
you right it's great I want to get you
wrong it's rapes right no so the
disambiguation of who the person is is
work that is going on in that team and
with the next release I think you'll
actually see that improve in fact one of
the things they're doing is revamping a
lot of the work they're doing in there
so you don't actually see it and they
won't they'll put it out soon but
actually that's actually a good good
piece good question that the problem
that with that is that means usually
you've written them in so many different
names that you've had no no no the what
Mitchell specials yeah it is yeah but
yeah I by our colleagues who
particularly Spanish colleagues there
are real real trouble yeah because it
just mixes up all of the Oscar nachos
and then if they can't use it and it's
really the best thing for promotion case
yes so also feel free to always share
that with 22 yeah good any others
wow you guys you guys are really timed
out here huh okay so that was kind of
all I just I just wanted to go through a
few quick things and didn't want to take
a lot of time for you guys because I
knew it was going to be at the end of
the day we're going to be here through
the rest of the week if you have
anything also the oh good somebody
actually Chris added some thump there so
actually if you have other ones feel
free to put them up there as you're
going along feel free to use it as a
resource but one of the things we just
want to do is understand what's other
ways that you think you might need to
get your information out if it's not
only just source code but binaries
visibility for other information and how
we can do that as well so the one other
one I didn't put on here that we we use
sometimes as well is reddit so if you
actually use that a well that's good way
also to get articles out or information
out as well and if you can get it
populated up so that's another thing to
use so good well we're out here we go
back to hear good get perfect thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
