go ahead and welcome Michael Johnson
Michael Johnson used to work directly
with me in the dpe group and he recently
abandoned us and moved to add SDK and
now he's a he is an expert in the way
that the ad SDK works he's going to
share that with us today so without
further ado let's welcome Michael
Johnson MJ thanks you guys going war all
right so expert is stretching it because
we've learned something new every day
because people are pushing the limits on
what our at st sdk could do today so
we're constantly making changes in
getting feedback so feedback is welcome
so i kind of want to just talk about the
ad is to care how many guys are using it
today I know you are how's it going for
you so far what are you looking to get
from today's you hear you using it so
I'm just curious my fill rate is really
really
guinea-bissau isn't available to serve
and that site I wonder if it's a config
thing or there's some techniques for a
kind of our meta ok feel right and I'm
somewhat i'll send it back to raise
their head that was using a hat sdk what
are you looking to get today I'm times
at home yet any ads that emphasis is
great thing or because of her seeing the
thing the default being there you see in
a wire okay all right so we would talk
about that so let's just kind of jump
into this I got a couple demos to kind
of just talk about implementation talk
about some of the ad experiences and
talk about some of the size because I
didn't know where people's skill sets
we're at with a des des kay if people
knew it so it's kind of like an
introduction all the way and some of you
guys things me how to go offline with
all right so the reason we at Microsoft
is investing in advertisement because
the industry is going to get to 10
billion dollar business and so we still
have a lot of work with new on Windows 8
Windows 8 came out in October there are
some things we haven't implemented yet
that we will have on a road map to kind
of make our advertisement platform even
better considering that Windows 8 is new
our advertisement SDK kind of came out
with that although we leveraged a lot of
experience from phone we actually
looking to do a lot of different things
with windows 8 because windows 8 give us
a lot more real estate so we can create
some unique experience and I kind of
show some of those it's easy to use it's
free and it's a simple process to
implement and then you can leverage our
platform is what we would like you to do
there are other platforms out there that
you can use if you already have
relationship some of those platforms you
could use those on Windows 8 we actually
deliver better experiences and add
experience we still got work to do on
those and we are working on that one our
advertisements decay on mr. you guys saw
this you can monetize it up what we do
yes i think is unique and kind of answer
some of your courses we try to work with
top 500 advertisers because we want to
deliver quality advertisement which if
we deliver you quality advertisement we
delivering you higher CPM / impressions
we don't want to see like hey go lose
weight dieting pills or come here and
you know get your lost weight pills and
things like that so we try to stick with
like name brands
high quality advertisement the other
thing we work on is we don't want the
user to leave your apps so we try to
create immersive engaging advertisement
experience that keep the user within
your app so when they actually click
through and actually it engage one
advertisement they're still in your app
and Nikki use the back button to go back
to your app which helps with your
impression level and also help with
engagement and then we try to make them
immersive great experiences not only is
quickly at enable it's a few lines of
code to add for HTML or zemel so the way
it works is once you decide say i'ma
monetize my advertisement our monetize
my up using advertising you actually go
to download the SDK you can use some of
the test codes that we have to come test
your app out you go to pub Center signup
and it's really that easy to implement
the you publish to the store and then
you start tracking your information how
we pay because there's a lot of
different ways people play they play
based on click throughs right now we're
doing it just per impression so the way
to think of that is it's a thousand
impressions so if we go work a deal out
with the advertisers you say I'm will
pay two dollars ten dollars or twenty
dollars for every thousand impression
now if a user is creating a thousand
impression you'll get ten dollars or two
dollars whatever that impression is
we're not paying for click throughs
right now so we'll talk about how that
works when you actually impression show
up on the screen now the key thing is
and I've done a literature app you
didn't have ratings we because of Child
Online protective Privacy Act we don't
advertise in apps if you have your apps
are under 12 so we can't do advertise
them so it has to be 12 plus for your
apps to use our advertisement platform
and then there's the seventy percent 30
percentage split so based on the net
process net profit that you make from
advertisement you the developer get
seventy percent will get thirty percent
and of course if you go over to 25,000
that changes to where you get a two
percent we get twenty percent and it is
net not gross go I set my episode last
night but I
seen ads to wear those xbox so let's
take that offline you shouldn't see a
hat you because when it comes when it
goes to the store your rating and
everything should block you from seeing
ads so we should talk about that if you
shouldn't you say and asking your out
because you really should are you
actually getting numbers and dollar
signs in pub center okay thank you I'll
say that's a bug I don't like
impressions how are you defending an
official visit just so we're going to
talk about that later so let me just be
clear this is strictly going to be
windows 8 advertisement windows 8 at SDK
is different from windows phone at SDK
only focus on windows 8 at SDK if you
have questions about the Windows Phone a
des des kay I'll kind of help you but I
don't want to go down that path because
it is different we deliver different
experiences and the whole process is a
little bit different the problem is we
did take a lot of things they did like
we integrated everything in the pub
center so there is going to probably be
some changes coming to where you can
actually see the differences between
Windows Phone and Windows 8 clear and
pub center once you hit 25 thousand
dollars and revenue so some of the
things that consider for for your
advertisement is one we talked about
what I'm talking about is download SDK
consideration for integrating address
you can t you're out so it's not
intrusive and a few lines of code
signing in the pub center register pub
center and then send your ad units and
to sell so how many so it was only three
or four people how many people actually
have apps are ready to publish to the
store and those who are not using that
as decay how are you currently
monetizing your app in the store hey
so are you doing advertisement first on
free then you convert into paid so you
have two outs one advertising want to
pay anyone else so it's free with
advertisement and then you make them pay
if they want to remove advertisement do
they get any additional functionality is
just removing advertiser ok people do ok
I think I saw a hand over here alright
so what we going to talk about is how
easy it is to implement that s decatur
different at unit sizes what we tried to
do I hate PowerPoint but let me I know I
had just so here's an ad unit sizes we
have when you go to pub center you're
going to see seven at your sizes what we
try to do is there's this organization
called IAB and they have standards for
at unit sizes and so you will see some
of these similar sizes whether you go
and do stuff on Apple iOS if you do
stuff on Android and things like that so
there's IAB standards and so the good
thing is a lot of these IAB standards
fit very well within the windows 8
design elements like the grid so we have
2 250 x 250 we have 2 300 by 250 we even
have some banners that get lined up with
your margins so we tell you to think
about your ad unit sizes so i'm a pause
here because i don't want to spend too
much time on the power point i want to
make this interactive how it works is
each ad unit that you create is a
placement in your app there there's a
combination right the first thing you do
when you go in the pub center let me
just a guess I'll stick to powerpoint
because i forgot people are watching in
there recording the additional side is
728 x nanny so when you think about
doing your advertisement that's what we
want you to think about we want you to
think about all the different a sizes
you have and then how to play sending
your app so I'm sure show a couple of
examples of some of the ad experiences
we do and how to how to look within your
app all right
so this is a demo app that we have to
kind of just show that experiences and
as you can see here we have different ad
experiences we have a full screen image
and I can use the 160 x 600 anchor I can
use the 350 x 250 and that ax paris to
be served in the anchor sighs so from a
developer or a design perspective all
you have to think about is integrating
real estate of your app using one of the
ad anchor sizes we take care of all the
experiences the advertiser is going to
get sent to you you as the designer
developer you don't know how to worry
about that no this is a actually they
was going to try to publish it let me
confirm if it actually went through or
not but it's not a fool I was just a
demo out for us but it would be great
for you guys see so for example if I
click here this is the fabric a man
dailies app and so when you think about
this app you can see here's the
advertisement it's the banner 11 160 x
600 one of the things you'll notice
about the banner it is it kind of fits
with the content the margins and the
content lineup it's not out of place and
it kind of feel like it's just part of
the application versus advertisement and
so once again when I click on this
advertisement you can see the silhouette
behind I guess you kind of see it maybe
but you can see I didn't really leave
the app I didn't go to a browser I
didn't open up some Internet Explorer or
Chrome browser I stayed with a nap and I
can see the full screen image so
advertisers like this although we're not
paying through click-through we have
more interaction and is more recall
memory so what we maybe I recall
memories can you recall that
advertisement that you saw in the app
and we almost have an eighty-eight
percent recall percentage so advertisers
like that only time I leave this page is
if I click here and go to learn more at
the bottom it would then open up a
browser I take me to forward if I click
the back button i'm back at the app now
we talked about impressions so when I
loaded this out that's one impression
because it's right on the screen so an
oppression happens so if i had a grid
and i was scrolling and panning left or
right when it's sixty percent on the
screen is counted as an impression so
like I left the app
and I click through the advertisement
when I met went back out and I went back
there's going to be another impression
questions on that alright so that's just
one of the experiences other one is we
have like full screen video again we
have the 250 x 250 anchor if i click you
can see again the fabric a man's daily
and you can see how integrated it with
in my grid and I just kind of pretty
much made interstitial within the
content of the grid you can see it's the
Cobra so once i click again you get the
different experience and i have the full
screen video so clicking isn't the
impression me going to that out is the
impression so like right now I'm in the
app and I click back that's going to
count as another impression so again
this is just my cup if I scrolled over
and then I scroll back that account as
an impression so it's pretty much the
pressure on one so think of this way
someone playing a game are we going to
get into this someone playing a game and
they just sitting on your screen like
solitaire and you have advertisement at
the bottom feels like okay well they're
not moving they're not doing anything
how does it count as an impression we
have what we call ad refresh and so
we'll talk about that how to add refresh
works and that's how if you're just
sitting in a game so games are the ones
that are very successful because you get
someone just in your out planning your
app and that you have the advertisements
just sitting somewhere long as you
planning your game you're going to have
impressions kind of so like if eyes are
set on the screen I'll be counting
impressions and that's because of the ad
refresh and we'll talk about that again
we don't pay for click through yet we
just is strictly impressions so those
some of the experience we work on so we
we have an internal team that takes a
lot of these creatives to create these
advertising experiences the other one we
have like full screen and video so right
here you can see again how just took one
of the ad units and integrated into my
content is not distracting the user it
just flows with the content when they
click on it they get one of those out
experience this one actually been acting
funny oh it worked that time so you see
I got the picture in the video and so
again these are experiences that you're
not going to get with some of the other
avatar
what you typically would get from them
is a banner and you click and it opens
up a browser like this so now I'm out of
the app and I can go back and now I'm
back into my regular i'm not going to
click to all their experiences i'll show
most of you guys probably seeing the
hotspot ones because that's one of our
tests at ones actually like this one so
i just showed up at rotator real quick
and so it's almost like an app within
the app and that's what our ad
experiences are so that's what's so
unique about that so you think about an
advertiser and you think about what
advertisers thinking because there's two
teams that we have so my job is the work
of you guys to implement that real
estate we have a sales team a national
worldwide sales team that go try to
partner with ford nissan i'm even say
Adobe whoever else want to do
advertisement because you guys are the
supply and we say we have all of these
advertisers apps that you can actually
put advertisement and we go to the
advertisers data one is a demand certain
add Anchor certain type of apps certain
categories because what they want so for
example like you go work with Rolex
watch what do you think they're going to
advertising they don't want to advertise
in your game they're going to advertise
into their target audience which would
probably be Wall Street Journal things
like that right so that's what we worked
with and that's how we worked with
different advertisers try to sell your
space in your app courses on that no we
do not sell pacific apps so i'm not on
the south side so i can't speak for them
i was just kind of trying to tell you
how CPMs you know how someone decide hey
i'ma bodies advertise me they launched a
campaign but i tell you they don't sell
pacific alps is certain kind of
statistics or like what is the best at
you've used to get the highest she kept
within the same pistol sighs so if you
have a 255 250 and
just vary based on the market at the
time if image is going to be better or a
full screen image or a video they all
taking the same size is their way of
telling which is going to be the best
CPM right or you're going running to
fill rate issues it might be better to
actually have three different ads and
then have your app change them out
periodically like every half hour our
change to add type on that that space
there that that's going to be better or
not affected okay so I'm going to
restate that try to break it up to Jax
like five different questions and since
we recording I want to try to make
charlatan so the first one that I heard
is and not adds its ad anchors so again
you don't control the ad you control the
real estate so his first question was
about placement and choosing the right
ad unit size so when you go into pub
Center you have seven eight different ad
unit sizes so his questions like does it
do we have data to say the 160 x 600 is
going to give me better CPM versus the
300 by 250 correct that's first course I
would say it's kind of hard to say
because advertisers are kind of fickle
what they want right most people
consider how we deliver our experiences
so if you notice if I stay in this app
you can see here I have the carousel at
a 160 x 600 and i also have just imaged
by the full screen image 160 x 600 and
you can see here i have the full screen
video at a 250 x 250 that's not just
stopping me from serving that same full
screen at video and the 160 x 600 so to
add experiences that they're paying for
we could literally serve between all of
the ad anchors so there's kind of a
balance of saying what they willing to
pay for based on IAB standards and what
an IAB standards go across all kind of
advertisement online web iOS and things
like that so based on a lot of those
being based on that advertisers do have
like ass assistant way of saying we're
going to purchase this and so that's why
you'll see some ad experience to show up
into 250 x 250 and some show up in 300
by 250 because what they are typically
buying in the past right and so that's
the mindset that we kind of got to
change because what we have done we have
change how advertisement work right
typically is just not your text banner
click to advertisement we actually given
unique experiences and so that's going
to take us time to kind of ramp that up
and we haven't wrapped up to the 500
advertisers so we still got to do some
of those things the second question you
asked so that does that kind of answer
it the second question that thing I kind
of got lost but second question was
about can you place a lot of different
ad units in your app and kind of rotate
them out as yes so we'll talk about that
and I'm dancers yes but we'll talk about
that because i'll show you some of the
things that you can capture especially
in the no ad scenario and fill rates
issues because this is hard to get a
100-percent fill rate so their chances
of having an oh add what happened or if
you have an offline experience where
your app isn't connected you won't get
an ad so we kind of talked about that so
hold that thought so since you brought
that up do I'll do want to show like I
got the 250 x 125 here where I could do
the anchor at as you can see here it
fits in right here if I click it I get
the pop-out experiences so again I can
have different things in the 250 x 150
if you use one of the test codes you can
see this same type of experience is in a
300 by 250 and also and I think on 160 x
600 so that kind of helps that I think
you had a third question we'd like if
you text or image only adds is it
generally that the larger ads are going
to give a higher CPM or is it just kind
of bad because my experience was very
very good like one day the large banner
ad would be getting more than the 250 x
250 and on the next day the 250 x 250
was getting so i won't say it's based on
size i say it was based on creative and
experiences so you can see like me being
immersed in the ad rotator experience
advertise going to pay more for that
because it's more creative for me to
just take an image and put it together
that's cheap for them to do so they're
not going to pay high CPM for that for
me to do one of these experience to
where if I go back I'll just show you
this one for me to do this here
experience the carousel they have to
take a lot of their digital image and
then really create a carousel
this is different than just a image
right and so I got pictures and I have
video within this advertisement so this
is definitely a higher CPM then just
your banner edge whether you're better
at was like 700 x 700 or whatever size
versus this this is higher CPM generally
just kind of depends on what the markets
out at the time but the the more
immersive add styles that have videos
and full screen images those generally
do give a higher CPM than the straight
image ads yes then the ones that just
dumped you off to the well yeah yes n
equals go can I control what thankful I
want to eat loud voices no you cannot if
we could do that we're all be
millionaires right now I'll just be
honest okay you do have and I don't want
to have like this place I would like to
have a video answer because it's a video
that's right so how do I control that my
preference is to get you when are an SDK
you can't so let me just let me just
restate your question just to make sure
so you want to consult does two
different things so there's ad unit
sizes so I want you to think of like an
apartment building right you go get this
three bedroom apartment right so I'm the
guy who owns the building i'm giving you
a three bedroom apartment is empty
that's what you've given us you've given
us an empty space whatever size you
chose then now so if you if i'm an
advertiser and i say i want to
advertising that we're going to serve up
those experiences whether it's the video
and picture experience or if it's a full
screen image or if it's the rotator we r
is the hot spot that jumps you off and
have you purchase stuff to e-commerce
we're going to control what we send you
because it's the advertisers who paying
us to give them so many impressions or
whatever that campaign is that they're
running right now if you step outside of
the box and you say okay I'm going to
use Microsoft fat SDK I'm used they say
ad tech or add what is it a duplex or
something like that way you can promote
other people out then from that
perspective what you control
is with with which ad engine you're
going to render an ad with you don't
control the experience within our SDK
right just like with Google and everyone
else you're not going to really control
that unless you got your own sales team
and you're buying your own advertisement
then you can serve whatever you want
right so that's you doing first party ad
serving meaning you are the first party
you're going out making deals with
coca-cola Pepsi nike and you're serving
your own stuff but if you take that 250
x 250 and you have these relationships
with all these other ad providers you
could build logic and you're out but you
got to think about the user and a user
experience but you could build logic in
your app that's nothing stopping you to
saying my first chair advertisement is
going to be Microsoft at SDK if I get to
know act I'm going to reclaim that space
e to put content in it well I'm gonna
put a static banner ad or I'm gonna go
to some other ad network and bring
another one in right so that you control
does that make sense ok any other
questions all right so let's talk about
design considerations we have do's and
don'ts and so to your point and this is
where design come in handy and when you
think about your user you think about
the overall experience of your app you
des couple things you built the app for
one you built out the first reason you
built a pop zooming to make money right
you thought like okay this is something
that people going to use and people
going to need in order for you to make
money there's a couple things got to
happen no matter which way you choose to
monetize your out you got to make sure
it's a great user experience and you got
to make sure your users not extended or
your users not in they got to be
impressed and you want them continuously
using your app so when you think about
advertisement you need to have that same
mindset is how can I get great reviews
and get a million people downloaded
because the more people download you out
the more impressions I don't have that
impression is twenty cents for CPM up to
fifty dollars per CPM if you got one
person you're not going to make any
money if you got a million people 20
sets start adding up right so you kind
of got to think about that so people get
caught up in like
well my CPM low well what's your
download so when he brought up analytics
he was right on how people using your
apps so I encourage you to look at
reviews look at your analytics and your
analytics going to also tell you the
most critical thing what a place your
ads where people spending the most time
in your app because people say well I'm
not getting any money okay where did you
put your ad if your ass over here and
they never go in there you're not going
to get a lot of impressions but you got
a million downloads but no impressions
because where you place your ass you got
to think about that when you're thinking
about all those things we don't want you
to lose the quality that you put on your
app we don't want you to lose the design
that you put in your app so we want you
to think about those things so if you
know right out of the back that you're
going to be doing advertisements to make
your money we want you to think about
that at your wireframe stage all the way
to building your app how does going to
fit into my out how do i think users are
going to be using my up now analytics
going to drive more of that after your
appt is in and that's going to take you
to a v2 of kind of placing things around
right so we want you to think about that
and like I said we built a lot of things
for layouts so when you think about
advertisement you can see again we put
the flight app and you can see how we
lined it all up so everything actually
fits with my content it's not like up
above and then my contents down
everything is margin correctly it's all
sitting in together and this is a nice
experience again if I'm sitting here
playing with this out I'm getting
impressions as long as I'm sitting on
this it's not distracting from the user
because again you're not getting paid on
click through so you don't have to say
user I'm over here advertisement we
paying you based on oppression so you
could keep the quality of your app and
you can keep that experience and still
make money so we want you to think about
that first and foremost the other one
you can see here most people that count
out of place but you can still see is
lined up evenly with the margins the
edge still have the right and so it's
not again it's not in the user way is
not really distracting from your content
it kind of feels like it fits in
although me personally I still don't
like this but it's still a good
experience versus other things so when
you think about other ways like this one
you can see the difference is not lined
up it's just like I just
thought about it at the end and I just
plop the ad there right it it doesn't
fit with your content so you want to
kind of think about those things I mean
that's those are simple things but it
makes a big deal about how people review
your app and how they look at your out
so use your real estate wisely you have
a lot of real estate we have a lot of
different at unit sizes so to your point
of switching them out because you can
see the difference between your little
banner ad at the bottom versus a 300 by
250 versus a 1 160 x 600 if you trying
to wrote those rotos rotate those out
you actually going to be changing your
content around because you still want to
make sure it fits and flows within your
content this using the same ad size but
changing this type of AD going from an
image to a video you can't control that
well I know but if you had a different
ad unit for each one and then you just
remove one and add another so all right
so great let me just make sure I
understand it so when you go create at
unit sizes you have application and do
you have a unit sizes so you're saying
I'm gonna go create 5 300 by 250 s and
they are going to have different ad IDs
that may not change your story because
I'll tell you how what happens is you is
going to be a campaign running against
that so official campaign running
against 300 by 250 and you send your
application ID and ad unit ID to our
server and send a request back you're
going to get that ad then if you saying
oh well I'm going to go change it you
may not get a different experience you
may get the same at but with that same
ad unit I'll talk about how you can redo
refresh to get your impressions up and
also make a call to get a different hat
if a different ads development but you
don't control if it's a banner or text
or image or add rotator we control that
video with full speed images are
completely different types that you
select so those are different
experiences yeah you do not control
those so all you control again is a size
your application ID and that unit ID for
that size that's it so it's empty space
right now so like he said I get a no ad
and that means he gets nothing he still
have that empty space there
we're not sending him anything back so
now those are only the best ones that's
all the text and all the reason we do
that just so you can see the difference
that's just text so add you like these
when you do it in pub Center it go live
you know it doesn't map to video it
doesn't map to full image it doesn't map
to video in full image so correct the
test one is strictly just for
development so you can kind of see how
users interact so because there's a lot
of things that people are not doing so
like Youker is you can suspend an ad you
can see if the ad is in gate so that's
why we have all the different test modes
also it's not just oh let me see hottest
look in my app but it's also to see if
the users in there watching a video and
I want him to do something else like can
I see if he's engaged in the app before
i suspend that act and then have them do
something else so it's things like that
so that's the reason we have the test
code so you could test all those
different scenarios because if it's just
a fool out image the chances of you
saying oh he's doing something in it you
can say I'm gonna suspend a tad and pull
it down and have him go back to my app
versus if he's watching the video and
he's in the middle of the video you can
see he's engaged and then you want to
see when he's not engaged so you can
take him out of the ad and put him back
in your app right so it's things like
that so I can see how that's confusing
we should get some that's great point we
should get some clarification
documentation on that understand how we
gonna take this GPM good to do I mean
nothing we put out an ad right I mean we
will put all the ebony I mean I as a
developer will say about what CPM I'm
gonna get that's correct you guys
decided right so yes or no so we decide
based on what the advertisers want so
the advertiser is going to come to us
and say we want to run this campaign
this is what we want to do and that kind
of decide CPM because they're going to
come back and say we want X number of
impressions on this and so then we share
that love across all of the apps out
there so let's just take for example of
being the big act that you guys were
saying so say we won't work to Bing team
being team said we want a million
impressions and we're going to pay you X
dollars so that came out to be saying
two dollars per CC p.m. so that's every
thousand impressions that developer get
two dollars so but they only want to pay
up to a million so once they hit that
million that campaign is done right but
if they got all that million with you
for the two dollars you do the math
that's how much you get paid after we do
the split I'm confused because I steps
in X every day but a CPM seems to be
changing every day how does that play
come to play so so there are thresholds
that advertise the cassette based on
impression levels like a tier so you
could see CPM fluctuate based on again
this is all on the south side I am NOT
the sell-side guy and they probably
shoot me for talking about it I'm more
on hey mr. develop that's what you need
to do is how we serve as but when you
try to figure out CPM people look at and
they look at different pricing is also
about impressions at unit sizes a lot of
those things play in the mix and then
it's about what that advertiser want so
I don't control CPM we try to set the
bar high that's why we create
experiences versus a banner that you
click and you go to a web page right so
that's kind of what we try to do we try
to inflict influence great ad
experiences so those are the things i do
work with our team on we try to create
all these unique ad experiences so what
you got to think about is here's a good
way to look at it there's car dealers
right there's there's a Nissan Toyota
audie BMW Mercedes let's say and there's
you go I don't think those exist anymore
but I can think of a lower grade car
where does the Lord Greek are now like a
you go are you guys off of me what do
you go but anyway that's like Oh car
that was like $2,000 you can go buy this
little bucket thing right so that's the
ad experience you get today is a you go
because all it is is a banner ad you
click on it the user leave your app and
they go to a web browser those are cheap
those are cheap for anyone to create i
can go create one and
have it t-shirts or whatever and
clicking you come to my website that's
cheap you're going to get below of a
dollar CPM period it's going to be cheap
now when you talk about adding the ad
rotator examples like I was showing you
with images pictures and videos that
takes a lot more because now I want high
quality resolution images I want video I
want a full video so you can see the
creative to go behind to make just an
image versus the Creator that gohan to
make that full experience so now you can
see the CPMs are different so that's
kind of where we try to go to
advertisers a look at a great experience
we can create and it's a recall so
remember I said is the recall so when
you think about people clicking on just
the image and go into a browser how many
people go recall that advertisement so
good example if you look at Super Bowl
NBA playoff games the final for all
those you look at the advertisement
that's going on during those games those
are memorable advertisement that you're
going to remember you're going to recall
those you're going to be telling those
stories right so that's what we're
creating versus just a banner tech side
you click and you go away I'm like yeah
i think i went to the lego site I can't
remember vs oh yeah I had that great
experience with forward and I was able
to go around and see the 3d image that's
what they pay for that's where you get
to higher CPM so does that kind of help
but you have little control I mean yeah
you have no control but let me take that
back I take that back let's talk about
that for a second you have no control of
the price setting you have no control of
what we sin you have all the controls in
the world how many impressions you get
how people are using your app how great
your app is and how they are engaging
your app so if you're not successful
when you talk about analytics that's
your friend that tells you how people
are using your app that tell you what
people left your app that's tell you
where they spending all their time at in
your app that's where you didn't go and
say hey this one need to place
advertisement this is what I need to
make changes in my app this is why I
need to add new features to my up and
things like that so you kind of have a
control but you can't control what my
baseline CPM is but you can kind of
control like can I get more impressions
right so I'm gonna get to that real
quick any more questions on that piece
that's what that's map to the Windows
Store category and so people do buy
based on categories so like great
question so if you look at the windows
store categories if you go into windows
store categories these categories put in
place for a reason so remember i get an
example for rolex watch rolex is not
going to come to wear as game they're
not going to probably come to game as
social right what's the chances of
someone that's playing a game that's
going about rolex watch right so that's
kind of what the categories before so
when you think about categories
advertisers also notice advertise is no
user base advertisers know who's going
to be in a cooking app versus who's
going to be in a game advertisers know
who's going to be reading The Wall
Street Journal's and things like that or
New York Times who's going to be reading
USA today versus plan a game so that's
what the category is it for so again
it's also based on your app too because
your app like games there's only a
certain type of advertisements that can
go into games versus into business apps
and versus into health and fitness and
things like that so you kind of got to
think about that also goes into like if
you did you publish a nap and say
shopping but you set up your adding
their games like bullet surgeon games
lines
what's it on the back and it
entertainment hats movies vs boat
can you the developer filter at this
time no you the developer cannot target
as keep in mind we own what we sending
you and what we do is we say okay this
is a movie out so because it is hard to
what movie is probably a bad example
because to be honest with you all kind
of advertising to show up in movies if
you watch TV you see all kind of
advertising Nestor that's the number one
advertisement channel right now is put
it in between shows and they advertise
everything from sleeping pill to help
pills to workout videos right but now so
so he yes so you from the developer you
cannot control but us from Microsoft we
can control question just the amount
downloads you have with the number of
persons that you previously gotten it
back to see can write at all
so so let's talk about CPM rate versus
my overall amount of money I get CPM
rate no keep in mind CPM Raiders again
all based driven by advertisers but book
based on like you had a million
downloads so the application can get you
more money no cuz they're not going to
know about you two individual they're
not going to know about you two
individual so they're not going to say
no jet John Paul app is while my
impressions came from right we do run of
apps meaning it can go and so like for
example he could see the same
advertisement that you will see he may
see the same every time you see so we're
not going to know the advertiser is not
going to know we all know you know so
when you say my CPM love again you have
no control over that that's a set price
and it could change based on day so
again what you got to think about is a
campaign when when you run a campaign
and say I'm around a 30 day campaign
you're gonna give you a better example
listen remove advertiser and I hate to
use this as an example but it's true you
know when something like what's this
place as the the people looking for
people to bad people Crimestoppers right
when crime stoppers first start
something then started out with a
thousand dollars if they didn't get
anything in seven days they may increase
it to two thousand dollars they can get
anything in three weeks they may
increase it right so the same thing from
an advertiser perspective they say okay
this is a shelf life we're running this
campaign for 30 days if I don't get the
projections that I wanted in the first
week maybe I need to increase like
something so they're come back and they
may want to increase their reach so
that's the same thing right so like
somebody was asking why ccpm changed a
day and stuff like that is because
people set thresholds right that's the
change but you again the developers not
the ones that control them that's kind
of all just automated again from a
developer perspective the only thing
that you need to think about is ad unit
size going to the pub center crane
you're adding you the sizes and
integrating it in a nice way in your app
is really just that easy and then just
kind of work
placement where you want to put it at
door multiple levels if your app goes
deeper putting ads in multiple levels
those are the things that you as a
developer design I want to think about
wrapping your head around trying to
figure out who how much eCPM this one
every time is going to place do not even
go there because you don't control I'm
an advertising group I don't even know
right that's a whole separate team
that's going out and selling the thing
that I try to tell you is the best way
to try to think about your app is from
analytics once you got that data I can
work with you and say you should put an
ad here you should be adhered you should
add here you should put ad here based on
what user is going to be because the
beautiful thing of it is its impressions
not click through no user action is
required it's tough to be in your app
and you want the highest traffic part of
your out and the best way to do that is
find out analytics where people are in
your app that's really what you can do
as a developer does that help so any
more questions about sell stuff I'm
going to not talk about them because I'm
trying to help you as a developer to
think about how you can use what you can
use because you can't control that you
know you can't control go dad is going
to go by this campaign like they do with
the Super Bowl right that's just the
luck of the draw where people going to
bind ourselves team is trying to do that
the other thing that we try to tell you
again you can see again the halo ad just
fits with the content that blends in so
you just try to think about how to
integrate different at unit sizes but
the main point that I want to bring home
to you again using the grid layout you
can see is integrated into the content
so I showed you guys all different types
of sizes and how they fit with the
content and how it just looked like it
just marries your content is is flowing
with your content is not out of the way
is not distracting user and again if I'm
using this app i'm still doing what I
need to do I'm reading this I'm
scrolling the content and i'm still
getting an impression so you can't
control how successful you are on
advertisement if you place your ass in
the right place because it's all based
on impressions so that's the one thing
to think about I'm nephew
put it and not what sunscreen six
percent because I was loading screen
ever game Louis like a few seconds way
let me just make sure I understand so if
you have it so first of all I shouldn't
have it on the loading screen the store
should deny you if I'm thinking of a
loading screen like my outbursts first
launching okay so so you're saying you
got it then you're dismissing and hiding
it that's a great question let me find
out for you on that so I give me a
contact because i'm not sure if there's
a short time cycle of like two seconds
but i know once it shows on the screen
sixty percent it counts it but how fast
that is i will say it is counting
because how it works but don't quote me
on this but because how it works is you
setting a space and your app in your
real estate and that space is marked
with an application ID and an ad unit ID
and it's firing off to our server and
sending the request back so at that
point is counting as an impression
because it showed up on the screen to
make that call so that round trip of
your ads show up it should be counted
but the thing you got to think about did
the trip complete like making your
column then coming back two seconds
maybe really fast then it may not be
just depending on where you use that for
internet connectivity enough to add
actually fully rendered and before you
dismissing it so you could be losing
impressions so that's why i said don't
quote me on it but i'll try to find out
if there's a confusion between
microwaving those phone that does that
and your freshest cuz there's our base
sometime we have something sometime
that's refresh he's talking about first
of all can you say it's actually this
place p that's correct it has display so
if it sits or 55-250 however fixes is
250 times 560 is six percent on the
screen but so again what he's saying so
when i'm scrolling so if i'm scrolling
here so you can see how my ad is showing
up if i got this on six percent is an
impression it's gonna count but so he
may be dismissing too quickly because
he's suppressing his at he's hiding his
at versus waiting for it to
and then we'll talk about the
differences of refresh like I won this
phone i think they first did it I don't
know what it is now I think I was
talking to someone in the back where
people is able to refresh refresh
refresh and yeah we don't we have some
of that on Windows 8 so I talked about
the limitations is not the same as phone
and a lot of people make that mistake
and they get in trouble yes right here
there's another ad for pages over your
panic does that count as another that's
another impression correct adhered to
add four columns over and built up the
show up on the screen at the same time
is that cool so I'm gonna address that
for you in the demo let me get through
this cuz how long do I go tell oh man
okay you're at all all right no I'm just
kidding so let me get through this and
then i'll show you the answer your
question so because i want to get to
this slide so because he hit on a good
point we do frown against desk where you
stuck in act so you said how the banner
ad didn't have another appt we do have
people monitoring for that and it will
be considered abuse so i would tell you
to read the usage policies and the
rights of how you can use that down
that's not the same as what you're
saying so imma sure what you're saying
but that we do front on so we don't want
you to have a month of ass like that
because you can see it's not panning
it's just the screen and not it's kind
of tacky your users not going to be
happy because they can be like why you
throwing all these ads at me right and
then it's just kind of out of place it's
just weird so don't do that because you
will get in trouble for that the other
one is again another another one example
you can see how they have an
advertisement here advertising here
advertisement there don't stack at so we
have a 160 x 600 some people their
excuse is I stacked 300 by 250 and the
300 by 250 because I wanted to make sure
it fit and mirror my content that stack
into ass will come back so well no we
got a 160 x 600 that can do the same and
you can kind of put a little buffer
around the ad to kind of do the border
so it fits with your content so that we
don't bite it right so don't overuse
oversaturate now let's talk about the
Nowak and the field rate so we I don't
know any network out there that has 100%
feeling rate again one of our thing is
we are boarding a lot of advertisers and
we're on board in a lot of developers
and Windows 8 is new so we're kind of
doing this little cycle or trying to get
caught up right now what we do try to
tell people to do is there's two cases
where you get no ad is one your ad unit
at that point is not running the
campaign so you can reclaim that space
and put some of your own content back or
do something else we do not want just
the empty space and I'll show you an
example I shouldn't do this but I am I
just hope he doesn't see this recording
and yell at me so you can see it's very
obvious that that's supposed to be a dad
that's supposed to be a hat he he has a
bug in his appt it's not that there's no
way and I'm working with him to fix this
bug in his app right but that's still
the same of not getting to know I had
experience right you don't want that
that just makes your outlook all
misplace and out of line so kind of
reclaim that space and do something else
with it part of that is a field radio
issue because it's not a hundred percent
so how many guys familiar with feel rate
okay so i'll hit on that but you had a
question first what is go right okay so
it's pretty much based on is the best
way to explain it is they're supplying
there's demand and they're at par and
even meaning everywhere that i have an
add request i'm sending an advertisement
so that's one hundred percent fill rate
meaning for every unit size that we have
available for every developer that has
that unit sizes in their app and for
every one of those at units as making a
call to us we send in a successful have
returned we do not have one hundred
percent fill rate on certain ad units
and categories
that's what they're saying so they get
on no and thank uses a 29 I'm not sure
the lyrics because of leg issue or is it
because of a bug in my code or is it
because of a bug in the act and wrote
itself only we have error codes and I'll
show you those different codes that you
can look for and capture and you should
and i'll tell you about ninety-eight
percent of people or not doing a lot of
the things they can do to be very
efficient with leveraging the ad
platform one is the refresh and i'll
talk about that and then one is just
error handling and reclaiming your space
and sending another call to at the ad
server and then receiving a head unit
request you know things like that so
it's just different stuff now bugging
codes you could test there's ways to
test that this topic wasn't really on
that but you could use a fiddler and it
can kind of tell you if getting requests
calls back and stuff the other one is
just doing error code and you can kind
of see if it's just bugging your code
but I'll tell you this probably could be
a combination a lot of things one of
them is network connections and things
like that lack because I have people who
are trying to do creative things with
like flip view controls and they trying
to low to add on slippery controls and
stuff like that and if you think about
how to add unit works it's making a call
back and forth that means they literally
trying to load stuff instantly and so
you could have issues with that so
there's a lot of best practice that we
could talk about on that that's correct
it should be enabled by default unless
someone go remove so whenever you create
a visual studio project that should be
enabled by default that's the only
capability that's always checked and you
do need that so the user which we are
modified
so you said is it possible to use the
cuckoo hopping install cookies color
folder remove that I'm lozano pal he's
skilled players no I this series I'm
fuckin detective yes we're table that
one cuz I'm not gonna say with a
sophisticated user what they can and
can't do but just a regular user no but
people doing hagas things anything is
possible I'm not going to address that
you have to kind of we could talk about
that one offline I was not using the
test unit IDs how likely is it if you
guys are punishing me for for that
running from the same machine going
further ass for many hours and
development or ooh yeah uh-huh sorry
that could be that could be a case
because what we because once what what
we do we do a lot of different things we
have the P support team which is a huge
organization so this free support for
anyone does have issues with
advertisement they do want to certain
things like then they do look we do run
reports to talk about impressions and
then if we go and look and we don't see
that app in the store then yes stuff
like that could happen to where they
could kind of suspend or stop calls from
your application ID and stuff like that
if you just have an issues not getting
ass now that is in there you could send
an email to pee support and they can do
research on that that's a great one
please use the test side because you're
taking away from yourself if you add is
not public you know published because
it's not going to be a tie into like the
store and all of that so definitely use
the test ads for development purpose and
I'll talk about those a little bit so
you can see again how there's no ad and
how the it just kind of makes your
outlook not as great but considering
that you got two great tiles you could
say hey there's only three content
things I'll put it in any way but if you
have more that showed up you can kind of
see how is
different this one don't don't try to
say oh let me put this at in front of
the user because you can kind of control
some of the ads to kind of make them
have focus in front like examine sub
don't do that right because it's not all
about click throughs you don't have to
put it in front of the user just having
it integrated into your app it's an
impression so don't distract your user
from your app because i'll tell you how
r install you out real fast and i
guarantee you a lot of other kids will a
lot of other people will if they go into
your app thinking they could do
something else and you throwing this in
front of them they got to get frustrated
with you and they're going to install
your app you're going to get a bad
review and then it's going to stop your
downloads people are not going to do it
so you have to think smart about it all
right so let me just show a couple of
things that I want to show so let me
just show you how easy it is to do the
ad SDK I know we say like two lines of
code is really us to line of code I just
kind of work it up the first thing that
you're going to do is add the night this
is mo you're going to add the reference
to the name space so I can use the name
space for the SDK and I'm all done this
for people who haven't haven't
implemented and then I'm just going to
make a call again here if you see let me
just make this you can see here I'm just
making a call to my application ID and
by the way this is the test code the
test application ID and the test at unit
ID for 250 x 250 and so you could do
this and that's literally it out besides
making a reference so if i go into
reference and i hit add reference all
out do is just check the microsoft sdk
that's it and as ammo if you go to box
you can literally just drag over and as
UK now up good how you can be add your
ID
get in Turkey okay we'll talk about that
so this is test but in pub center i'll
show you how you go into pub center you
create a user and you create your
application ID and you create that unit
ID and so when you're going to pub
center the tooth there's three things
that you're going to have to think about
and it's kind of weird because if you
don't specify height and width you won't
get an ad you have to specify Hayden
with you have to specify the application
ID and the ad unit ID so and I'll show
you that in pub center but see when I
run this again this is a blank
application so i will share this with
you these are examples that we have on
the site how easy that i just told you
and I noticed it being recorded but I'm
just going to try to be honest how easy
that I told you that it was to do that
with a couple lines of code really it is
for the ads implementation portion is
littering me making a reference to the
name spacings MO and then me putting in
into the grid and the tags and all of
that the application ID and on so you
can see here I'll pop it goes through a
browser that's just one of our tests at
if I go and do this in HTML again is
going to be easy I'm just going to do
the same thing I would make my
JavaScript reference to it and I'm just
going to do a deal tag same thing I'm do
the application ID at unit ID those are
the lines of codes that you add to
actually implement it now mind you I did
this in a blink out one hundred percent
of developers are not going to have a
blank out so that was easy for me and if
I started a blank app for samo and go to
toolbar I can just drag it over it'll
make the reference for me it'll give me
a test ID and application ID and then I
can replace that right but ninety
percent of people not going to end up
with a blank out so you got to think
about how do I actually integrate this
in my content how do i add this like in
my grits if I'm doings mo how do I put
this in my tea HTML if I'm doing div
tags and things like that right so you
got to think about that so I know we say
is very easy but in all reality it is
but it depends on how complicated your
application is so i'll show you another
sample let me just make sure I don't
close the runway so this example
actually me just show another will be
far go there so I did this in html5 so
you can see here is auto refresh enables
equals true so this is where I can
control on add refresh or making a call
saying my ad refresh and i'm logging it
so i'm gonna show you that so let's talk
about the Refresh if auto refresh enable
equals true that means it's going to
auto refresh that means we're going to
automatically control it and that's
going to happen every minute so every 60
seconds we're going to make an attempt
to refresh your hat so let me just run
this so you can see here i have auto
refresh enable you can see my refresh
count and so I'm just kind of wait for
60 seconds but that's a new oppression
so every time I refresh so just memorize
telling you I'm playing a game so just
imagine i'm playing a game here it's
this black game try to find something on
the screen no and I can't find so just
imagine if you have something you tell a
kid to find someone screen how long they
gonna be looking like Where's Waldo and
they just look in the liquor look
there's a app idea wow so long as they
sit in here is going to do an auto
refresh and that's going to be a new
impression so that's Otto so what do you
guys think of that that's pretty much
probably a lot of people using right
alright so wow that was a long 60
seconds I hotels working right 60
seconds to like 30 60 it is too but we
are still six a second word holy cow I
thought I'll talk longer than that all
right so any questions so far besides if
we could change it alright so that's six
a second so it was unable to true so I'm
just going to check this and that's not
going to set it to false now I can
actually do a refresh every 30 seconds
and people said wow so now instead of
getting one impression in a minute I can
get to know you can't do two seconds and
no you can't do 10 seconds like you do
on the phone we have 30 seconds now how
it doesn't help it doesn't help to 60
seconds you fresh oh yeah yeah yeah good
so I thing else let me see that was
thursday so here it wasn't 30 second but
you can see here I'm click oh it was 30
second but you see here I'm clicking you
can see is telling me no no no it's not
refreshing so you cannot do it any more
than like I can't do it in 10 seconds I
can do it in towards thing I could do it
in 30 seconds so you can see the Refresh
so I give it a little more time and then
I do a refresh again and I go up to 4 so
yes so you can go set up is auto refresh
and able to false and then you can kind
of code and say call this on add refresh
because there's a hat refresh and i'll
show you guys those functions and events
that you can call and you can be
refreshing it now here's the beauty part
of that that's per ad unit ID so if you
got 15 at you can refresh all 15
different time cycles at 30 seconds
that's not me refreshing all of them
went out so that's each ad unit ID so
that was prob about 30 seconds so if i
refresh now it's four times right so
that's one way of looking at it and so
you can see here this is just one ad
unit ID and I'm saying it's of course i
have this to false but i just built that
just so i can show people because they
didn't believe it on that refresh and
I'm calling my ad refresh so that's
kinda that's kind of some of the ways
that you could do that questions on that
fortunately regression yes only in 30
seconds so that's not quite awesome just
great let me address them that I come to
you now the that that works too because
a lot of people say okay I didn't get it
at that time so let me just issue a
command to do a refresh and you probably
come back on and a hat I can't tell you
how all that works on the backhand but
yeah you have to wait 30 seconds but
what you could um let me try that on a
node refer no ad serve I don't know if I
ever tried that I would think it would
because you never received the ad so it
never completed your request so I think
you could do a refresh
I don't know if you can spin it in a
loop that much but imma try that I test
that out that's a great one but you
should you should be able to submit a
refresh to see if you get another hand
and now if you can keep just refreshing
it in the loop till you get one because
you may say oh you're not getting what
cause there's no campaign to sew right
questions you still get that service uh
I'm local I mean it you mean if I'm not
connect to the internet just locking up
connect to the internet and i'm using
the test at i could what if you're using
your own okay so you may have that
problem so that's what he was just
talking about in his test environment in
his dev environment he was actually
using what he created a pub center so
they may go in and see those requests
and they may they may suspend so you may
not get anything but it's best to do
this because you guaranteed to get and
add to see how it works in your app but
you could also be running into when
you're doing dev work and using your
actual pub center you could be also
experiencing know at scenario so that's
why we tell you to use the test was to
sit in the SDK documentation assistant a
normal refresh rate for
Oh is 30 seconds so if you're using auto
refresh it will be 30 seconds is that
right no auto refreshes a minute because
then it says if the user is on a meter
it's a min yes so let me clarify it so
that should be updated so if you're
doing auto refresh auto refresh is going
to happen at a minute if you on a meter
network it's still going to happen at a
minute if you doing manual refresh you
can choose whatever time you want 30
minutes and green I mean sorry 30
seconds in greater if you're on a meter
network that 30-second rule is not going
to apply still going to go to a minute
because on a meter networking to be a
minute on the only time you can go below
a minute to 30 seconds is if you
manually don't refresh so the other
thing a lot of people do too based on a
out there do a longer refresh because
they're not really worried about
impressions that way because they get
enough impression so they may delay the
refresh the other thing is some people
do a refresh because if they suspend and
then they do a resume they make some
shoot our refresh command to depending
on how to try to control their app and
their user and stuff so like in your
scenario of the game instead of
dismissing right away you may want to do
a suspend and then a resume and stuff
like that so there's a lot of different
events and functions that you can use
that are off just using your own favor
and putting it at 30 seconds to
effectively double your impressions this
one
cuz it's something I've looked into and
I've read all that when I made my out
but I just I get stuck with the auto
refresh just because I wanted to be sure
everything's going to work but through
testing the timer was refreshing to add
in the 30 seconds anything that makes
you so you're just better off going that
route is there any downside to yes and
no there's downside just depends on your
app it depends on what you're doing one
of the design size is your miss a hit on
getting the ad no no ad return could be
higher because you just constantly just
refreshing but if it was me because I'm
building my op to make money I'm
probably going to control my refresh
what I do that at 30 seconds or a minute
or two minutes or three minutes I
actually want to be in control based on
how I want to control my user experience
how I want to control my user navigating
so I'm going to try to use all of the
functions therefore resume is the user
engaged in my hand and all of those
things just so I can control the
experience of the user and not get a
user bad experience so think about this
you saw our experiences so say if I was
on your page and I clicked it and I
opened up to the video and I'm just
watching it it may be a video someone
talking to dance and I don't know like
the jack reacher video something I'm
engaged with that but you don't check to
see if I'm engaged and do refresh it may
just take that use out and then you just
go like whoa what happened right so you
kind of got to think about your user
base and if you're going to do certain
things you may want to look at all of
the functionality so like do i do it is
engaged if the user engaged maybe I
don't do a refresh if the users not
engaged I do a refresh right so that's
why it's kind of like a yes or no but I
personally I think I would want to
control my refresh
if you drill down to different pages
like to have some of your apps and it's
less than 30 seconds that's your second
page not getting back in after 30
seconds all right so keep in mind you're
my suggestion on that I wouldn't even
worry about that here's why if I'm going
on different pages I may want to have
different ad units here's why you want
to track where users are to write so if
i don't have analytics and I'm on page
one and i'm using a 350 300 by 250 at
unit ID x y&amp;amp;z on page 2i may still use a
300 by 250 but it's going to be a BCI
unit I can see which one's giving me the
most impressions but if you just use the
same at you and I dh1 you have no idea
where their users at so yes so let me
just show you this here so this is the
default grid app I didn't change
anything and you can see I integrated
ions in it so the question was can I
have more than one ad per page when i
scroll so you can see here if i scroll
now i'm kind of coming into two and so
now I literally I have two impressions
then I come and I got another one come
on and like keeps crowd so now I got
another one coming up and so then I got
to but see they ain't groups and so how
how this works is if you got I'm sure
all you guys are familiar with one or
the other as his MO or JavaScript on the
great template and how they pull in data
so all i did was created a datatemplate
selector and general and i'm switching
between content and ad unit ID and so
I'm kind of rotating so if you look here
I got one too then I took over three and
I move three down versus I put it at the
end on this one so I got one two three
four so you can do things like that so
in a grid template style we're not going
to frown at you because I may end up
with 12 items and one group and my ad
maybe somewhere in there was 12 items
right so you could kind of get away with
having them show up
more than homework page now to answer
your question are drilling down now mind
you these are all the same ad unit ID
because these all of my hub page so i
can say on my hub page i got x.x
impressions with my 250 x 250 now if I
drill down on my title page I have a
different ad unit ID because i also have
a different at unit size and same thing
i chose the item collection and i
inserted an ad in the idol collection oh
I just chose the same this is test so I
just chose the same at test on d i'm not
using saying i'm not using relax so the
chances are it could be a different ad
or it could be the same at but i would
say it probably a different add more
likely because this is a different ad
unit size versus the other ones so they
may have different advertisement
campaigns running against them or it
could be the same swamp age i can have
optimum adjudant and cannot oh no no se
midday no no no so let me that's just
clarifying it does not use paint I don't
want to use where paint because they you
give you in trouble you get in trouble
so that's why I stuck with the grid so
if I got a group Group one not because I
can't I don't want to call that a page
because I'm spanning right content so I
don't really want to call that a page so
I'm as I got group 1 group 2 group 3 so
what I'm saying is you can get away with
putting it in groups because you're kind
of intermixing ass within your content a
page is there and if you got more than
one you're going to get spanked right
they're going to say no but that's why I
use I'm trying to just kind of
politically say Grizz but to answer your
question on the first one the hub page
so if I go back to this yes these are
all the same ad unit IDs because what i
did is and i just show you so what i did
here is I have in my standard so I
litter I'm gonna have to add unit IDs
one right here
for my 250 and so these are all of my
the on the hub page 2 250 about 250 that
is throwing up is all the same ad unit
ID because I created a template for it
for so I can kind of replace the grid
template style too itemtemplate control
that you have by default so I can kind
of interchange them do a template
selector and then for the other one I
did the 500 by 1 30 and again it's the
same ad unit ID so only i'm only using
two ad unit IDs but my ad is showing up
in multiple places so you could do that
or i can get very complicated and say
well in this group I want this ad unit
ID and this when I want this ad unit ID
and stuff like that but I didn't see a
reason why just for this demo right and
for it so just to make it really easy
and simple i created the two classes so
you can see here the grid view data
template selector so this allow me to
rotate between the grid view the hub
between my advertising 250 template and
the standard 250 template that comes by
default with a great application and
then i created the second item view
template selector so when I went into
the items i created again the 500 by 1
30 and then i rotated between the
default one that you get with the grid
and so it was just made it easier for me
to just have those to add IDs associated
with it so that answer your question in
the back about having more than one ad
kind of as I Pam correct in the back
yeah as long as I'm not stack them so
what you can't do so to kind of address
both of them if I put an ad here and
then add here that's stacking them but
as you can see me I'm just kind of
panning and I got to add in group 3 I
didn't put one in group 2 but I can
easily go put 1 and group 2 but I kind
of try to give a spacing because again I
don't want to over advertise to my user
so if you know you're going to have 12
groups try to do group 1 group 3 you
know do the eyes or either due to even I
also do das because you want the first I
had to show up in Group 1 but you can
see I kind of did group 3 then I did
group for I did five and six
just kind of show you that you can kind
of change it up a little bit in other
words let's just say that those squares
for something that like a ball bounced
off cuz you have to to to to 250 x 20 to
50 squares no so that'll go back to if i
go back to the PowerPoint let it go back
to this slide rate like right here where
you can just say this is my game and I
got two ads even if i move the banner
way over here well what do you mean by
part of the game because their ass not
going to part of the game unless you go
have it on a shirt of a sum that gonna
be very creative and i would love to see
you do that because i've been trying and
white squares but you just happen but
you're so fast sometime no no you that's
me as a user i'll stop playing your game
right away i'll just be honest I mean
you to put it this way try it if you get
away with it more power to you I mean
seriously but what you got to think
about is is that something you want to
play with right I know we all here to
make money but let's be real let's be
realistic and let's try to be truthful
to our user base right we don't want to
manipulate our user base the last person
you want to offend is your user base
because when you think about a
restaurant it's the same thing in
applications if you go to a restaurant
and this bad is harboring the service
how you think restaurants survive word
of mouth reviews ratings people believe
in that so if you do things in your app
data users just going to really just be
annoyed with they're going to say it
they go see ratings they're gonna see
one star 1 star 1 star 2 star 1 star 1
star and that's going to stop your
download because the store itself is
promoting your app so you kind of got to
think about that so now I don't know
what your game look like but I'm just
trying to envision it so
for instance I would say my personal
opinion don't try to interact as into
your game unless we can come up i'll
give you a good example and well let me
hold that example any more questions let
me get to something else because I I do
want to have like a love of conversation
where we not record it so let me we did
that all right so we talked about pub
center so let me show you guys pub
center oh you know i'll show you guys
something real cool real quick mmm i
thought i had it on here maybe just sit
nope that's not it i'll come back to it
i can't i can't remember which app it
was in oh that is chicago tribune so let
me just show you how we think about
advertisement so this is I think this is
pretty cool so we we worked with the
check out chicago tribune to do this
advertisement so you can see here when i
scroll with a nap just notice how to
black background change so now i'm on
the fort so it's showing the leather up
top and then when I keep scrolling if
you keep scrolling it is just see how
the lights kind of glaring over the
leather and then when I keep scrolling
see the background changes to wear as
matching into the advertisement of fort
that's what we think of advertisement
right we think about experiences we we
think about how can we create something
that is very unique so then when I keep
going you can see how the green leaf
coming down advertisement on the four
dash the leaf right those are positive
experience we create that's a customer
experience that we worked with Ford and
Chicago Tribune on but you can see our
creative thinking of trying to make your
guys experience is great to make a user
have a recall and if I want to go back
in an app to try to find that
advertising experience right is it's
immersive is it engaging so that's what
we think about so when you say can I put
two on the thing just to kind of do it
you kind of got to think about how do I
keep my user engaged
and how do I keep them great and so
that's something we're working on and I
kind of share with you and not on online
I was going to open up a browser sorry
you guys got to keep me focused because
i think i can go off in multiple
different areas so let me just show you
pub center so you go to pub center you
can do one of two things you can sign in
with like your Microsoft account that's
what I chose to do because I'm just
harbor at trying to remember username
and passwords now because they're all
over the place so I'm just going to sign
in and when you get the pup center I
don't have this is like demo i have 0
money i'm not making any money you guys
need to go download my up I don't have
one no it's I will have something you
guys how to download but so when you go
to set up you see so for those who are
for me you can see I could do my Windows
Phone application and I could do the
windows 8 application and you can see
here I have two applications so i can
actually go say register an application
and so if i actually go in and register
application i can choose i'm going to
just call it up x fest we're going to
choose windows 8 and i'm gonna hit save
and you can see now i have my
application ID so you're going to need
to make a note of your application ID
this is really how easy it is right just
make a note of your application ID so
then if I go back and I go to add units
I can literally go to my Windows 8
applications I'm gonna say create an
application at unit ID and I can name it
we to me the best thing to do is kind of
come up with a naming convention so you
can kind of track your ad unit IDs to
kind of fit where you are in your
application so i always put the
reference of the size in my unit ID and
then i'm also thinking about my
placement so like in my example of the
app i had it on my hub screen i will say
you know like hub screen 3 250 x 250
blah blah blah something
that way you just kind of know and you
could track to see which one is giving
you the impression because you just
leave a generic name and say 250 about
250 you're gonna be like oh which one is
this you know so kind of make sure you
think but for now I'm just going to say
test ID that's kind of sad I said all
that then I go test I be right no and
then you just choose from one of your
sizes so all the sides we talked about
the 160 x 600 250 x 125 250 x 250 and
then just remind me to say something but
at a size it when we're not recording so
imma just choose 300 300 by 250 and so
here is where you can go and set your
tier 1 categories it doesn't allow you
to choose tier 2 maybe something in the
future so i could use education and
automatic shoes on education or i can go
and choose books and reference and its
use all of the books and reference by
default and then i just hit save right
the green ones oh that's that's a great
question uh oh oh yeah so yeah great I
don't think guys so it's off to tier 2
but I think eventually you're gonna be
able to like so then I just hit save and
then I get my ad unit ID and then you go
and put these in your apps you come back
and you see your report see how you're
doing and see your money so somebody
asks about I think it was you asked
about how you get the application ID
nagging an idea now do not use this and
development so it is so if that was my
actual app these are things for
production so we have test test codes
that I'll share with you i think i have
links in here that's where you go use
those test codes we have a long list and
you can use those and do the same thing
for testing and coding questions on pub
center hold on the gentleman behind you
in danger
killer 8 on the website so we only stats
yeah you you guess that I don't have any
because this is just demo but you get
all kinds of stats you can see stats and
metrics I actually been trying to get
them to populate with dummy stuff but
they won't do it yet so I'm still
fighting with that I'll come back to you
but I have him next oh yes I want to
talk to the activity in an application I
would eventually have one application ID
and and a couple of a gene IDs visit
correct correct so your application ID
is tied to that action application so
you're going to have one application ID
and you can have unlimited number ad
unit IDs it just depends on how you want
to do your app the multiple agile I need
I would have likely what one and you a
deeper dimension of the ACT is that or
for the same dimension I may have
multiple identities ok so the new just
make sure I understand what you're
saying so efficient is is that Wendy but
choosing get the achievement there we
just specified the dimension right
okay Evan only by any example we just
give me dimension yeah so and then we
had the ad unit ID so let me just make
sure I'm Estrada matata paraphrase and
if you caught something different help
me so what I'm hearing you saying so let
me just give you the flow first but
here's what I'm hearing you saying is
when I go create an ad unit ID I'm
creating the size and I'm choosing the
size right that size with that ad unit
ID once you create that size you name
that unity you choose your category
you'll get a ad unit ID right here and
this ad unit ID is going to be paired
with that application ID so let me just
make sure I'm with you so if i had like
i have three applications right in this
demo account if I took this ad unit ID
and with another application is not
going to work so I I got I'm just trying
to hope I'm trying to answer it too now
with this ad unit ID this ad unit ID is
tied to I think I chose 300 by 250 so
that's my size that's my category for
this ad unit ID for that application now
if I go create another ad unit ID for
this same application ID it's going to
be a different ad unit ID it could be
the same size or different size same
category different category for that
application my other fishing to that is
is that for the same dimension of the ad
well what are the kisses Ben I would
want to have two different as you like
these different categories different
categories different places in your app
from on front page back page I mean be
honest with you that's your choice but
what you want to do is be smart so okay
let's say everything in my app what is
on the first page second page third page
over here over here whatever all of the
sizes to everything for to make one of
my ass fit into the size everything is a
300 by 250 so all ad unit ID is that i'm
going to create is going to be 300 by
250 right
if your app is like a news app with
different categories like sports or what
else the news app have financed crime or
whatever you may want to have an ad
units for that section for this section
and for that section right and so you
would create a separate ad unit ID
although it's the same size you're going
to match that to a different category
and you're going to put that in
different placements within your app
oxygen why would i watch you can seem as
you dirty giving them attention in the
same I mean you can you can but do you
what you do is you I'll be honest with
you when you're on a freeway do if I
gave you a choice you get on the freeway
and I told you how to get somewhere in
30 minutes and if you get that 30
minutes you gonna make a million dollars
versus if you don't get there in 30
minutes and I say there's this one lane
freeway versus this 5 laying freeway
you're going to take the five lane
because you're going to be able to
maneuver traffic versus being stopped so
now think of that same concept with an
ad unit ID I got one ad unit ID I'm in
one category and I'm blasting this all
over my app versus now remember i told
you advertisers or doing things based on
campaign so we got the Final Four
happening now we got the NBA finals
starting we got baseball kicking off so
if your app had a spork session and you
chose one ad unit ID it was on education
the chances you get in great
advertisements is that that's why you
create different unit IDs in different
categories because you're going to be
trying to mirror your content with what
advertisers are going to buy so in the
sports section I'm a one sports and an
education session I made one education
and health and fitness I may want to
mirror what health and fitness that's
why determine what happened in one area
versus another they all share the same
ad unit ID when looked in the pub center
it would report that you had this many
impressions you wouldn't know
impressions from this page and how many
were on a different page if you curse
the same one ya know did you do not have
some extra cuz he got to happen to store
so before taking more questions when
backup the public yes alright cool so
let me just finish real fast the other
thing I'll tell you guys to think about
we already did this is we have this
reference so someone was asking how do I
know and how do I handle if I get no ad
so you'll be looking for like the code
one and then you just do on era do XY
and z or whatever and replace content
with this banner ad or static and how
sad or content like network connection
climb for configuration and steps like
that the other things we have is we have
lots of different methods so we talked
about the refresh there's also to
suspend and there's also like disposed
and things like that so this is all on
the site for you guys to check out I
suggest using this because they come in
handy in certain situations it all
depends on your application and how to
use a using application and then we also
have events so you saw that refresh in
JavaScript I don't think I showed you
error well yeah I did I did air handling
when I was doing at refresh I should
have showed that then you see is engaged
of the users engage in the ad and things
like that then you got properties which
we talked about the auto refresh is
enabled you talk about that unit ID
application ID is suspended longitude
and latitude we didn't talk about but
it's there and then just resources we
have a new site which I will show is
actually been redesigned which i think
is beautiful let's get out it is let's
do this here
and so that's the new site for those
guys who did phone and other stuff you
remember 20 red and white site yeah so
this is way better we got the content
laid out this is targeting only windows
8 go and people say well why did you
guys break out so we still working with
the phone team to try to do the same and
it gives you a great pretty much
everything I covered you can find a lot
of great information on here so like
some of the experiences and stuff like
that if you want to learn more is on
this site learning more about pup center
is on this site the ad unit sizes you
can see here all that's on the site to
captivate the ad experiences so
everything I was kind of showing you is
kind of publicly available so that's it
for public if you guys got any questions
on public we can go now other than that
will we have 15-20 minutes afterwards
offline possible we know the raw ginger
ages understanding
okay so let's go ahead and wrap up the
