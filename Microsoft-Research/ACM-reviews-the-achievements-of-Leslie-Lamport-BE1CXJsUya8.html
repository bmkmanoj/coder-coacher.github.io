in touring this name mentioned in the
same sentence that's very mind boggling
concept
just across the road from the Computer
History Museum in Mountain View
California stands the West Coast office
of Microsoft Research this is the
workplace of principal researcher Leslie
Lamport who has been named the 2013
recipient of the prestigious ACM am
turing award the main thing that that I
think Leslie did was he essentially a
invented or discovered the field of
distributed systems established in 1966
this pinnacle award celebrates the life
work of those who have advanced the art
of computer science in groundbreaking
ways often called the Nobel Prize of
computing the ACM am touring award
conveys a substantial cash endowment and
opens the door to even greater
prominence for its accomplished
recipients his work began over four
decades ago yet it remains central to
the way computers cooperate avoid errors
and reach consensus looking at
distributed systems and concurrent
systems the key player here is Leslie
Lamport one of lamport's great works
appeared in communications of the ACM in
August of 1974 when he introduced what
came to be known as the bakery algorithm
another notable moment arrived in July
of 1978 with a paper in communications
of the ACM that defined time based on
causality rather than physical clocks
it's one of the literature's most cited
papers most of my important stuff has
been in ACM publications but that's
because ACM has published the most
important journals in the areas that
I've been working in perhaps his most
famous work was the introduction of the
paxos algorithm in ACM transactions on
computer systems in may of nineteen
ninety eight it describes a way to
guarantee the safety of messages passed
among multiple players even when some of
those players are unreliable paxos
wasn't well understood when it first
appeared under the title the part-time
parliament but as it gained currency
Lamport spun out numerous variations to
cover a wide variety of circumstances
and implementations well Leslie has
really I think it's fair to say laid the
foundations of distributor and
fault-tolerant computing and nowadays
when we have machines with dozens of
cores and and data centers with hundreds
of thousands of computers in them this
is just the way computing is done
and Leslie showed us how to do it
reliably as a side project Lamport
created lay tech now is standard in
layout and typesetting wherever
mathematical formulas appear underlying
all of dr. lamport's work is an
insistence on specifications using math
logic and proved ability to create
reliable systems to serve this goal he
created the temporal logic of actions
and the language TLA plus now a standard
part of the system designers toolbox my
idea basically is that the best language
that mankind has developed for stating
things clearly and precisely is
mathematics and so the best way to write
a specification is using mathematics
amazingly enough this is a controversial
idea lamport's ideas often shook his
colleagues thinking but his insistence
on rigor and prove ability won out in
the end although had failed to somehow
former grand theory what I had done
through my wanderings is to create a
path and
a lot of people who followed that path
and then taking it much further than
than I ever went a lot of people who are
a lot smarter than I am but I did went
in my wanderings create this path that a
number of people have followed so that
is something to be proud of the
Association for Computing Machinery
sincerely thanks Leslie Lamport for all
he's done and congratulate him on being
the 2013 recipient of the ACM am turing
award we're pleased to feature his life
and work in a jun 2014 issue of
communications of the ACM a banquet in
San Francisco celebrates him along with
recipients of this year's other ACM
awards
