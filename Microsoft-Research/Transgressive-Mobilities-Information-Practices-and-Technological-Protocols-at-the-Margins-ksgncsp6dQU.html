good morning everybody and thank you for
joining us today we have Jessa lingle
from Rutgers University who's going to
talk about transgressive Mobility's
ladies and gentlemen Jessel Engel thank
you and takes much for inviting me and
really excited to share my work with you
it today and I want to start off by
making the claim that whether we're
talking about a design standpoint or an
end user standpoint or more of a
conceptual standpoint and it's really
important not to a centralized
technology and because generalizations
about technology like glossing over
differences in how people use technology
or not recognizing the ideology embedded
and technological production and can
lead us to make some really know in
terms of how people might be using it if
you want to design a technology that can
serve a wide group of people if you want
to make technology in an ethically
responsible way or from a critical
theory perspective from critical theory
perspective differences in how people
use reading and how people talk about
technology you can appoint point us to
important differences of things like
power and privilege and legitimacy so
for example one way to behalf of talking
about things like information and
equality is this free as the digital
divide and at the term that has a lot of
popular attraction but it can be really
problematic because it sets up this
binary between people who do and do not
have housing that have not and it sort
of implies that the problem is just
access to technology rather than things
like maybe fluency in technology so
rather than identifying who is using
technology or the barriers and few
people getting to access or to use
technology I'm more interested in
questions of why some groups of people
use technology and radically different
ways than others and what those
differences tell us about underlying
cultural logics that give rise to these
differences of power and privilege
so in dealing with these questions i
bring to theoretical backgrounds to bear
so the first is a background in critical
theory and more specifically in gender
studies and literary theory and this is
a background that is really basically
given me the tools to engage questions
of power dynamics an ideology embedded
into everyday life that's one
disciplinary background on the other
background and I have both a
professional and an academic background
a library and information science and
that shapes my interest in applying
those theoretical tools to phenomenon of
information practices and technological
use if you're curious this is Michel de
certeau will be talking about him a
little bit later this is sr ranganath on
one of my favorite librarians of all
times if you don't get the inside joke
he created this system for he created
the five laws of library science which I
will just tell you right now our books
are for you every reader it's book every
book it's reader they have the time of
the reader and the library is a growing
organism so the five laws and he created
a faceted system which we actually use
all the time but we don't call it that
so that's a colon oh that's my very
nerdy inside joke of posse people no um
it is not an organ it is a system of
punctuation as far as I know somehow
that's escaped a lot of the library
literature that comes down to us as
professionals I don't know why I can
talk about a third room renganathan all
day but um I'll bow saw instead talk
about so these things right the critical
theory background in the library theory
background the tools for asking
questions and then asking those
questions with certain things like
technology and information so more
specifically I bring these backgrounds
together and ask questions like what
technologies emerge to meet the needs of
some groups over others how and why are
some information practices technological
protocols legitimized over others and
what possibilities are there for
resistance reappropriation and
and when I tackle these questions I tend
to do it from the level of community or
shared subject positions so for example
I study communities of practice so how
to dj's organize their music and
communities of practice like software
engineers and the extent to which they
perceived their work as craft that was a
project I did this past summer with Tim
Regan at the other Cambridge Microsoft
loud and and YouTube users people could
take videos at concerts and post them on
YouTube so these are communities bound
together by technological practice
mm-hmm ye olde as Tim Regan sent me an
email saying like come be my intern at
MSR cambridge ii olds not Massachusetts
I was like you goofball and he's great
communities found in place so I studied
the punk rock music scene in New
Brunswick New Jersey um and also the
research i'll be sharing with you today
transnational migrants in New York and
communities of alterra T so I did a
project on information health
information seeking of homeless women in
San Francisco and also the project I did
here is a summer intern and how do you
keep secrets online in the extreme body
modification community I just want to
point out and that despite the fact that
it's on this neat table the lines
between place and altera t and placement
practice or by no means hard and fast
right so you're studying the new
brunswick music scene it's important to
understand that there's a relationship
of geography that new brunswick is
halfway between Philadelphia and New
York and that shapes the music scene
there but it's also a community of
alterra T in some ways and that the
music scene wouldn't be the information
practices have to be contextual as in a
punk DIY ethic so there's there's no
hard and fast lines between alterity
place in practice so the research i'm
going to talk about today is about the
experiences of transnational migrants
and becoming familiar with city space
and in a lot of ways this screw out out
of a frustration with how we tend to
talk about technology and mobility so
unpopular discourses of technology the
progress narrative dominates and what i
mean by this is a narrative in which
technology is helping us send
information faster and maintain
you know intimate ties that we often say
collapse geographic distance so take
this picture for example it might look
like an ad for a mac laptops but it's in
fact from this summer and those are my
two sisters and that's me in the laptop
I mean we're skyping me in I was in a
hostel in zadar croatia and then we were
skyping in for my now sister-in-law's
bridal shower now the power of icts
information communication technology use
the power of ICT is like skype in this
moment were undeniable at that afternoon
my sister hadn't heard my voice in about
three months and she hadn't seen my face
in real time in about six months and my
head first popped onto the laptop she
burst into tears um and I was very
grateful to skype in that moment because
I could participate in this event with
my family in a real-time intimate way
that I probably wouldn't have been able
to without skype but those are another
way of looking at this story i'm far
from the first person to point out that
in HCI we often study events that are a
lot like this one a bunch of highly
educated white middle-class women who by
the way are celebrating a straight white
Christian marriage by buying presents
that celebrate feminine domesticity I
dare you to come up with a more succinct
image of hegemonies and like this image
contextualise right so what other
stories can we tell of transnational
communication you know what stories can
we talk about that are more about
ruptures and connectivity stories that
we can tell that are more about a play
and improvisation rather than efficiency
and business so this brings me to my
dissertation work which is called
information tactics and urban spaces
portraits of transnational migration and
the key questions that I had going into
this project were how do you
translational migrants make sense of new
urban environments what are the spatial
temporal and social dimensions of
information practices and technological
practices among transnational migrants
in new urban space now I use the term
transnational migrants for a couple
reasons a number one it helps me
sidestep some of the political charge
around the term immigrants and number
two it's sort of
opens up a less stereotypical notion of
what immigrant usually calls to mind
right so the people in my project you
know some of them there was Midori from
Japan who had a really great post doc at
NYU and then there was Julio from the
Dominican Republic who had been
unemployed the entire time he'd been in
New York so had people with great jobs
people with no jobs people were in the
country legally and illegally and people
who had been to New York before people
would never been there before that was
their first time and people who were
there for the long haul and people who
were just going to be in New York for a
few months as an overarching theory for
my research I used stacer chose work on
tactics strategies and everyday
negotiations of urban life so in the
practice of everyday life which is his
you know big book from 1984 district Oh
describe the city as a source of tension
where individuals are you know
struggling to exert their own agency and
well against the dominating force of
institutional infrastructure so district
to identify I meant that temps to
maintain individual agency as tactics
and the pressure of institutions as
strategies so I like to think of this as
a politics of the interstitial so if you
imagine you know strategies as the
lattices and networks of things like
crystals and adams tactics are the
things that are going on in those spaces
between so they're supposed to be improv
improvisational playful time-saving the
maneuvers that help you get through
institutional lattices as a
methodological framework i use garfinkel
snow shown of FMF addala g at the
methodology typically revolves around
repeated qualitative interviews where
you're sort of trying to understand how
people make sense of everyday lives so
I'm again from an human information
behavior perspective the methodology is
really appealing because it sort of
talks about identifying patterns and
organizational structures for making
sense of everyday life we're not going
to talk too much about effing
methodology but I'm happy to come back
to it in the Q&amp;amp;A so how did I get this
done um I'm use to New York about nine
years ago and I started volunteering
and teaching english as a second
language or ESL about six years ago long
before i started my PhD work so I tapped
those networks in order to find five
different recruitment sites throughout
New York and Newark so one was in Newark
New Jersey another was in Manhattan the
other three were at public libraries in
brooklyn and queens so between September
2011 and may 2012 I spent about two
hundred hours volunteering teaching
English as a Second Language having
one-on-one conversation partners leading
book groups I taught classes on
preparing for one citizenship test so I
kept all my subway cards in New Jersey
Transit cards that I racked up during a
period of time but mostly I just meant a
lot of time on my bike which
incidentally I'm microsoft bought for me
when I was an intern here thanks
Microsoft so as a result of all those
hours volunteering at all those research
sites i wound up with 18 different
participants monitor from 17 countries
and they live in 17 neighborhoods in New
York I deliberately thought a very
heterogeneous population I wanted people
from a large number of countries in a
large number of places in the city and
so that I could talk about what
practices emerged across those groups of
people one thing that they shared was an
experience of newness in New York so I
screen participants for people who had
been in the city for less than two years
um yes each country ogp Japan yes and
the average length of time that people
had been in New York was 11 months I do
have people from all five continents no
one from Antarctica but if you know
anyone there's still a little bit of
time for me to add them to do this
project not much I'm defending on the
21st but uh
excuse me oh no gee japanese word i
didn't no one within 10 one wasn't for
green and the other one was in midtown
yeah so i use three different
qualitative research tools to do this
work so conversational interviews which
are also called unstructured interviews
they use an interview themes more than
the specific interview questions and i'm
happy to talk more about with those
teams were at the end and when I could I
interviewed people repeatedly over the
course of 6 to 12 month I ask you
something called participatory maps
sometimes called cognitive cognitive max
we asked people to draw you on that with
something in my case of their
neighborhoods and I coined the phrase
participatory wandering or first asking
people to let me walk with them through
their neighborhoods so here are two of
the maps that were drawn and I gave
people blank pieces of paper and colored
pencils an awesome shirt on maps this is
Jersey City and this is midtown
Manhattan um I like those to match
because I think they look a little bit
alike even though they're of technically
different states and i'll be bringing
some other maps in as we go along also
um you know participatory wandering is
actually something that it's fairly
common in documentary film right this
idea of asking someone to show you
around our neighborhood and tell stories
about it but for whatever reason we
don't seem to use it as much in social
science so these blue lines are roots
that where people took me um with them
various things like I'm a grocery
shopping in Chinatown with when I
participant I went to a flea market I
was biking in bushwick on occasion it
would also go without the participants
now I'm trying to use the maps that they
had given me as a guide for one rang
through city space and those are the
pink lines um and then the blue push
pins are for out of my five research
sites there's a fifth one in New York go
to sort of threw off the perspective of
the map so I organized by finding around
three different dimensions of
information practices I'm going to go
very quickly over temporal dimensions
talk a little bit about social
dimensions and it's been most of my time
on spatial dimensions and information
practices so in the chat
on temporal dimensions you know because
I had interviewed people often over the
course of several months and then again
by this time I had interviewed people I
often knew who they were anyway because
I'd spent all this time at interview at
the recruitment site so a lot of times
by the time I sat down with people
already knew how long they had been here
in a little bit about their lives so I
was able to sort of have this much more
longitudinal perspective of people's
lives in New York so I really tried to
focus on that in the section on time in
order to see how perceptions of City
space change over time so in this
chapter i use Bergson has this really
beautiful definition of Henry Berg
Sonja's a philosopher and you died
drowned world war two and he has this
really beautiful definition of habit
something that organizes your spatial
surroundings and so i tried to use that
to think about practices that emerged in
two instances the first one you know you
have a moment of lostness and then how
do you develop practices to avoid
moments of losses in the future and the
second perhaps a little more
conceptually I talked about and the
determination among many of my
participants to avoid looking like a
tourist and in both of those cases I'm
really interested in how people use
technology and the chapter on social
dimensions of information practices I
look specifically at the use of social
network sites and I contrast the use of
Facebook which was by far the most
popular social network site among my
participants with meet up in order to
identify different affordances as well
as obstacles of social network sites
among transnational migrants so again it
was really interested in the fact that a
lot of times when we talk about icts and
transnationalism the rhetoric is about
the affordances of technology in terms
of keeping in touch and maintaining ties
but there are also ways in which
technology makes our lives much more
complicated so take for example the
issue of language and 417 on my 18
participants english is not their first
language i had one participant from
australia so sure she had a slightly
different case but for everybody else
there was the option of posting in at
least two and sometimes more languages
now in a way this is a real affordance
right so I was thinking of
Tina analysis work on how teens will
sometimes use inside jokes or cultural
references in order to guide messages
they send to a certain part of their
social network like teens versus you
know their parents you can sort of do
that with language right because
Facebook doesn't necessarily allow you
to control the dissemination of your
content across all your social networks
so for example Laura she's from Brazil
you know she talks about I'm posting in
Portuguese versus English and she liked
posting in English because it helps her
practice her english but she'll post in
Portuguese if it's something that's just
about our family so there's that same
sort of sense of directing messages but
of course directing the message that way
is still documenting a signal to the
rest of your network that they're
excluded and I use do dishonest work on
signal theory and in this chapter a lot
where she talks about you know
interactions online as signaling things
to your social network a signal of care
signal of effect so Laura talks about
the tension of on the one hand wanting
to use language as a means of directing
her content to one group versus another
but at the same time the cost of doing
that in terms of part of her social
network feeling excluded other sources
of tension emerged so for example some
participants talked about the fatigue of
being expected to share information with
their social networks abroad social
media itself in the way that it's
structured tends to encourage sharing
but for a number of reasons and
transnational migrants might not want to
share their New York lives with family
elsewhere oh dear sorry we were went
ahead later on in this quote has sent us
says I would really love to use Facebook
and Twitter serenely in the future but
for right now it's I feel like I can't
so she talked about how she basically
stopped using these sites because she
felt like she was living too much in
Mexico she's from Mexico City and I
thought that that was so interesting
because a lot of times when we talk
about social media use and
transnationalism we talk about the ease
of maintaining ties and the facility of
maintaining a sense of intimacy but
that's not how hasn't experienced is it
she experiences that as obligation she
experiences it as a source of tension
and she does not experience it as
anything like serenity so my favorite
example was from rob it's also the most
extreme example he moved from Puerto
Rico to New York and promptly deleted
all of his verdict and friends from his
facebook network this is the exact
opposite of how we usually think of
transnational use of things like
Facebook we think of it as Facebook is
so great because it allows us to
maintain ties with our friends and
family abroad and here rob was saying no
I wanted to start over I wanted a new
life and that meant you no deleting my
friends from Facebook and eventually
your friends grow and you have this you
know a documentation of your life on
your social media site I thought that
was interesting too because um you know
a lot of the initial concern over social
network sites is that people were going
to be finding strangers online and oh
gosh what do we do and then it turned
out that people weren't finding
strangers they were really connecting
with people they already knew this is an
incredible literal ization of that right
it's a literal ization of your social
network online looks exactly like it
does in real life real life is now in
New York and that's what my social
network is going to reflect so I want to
spend a little bit more time talking
about spatial dimensions of information
practices did people sometimes try to
create two identities well the problem
with that is i mean not really why
facebook doesn't want you to do it and
then the other thing is a facebook sort
of takes on this new life so a lot of
people talked about wayne and again this
is tough because it varies so much from
person to person but and people will
talk about I didn't use Facebook as much
until I moved here and then suddenly you
know I realized that it was important to
people here and so I had to check into
that and I think part of that is a new
york thing um and i think part of that
is maybe a us thing so it's hard to say
and there was a little bit more of you
know what really conforms to the norm of
transnational use of ICT in skype people
use skype to maintain ties with people
abroad and they do not use it to you
know chat with people that they met at
the bar or you know whatever so that's
the one that really maps pretty closely
but i didn't find that same
hang on social media sites of image so
when I talk about space I'm using a
specific conceptualization of space that
emphasizes the importance of
interactions so i'm using cultural
geographers like Doreen Massey David
Harvey every soja and particularly
Henley Lefevre and when these theorists
I mean to have their divergencies I just
listed them in the group as if they all
agree all the time which they don't but
the important thing for me is that space
is active and it requires social
interaction a lot of times when we talk
about the use of technology in space we
talked about it in you know sort of a
lot of the HCI human-computer
interaction literature talks about we're
going to design this thing and then
we're going to deploy it in urban space
and just see what happens and hopefully
you know a lot of times there's really
civic engagement in mind you know like
we want to foster dialogue I'm about to
create an exaggerated caricature but
it's actually not that far off if you
read a lot of this literature it really
reminds me of those like Hollywood sets
of like a western town where it's like
those two dimensional like here's the
saloon and here's the whatever and that
space right it's inert and it's static
and it's two-dimensional and we don't
think very much about the fact that
space is actually very fluid and it's
very and it changes over time and it's
very much constructed by the social
practices that go on there so that's my
theater a theoretical construction of
space and sort of its intended to be
very aware of social interaction and
very aware of changes over time so I
identified two practices for navigating
space space that sort of go along with
this conceptualization mille in hand i'm
going to talk about wandering as a means
of learning about space and
neighborhoods means of talking about
space so i defined wandering as a form
of acquiring information about
neighborhoods completely outside of
formal information resources and it uses
informal unstructured walks to acquire a
kind of personal fluency in your
neighborhood wandering is undirected but
a very deliberate engagement with city
space the authentic on that wandering is
incorporated into daily routine
so hang on how well you know Manhattan
and I mean I could draw it for you so
Manhattan is like this right and here's
midtown right here and here's so talk
about Midori so she you know she lived
in midtown and she was going to her
office in east village now Broadway goes
like this so I asked her about you know
how she got to work and she said well I
always walk and I take Broadway because
it's the shortest way she's right but
when she's commuting she often just to
break up the monotony of the routine she
will sort of like take a little sides
route every now and then you know like
this would be like one day this would be
the next day just to break up her
commute and when she talked about that
she said it was an important means of
learning about her neighborhood you know
she would take these little side roots
in order to find things nass Pacific
thing she talked about finding
restaurants grocery stores that way
incidentally this absolutely backs up
Jane Jacobs work the death and life of
great American cities where she argues
for shorts tvblox because it would
facilitate wandering she doesn't call it
that but that's her argument that's just
totally borne out and I work another
example Ishmael who was a devout Muslim
he would talk about you know these
various places said he had to be
throughout the day so his know he was
unemployed but he would talk about where
he lived and then he would talk about
where he volunteered and he would talk
about you know where he did his ESL
learning and I'm spiraling out from
those places on his free time in order
to find mosques where if you know there
were calls for prayers at those times he
would go find them so here's his map of
the Bronx I know it's not the best might
be hard for you to see so he lived in
the Bronx and he actually pointed out
not one not two but three different
mosques in his neighborhood that's where
the arrows are pointing out when I asked
him how he chose to go to one mosque
versus another he would say oh depends
on the time of day depends on whether or
not I feel like being social but his map
sort of reflects this practice of
wandering in order to find in his case
something that he needed you needed a
working knowledge of where these things
were throughout the day in order to
comply with his religion wandering is
also a practice at scales so someone
like Midori I mentioned earlier
wandering was mostly about finding out
things in her neighborhood and she was
very nervous about leaving Manhattan and
she didn't even like going to certain
neighborhoods that she felt were unsafe
like Harlem
and you can trust that to someone like
Jorge who lived in the upper west side
and he had this amazing quote elsewhere
about it's impossible to find
information about my neighborhood on the
internet I have to walk around in order
to find information which I thought was
this amazing rejection of a very
technologically sophisticated practice
for something that is much more
rudimentary arguably the most the least
technological practice of just walking
but for Jorge mälaren area is important
about finding out about the upper west
side but he says I hate people who live
in the upper west side and they say oh
and not going to Queens i'm not going to
Brooklyn this is so so awful I mean
you're losing things it's like saying I
don't read books it's the same and I
thought that was such a great quote um
so for him wandering isn't just about
the neighborhood it's about the city as
a whole obviously the stuff opens up a
whole thing about the city is library
which is just like incredibly appealing
to me about we'll set that aside for the
moment so as an information practice i'm
interested in contrasting wandering to
the use of online maps so of course
there's no hard and fast line between
wandering as an non-technological
practice and online maps is apparently
technological practice lots of people
use technology when they wander they
might use guidebooks they might use
their i pause they might use smartphone
but their motivations for using these
technologies are different than when you
are just using an online map so a lot of
my participants would talk about
wandering is something that opened them
up to social interaction and is the deep
engagement with their surroundings
whereas use of online maps was
frequently characterized as i was
looking something up on my phone and
then somehow I got where I was supposed
to be and I have no idea how I got there
and if you ask me to recreate that walk
right now I couldn't tell you anything
that happened I think they sort of
intuitively experienced this a lot
ourselves when we use maps but it was
nice to have like grounded data that
suggested the same thing but it also
opens up a difference between these two
things as information and practices
where there's essentially a trade-off in
short-term convenient so finding a route
efficiently with a long-term
disengagement from city space
so also interested in tracking different
means of talking about space so
participants referenced a number of
tactics for making sense of city space
so in terms of the industry that might
be there or in terms of the architecture
or in terms of race who lives in those
neighborhoods but I was particularly
interested in two different tactics of
talking about neighborhoods and wanted
to talk about the social norms for a
particular space so here is the cinta
she works in midtown and she made this
casual reference when we were talking to
midtown rules I said midtown rule was
what are those she says omentum rules
are very clear you know what time
everything is gonna be closed you know
that on weekends no one will be here you
know that everyone's in a hurry that
everything's a grid you know Grand
Central and she went on to say she got
very thoughtful and she said you know
the thing is in terms of knowing where
to go in midtown mid Tom makes total
sense to me but in terms of interaction
I don't get it i'm from mexico city
mexico city is not orderly it's chaotic
so I love spaces like Chinatown I love
spaces like the village those make more
sense to me in terms of the way I'm
going to act there even if I don't
understand where I'm going in that space
I think that really sort of opens up a
question of how space is how our maps of
urban space would look if we were more
interested in the social practices that
go on there feeling familiar rather than
architecture the infrastructure feeling
familiar also that definitely points
back to someone like Lefevre who talked
about space is socially constructed
another means of talking about space
that really interested in me came from
Jorge who's talking about rejecting of
norms of how we draw boundaries around
space at Lisa's you know parts of Bush
book they're not really Bushwick I like
my neighborhood in the upper west side
between you know this 20 blocks span but
outside of that I really don't like it
it sort of rattles off this list of
neighborhood said he does or doesn't
agree with their you know general
reputation and when I read into that is
an assertion of tactical neighborhoods
versus strategic neighborhood he is
coming up with his own means of talking
about city space that may or may not
conform with the strategic means of
talking about city space it really
actually reminded me of this project by
a chisel and Cohen
so they created this API where you can
populate a mat based on craigslist
wanted I mean craigslist ads for
apartments what you see here is a dot
corresponding to the color of what the
someone says the neighborhood is versus
where it actually is in space so you can
sort of see I mean I don't know how
familiar with San Francisco but no one
wants to no one wants to sell an
apartment that's in the Tenderloin right
because that's where a drug use and
prostitution is historically gone so no
one calls it the tenderloin I won't
people only call it the civic center
right so there is this question of how
do you create maps of space that reflect
the both the social norms that go on
there but the idea that you might assert
your own neighborhood boundary for a
number of reasons it's actually what
someone like Arjuna padre would call the
production of new cartography so I'm
thinking about these information
practices in terms of their implications
for theory and design I link wandering
to a larger resistance to progress and
efficiency narratives and technology so
lately we've seen sort of a resurgence
and interest of other metrics for
evaluating technology you can think of
slow food there's actually a book called
slow reading over short it's like a
hundred pages because I'm a librarian
I'll give you here's the last name and
it's at a liquid press the advantage of
having librarian around the fair uh go
read it um so there's this interest in
slow narrative right a slow near slower
narratives of Technology and oh there's
another thing going on at the other
Cambridge lab an interest in slow search
right like what would our use of the
internet look like a food we're
interested in slower search rather than
faster search so I link wandering to the
same interest in slowness and where
we're talking about information
practices that are measured in terms of
depth and personal engagement not to
mention pleasure I think the pleasure of
wandering if actual
part of the problem where when we think
about city space we're wandering where
where we make room for pleasure I mean
we're think the city space in terms of
wandering its phases of pleasure or
spaces of leisure like public parks you
know like that's where we expect to
wander but how would city space be
different if we took seriously the
affordances of wandering as a practice
of slowness imagine a world where we
didn't have online maps that were just
about public transportation mode and
walking mode and biking mode why
couldn't we have a wandering mode what
would that look like and what would it
get us in terms of urban policy a lot of
the policy is an emerging in Space and
Technology our initiatives that have a
lot to do with speed and progress so I'm
thinking here of the pushed at Foley
wireless cities or to have you know
information sands and strategic I use
that word deliberate leave places to
update citizens of information but a lot
of my research points to the need to
foster technological forms of play that
can encourage social interaction between
people and space I think we're already
seeing some of that emerge when it comes
to thing like flash mobs or even
geocaching right people's engagement
with space in terms of technology but
I'm not sure how much these games
actually foster social interaction I
think it's a lot more about the spatial
interaction is there but what about the
social dynamic what about the social
element and moreover I think might a lot
of times we focus too much on really
sophisticated technologies that we're a
broader definition of technological
engagement would service really well I
don't have that much time to talk about
future directions of my work but I did
want to point to a couple projects that
I'm in the very early stages of
conceptualizing or researching so in my
dissertation it was really struck by the
extent to which online maps are deployed
across a range of everyday interactions
as well as a spectrum of technologies so
not analysis I argue that even if maps
are highly personalized and that they
accompany us on a range of personal
technologies they don't necessarily lead
to a very personalized engagement with
city space but you really sort of press
that tension a little bit more I want to
study two groups of people for whom
knowledge of urban spaces both
professionally and personally important
those groups of people are bike
messengers and ambulance drivers this is
actually a picture of my friend
Christian biking um with mess collective
which is a collective of bike messengers
so in this project that i'm imagining i
want to combine ethnographic interviews
with participant observation looking to
identify the technical as well as the
social affordances of online maps in
moving through urban environments so the
questions that i have are sort of like
what are the cartographic practices that
emerge when you have to find your way
through city space what are the axis
spatial translation as you move from an
abstract online map to a digital to a
grounded reality of the street how are
these tactics communicated to others and
from a theoretical standpoint sort of
complicated by those tactics being
subsumed into institutional strategies
and then what possibilities are there
for spatial what i would call spatial
articulations of resistance and whether
that's just deciding that you're not
going to take the prescribed route
whether that's assign your roi to break
traffic laws and go a different way
whether that's deciding are going to
hide from your co-workers and the how
routes you have for getting from place
to place I think those are all really
interesting questions and as far as
using technology to navigate city space
the other and project that I want to
return to is an investigation of online
subcultures and I'm really interested in
how individuals manage norms of care in
online worlds as a counter public so
partly this would involve going back to
the body modification community because
questions of self-care are so evident
right i mean there's literally questions
about like how do i care for this
modification but also bringing in other
online and subcultures to sort of have a
broader discussion about how the
technical structures of a site such as
managing insiders and outsiders and
privacy and self disclosure affect the
social norms of care so when members of
the community share interests that are
stigmatized by the mainstream how are
the ethics of online
should define and enforced both socially
and technologically so as a whole what
happens with these projects is that I
use technology as a focal point partly
because I want to contribute to
designing better technology when I say
better I don't actually mean faster I
being better than that it encourages
social interaction and also that maybe
it's more ethically or more ethically
designed more informed in terms of
different possibilities for using it but
I'm really awesome on the one hand i'm
actually interested in these questions
of technological design but i'm also
interested in the technologies that
emerged as an opening up for asking
other questions of power and privilege
so I think I'll stop there thank you
guys so much for coming and for your
attention and I'm really looking forward
to your feet cake people thank you so
much Jessa I am I want to take you're on
vacation seriously permitted about how
we might reconstruction eyes maps as a
space for laundering and to actually
press you on what you commented on at
the end that you were interested in
contributing to the design of it let's
say for example we were thinking about
rolling out and
okay this kind of research to
reconceptualize what maps could do how
would you advise to designers that they
think through the kinds of richness that
you found through this wandering mode so
first thing would be we need to stop
thinking of mapping as a means of
getting from point A to point B so the
efficiency of you know here's your entry
point here is your exit point and those
being the stopping and starting so I'm
not I'm interested in taking away that
ethic and it's that I'm interested in
saying how would we map the route
between these spaces in a way that
maximizes engagement with your
surroundings and social interactions so
two things that I can think of number
one would be um there's this great to
lose quote a dilution coterie quote
about Max's malleable as changeable as
things that you you break apart and put
back together so I would literal as that
um and have the roots of mapping being
something that you could make
collectively something that you could
alter something that you could add
stories to something that you could add
pictures to and I think we have some of
those things in mind but it's often
about and so when you upload a google
map and you drill down it actually
allows you to tag like photos and it
allows you to see wiki posts and
whatever and that's great um but what
would it be like if you could just like
move those photos around and say that's
not photo isn't here anymore that photo
is of somewhere else you know the sort
of idea of configuring things and
allowing for updating things and the
thing that you lose there is a sense of
someone else's deep attachment to space
but you're opening it up to a more
collective knowledge and sort of a more
a sense of configurability rather than
that sense of stasis and so I would do
that the other thing was really
important to me is from a privacy
perspective and what concerns me about
practices of mapping is these questions
as I'm uncomfortable with people knowing
where I'm going all the time and so I
would want anything that took seriously
this practice of mapping to be very
cognizant of privacy and I think part
will you get out of this willingness to
play with roots is
it's no longer an accurate record of how
you got from point A to point B it's a
record of something else so those are
two of the things that come to mind
right away a documentation of everyday
life opening things up so that people
could configure it and then also being
very cognizant of privacy just one full
of you mentioned maximizing social
interaction how would you think about it
introverts ah that's a good question I
think um I think lots of people have
interpreted the city's all the time so
actually I was thinking as I was walking
over here um both when I was here for
the summer and when I was in the other
Cambridge for the summer when I was here
for the summer because I already knew I
was going to be doing this project I
kept a list of every time I had to use a
map until you find out where I was and I
didn't allow myself to use google maps
right so I had this life very
introverted and I was sort of humiliated
by my own um like what do you do and you
can't use google maps to get around and
I would get lost all times all these
things and when I was in Cambridge last
summer um I said I'm going to draw a map
every day of getting from point A to
point B but it had to be a different map
and I also didn't allow myself used
street names so I was really interested
in okay by then I'd already done the
research for this and I was really
frustrated that so many of the maps it
relied on street names and didn't show
landmarks and so I was determined to
force myself to feel and more so all
this is way of saying I'm very aware of
introverted map so you know because
these maps of privacy and these maps of
lostness so I think one thing would be
to open up again a space where maps are
I think a lot would have change if we
got rid of the ethic of maps being from
route finding and then ethics of math
instead being those storytelling and I
think that people have these introverted
maps all the time and it would just be a
wave and making it possible for you to
people to share them perhaps by getting
rid of that ethic of but that's not the
fastest route there Manthey thinking
about those alternate role playing games
that try to do this right like just this
morning people were tweeting about using
ingress which where your it's like a spy
reality game it has a bunch of these
where they're interactive and their
online and really designed to force you
to wander cities and unexpected ways on
your answer missions that you never
would have come up if you were looking
at google maps to five highlights of the
city do you have any thoughts about
those games yes I do um so one of the
things that I do in my conclusion is I
try and talk about and like out the
dissertation I try and come up with like
a checklist for games that would meet my
criteria is social spatial play because
I think we are seeing a lot of these
games a lot um increasingly and what's
so interesting about them as people will
talk about I I'm you know in this
neighborhood all the time and they don't
say it but you also know that they're
using the same technology all the time
so they look the exact name to a lot of
if you were just walking by a nothing to
be like those a dude standing with a
smartphone on this street corner and it
looks like he's going to work these is
very different experience of the space
around him because he there's the
artifice of this game my only thing
about the games is that again a lot of
them don't actually encourage social
interaction between strangers they
encourage social interview like is a
game you play with your friends right so
sort of though about geocaching so a lot
of times this games you play
individually or with your friends and
then I'd like to see that beam or
something that opens up interactions
with other people so that's why I'm
thinking about those games in terms of
like how can we get strangers involves
but I asked to thank you no I'm not a
game designers I'm probably not gonna
and I think a lot of games were exciting
and the one other thing that I would say
is a lot of these games are taking place
in urban space but I'm really interested
in games that we could plan the suburbs
or games that we could play on rural
spaces and because I've lived in rural
spaces and they have a very different
set of storytelling practices around
space a lot of times you know that
actually tends to be much more temporal
I was so my mind was blown when I moved
and this isn't it sound like a
caricature but it happened uh I was
asking how to get somewhere and someone
was like oh you just turn right at the
house with a with a white picket fence
oh wait the fence is gone but it used to
be there so just turn it on with leha
doesn't make sense to me at all and but
it makes a lot of sense in terms of
a temporal familiarity with space and so
sort of like tapping into those networks
of like how to space change over time
and that like a longitudinal familiarity
rather than a spatial familiarity Dana
with mapping tool in part because it's
designed to try to get you the
individual user to train its data to
know more about things with an idea of
optimizing for traffic flows in places
that Google Maps does not pay attention
to us and Israeli this object what's
interesting about it as a complement to
what you're talking about is that there
are three different relevant actors
trying to shape the dynamics of that map
on one hand you have the designers
constantly trying to convince you to do
things that will give it more data so it
puts up pac-man things all over on the
cities that you can try to encourage you
to go certain places in many ways to
wander according to you in order to give
it data right and in addition it invites
you to put your your own information on
there for other users so namely you've
got them to very important I conjugate
but you can put police officer or you
can put car wash right which are both
meant to be signals both against the
system but also to the other you the
reason I think it's interesting push
back to some of what you're talking
about is how do you deal with this
moment where you have three very
different actor groups trying to design
the system and to design behavior and
try and move both individual behavior
and the collective behavior for all of
these different purposes it has a part
of what i'm trying to matter this is
that is pushing you away from the idea
of the design of the system as a static
process but to try to think about that
design as an interactive dance the
different constituencies that are engage
with it and i'm curious how you would
think about that version of the side as
opposed to the idea of designing in a
very HCI here have to go yeah I mean I
certainly like to think of myself as
more on the ladder camp in the former
camp and that's certainly we're more
comfortable it's always like a shock to
me and I'm like oh I have implications
for design that's that's unfamiliar um
and then I've you know tried either the
most responsible
I can and but for one thing I mean just
as an activist right and are my own
experiences of being occupy wall
streeters various other occupations
where I am protested uh we didn't have
the luxury of building new tools for
talking to each other we had to come up
with our own tools and so some of the
technologies that we developed we're
very rudimentary like hand signals and
the people's Mike I mean those are
technologies of communication that get
that matched our ethics so I can imagine
other scenarios and I mean things like
we should he be right of using maps in
order to document things I mean what
makes me so nervous about the ways thing
that you just suggested is like well if
we tell the police where we are then
they're just gonna come arrest us from a
protest perspective right so those
questions but um but I think it's
important I completely agree with your
point that it's important to identify
different stakeholders and but I think
it's also a cat and mouse game from my
own perspective of finding of technology
being like yes I can't wait to be
appropriate this and then seeing it get
subsume back into the system the other
thing that I say about that is when I
was talking about the bike messenger um
project and the ambulance project I mean
a lot of that comes out of this real
question of this is another way talking
the question of tactics and strategies
right like in the workplace your
individual tactics again gets subsumed
into strategies the story of taylorism
is a day sort olean story of i had my
own little tricks for getting something
done and then Taylor came along and then
I was like and those little tricks and
tactics suddenly got subsumed into
institutionalized strategies and now we
have a more efficient at work force and
then what happened your tactics well
their strategies now so they're from a
design question standpoint that's what I
want to get out I'm a design standpoint
of maps so it's really what I want to
get out is this question of bike
messengers and ambulance drivers is they
have there's a real you know push to be
efficient and anything else to every
single like labs or occasionally online
a lot of ambulance driving is honestly
taking people to the hospital like and
not food don't really I mean that's what
my sister is nebulous driver so it's
where this project came from anyway that
tension of managing individual agency
and individual sort of a sense of play
within an institutionalized framework of
design it's simply something I want to
tackle in this next project
night I want to actually circle back a
little bit to where you started your
talk about why some groups use
technology and radically different ways
and now looking at these cultural logics
kind of reflect back on power yeah I'm
wondering if you can just kind of close
the loop a little bit on that and talk
about how your dissertation speaks to
that and then I guess I also mean the
critique of rationalization of space
yeah so I'm guessing what I'm wondering
what you're bringing to that by focusing
on information practices as opposed to I
mean any new like Jane Jacobs and manual
Cassell's and Jennifer omen and all
these people since the 60s have really
been looking at people's conceptions is
phased and how those don't know Cody
marks around it to map so I guess yeah
I'm wondering how you can pushing on
those and so about the first question in
terms of what do we learn if I sort of
setting aside the progress in earnest
now if you're what do we learn when we
study you know communities of alterra
tea and a lot of that comes for me out
of a background in library and
information science where we have a
history of talking about people who are
working and people who are doing white
collar work and sort of um what it's
just more when we look at technology
outside those metrics and what what do
we get so the reason I keep returning to
things like and isn't Rob's used to
Facebook crazy is because I mean a half
it's really for me important to study
the moments of rupture right so there
have been these calls for like but how
do we so I mean Jed's work here right on
my people who depart from social network
sites or whatever and i love that work
and i see you know someone i wasn't
looking for that in this project
liberally but i was excited when it came
out because i think it provides a carrot
counter narrative to how we think of
social network sites and the affordances
that they give us some moments like that
are sort of part of my overall overall
interest um also things like um you know
definitely people in my project use
social media to keep in touch with
families back home but they're also
doing other things
and I think that says something about
the affordances of social media but
other things too with the affordances of
maps and for asserting one's own
individual relationship to space over a
strategic relationship to space and so I
think that's part of my broader interest
both I suppose an information scientists
you sort of like determined to operate
outside this context of you know how do
we get the most I won't even make that
exaggerations it outside of an
information and scientist perspective of
the workplace or of you know information
retrieval and sort of month much more of
an interest a sociological interest and
how people use information on everyday
life so I think I hope that answered
your question probably the first one I
guess the other way coming at it is
power Amy and especially because I think
information sciences is so weak on
theorizing power that there's clearly
like a lot of space um yes I guess and
I'm interested in specifically that
aspect so again I mean for people who
are disenfranchised of the people that I
studied phrase and there are people who
are not to raid their people who had a
lot of privilege and there are people
who really didn't um for them I mean one
of the ways this project got started for
me was doing work with ESL population
for two or three years and man it sounds
almost uh I'm almost embarrassed by how
humbled I was at the lives of people and
I was just like I had a hard enough time
moving from California to New York and
here you are and you don't have a job
and barely speak the language and what
does the city look like to you when I
have all these affordances of education
and language no money but education and
language and the city must look
different to you does it look different
to you and sort of trying to unpack you
know how does the city look differently
to you and because I'm an information
scientist their ways as I approached
that or what are the information
practices that you need and what are the
technologies that you need so someone
like Julio who again was unemployed you
know living in like a you know with his
three generations of his family I mean
it
stereotypical his life and he would use
information as a kind of social capital
and he was very proud of moments where
he could tell his relative things that
they didn't know about the city because
he was newer but this is amin he had to
occupy his time somehow so we would
wander through city space give this very
proud of this moment he was like telling
someone the fastest way to get to this
outlet mall in New Jersey and he was
like my relatives didn't know that I'm
they've been here for five or six years
and I figured it out because I found
this flyer on a bus well that's a moment
where information is powerful because it
speaks to part of his social network you
know it gives him a very rare moment of
feeling like he has information that
other people in his life town and so I
think moments like that where we're not
interested in his information scientists
in that information as you know the
power of that information is not how to
get from point A to point B as in the
social context of his lived life and
your other question was about
rationalizations of space so um I'm with
you on that I mean partly is that I see
this project of speaking to information
science and I see this project as
speaking to providing lived accounts of
globalization um because I feel like a
lot of globalization theory imma tends
to be very theoretical um so there's an
urgent of pottery to a class with him
one time and he made a joke that I
public he almost kind of wasn't joking
where he's like that's fine and practice
but how was it in theory and I was like
oh dear um so I'd see my work is sort of
providing a grounded lived count of
transnationalism that can speak to
things that he would be interested in
speaking to like transnationalism like a
post national the cartography so I see
myself as I situating and in that
discipline rather honestly than the
space disciplines I'm interested in
using those frameworks but maybe not
trying to disrupt those notions of space
as much and it's certainly not out of I
mean I had the most fun writing about
space because I enjoy a series of space
but I'm not speaking to those do you
mean I mean I'm not really trying to
disrupt those disciplines as much as my
own and maybe globalization studies
the ball so if anything wanted to follow
up with Justin feel free to let me know
and all my time is not my own today so
