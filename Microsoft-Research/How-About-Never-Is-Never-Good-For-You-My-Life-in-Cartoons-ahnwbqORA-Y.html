humor and will tell you more about that
he is the cartoon editor at The New
Yorker and founded the cartoon bank
which licenses cartoons for other
purposes he has partnered with
universities to deliver classes on humor
and has published more than 900 cartoons
of the New Yorker including one of the
most popular cartoons of all time which
gave the title to this memoir I also
want to thank you guys for taking on the
caption contest with true gusto we had
in just 12 hours we had over 200 entries
so please join me in giving him a very
warm welcome so we already have 200
losers hey you're a good-looking

really I am I am happy to be here
received a really warm welcome
everybody's here and to you people
online you know up there who didn't have
time to come down give me a very special
prizes here so this is my book how about
never is never good for you it's uh it's
yours right there you can buy it if you
do and you know you get look it's nice
right look you're gonna get a little dry
I don't you think that was worth buying
a GoPro 4
look so you know I'm going to do this
little drawing for you guys and I don't
know maybe you're not involved in order
what makes things more valuable or less
valuable but you know it's a draw and
I'm a cartoon editor The New Yorker me
doing the drawing for you might make you
know this book over time more valuable
in which case I would like it back okay
so the book actually is a book it's a
lot of writing I talk about my mom my
dad my growing up my being Jewish ah
here's my mom was a I stereotypical
Jewish mother and she was before a
helicopter mother there were drone
mothers and my mother was a drone mother
and she doted on me I'm just going to
read a little DoDEA is probably too mild
a word to describe my mother's obsessive
attention to my existence so long and
doubt and which she felt could be
snatched away from her at any time I'm
told it when I was sleepy and she would
put a mirror up to my mouth to see if it
would flog over showing that I was
indeed breathing L alive I still do that
myself every once in a while just to
make sure I think Molly's my mother's
name ministrations instilled in me a
potential for hypochondria a potential
has been fully realized so I do a lot of
cartoons on that medicine well Bob it
looks like a paper cut but just to be
sure let's do lots of tests
okay so this is the cartoon no
Thursday's out how about never is never
good for you to do I published by 950
cartoons like now a cartoonist every
week for The New Yorker does 10 15 20
ideas you actually never know you never
really know which is going to hit with
people what are the differences between
an amateur and a professional in some
feel like this is an amateur really
likes what they do a professional is
always dissatisfied so this cartoon I
think it was like the last one I threw
off and and now it's been reprinted
thousand times put my daughter through
college so a little a little comedy fear
and lesson because we're we do little
theory stuff here okay so when you look
at a joke like this no Thursday's out
how bad never is never good for you well
it's funny or why is it funny well what
you have actually is you have two
different frames of reference that are
clashing you have the message is rude
right it's rude the syntax is polite so
those are the counseling you're saying
something very rude in a polite way
that's why you can't end you could
theoretically end the joke here it would
still be a joke no Thursday's out how
about never would just be sharp and rude
but it wouldn't it wouldn't maintain the
two different frames going together
that's the only secret I'm telling you
today
anyway it's in the it's cool because
it's in the Yale book of quotations you
know right there next to that other
famous humorous mounts a tongue so you
know this tells your i'm old and here's
mike is my three drugs about being 70
you'll see the structure of jokes so I'm
70 the the good news is it could be
worse the bad news is it will be okay
I'm 70 the good news is 70 is the new 50
the bad news is dead is not the new
alive okay when you when you're 70
you're a guy and you wake and you wake
up you're stiff everywhere but where you
want to be okay so what happens with
when you publish a cartoon in The New
Yorker the copyright question is
actually owns it you have the copyright
to the cartoon as it appears
unfortunately the actual phrase or
whatever it is can be can be ripped off
and is so people rip it off and now I've
actually had to go through the copyright
and Trademark so now I have that phrase
so you can't use it but so it's on
t-shirts and you could also get it on
this thong
if that appeals to you you can't get it
on the thong and we the lawyers talk to
the thong people but they only offer
treat bouncer hi so the book has a lot
of content I mean it has my history of
my life one of the things in the book I
talk about more than I'll talk about
today is so the first chapter is I'm not
arguing I'm Jewish because when i
married my third last and best wives
McCrory Scott whittier not Jewish Cory's
got whittier and I thought I was having
like a totally normal conversation with
her and she said why you argue
everything I'm not arguing I'm Julie but
I'm not this Jewish but in but in the
book I do talk about and in some of the
lectures it is being Jewish this
actually if you're going to be in comedy
pretty important in 1980s survey was
done eighty percent of people in
professional comedy or Jewish and I go
back and it's all stories about coming
from Eastern Europe and everything so
it's really interesting how the people
of the book and the book is not funny
the book the Bible is dreadful Lee
terrible I mean there are 29 instances
of laughter and if God laughs you are
toast that is a really bad thing so this
is great this is from Seinfeld it and I
just like to show the thing we're okay
I'll tell you what's up oh I'm a gym no
sound
excuse me come a Jew if it's converting
two days ago oh well welcome aboard hey
yeah will you just hit the health book
oh yeah no he must have just missed you
yeah well I didn't do much I just sat in
the sauna you know it's more like a
Jewish workout blame the guys Jewish two
days he's already making Jewish jokes
which reminds me did you hear the one
about the rabbi and the farmer's
daughter huh so Jews became known the
jokes I have a chapter starts really in
the 19th century Freud book wrote a book
in 1905 jokes in their relations of the
unconscious and really they're all
they're all Jewish drugs I told one last
night at dinner I'll tell it again it's
great and there's something unique about
these jokes in that they depend very
much on cognitive manipulation rather
than simply being transgressive or
something like that so in in in the 19th
century in Eastern Europe among Jews are
a lot of these jokes about matchmakers
and the matchmaker is the one who brings
the bride okay and so the matchmaker
brings the the bride to the groom and
groom brings him over he says I don't
understand she's blind in one eye she
has a hunch back and she limps and the
matchmaker says you don't have to
whisper she's deaf to a lot of the jokes
and the joke side so in the Jewish
tradition in Eastern Europe there's
douche Nora the Shannara is not a beggar
exactly the Shura is someone who as a
person if you have means you need to be
charitable to in Jewish religion it's
your obligation and thus Nora takes
advantage of this constantly in the
jokes so the rich man in Vienna the SH
Nora comes to him and says I'm not
feeling well and he says okay i'll give
you money for your health he gives him
money and then he goes to that he finds
him at the fanciest spa in vienna he
says what are you doing here i gave you
a little money you're wasting of the
fancy fancy spa new sure says when it
comes to my health money is no object
the other one would I really like
because of the way a twist logic is this
the rich man gives her money for to go
eat and then he eats whatever fancy
dishes they have some sort of salmon
mayonnaise thing and then the rich man
sees them at the restaurant saying
eating the salmon because what are you
doing it gave you money you reading the
fanciest esta salmon and the addition or
says excuse me if when I have no money I
can't eat salmon and when I have money I
can eat salmon when can I eat salmon so
the this these types of cognitions in
everything it comes out when the
immigrants called a vaudeville and in
radio and then eventually television but
this way of thinking which goes back to
the Talmud goes back the question in God
because Judaism is a very skeptical
religion the Talmud is wrestling
constantly with the problems is that
you're saying oh that's fine I
understand you know your God I mean I
did a cartoon once in the new yorker
which has a guy coming at a church and
he's saying to the priest I know he
works in mysterious ways but if I work
that mysteriously I get fired so this
doubt ah I grew up in Queens and my
parents who take me to these resorts in
the Catskills where I was marinated in
jokes so these are all Jewish comedians
from the 40s and 50s and 60s I grew up
in the 50s and 68 mm so Rodney
Dangerfield is in it as an example and
I'm going to show it for another example
I am all right now the last week as a
rough shape you know last week I told my
wife needs a home improvement loan Jimmy
a thousand dollars to move out I'll tell
you my wife is always something you know
well the other day I called her up I
said to her honey I've been sick the
last time we had sex I'm getting excited
she said who is this
don't am i watching it with me the first
time I called her up she told me come on
over there's nobody at home I went over
it was no one at home okay so all the
dollars although the Dangerfield jokes
are really coming right out of this
tradition so I'm a cartoonist ah here
are some of my cartoons I'm sorry dear I
wasn't listening could you repeat what
you said since we've been married on the
one hand eliminating the middleman would
result in lower costs increase sales and
greater consumer satisfaction on the
other hand with the middleman your
coverage doesn't seem to include illness
as a matter of fact you did catch us at
a bad time this is more philosophical
there was no justice in the world there
is some justice in the world the world
discussed now that's product placement
it's called Hamlet duplex
so this so part of this I'm just showing
you where I came from and and until I
wrote the book and did the memoir and
did the research you know you don't feel
everything has a cultural patrimony you
know we will you're out so I've done
cartoon since 1977 New Yorker has volume
scrapbooks of every cartoon ever
published in for a long time as well it
tagged and categorized every cartoon in
these books and when I die they'll put
this party okay what I'm going to show
now because this is part of the book is
some videos and because the book is also
about that uh I became cartoon editor in
1997 there was a Nightline show on it
okay and then when I can't put this book
out there was a 60 minutes i'm going to
show the two different videos because i
want to show you how things have changed
and really how they're the same really
at the new yorker so first this is the
night light as cartoon editor mankoff
now presides over the New Yorkers
Tuesday morning ritual get that loud
deaf artists like religious supplicants
effect bring in a full week's work
hoping the just one cartoon will find
faith that we supposed enough yeah all
right you know one of the things about
being a cartoonist you know you have to
get put up with is the constant
rejection because ninety-five percent of
your work is being rejected and I gotta
say it's easier rejecting maybe check
and to add to the cartoonists agony man
cough usually scans their work with a
stone-faced
kind of quiet in here da with quiet but
in inside my mind is ricocheting with
laughter okay so that's 97 and this is
later as you can see because I'm older
and sort of the same but also different
because the new generation people are
starting today how are you fall Robert
well I suppose you came in here to show
me cartoons every Wednesday a nervous
band of ink-stained wretches gathers at
Bob man coughs office I don't see what
you got here hey hoping against hope to
sell him a cartoon as for what they're
paid no one's talking how many been
except that i really don't know there's
the grizzled veteran Sam gross who
figures he submitted 30,000 cartoons
give or take 30,000 yes many consider
this his masterpiece a dog at Heaven's
Gate asking is there any chance of
getting my testicles back I still have
to push the envelope Sam has always
pushed the envelope things that you
couldn't quite do how you doing I don't
very well there's always a little
preliminary chitchat how you been all
right parley finally cats specializes in
the farm in both cartoons and facial
hair so what's going on with that
mustache sure you're still entering the
contest no I retired from the circuit
this is all like a recreational message
okay and then make up speed raise the
rough sketches this is just too awkward
wrong most get rejected he's seen the
idea in one form or another before you
know like at you know whenever they open
your bag at an airport carolita johnson
has an airport security cartoon with the
TSA guys saying you can pack this back
up now Emily flake is a joke featuring
both King Kong and Godzilla it's a two
heavy hitters in the monster world yeah
it's as simple as that maybe it's just a
day for facial hair
but Joe data seems to be a contender
with a Tarzan cartoon the Apes the same
we found you and raised you as one of us
so we were just wondering at what point
did you learn to shave yes I have
researched this there is no no iteration
of Tarzan in literature comic books and
movies in which he has facial hair it
makes no sense right here's some of this
stuff wow this is just stage one sitting
out the candidates to take to the
magazine's editor yes a little bit too
straightforward he's largely Lord
committal pleasant but blood won't look
right in our magazine with a drawing
simply isn't good enough we're not that
impressed okay next it doesn't have
enough charm so that's what happened it
sort of seems the same but one of the
things that's really different is humor
itself changes over time and the
generations of people do it must change
when I took over in 1997 the cartoonist
were in their 40s and 50s and 60s and if
I was a very well oiled machine but if
the new generation didn't come in that
we're going to be no new yorker
cartoonist and when a new generation
comes in you have to accept more
diversity you have to accept also that
jokes themselves change so the jokes I
told you those Jewish jokes they're
great jokes but they're not our today's
jokes there's much more absurdity in
joking now than there would have been
another time there's much more
participation on the part of the viewer
in having their imagination engaged so
that Tarzan Joe would never occur in
nineteen fifty or let's say there's joke
I'll just tell you the title okay so
let's say it's called paninis of the Old
West now there's something ludicrous
about paninis of the Old West now
already you're thinking well what could
paninis are the Old West big and then
you see the villain is on the railroad
tracks as the train is coming by
and the panini anyway that's where it
but so that's that type that type of
very loose or the crazy thinking is is
it is much more evident allies we're
bombarded by many many different sources
you know of stimuli and jokes and and
then there's a whole field of meta humor
like we have a caption contest and
there's an anti caption contest which
the attempt is to give the absolute
worst caption there's a caption contest
in which is called which is called the
monkeys you order calm which simply
describes it describes the caption so
the caption to the one that you have
would be there's a man in a suit rolling
next to me but and which won't be funny
to you but will be funny to you as you
see all of them there's a caption in
which the same caption is put on every
single contest and that caption for
every single contest is what a
misunderstanding with somehow works ah
ok how did I get to be the criteria
editor the courtiers ok so i went to the
high school of music and art with art
oak sorry oh no no no we're not doing
this yeah the i didn't panic I mean last
time that happened I risk the screen and
that was wrong ah so I went to music in
our music and art was a school was a
school in New York City with Jews on 130
fifth Street in Spanish Harlem now it's
somewhere else they changed the name I
know sixties and seventies to LaGuardia
High School because he felt LaGuardia
High School is a lot more catchy name
the music and art so I went to music and
art on art because I could I could I
could I could draw a little bit huh this
is me 1962 but look at this dude look at
Edward Barrak Edred rack this is 1962
he's got a pipe right that wild was
writing a memo I said because it's the
internet you can find out anything what
happened to Edward Barrak he became the
dean of american pie
dad shows you what focus will do I me
nots astounding I mean jack just think
just think how much I could have
accomplished and I only smoked a pipe
but I didn't okay I 62 I went to
Syracuse University where I'm Adrian
hair porch while you still have now
Syracuse you I didn't go to any classes
at all costs it was a six-piece for
whatever and when people say did you do
any drugs and I said not enough that's
the one regret I have if I could go back
I would do more drugs ah but the
transformative moment at Syracuse was a
moment really to change my life because
I didn't go to class because his large
seminar classes you go to the first
class and you get the text book you
could wait till the last class take
amphetamines read the whole book and you
know dude so that's what I did for the
sociology class oh I been to the first
class you know okay find out when the
test was and then I got the book the
pills and it went to the class and so it
really crowded it's like one of those
big rooms and I'm late I mean I should
have been early with the amphetamines I
was late and it's all crowded and I have
to come in my hair is much much longer
and totally more hip ified so I'm
standing at ago and I and I and I rushed
to the sea to pick up though you know
the blue book I don't know if they still
have blue books and I sit down and you
know start scribbling actually
scribbling and so the teacher you know
comes up to me and looms over me looks
down at me and says who the hell are you
and so I looked up at him and said you
know I could very well ask you the same
question
and I think that was the point my life
changed because it's sort of the power
of humor to change situation the courage
of it in the face of what seems like
odds and everybody has all the cards and
you've up in everything but you
still stand up you're still a person you
can change things around and the course
the class laughs and that is so great so
what if I flunk didn't matter actually
didn't look he passed me up okay then I
went to graduate school in Experimental
Psychology and I got all my credits for
PhD and I was on the cusp of my PhD I
remain on the cusp all these years later
the me with the world's largest cusp
just extended forever and what it did
was it was it was a behavior of
behaviorism in the in the 70s and so you
put these defenseless animals in these
cages and you did things to them that
are now outlawed by the Geneva
Convention uh what you did primarily was
you with schedules of reinforcement so
reinforcement is a reward for the animal
and it's negative reinforcement to which
is not punishment but something else but
so if you if you if you every time the
animal presses the bar you give them
food naturally they press the bar and if
you stop they stop well not big deal
about that so part of it was well how do
you what types of schedules of
reinforcement encourage persistence and
it turns out if you start the animal off
freedom all the time with pressing the
bar and then you start to vary it in a
very variable manner and it can either
be by time or respond responses you
goose great persistence and those
intermittent schedules re-enforcements
so that's sort of what I did I quit
because of the cost we've mentioned that
and told my parents I wasn't going to be
a psychologist and George parents it's
going to be a cartoonist my father who
grew up during who worked during the
Depression
19 08 turned to me very sternly and said
you know they already have people who do
that I said yeah but one of them might
die so all I gotta do is be alert read
the papers and I'm first in line so I I
i started doing cartoons lots of
cartoons I got kept getting rejected by
the New Yorker least a thousand times at
The New Yorker rejection rejection
rejection I then now he's not
interesting because i was telling
cartoonist other magazines every once in
a while i was my intimate and schedule
of reinforcement that Kevin if I if I
hadn't sold anything I wouldn't kept
going but just just getting published
was this huge reinforcement and then
just because the way that they weren't
they weren't putting me intentionally on
an intermittent schedule of
reinforcement for that for the nature of
this type of work so I I did sell car
turns this is 1974 this is the first
cartoon I ever sold okay faster than a
speeding bullet more powerful than a
locomotive know shorthand that shows you
how long ago that works then this is
please tell the King I remembered the
punch line
and I work in a stipple technique with a
technical pen I still do that so this
usual labor intensive these are all done
with these tiny little guys but finally
in 1977 after all those submissions this
change to this with you didn't because
the new yorker does not that is not your
car you mer but it partly in each one of
these things maybe eventually we'll talk
in the Q&amp;amp;A well what makes things funny
why is that funny versus something else
what is the clash involved here ah but
you're partly it's an emotional truth
this is actually how you felt you know
what you screamed you know and
everything besides the fact that I feel
I proved my parents wrong ah so now I'm
cartoon editor all these years later and
that's a whole other story that's in the
book and so this is what I do you saw me
meet with people I meet on Tuesdays it's
called open call Tuesday so anybody can
come and see me but most of the cartoons
really come in because not everybody is
in New York there people in England and
Taipei and France and everything that
comes in comes in electronically but you
print it out because it's still it's
still pretty much the best way to look
at these things maybe even the way you
want to look at most of them coming to
speed the apps so I'll look at a
thousand cartoons you know there's no
left meter there and in fact I don't
laugh at all and that's some interesting
psychological from what I mean you don't
laugh how can you possibly be judging
these cartoons well evaluation is very
different than experiencing something
anything that you evaluate in this way
becomes mediated and it will
automatically suppress what actual
response you have if you are so so you
don't in you don't enjoy it in that same
way I mean you can do it you appreciate
it you understand is basically you it's
a crap is this joke working how will it
be changed because here when you looked
at each of those jokes well you
responded to them as jokes and
everything you didn't think Oh should
that be edited should it be briefer
should it be there should it be that but
that's naturally my concern so
everything I'm
I'm looking at then there are all other
factors that have to be factored in
which is that you actually can't look
sequentially at a number of jokes and
judge them without knowing that these
are serialization and satiation effects
if you just simply think because you'll
say it would be like you're a bonbon
taster and you're hungry and the first
one you taste man these bonbons are
great and then you know you after your
thousand bonbon you throw up and say
these bonbons are terrible you're not
bringing in the factors so I'm thinking
of all this and I have a philosophy of
what I want ah ok so this is interested
this is william Hogarth the laughing
audience and everybody is laughing
except this guy this guy is the critic
this is the evaluator so I have to watch
out that I don't become that guy and
that actually is a fairly easy thing to
happen where you you forget what the
purpose is of what you're doing which is
primarily to provide the cartoons for
the audience primarily for the or not
solely because in The New Yorker so
we're pushing the envelope and we and
the things that I want to push because
the most people if you and say oh what
makes jokes good novelty not really not
for most people most people don't like
very much novelty they like novelty
within a cocoon of familiarity so if you
do an experiment where you have a
stand-up routine and you stop the joke
before the punchline and you have and
you have those people predict the joke
then you have other people evaluated
most people like the most predictable
jokes the things they almost could think
of so I want to avoid that also but I
don't want I don't want to be a fussy
connoisseur because that that's what
your natural tendency will be if you
look at much material that nothing is
good there Barry Schwartz wrote a book
the paradox of choice you'll very easily
because ok a thousand cartoons are going
to come in you're going to pick 17 how
are you going to pick the 17 you must
pick the 17 in some way by thinking this
is no good in subway this is no good
this isn't good so part of it is an egg
mindset is starting to evolve rather
than experiential a mindset also in the
picking let's say you say I don't like
this one and I like this one but I do
like this little thing about this one
that I rejected I like this one better
overall but now the thing that you liked
and the other one that you have to
reject is now detracting from the thing
that you like more so you so your own
experience for it the values it so my
background in psychology I think helps
me and this is actually when I'm with
David Remnick or other people who in the
brilliant but I think in this way naive
a little bit saying okay you were seeing
you are seeing some association or
serialization effects by doing this okay
so what are we looking for it but I told
you a little bit but here's the contract
i got from the new yorker in 1980 and
it's interesting know here in the
contract does it mention the word
cartoons all ideas ideas and so
primarily the new yorkers cartoons
you're about ideas they're not simply
about violating expectations or
transgression or the thing the things
that make people laugh the loudest are
actually fairly simple the people people
falling down and getting hurt but not
really getting her to music that's what
America's Funniest Home Videos is that
if you actually watch or if you go up on
the internet and you look at prank you
learn stuff and you see what people
laugh at really hardly is this and it's
in today it's in this very very primal
experience that when we when we I mean
part of the way to look at rumors a
little bit as I've talked to talked
about this last night as its surprise
and for an organism it's always bad to
be surprised because surprise is an egg
it you should always bet on it being
something bad so originally when you're
surprised you bet negative because
because that's more protective when the
when the when the fat man falls on the
banana peel you your mirror neurons or
whatever actually reacting to it a
little bit like you felt a little bit
and at that moment you
are betting negative that's something
bad has happened immediately after that
something not bad happens in NEP got
hurt that would be one thing and that
and that's this relief less so that's in
a way that's the most primitive type
we're not dealing with that here so the
mechanisms we use have to be you know
more cognitive ideas people say how do I
get ideas I think of them okay so I want
to make it I want to make some of the
thinking as simple as possible not
because these are great jokes but just
to show how simple it is okay that's
right in that a person in a chair sort
of stands up like that so right is never
funny it's got to be wrong in some way
okay that's wrong and it's not very
funny but it's marginally more punishing
it's marginally more funny to see the
wrong like that right and then I can
complete it by making a joke budget
recliner okay I'm so for what's the fit
right wrong funny okay that's right
she's got two buckets that's wrong so
the field is disturbed now you feel like
hey you got to make sense of this and
then that's funny okay so that's right
bad for the lemmings but okay but that's
where they do they go off the clip right
and that's wrong they don't grow up and
that's funny
so I'm just sort of showing you this the
way in a simple way the way it works
usually humor is going to be first of
all it can't praise it can't elevate it
must always that must always because you
know either you know that that makes it
so broad you find like one
counterexample you know there's whimsy
and things but overall it diminishes in
some way it diminishes what is what has
happened oh okay how to win the new
yorker caption contest will get there
you're so new yorka caption contest what
is it on the back page every week we
have a contest you can enter we have
contests and we sent a finalist and we
have a winner overall so this this this
one over here if you can't see it quite
is Joe zombies are attacking these
people this guy has cookies and this
woman has a garden okay so that's the
one you had a thought ah overall it's a
five week process so it's a little weird
because we can't possibly have a caption
contest on the back page and then which
runs all the way through the week and
then on Monday have it because 5,000
come in so overall it's a five week
process before it finally gets done so
in this instance that was you know let's
hope for some nut allergies
now the now good me now then now on that
we got letters from people who have nut
allergies and that and The New Yorker is
a complicated frame for which to do
cartoons because humor as I said
diminishes has an aggressive element of
them and is really for the most part the
opposite of empathetic feelings real
empathy really at odds somewhat and The
New Yorker it because it's a very
liberal magazine and so many of the
articles make us feel empathetically
make us care about the world that we're
heightened when anything like happens so
for example we ran a cartoon in which
one woman is saying to the other eye
I've only been gluten-free for a week
but I'm already annoying and we got lots
of letters we got we got a letter from a
woman from lots of people who really
misread it because you know he said
you're being gluten-free is not a fad
for me I've sell yak disease you know
you know try you know walking a mile in
my shoes which you know for that woman
it's a good idea because you walk a mile
in their shoes you'll be a mile away
from them and you'll have their shoes ah
but but but so it's very a very
sensitive environments so we got you
know protest there okay this is a walk
it's a little bit out of date now we're
up to like 475 there's about and I'm
we're doing some experiments here with
all this data so we get about five
thousand a week there's been about two
and a half million entries now your
chance of winning maybe is that I don't
know I had someone do this formula which
I think works out which is that if you
just entered week after week by chance
what would you be your chance of winning
and it turns out that you know it's
supposed to just by chance by 2026 you
would have a twenty percent chance of
winning and I think actually that would
mean that you had put in the malcolm
gladwell 10,000 hours
which which you know means that you
seriously need to reorder your
priorities if you put in 10,000 hours on
this okay many more men enter than women
not eighty four percent more women
actually end up winning and presented
which is interesting and I think it's
one of these things when you when you
remove a lot of external variables from
what make people laugh where the only
thing you actually have is your words
and it's anonymous women do quite well
ten top states where you can see in New
York and California but if you normalize
for population you get a little bit
different look you know anything and
generally what you're going to see is
that liberal states probably because
they more subscribers to the New Yorker
okay so this this is the actual process
that goes on now that's my cartoon
assistant mark Philippe Eskenazi who we
call Mark Foley best knowledge for short
ah and here's a little little little
video can looking at the contest
cruising for captions here shortly
before I started it was when they
started the captain contests the
assistant needed to be someone who could
judge all those captions
people go onto the internet and enter
their idea for the best gag line for
that cartoon and then some poor soul
sorts through all of those at the end of
the week I mean mainly my job was to
just read 8,000 captions a week most fun
but it was also soul crushing my eyes
which have leveled off it's sort of like
a certain blurriness increased several
whatever they aren't like blindness
points after staring those captions for
so long
so whether i'm out here collaborating
with some people at microsoft is there
have been a number of research into this
and truly at five or even ten thousand
it's a manual task to do at a hundred
thousand a million it wouldn't be
manageable it's actually fairly
restricted its subscribers to the new
yorker so all the sudden if we had
mobile apps and everyone could enter and
they were going to win a lot of money to
be you could do it i think through
crowds who are seeing a lot of people
but we're looking to see how computers
can help so my new Carson is Colin
Stokes and so he does he does this thing
this would be for the this would be for
that for that caption contest and it
always here's the thing there are five
thousand different captions or 10,000
different cap but not 10,000 different
captions they come in in clusters and
this is called collective this course
and you can have very big clusters you
could have clusters of a thousand like
440 ah for the contest which we'll get
to that you did and we'll talk about
that there's a big nough is one big
cluster so here so this is wordplay
dietary source in cooking is all zombie
stuff hosting dinner parties killing
violence relationship cultural
references then what I do is I pick at
that point after i get these categories
aight i put them on SurveyMonkey
SurveyMonkey gives it to the cartoon the
editors of New Yorker in randomized
faction they judge then and their
judgment or is usually they don't judge
them very highly because once again they
having this problem of evaluation all of
a sudden they're having this this crazy
task of saying this is funnier than this
is funnier than this ah you do get a
consensus but here's what's interesting
ok so here's this person for that
particular contest they sort pretty much
everything was funny here's this other
person who thought pretty much
everything was unfunny that person
so that so when you get to the granular
level you see the truth subjectivity of
humor of course the larger the number
you make you'll think it's a consensus
it's sort of a little bit like it is
here for soil laughter is contagious so
the general feeling in this room is I'm
funny individuals hip particular
individuals and I know who you are have
a different opinion but that's just the
nature it's just so subjective okay
here's Anna Ted Danson and bored to
death so he's with a police duck say to
a suicidal bear you can bear it oh god
that's terrible I'm never gonna win this
thing what are you doing ah so he's not
gonna read it now Roger Ebert late Roger
Ebert entered 107 times finally one with
I'm not going to say the word I'm
thinking of he went one of the first
studies done to look at it was uh by
Peter McGraw until firm back and they
looked at all from the Ebert thing and
they came up with these are the rules to
win novelty captions that use words that
are uncommon and other captions are more
likely to make the shortlist punctuation
captions at avoid ! length captions that
use fewer words and abstractness and
imagine ability captions that are hard
to visualize and that would be true of a
B birds caption because from I'm not
going to say the word I'm thinking of
you wouldn't know the problem with any
theory of humor is if what you actually
have to look at all the different things
you know to see is it true in these
instance and so you take a contest like
this objection your honor alleged killer
whale you know these were this was the
winning one and there were many many
like that a huge cluster and when you
look at it certainly not true a novelty
punctuation you got to got to be
punctuated ! late that's true abstracts
and imagine ability not true for this
and you know be funny yeah got to be fun
interestingly this is a terrible caption
contest and why is it a terrible caption
contest well it's not a real caption
and test at all if the terrible caption
contest even never would have figured it
out it's very difficult because there
are too many frames of reference in the
image it's not just that there's a bear
who's suicidal here there's a duck that
he's not simply a duck he's a plea stuck
now you have to try it's it's a funny
picture but how are you going to put it
all together ah that would have been a
simpler picture still incongruous right
and you could have solved it with go
home and get some sleep you'll feel
better in May why did you ever take a
job on Wall Street okay now I've added
now look at Malley it's a bull in a beer
you can more you can make sense out of
it now right because you can say it's
just an expression no one blames you for
the market we all have bad days how do
you think when I feel the market doesn't
set a record high okay and try not to
land on my sculpture
okay now but now and I'm doing
experiments and now I've increased the
incongruity I've made the picture rear
in front of you but much harder still
possible to solve oh yeah try getting
cold pig all day really I've got a
brother who works with stocks and just
loves it ah so this was your caption
contest right this is the one you
entered I didn't have time to look at
all the entries but they came in at the
end this is a contrast we actually ran
and this is what happens these are the
types of clusters they come in airplanes
first time in coach finance offices your
last job sounds terrible closed dressing
okay now the big cluster that came in
from you guys was casual Fridays and in
this contest itself out of 5990 entries
or casual Friday 900 if you look at how
they come in time was the those come in
first those come in first so naturally
what I'm seeing that it may actually be
that is the funniest captured in some
way but in terms of the criteria i'm
using it's not going to be so the one
would we actually want was your last job
sounds terrible this is what came in on
your stuff and and you know and so there
was our dress code stuff like that i
just didn't have a chance to look at it
i am going to award the winner you'll
get a free book and a trip to Miami no
just a book
you know one thing to remember is that
sometimes the very best caption is the
simplest so it makes you stop and think
doesn't it I hope I have thanks very
much I'll happy to answer some questions
I need to buy the book questions anybody
want have questions oh come on hey go
ahead tell us about your drawing so how
did you go from people using lines and
half tones dots I drew that way in the
high school music in order was this
idiosyncratic style it was it was based
someone on photographs I love the way
photographs looks and they were all
formed from actually little dots and I
actually just started copying photograph
starts with dot and then I did it and
then it became a very distinctive style
that magazines noticed and I kept up
with it and now now I have all these
repetitive use injuries yeah go ahead
countries to revise Urquhart cheated all
the time I mean all the time on the
cartoon editor so I have a whole thing
yeah I do I edited it also always
looking there knocking off a lot of
cartoons at once that point of doing of
submitting those cartoons is to generate
lots of stuff not to worry every single
comment and everything and so that's
what I do usually for compression
especially for younger cartoonists that
are mentoring I mean a lot of like if
you looked at a lot I didn't get a
chance to look at your stuff but a lot
of you put the punchline first or then
you just put some other line after the
punch line and you know it doesn't work
yeah grad so how do you you still
continue cuff ha yeah cartoons how do
you deal with them in your process uh
well your people say there's a there's a
conflict of interest because not only
did i start the cartoon bank not only do
i select the cartoons &amp;amp; publish my own
cartoons right it's all those things so
people have said is there a conflict of
interest and i think is I established a
blue ribbon committee which i'm heading
I don't submit that much anymore I'm
just not that interested I'm interested
in mentoring a whole new generation I
feel like your life course is to do
different things when I'm really
interested in the academic part new
generation of cartoonists research and
humor and bringing that in so I started
off as a player than a player coach or
now it's more a coach and being almost
out here as a symbol of the new yorker
what we do and inspiring people and
that's the best thing I can do any more
question all right back there webcomics
like XKCD I think that's an amazing
amount of creativity out in in web
comics and everywhere else the problem
with so much of it is is it going to be
a hobby or is it going to be a
profession with so much it's not that
the internet that cartoons are going to
go away or anything and that's going to
be the problem not just for cartoons but
for so many creative things that we used
to do and get paid for is it may in the
end actually be better you know we've
gone to a model where the only people
who do things are the professionals the
only producing or the pad one point only
people who draw the only and then once
it turns out that you're not the very
best anymore and you can't get into
these slots you stop so that may be that
may be I think humor be keep changing
and truthfully the thing I guess I worry
about it i do think you look you can do
everything with crowdsourcing you can do
everything without how many people like
this and then the people like this cat
better and most people like this okay
and then you do get a sort of general
consensus but I don't think you then you
know get those things that you didn't
know you liked well that's what I try to
do I try to push people things that
might not otherwise like all right yeah
in France with Charlie head bowed to
that effect any of your hedgerow
guidelines well I was Charlie Abdel was
completely smeared they were not they
were not racist you had to read the
cartoons I know the people there
you know I gave a talk at Penn I think
that a free speech is obviously very
important humor is often humor is often
the marginalized second citizen of free
speech it's the tip of the spear in the
back of the bus when it comes to
defending it because we feel we can
sacrifice humor it's not that important
the points it makes we understand that
ridicule and contempt I mean a lot of
absolutely a lot of those cartoons I
mean when you look at it of course they
ridicule and they were I mean they
ridiculed people who wanted to kill them
for drawing a picture and you can't
remove the contempt and the ridicule
from the message without having what the
message actually is the message it
partly is there are some beliefs that
don't deserve reason counter-argument I
mean that's what we're making fun of
religion when I'm saying when I hear the
things he works in mysterious ways I'm
making a joke if I worked at mysterious
I'll get fired the joke I made at Penn
was I mean I gave a little speech
because they were there in support of
them as cartoon editor than New Yorker
and I said because you know a lot of
writers backed out and it was a
black-tie dinner and right as some
writers had backed out some time of
change their mind and he said well there
was no way I was going to back out
because I'd already rented this tux and
it was very expensive because it's
bulletproof and you know and then you
know and then I said you know my thing
was well as accurate too far does it go
over the line and also this whole thing
about being a look being offended by
jokes I mean I understand whether it's
microsoft of the new yorker were
commercial enterprises so really the
thing that really limits free speech
most mostly is commercialism we have
audiences and we want people to buy
things we don't want them to be offended
or too much of them to be offended
because the pie thing but when you to
what you say with the harm offense does
the actual harm let's say the woman with
the glutens
then what if someone says to me they
were offended by a cartoon I mean a
reasonable person I asked well then what
happened were you able to have lunch
could you not sleep and you have
post-traumatic stress syndrome I mean I
said we're talking to people yesterday i
said i think what we really need to talk
so much as sensitive sensitivity
training that's in sensitivity training
just to be a little tough anyway I want
to gotta sign the book or one where I'll
grab so I want to extend me and recently
and I really enjoyed it it's good and
had the whole place rolling just
laughing who was it again yeah that's
why that's what so great about unit
comedian my question was to you uh I
noticed that the community had the whole
place laughing just the whole place
rolling which is fun I imagine that's
like which is the comedian's August
there in 10 right yeah yeah I imagine
cartooning is probably the same way
where you were able to have that effect
on people you know the laugh getting
that funny bone where's just like well
it's okay it's somewhat different
because it's mediated there's a whole
buffer of being published to everything
so you get nice letters but the you know
this is this is this is fun this is fun
to have people you know enjoy that so
yeah and for a lot of comedians and
people one of the problems of the fun
that it is is it's an addictive fun and
it's not easy and not everybody always
laughs now everybody's always rolling
and the when you're in a group like this
this is a very primal group in a way in
some ways it's very easy to get laughs
because there's a lot of tension first
of all you really can't say anything
while I'm talking you're not supposed to
you only have one response when you
might frown or you can laugh and then
I'm one person up in front of all you
guys I can't be good from an
evolutionary standpoint bad things could
happen to me if you don't like me I mean
you could run up and kill me you could
you only mean and all I have and and
every time I tell a joke that falls flat
where you start to look like that
there's something very deep that says
not only are you fail
but you you feel worse than that there's
a whole group of people that don't like
you you promise them something that you
can make them laugh and you have it and
on that somber note let me go sign the
books thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
