professor of technology and education
Andy Van Dam from Brown University and
distinguished scientists anup gupta
Microsoft Research to talk with us about
some exciting developments in online
education and II anoop thanks for being
here preciate it Chris we ran out of
stuff on here we're gonna learn some
stuff with research in focus we'll start
with you and I understand you have
something pretty cool to show us today
tell us what office mix is one office
mix is a incredibly simple way for
people to create online presentations I
basically build on PowerPoint that a
billion people use to create a you know
online presentation with audio video
inking quizzes in a very simple way
provides a web-based experience
cross-platform and it gives you
analytics on how students are
interacting with what you created so
basically it is a tremendously simple
way to do all of these things that
people have wanted to do this is
exciting stuff so an open and II
everyone who's gone to college is
experienced you know the traditional
lecture approach to learning and you say
that lectures aren't the best way to
teach which at face value i think is
intuitive clear when you know the old
saying quit lecturing me right we sort
of even associate that name is not the
best way to learn something right so
there are many studies that have shown
that the sage on the stage model in some
sense is not a very effective way to
learn you know some work that called
Wyman has done who is a Nobel Prize
winning physicist in the science and
stem education where he's focused on
shows people get around thirty percent
of the concepts that the professor
intended for them in the lecture style
model and it comes from a couple of
things one is lectures can quite easily
in many cases become pretty passive
experiences for the students and that's
not a way to learn and the second thing
is that you know as the professor is
going if you miss something there's no
way to catch up before you the next
concept comes so if you'll get lost in
some place you may be lost for quite a
while or and probably many of our
audience
since hair I've experienced not yeah
yeah and Andy I mean you can talk to
that I mean we're kind of living I have
a seven-year-old daughter and a
four-year-old daughter they don't even
know what rewinding the old-fashioned
way is right we're kind of in an
on-demand world I want it now I want to
rewind things I want to pause things
yeah i've been recording my lectures for
much more than a decade precisely so
that students have a chance after the
class is over to look at the materials
at their own speed and very selectively
they don't need to hear the whole
lecture again they just want to go to
the place where they had some
difficulties and mix gives you a really
good way to do that kind of you so you
guys have proposed that blended learning
is a better way of teaching and so talk
to us exactly about what you mean by
blended learning what blended learning
to me in a simple way means to use
technology and the humans in appropriate
ways so if there's a broadcast lecture
mode that you're doing you know you
could watch that at home and in fact you
can pepper the online lecture with a
bunch of quizzes interactive exercises
simulations so that you know you're
experiencing you're finding out oh I
wasn't paying attention let me go back
and tried on again and then the way you
use the classroom time in some sense the
people together time is to have deeper
discussions to resolve the difficulties
it's often called flipped classrooms
because the notion is you watch the
lecture at home and you come and do the
exercises and the recitation section in
the class and now if blended learning is
arguably a more effective way of
teaching why aren't more schools doing
anything I think they're couple of
challenges like people aunt doing it one
is you know there's a long long
tradition of the lecture style means all
of us learned that way and people are
used to that and changing traditions is
hard it's also not so easy to go to the
online model because so far creating
these online lectures lessons
incrementally updating them and you have
the latest hot has been very difficult
so it is a combination of
the momentum and inertia we have with
the traditional mode with the
technological and the additional work
that is needed that I think makes it
hard mm-hmm and obviously this would be
this whole session be real downer if we
didn't have some promise for overcoming
the challenges right we're here to prove
to them that it can and should be done
explain how office mix helps teachers
create online lessons so what office
makes a and we should you know get to a
demo pretty soft ooh this what it does
is it addresses the technological
challenges that I mentioned before it is
a very powerful tool that makes it very
easy to create these online lessons with
interactive elements that you'll want
the students to watch at home it gives
you a very easy way to share with the
students regardless of the kinds of
machines or phones that they're coming
with and finally an important part of
blended learning is that the professor
gets feedback to say what didn't they
get right what did they not get right
and so it automatically provides you
with analytics on how the students
interacted what the misconceptions were
so that yeah you know you can do things
differently in the classroom and we're
going to jump into the demo but Andy as
a professor you can speak to the fact
that as you sort of indicated sometimes
the biggest thing holding people back
has just changed like I already know how
to do this I already know my lesson
plans and I've got my books why would I
want to learn a whole new computer
system right is it as daunting as it
would appear yeah it is daunting and
most of us don't have the time or the
patience the bandwidth to do it frankly
but the thing I really find impressive
about mix is how fast you can leverage
what you already know how to do which is
to make powerpoint presentations to add
this enrichment material it was
essentially painless to learn how to use
it five minutes okay you can't ask for
more than that and I'm sure a lot of not
watching online are saying prove it
prove it if it's that the demo okay so
let's go so first thing is you know
mixes publicly available and it's free
of charge that's great so those of you
who are listening online go to mix
office com or you know and you can find
and see and in fact you'll be seeing
what you sing so the first part is
there's a public portal out air but I
didn't want to go there so let me just
go back for a second ahead so you know
there's a bunch of lectures that you'll
see it's a public portal where you can
go and see then in the public portal you
already see a lot of lessons and I want
to take a couple of them and share with
you there what we can do my machine is
having a little bit of difficulty
actually scrolling so this is not the
one that I wanted to show so you're
going to have to wait for me on the
online part okay part of the curve
that's that's part of the curve that's
its basic simple interaction so I'm
going to take you to this Ohm's law
lesson that a colleague of mine at
Microsoft Research created and this will
show you how inking audio/video
narration quizzes and some of the labs
can be included right so let's go there
if I can click so here we are you know
so it's just loading you can see it's
full screen beautiful inking is
happening and like a hopefully the audio
and the thunderclap and interactions
that are taking place you know you can
see out here I'm seeing the tables of
content and I can go and you know jump
around within that so you can see I just
you know went into a slightly different
part of it and you will see anything
taking place you know this is the 9-volt
battery you can actually speed it up in
the control that you out see out here to
do that you can embed videos inside it
so let me quickly actually jump into the
next video so you know to keep high
schoolers or freshman excited so you
know this is some fun a cat video here
ok that is there now next what you
seeing is an interactive lab you know
microsoft research has been working on
this technology called touch develop
which allows for labs to be there so
this is you know you want to understand
the resistance you want to see you know
as i increase the voltage what happens
as i'm increasing
the voltage and you know this one is hey
if I take it beyond 10 milliamps then
it's going to you know go and crash and
burn and so if i do that you know boom
you see the sound you can embed quizzes
inside so let me just take you to a
embedded credit quiz inside so you know
here you see a quiz that's going to pop
up and every interaction that I'm doing
with Max right now is actually getting
recorded in the back end so the
instructor can see how much students
spend time on what portions varied they
have difficulty they can see that I
chose this as an answer and then I
submit it that's incorrect and that you
know I took a second try to get the
answer right so you know all of this
information is available I also did a
quick you know lecture which is the tour
of the mix our capabilities and then
what I'm going to show you is create
this live for you what I just did okay
so we're going to go in here and let's
start watching this office makes its
being a little slow on the interview out
of office ok so you can see you know I
was just recording that the three
primary components you know to the video
that is there you can have authoring
within PowerPoint you know there's a
portal so I'm going to skip around a
little bit so here we show you know some
inking again and all of the nine
different capabilities that we provide
inside of mix that people can do and
then I'm going to go and start going
quizzes we have already seen so I'm
going to show you some additional things
that we can do so let me go into the
next one so here we have if this will go
across on the network a little bit I
wanted to show you basically here we
have embedded a con video mm-hmm inside
of our mix and you know so all of the
standard khan academy stuff works ok i
have embedded a Khan Academy exercise
inside so I'm just showing you all of
the different kinds of you
no interactable then I can move these
dots around and the whole thing changes
I can get a hint these things as another
thing that I put inside so this is from
Colorado University of Colorado people
have built some really interesting
simulations and see if I can drag these
things there i can hit go and you can
see that you know pulley if i put two
people so again all of this is being
recorded or i can show you one more
thing and then maybe we can go so this
is a python labs one of the most popular
languages that is there today is python
you know that people are trying to learn
and i can go and code and all of the
simulations hair you know are working if
i can again my touch is acting you know
so all these tapping through the
exercises can be done well so all this
interactivity embedded inside yeah
lessons that you create as simple as
inserting clip up so let's go and try
and create something like that here
we've got less than a minute you give us
the quick tutorial okay so basically
inside PowerPoint mixes an atom and if
you go to the portal again mixed at
office calm you can go and insert it and
within the mix i have a bunch of things
to record audio video inking add quizzes
etc so let's go into record and this is
where you know i'm going to make some of
the additions so what i'm going to do is
essentially as i was doing before okay
i'm going to make some edition so i'm
going to go to record and here in
recording i can say ah oh wow i'm having
a little bit of difficulty with my pen
of course because i told you to hurry
that's why you know this pressure round
okay so you know i can ink out there and
I can you know have all of my animations
hair coming up and as I'm doing the
animations if this was working you will
actually see my inking working out here
so did all of these things I can do so
right now actually what we will see is
this video and audio is recorded so here
I hit the stop button I whole touches
acting very funny so that's what happens
yeah your surface for you we perceive
easy so you know so you know the
recording is there and I can preview
what is there and you know you can
listen to what I just did and I can move
them around so I can stop the preview
hair and then let me close here so what
the other thing I can do is these videos
that are there I can move them around I
can adjust them let me go to just a
blank slide and actually show you how
you adequate okay as a basic thing so I
go to this section that I call quizzes
and videos and abs and as you will see
here in the store there is a wide
variety of applications that we have
that you can add and I will just go to a
multiple-choice quiz hair and select
that to add and you know let's take
something like what is the nick name of
Seattle and I will not worry about my
Spelling's right now i'll say shuffle
answers and I can say Emerald City I can
say the jet city because you know we
have bowling out there so there's a
variety of cop you know combinations i
can put and then just with a single
upload button that I have out hair I can
publish it and you will see the kinds of
explanations you know that for there and
then we can get analytics and usage so
let me stop there give ya know that's
brilliant stuff you showed us it's
really quite as simple as PowerPoint
obviously much more sophisticated I can
see how students would be much more
engaged and because I know we've got
some online questions asking but what
about from the teachers side of it you
said you've got the analytics business
you can see the completion rates what
they're focusing on when they're
stopping yes that stuff right yes that's
fantastic stuff guys thank you Andy anup
a a better way to teach hard to deny
that where should folks watching Gulf
they want to try out once again
officemax mixed office calm is where
they should go and just to close I think
you might want to look at what are some
additional users how grad students might
use it Andy well for example we all give
talks and usually what we do after the
talk is over is we put our powerpoints
or a PDF on the web
and that's not a very good record of
what you actually did with mix you can
get the entire life session you can see
the annotations come up so it provides
you with a much richer record and you
can use that same style for example all
of us practice our talks I make all my
students go through at least several of
those practice dogs well this is a
wonderful tool for again live recording
and then together reviewing and saying
that didn't quite work you need to fix
that slide but not on the basis of your
memory yes is what it remembers
freestyle it's good enhancement well we
thank you and the teachers thank you
gentlemen we appreciate your time today
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
