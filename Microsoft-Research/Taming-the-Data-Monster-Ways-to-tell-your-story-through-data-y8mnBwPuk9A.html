you
good afternoon my name is Frank Martinez
and it's a pleasure to have nemaha Park
visit MSR today to share his thoughts on
not only data visualization but some
mobile thoughts around data and
storytelling we met an info camp Seattle
this year and which was a great
conference and it was an opportunity to
see named hose thoughts but also to
engage on what he's been thinking about
and work he's been doing and sounds like
he's been flying around a lot lately
work with the Gates Foundation recently
and I think he was just returning from
DC so I'll turn it over to namm ho thank
you I was actually expecting a room full
of people but right right exactly so
today I'm I'm going to give the
presentation should I be looking this
way or this way that's kind of weird but
I'm going to give a presentation about
how to tell your story through through
data but that's that's I'm going to try
to weave two presentations into the
space of one time slot actually the the
the presentation about visualizing and
telling your story through data is you
know interesting but it's maybe a lot of
the stories that you've already heard so
I'm going to try to go through that
really quickly and get to some of the
stuff that I've been thinking about
lately and that second part is more
about storytelling to through through
through mobile environments through
mobile devices and how that's involved
and my thinking around that so hopefully
we can get through those two
presentations within the hour allotted
to me so let's jump into the first
presentation just a quick intro about
the organization that I work for I work
for 401 communications which which is an
organization that's been around for
maybe 15 years we've we've done about
and we've worked with about 500
organizations on about 1500 projects
mostly in the nonprofit space so we
the web strategy and digital
communication strategy for mostly
predominantly nonprofit organizations
and issue based organizations the Gates
Foundation is one of our clients robert
wood johnson foundation we've worked
with the UN the World Bank and the IMF
as well as a whole you know collection
of smaller organizations who work on
very important issues so my role right
now is I am the Regional Director of the
Seattle practice and also the west coast
practice but I'm also the director of
mobile services at forum one
communications so a little introduction
about me actually so so i was born in
seoul in 1969 so that's where soul is
when I was born you know the in 1962 the
GDP of the the per capita GDP Oh of
Korea was $62 which is kind of amazing
and when we had the Olympics in 1988 it
was just under four thousand dollars I
think and now Korea is has a really
booming economy as you know Samsung LG
hyundai-kia the whole Korean brands and
and it's just over twenty thousand
dollars so I've seen everything when I
was growing up I used to play with dirt
but now you know you have cell phones
kids playing with cellphones II say so
in the in the in the span of one
generation I've seen you know incredible
change so this as well as born and in
1970 because of my father's job we went
to robot which is in Morocco in 1971
went to London in 1974 we went back to
Seoul back to London back to Seoul and
back to London back to Seoul and then
for grad school I finally went to New
York the first time actually living in
the States and then just before nine
eleven we moved to washington DC away
where i got married and a lot of changes
happened to my life and that's where i
started with formal communications
in 2007 I returned to Korea you know to
give my kids an opportunity to you know
experience the the Korean culture and
also had some opportunities in Korea
that I wanted to pursue and then in 2008
I had I worked on a project in Hanoi
designing the 2030 plan for urban plan
for Hanoi there was an incredible
experience and then in 2009 I went back
to Seoul and then in 2011 ended up in
Seattle I started again you know have
formal communications return to my old
job and and now i'm in seattle right so
this is a this is a one way to represent
my life through through data I mean this
is data visualization right another way
to represent my life I guess is you know
18.5 years in Seoul point five years in
hell away nine years in London one year
in robot that I have no recollection of
and seven years in New York six years in
Washington DC and three months and going
on in Seattle so I mean that's another
way to represent my life okay here's one
more way so I studied architecture and I
went to college and I went to grad
school in architecture and practiced
architecture for about two years so
that's including all that experience
there will be nine years of architecture
I worked in user experience and
designing systems for about seven years
of working web strategy for about five
years and I've taught computer aided
design and other kind of teaching
engagements for about three years web
development for two years open design
for one year and then I worked for
nonprofit a foundation for one year so
that's another way to represent it and
if you kind of break it out these all
the kind of virtual environments that
I've worked in and these are actual
physical environments that I've worked
in no no they don't actually mean
anything and the as you can see the
numbers don't really add up to my age
either so these are just you know there
are some overlaps you know like user
experience and you know web strategy
there's some oval
there but I just wanted to show you that
I have been moving back and forth
physically in between different
countries but i've also been moving back
and forth between the virtual worlds and
the physical world and i constantly kind
of meditate around you know what's
virtual and what's physical so in this
part of the tour going to give you a
couple of examples you know six ways to
tell your story through data I mean data
is everywhere around us and through the
internet I think we are experiencing a
whole flood of data that we really have
to find ways of kind of finding stories
and finding deeper ways to engage data
so I'm going to talk about six ways we
can tell our stories with data three
simple ways that we can get started and
hopefully we'll have some time for
discussion at the end so let's jump
right in so the first technique I guess
is you know speak with numbers this is
this is charity water this is a capture
from maybe a year ago but basically
charity water is is an organization that
sells really expensive water and all the
proceeds actually go to helping people
in developing countries have access to
to clean water but basically that that
is that's the gist but you know how can
they explain the immediacy of this issue
through numbers right 1 billion people
right almost a billion people on the
planet don't have access to clean water
I mean thatthat's just you know that
figure alone is kind of mind-boggling
but in terms of what they've been doing
it's like 2524 projects funded so far
and about a million people get clean
water through these projects also one
hundred percent this is really important
for that one hundred percent of the
public donations go directly to water
projects I think that's one of the
missions clear mission that they had and
that is communicated very clearly
through the numbers and you know just
twenty dollars can give one person clean
water for 20 years so I mean it's not
something that's out of your reach and
they communicate that very clearly
through the numbers that they have
selected to express themselves
this is the one campaign once again one
of the things that they focus on is
maternal and child health and instead of
you know writing these long kind of you
know text descriptions about what they
do they can actually jump you over to
quick facts you know 8.1 million is the
number of children under the age of five
who die each year so that that once
again is a very hard-hitting number
about 300,000 mothers die each year due
to pregnancy related causes and eighty
percent of maternal deaths could be
prevented if women had access to basic
maternal and health services so just
these three figures alone tell you the
message and that is you know you don't
have to have big data sets you don't
have to have to have like complex graphs
just talking with numbers is really
clear sends a real clear message you can
also tell your story by revealing the
change within the numbers right this is
something that I think you know this is
visit mix I think this is clear fellated
to Microsoft but I mean this is an
amazing sight talking about obesity in
the US the data go back goes back to
1987 and these white shirts are the
states that don't have to any data so
these aren't really thin states I mean
these are the states that don't have
data collected at that time but
basically what you can see here is that
the the state with the highest level of
obesity is North Dakota at eleven point
two percent right just keep that in mind
11.2 percent let's zoom ahead to 2007
and this is what it looks like right
everybody has everybody's collecting
data and 32 two-point-six percent is the
highest level of obesity of any state
and if you take a look at the lowest
level of obesity Colorado 19.3 percent
which is still higher than the highest
level of obesity in any state in 1987 so
just by revealing change and you can
animate this change actually if you use
a slider just by revealing change this
tells a very powerful story that you
really can't which is
really hard to tell through any other
means you need to focus on the story you
need to find the story and you really
need to focus on the story here's a clay
shirky I'm sure you you know pretty well
wrote this book recently called the
cognitive surplus and it talks about the
fact that with with the internet and
with the availability of tools that you
can actually create things with he's
basically saying that before the
internet everybody the main kind of
casual activity was television viewing
and that was really you know a lot of
people were just spending lots of time
in front of the TV but now with the
internet you have an alternative to
television where you can actually start
creating things and so this is a really
interesting graphic two billion hours a
year spent watching TV by US adults
right and 100 million hours is what you
need to create Wikipedia right so I mean
this is a pretty amazing story not even
not even one year of you know all the
people watching TV but you know a small
fraction of the time expended watching
TV if you actually provide an
alternative to TV where you can actually
create stuff this is what happens and
just you this graphic alone reveals that
story very effectively this is a this
client that we've worked with and they
created a this 56 page report i think
around appalachian state's around the
educational system in Appalachian
state's and how they were faced with a
lot of challenges poverty high dropout
rate and other things that really was
affecting the outcome of of the
educational system you can read the 56
page report you can take a look at all
the data sets you can download them and
you can you know look at them but what
is the conclusion here of this 56 page
report of course you can read these
bullet points right you know but you
know reading the bullet points don't
it's not something that is really easy
to do and also at the bottom it says to
accomplish
above we have compiled a comprehensive
data set from various sources of
existent data and conduct a preliminary
descriptive analysis using selective
variables results of that descriptive
analysis are presented in this report I
just tell me what what it's about so I
mean so what is the tweetable version of
this report right what is the 140 pay
for 140 character conclusion to this
report and you know we we worked with
the researchers and then they they hate
doing this you know they don't want to
boil down years of research into
something that is you know so short
because it's they want the whole breadth
of that report to be absorbed as a whole
but of course nobody has that time
nobody has that attention span to be
able to go through and pull through
every single thing every single word in
that report so I mean ultimately
tweeting something has a greater impact
sometimes than actually having a few
people actually read the report having a
lot of people see the tweet it may be
more effective than having a couple of
people read the report so we actually
forced them to create a tweetable
version and this is what they came out
with despite financial and demographic
challenges some school districts are
actually succeeding right so how do you
represent this how do you take the data
how to represent this in a visual way so
we work with them in this creating this
visualization so you can set up some
challenges on this side and you can
actually see what the results of those
challenges are so the challenge here is
you know the you know the Graduate you
want to set up a challenge which which
says the graduation rate is greater than
ninety percent when you want to find
schools that have that kind of
graduation rate district budget per
student is less than eight thousand
dollars and percentage of students
eligible for free lunch is greater than
forty percent so these are pretty tough
challenges but still you see these
pockets of schools which are actually
rising above those challenges so this
actually tells that story in a very
visual way you need to provide also
provide context in order to tell your
story through day
this is kind of an interesting graph
this is the billion dollar gram so
everything is in billion dollar dollar
increments right so it's kind of
interesting when you actually compare
things that aren't in the same space so
for example if you talk about defense
spending you know it's always talked
about in the context of dis fence
bending it's so much more percent you
know more than last year but that
doesn't really give you a bigger picture
on things so when you start comparing
things that are outside the context of
whatever you're talking about actually
presents come somewhat you know
interesting findings so for example 465
billion dollars is what is needed to
feed and educate every child on earth
for five years right that's that's
pretty amazing and if you take a look at
this you know 200 million dollars is the
entire debt of African nations to the
Western nations and then you take a look
at something like that Iraq war
estimated total is 300 billion and the
worst case scenario total cost of the
financial crisis to the US government is
is this amazingly large figure saving
the Amazon is relatively cheap when you
come to when it come to you know when
when it compares to those kind of
figures and you know even Walmart's
revenues for a year you know 352 billion
is you know so once just take a look at
these things in different contexts you
start to realize the magnitude of some
of these issues what you think this is
guesses you know what this is what you
think it wasn't right so what what is
this what do you think how I guess oh so
it's really hard to tell if you don't
have any context right it's just numbers
but if you do something like this it
actually immediately you start
recognizing what these numbers are about
so average rainfall in certain cities in
the US San Francisco Seattle Chicago New
York and Miami if you do something like
this it's easier to read the numbers
right you realize that darker the colors
the darker the color the more rainfall
you're getting
if you do something like this forget the
numbers right numbers don't really
matter that much right when you talk
about inches of rain you know you have a
vague sense of how much rain you're
getting but if you do something like
this you realize in Seattle in
january-february much is very rainy as
you already know I'm about to find out
but I because i arrived in you know
August which was very dry and which was
really really nice and it's still very
nice but apparently it's very rainy it
in the winter in seattle but i can see
that i can see that through this graphic
right and you can compare you know
january in different cities immediately
you don't have to actually read the
numbers you can actually take a look the
graphic and see the story right there
you can go a step further and actually
locate it on a map so if you're living
in New York and you want to travel to
seattle in january you just do the
slider and you realize it's going to be
very rainy in january in seattle oh this
is this is the scary part for a lot of
researchers you know you researchers
want to tell the stories themselves but
you know sometimes it's actually better
to lose control and let the users
explore discover and control the data
but in you know one thing that you can
do is limit the level of control so that
you see that clear message if you give
them full control over the full data set
of course they're not going to find the
story but if you give them limited
control within certain parameters you
can really allow them to explore and
find the stories themselves so this is a
so who lives here and who can afford to
live here this is a map of New York and
it talks about the income levels of
people who live in certain areas so
right after I graduated I moved to you
know you know East Williamsburg which is
about right there and it's a it's very
industrial and and it's full of artists
but basically Brooklyn if you take a
look right after I graduated I wasn't
making that much money I was working in
school you know extremely low income
which is 20k very low income which is up
to 40 k low income which is up to 60 60
k and moderate income and middle income
and then very high income
basically I was right in this area
low-income right and obviously Brooklyn
is a place from a person like me at that
time if you take a look at Manhattan
where I went to school you know upper
west side look I mean students can't
live here right look I mean students
have an extremely low income right but
it's basically people who have you know
model to middle to you know high income
that live in that area so obviously
that's very kind of prohibitive of
anybody with with income levels below
there but as you can see the graphic
actually represents that very clearly
and very well so what's really important
here is that once you start to get the
interest going you can actually point
people to the actual data and that will
give them context in terms of
understanding that data so you give them
a primer and then you provide them with
the data find out more right there so
this is a this a project that G
initiated a couple of years ago you know
getting some artists and and web
developers to really visualize their
data and this this one actually gives
them some level gives the user some
level of control where you can actually
take a look at all these appliances that
you find in your house and you can see
how much does each appliance cost to use
in dollars you can also manipulate it so
that you can see in what's the year and
also the state that you're living in so
it gives them some limited control this
is the this is the one that uses least
amount of electricity electric can
opener I don't have fun I don't know
anybody who has fun these days who opens
cans these days right I can't remember
the last time I opened it camp
apparently it's the one that uses the
least amount of electricity one that
uses the most amount of electricity is
air conditioning right so let's look
somewhere in between no toaster in
Virginia it I mean for a year you're
spending three dollars and seventy cents
in a trustee for toaster let's compare
that to Washington three dollars and
three cents it's actually cheaper to run
a toaster in Washington then
is in Virginia which is which is good
but you can manipulate the data in
various ways to take a look at that so
you're providing the user control to
find their own stories but within a very
limited scope and the next step in doing
that is you know once they start you
know controlling the data they can
actually tell the stories and tell it to
other people about the story that you
could you could probably tell but also
you probably didn't have the resources
or the manpower all the hours to be able
to tell and find the story so this is
the world bank in which which we've
worked with so they've done a really
amazing job in you know releasing their
data so as the UN so as the US
government releasing their data and
actually not just releasing it by
visualizing in very new ways so these
previously they had this tool where you
can just go and you know manipulate
certain parameters fuel researcher or if
you were like an expert of course you
know what exactly what you're looking
for but if you're like me you and me you
know who wants to you know check out
some what the story is obviously that's
not going to provide you with much
information but we then given prep
parameters you can actually see the
story happening because they're they're
giving you some tools to be able to see
and manipulate that data and very
visually compelling ways so this is Bob
Zoellick and he in order to promote the
use of data he actually created a
competition the World Bank rated
competition who global Alfred
development competition let's read what
he says about that as part of our open
data initiative we will soon announce an
apps for development competition
challenge in the developer community to
create tools applications and mashups
making it easier for users of
development data to make better
decisions and better policies to
overcome poverty Bob Zoellick like
what's the interesting word here I mean
who would have thought that that the
head of the World Bank would use the
word mashup right there that seems to be
completely out of his vocabulary right
so but that's how far we've come ap is
and other things
the level of you know the tools that we
have actually allow that to easily
happen and what he's saying is that and
we're going to relinquish control of the
data so you can use the tools that are
available to you and actually create
better tools for us so for the fraction
of the cost it will take for their
developers to you know brainstorm and
create scenarios and develop these
applications you can have like 10 or 20
or hundred applications for fraction of
the cost by releasing the data and now
allowing other people other interested
people to find uses for that data so
this is a competition that we've entered
I was a couple of years ago by sunlight
labs designed for America where they
took public health information and did
the same thing and this is what we came
up with County sin rankings so we
basically took this data and mapped it
to you know the seven deadly sins right
so high school dropout right income
inequality unemployment way these we
kind of mapped in a kind of fun way to
certain data points the greener things
are the better thing the better the
situation the more red the worse the
situation what you can do now is you
know take a look at where your sister
lives or where your you know where your
friend lives and start comparing a
county that they live with where you
live you can select the county and then
you can start comparing things right
which is a very unique and easy way to
actually take a look at these these very
kind of heavy data points so of course I
mean if you have you know really good
communication skills and you're a
superstar you can you know of course you
know instead of allowing people to tell
your story you can tell the story
yourself right and that's the case of
mr. hans Rosling he's a I mean I'm sure
some of you have seen the his TED
presentations but I mean he takes data
and Mesa incredible story out of the day
he's also created his own tools that a
company with
that begins with a G you know bought and
and actually incorporate it into their
into their you know G Doc's right so let
me let's quickly run through like a
two-minute presentation by by this guy
and and the tool that he uses so
basically this is health public health
data and he's found data all the way
back to 1820 and he's going to explain
how public info infant mortality and
income have a relationship to each other
per person per year and they lost one
fifth of their kids before the first
birthday so this is what happens in the
world if we play the entire world how
they got slowly richer and richer and
the ads that taste isn't it beautiful
when they get statistics you see the
importance of that and here children
don't live longer the last century 1870
was bad for the kids in Europe because
most of the statistics is Europe it was
only by the turn of the century that
more than ninety percent of the children
survive the first year this is India
coming up with the first data from India
and this is the United States moving
away here earning more money and we
would soon see China coming up in the
very far end corner here and it moves up
with matzo tune getting health not
getting so rich very died then things
your ping brings money it moves this way
over here and the bubbles keeps moving
up there and this is what the world
looks like today
let us have a look at the United States
we have a function here I can tell the
world stay where you are and I take the
United States we still want to see the
background I put them up like this and
now we go backwards and we can see that
the United States go to the right of the
mainstream they are on the money side
all the time and down in 1915 the United
States was a neighbor of India present
contemporary India that means United
States is Richard but lost more kids
than India is doing today proportionally
and look here comparing to the
Philippines of today the Philippines of
today has almost the same economy as
United States you're in the First World
War but we have to bring United States
forwards quite a while to find the same
health of the United States as we have
in the Philippines about 1957 here the
health of the United States is the same
as the Philippines and this is the drama
of this world which many called
globalize is that Asia Arabic countries
Latin America are much more ahead in
being healthy educated having human
resources than they are economically I
mean if you take a look at his loss and
he's an amazing storyteller he tells the
story through data which could be you
know incredibly boring and incredibly
like you know academic and he plots it
in a way and he tells the story in a way
that is it's it's actually a story it's
actually a story of of health health
improvements and how you know with the
same level of income you should have
vastly different stories in this world
today so this is the this is the tool
that he used and it's publicly available
so I mean three simple ways to get
started you know you really have to this
is you know more ruined oriented to
people in a non profits and
organizations who want to do something
with their data of course you know you
research communications program and
development you know all these folks
need to be inspired and there are a
couple of really good blogs that
constantly kind of highlight really good
data visualization
and the the use of you know telling your
compelling story through the data
visualization and very updated daily
with with really inspirational stuff but
what's as important as that I mean after
you get inspired you really need to find
the story that you want to tell and you
have to really focus on that story you
can't tell all the story and you can't
give everybody everything you really
have to focus on what is what is the
unique story that you really want to
tell through your data and I mean for
example this this is a very kind of
clear and very focused story and you
have to find the story that you really
want to tell and focus on it you need to
pull the players together storyteller
visual design and an engineer was
classically how you know what the team
you looked like in in terms of you know
visualizing your data and telling a
compelling story through data but now
there are all these tools available that
you don't really actually need all those
three people you can actually if you if
you have the inclination and if you have
the time and the desire you can actually
use these tools to actually tell the
story through your data very compelling
ways so that's the first part of the
presentation so well 30 minutes so i
have another 30 minutes to go through
the second part which is more you know
which a little more passionate about
which is a little less cooked but it's
it's a it tells a little more about you
know where things are going for the
future so any questions about this part
of the presentation
okay I'll just I'll just roll ahead okay
so storytelling on mobile so mobile
technologies is obviously something that
is catching a lot of people's attention
these days and if you take just take a
look at the statistics you know almost
almost half of the the US adult
population will have smartphones by the
year roughly about next year actually so
mobile technologies is fast growing not
just in the US not just in developed
countries but also in developing
countries and you know so what are some
of the things what are some of the ways
that we can tell our story through
mobile is is are the two things
storytelling a mobile the two things
that kind of came together in this
presentation so my story I think I've
already told my story so I'm just going
to skip over that but basically you know
how do we tell our stories these days
today through our mobile technologies
right previously this is a this is
Egyptian scribe if you if you are the
king if you're the Pharaoh of course you
would have this guy following you around
all the time and writing down everything
that you're saying and recording your
actions all the time right you know how
many people have enough money to have a
personal biographer right not too many
people so you have something like this
you have a you have a phone and if
you're hanging around your neck you can
you know I think not quite now I mean
the the iphone that you can get these
days the cheapest one is 16 gigabytes
you know the biggest one with the
biggest capacity of 64 gigabytes but you
know every 16 or 18 months it's doubling
for the same price so you can kind of
extrapolate and say that within the next
three years you'll have a device that
would have 256 megabytes gigabytes of
memory on on a palm-sized kind of device
or mobile device what that means is in
low resolution you can capture every
single second of your life by just
hanging this lanyard around your neck of
course you know the batteries will run
out pretty soon but still you have the
potential of capturing every single part
of your life
through a device thats hanging around
your neck so I mean you don't need that
scribe yes just a comment there right
exactly exactly so I mean I'm kind of
boring stuff but I mean that's where
technology's going there's other ways of
you know engaging and not just that way
but uh other ways of engaging telling
your story through mobile and this is a
this is a project that NPR has has
running for a couple of years they've
recently revived it is called StoryCorps
where you have these booths in certain
areas around the around the state's
Grand Central Station in New York has a
booth you're going with your friends
your family and other people and
basically you tell your story a short
story about your life and that gets
archived for you know forever right and
they've created a mobile application
where you can actually do that you can
record the story yourself and upload it
so I mean that's one kind of literal way
of telling your story and that's a
really easy way to do that other ways
are more automatic that was you actually
actually have to have a deliberate you
know you have to be deliberate you have
to bring your friend or your family
member and actually think about what
you're going to say and then record it
however I mean nike+ for example it
tells the story of your run right lots
of pain pain you know these were good
parts right flat parts right it tells
the story it tells a story of your run
automatically you don't need to do
anything all you have to do is you know
attach this little device to your shoe
and run and it tells the story right
there's other ways of telling you the
story of course you know all the
photographs that I've taken
automatically you know now with geodata
geo-tagging automatically automatically
record where I've been going of course
these dots are pretty big here but if
you zoom in actually looks at the
neighborhood level about where where
I've gone to and you know force quelf
course you can check into various places
and that actually tells the story of
where I've been which is which is kind
of interesting and you can have you know
other other tools this is a interest you
know a very simple tool that my kids
play with all the time it's you know
stop-motion recall
and you know they can actually put
together little stories about themselves
through stop-motion animation and you
know this is something that you actually
needed a little of equipment and you
need a lot of discipline previously but
with an iphone or you know any other
kind of smartphone these days which has
this application you can just have a
little stand and you know you can create
a short animation and I'll share with
you some really bad animation so right
nothing really here's another one but
you see what's happening it's nothing
but you're already putting a story into
it right here's an alligator or here's a
little penguin that meets and goes you
know and talks becomes friends and you
know and he invites him over to his
house right which is moving people have
an automatic ability to take a look at
you know situation and automatically
frame a story out of it so I thought
that was pretty interesting this guy
takes it to a real extreme his name is a
Nicholas Felton and he really takes it
to a real extreme in terms of recording
the data around his life and he creates
annual reports ever since 2005 he
created annual reports all the data
points that he's carried what he's eaten
you know what went with the time he got
up in the morning you know the places he
has been to uh what's kind of moving
however is I think last year she
actually his father passed away so he
gathered all the data he could about his
father going through all his you know
writing school reports and everything
and he created a report a kind of
factual and data-driven report of his
father's life which I thought was it was
very moving so that's our stories the
way that we tell our stories so how do
we view other people's stories these
days so of course there's there's this
guy you know presenting other people's
stories in a in a stream you know which
isn't the best way I don't think in
terms of communicating stew
I mean they give you a little snapshot
of what people are doing but it doesn't
really i mean the stream the the
newsfeed isn't the best way to look at
what people's stories are right i mean
it's just informational you just
discarded if you're not interested same
with twitter right it's not really story
driven so you know as much as this is
the way that we engage people these days
this isn't the best way to engage people
you know in terms of having a stronger
relationship with them it's not really
story-driven we want to share our
stories whenever people meet you know
what happened to me today this happened
to me today and people starts to
automatically stead you know sharing
stories and that's how we you know
communicate and have a relationship with
other people however if you take the
same information and put it into this
application which is called Flipboard I
mean it becomes an amazing story it's I
mean just the format it takes Twitter
feeds you know Facebook feeds and just
by very simple things no bolding certain
text making them bigger presenting them
with images makes it look like a
magazine and you automatically just like
when you looked at the animation and
started you know imagining stories you
start to read a narrative through these
things and you start to get really
engaged instead of just going through a
news feed you're actually being engaged
by the rhythm of the information that's
being presented to you which is you know
vastly and if it's it's a it's a vastly
different experience and a lot more
engaging this is a I'm sure I'm sure
some services in the states are doing
this also but this is a mapping service
in Korea and this is the actual building
that I used to work in I used to work on
the fifth floor in this corner which you
can't see basically it's it's like a map
and it's a street view / map right
what's interesting is that is this
actually right there it says 2011 August
this is when the photograph was taken
and when they started offering this
service the first thing that I did was
actually I i went to the street view of
where you
where I grew up in the 70s and you know
of course the building the house that I
grew up isn't there anymore it's it's
been replaced by this really ugly office
building but still the fact that I can
go back and kind of look at how it's
changed was I thought was incredible
what they've started to do is actually
exactly what I really wanted to do was
you know go back in time and see what my
neighborhood used to look like and how
it maps to what I remember about my
neighborhood so if you take a look
they've started to provide a history of
all the photographs so they go back to
2008 August right so let's take a look
at what it looks like back then so the
building was under construction right
which is really amazing so you can
actually have a history so this is other
people's stories right this is our story
but other people's stories this is this
is a an objective gathering of stories
that you can actually input into a
history that is being gathered what you
know bye-bye in this case Tom
communication which is which is a
internet service provider in Korea so
you actually have the data you actually
have the images you actually have the
history where you can start to weave
your story our stories into which is I
thought was really interesting and now
you know of course you can you can track
other people as well so you can share
stories literally at the same time in
real time you know with the people with
a small group of people around you I
mean Apple isn't the first you know
service to all for this kind of you know
availability but uh I mean the fact that
it's just default on an iPhone that's
just rolling out is is a big indication
as to the fact that we've come that way
that far in terms of sharing our privacy
publicly with people that we want to
share it with Foursquare for example I
mean if you did that 10 years ago people
will be outraged by all the privacy
concerns but now people willingly share
that information and that just shows how
far our kind of attitudes around sharing
information around you know store
you know sharing our stories through
mobile media has really come so this is
a treasure hunt I mean I mean people go
on certain treasure hunts with
location-based information so there's
also geocaching where you hide certain
things in very remote locations and you
just provide them some clues as to how
to find it and people actually go on
these adventures to locate these you
know little hidden hidden gems and hide
things themselves as well and there's a
whole kind of kind of gaming industry
around that so I mean it's it's a story
it's sharing so there's a community
there's a story and there's an objective
and that's enabled through mobile
technologies I thought this was a pretty
interesting the latest you know Picasso
exhibition in New York actually created
this poster which you know Maps one of
his iconic figures on a man hat
Manhattan map I'm not absolutely sure if
you actually went to these locations I
think there might have been a QR code at
each of these locations that gives you
something but I'm not absolutely sure
but I thought mapping something virtual
onto a physical environment I thought
was very interesting use of marketing
you know since I'm always always
interested in how the physical and the
virtual kind of interact with each other
so the highest level that we can have in
this environment I think the which is
unique which is something that hasn't
really happened in the history of kind
of communications or the history of you
know human society really is to have an
have a collective story gathering
automatically right the internet really
allows our collective stories to be
gathered in a way that simply was not
possible before you know you would have
your community's stories you would have
your individual stories you have your
photo albums but now you have a body of
data that's been collected every day
every hour every minute every second
that really tells a larger more
collective story this is a really
interesting project
they'll started originally it's called
you shaheedi which was originally
started in Kenya to track election
presidential election irregularities
this was started by a reporter who who
had a blog and she was getting so many
tips on a blog that she listed to
developers to create a mapping
application that automatically took the
data and located on a map right and that
has built out into an open source a
mapping tool which was used during the
haiti earthquake to to gather data so
all these points are actual people with
their cell phones are reporting on these
issues by public health infrastructure
damage fire menaces security threats so
they were actually texting you know 20
Shahidi this repository and almost in
real time gathering data as to where
some of the biggest issues were located
and this really helped the aided you
know relief agencies to really
concentrate on certain areas and address
security issues address public health
issues and other things so this is the
this is a graph of how the density of of
the frequency of the texting that was
happening so obviously right after the
earthquake there was a huge amount of
activity and then it kind of you know
settle down but still I mean this is a
collective story each of these data
points is a story that somebody is
gathering through their mobile device
and when it's gathered together you can
actually see a collective story and you
can animate this to see how the
information was pouring in and how was a
hat was being treated and you know Steve
Jobs you know as to say the OVAs he died
a couple of week you know a couple of
weeks ago but I'll you know when you ask
people how did you hear about Steve Jobs
is death I mean how did you hear about
it test manager caved and holes
Steve Jobs how did he find out about it
it's a good question i'm not sure right
how did you hear about it right right so
i mean in my office people found out a
bit first through twitter you know it
was like passing through twitter and
twitter you know people who heard
through twitter started to go down the
hall and tell other people started
emailing picking up the phone and doing
other things but first i think the most
rapid first wave of information passed
through twitter i think but you know the
funny thing is as I mean you know there
was a collective gasp you know through
through the US and other parts of the
world you know when they heard the story
nobody was kind of expecting it to be so
soon I think Samsung folks weren't
expecting it so soon a major competitor
and a no whole corporation that has very
antagonistic relationships with Apple
obviously so there was this collective
gasp you know and people start to tell
that story through any means possible
the interesting thing is in terms of
tweets per second it didn't even hit
number one well it's number five Steve
Jobs is death is you know 6049 tweets
per second which is at the peak number
one is beyond seas MTV Music Video Music
Awards 8868 tweets per second which is
kind of interesting yeah exactly haha
everybody was tweeting that away like
crazy right so I mean this tells a
collective story that you just couldn't
tell before I mean the twist per second
is an indication of what kind of stories
are really making the headlines you know
the traditional media didn't pick up on
these stories until a couple of hours
later right so this collective gasp this
collective moment is really captured
very well through the number of tweets
that are going through in a Twitter
system right and that tells a collective
story that simply wasn't available
previously
so you know yeah this is kind of
interesting isn't it car engine you have
somebody get a bit of women's clothes
fit right I think this is these are the
Japanese you know people like Pink
crazed tweeting you know because I mean
twitter is pretty big in Japan as well
right you know you'd expect certain
things to be pretty high on the list but
you know Brazilians are you know tweet a
lot and you know you know Latin America
tweets a lot as well so Brazil limited
they did you know that that's that's
huge news right so you know if Moses had
you know smartphones what would have
happened you know probably you wouldn't
have wandered through the desert like
this you know for 40 years right it
would have had GPS you know and he would
have said okay you know and you know
God's Word probably came through you
know an app on a smartphone assist Oh
actually God wants us to wander through
the desert for 40 years okay how am I
going to communicate that to the rest of
the earth is realized but what's
interesting here is that yeah tweet it
you're exactly how many trees the second
of that can let go through but the
interesting thing is you know in the
Bible it's the story I mean it's because
there's a rich story in Exodus and all
there you know and all the other books
that relate to this journey Leviticus
although that's pretty boring but anyway
you know you have you have other other
books it's it's a story that has the
richness and has the has the stories
that we can learn from that we can
reflect on right and if if that wasn't
captured then what would have been I
mean we wouldn't have that rich history
to reflect upon right so i think i think
stories I mean the mobile experience has
that potential to capture those stories
and you know we really have to look for
in a deep opportunities to have the have
the insights to be able to collect a
collective story I mean obviously this
story is a very very collective story
it's not just about one man Moses it's
about the Israelites and all the things
that they
went through through the 40 years when
they wander through the desert it was a
very collective story and mobile really
has that ability to have a collective
impact in terms of story gathering and
storytelling this is this is a kind of
interesting app that I recently stumbled
across so it takes my facebook it takes
my tweets it takes my flickr it takes my
blogging it takes all those things and
puts it together in a in a diary so i
can actually take a look at certain days
and i can take a look at all the
activities in certain given days it
takes four square information as well so
what's interesting is you know if i die
and if white kids you know take a look
at this they can actually reconstruct my
life through all these various you know
data points that collected in a single
collection and actually you know when
you have a story like that i mean right
now everything is kind of dispersed on
facebook twitter and you know not none
of these are coming together but if you
have something like this it really tells
a very very different story you know
there are periods when they have nothing
right and I'm thinking what did I do
back then I was depressed you know I
didn't do anything because I was
depressed and you know I couldn't I just
couldn't do anything right or maybe it
was a family tragedy or maybe you know I
was doing something else but where they
are you know peaks of activity I
realized that these were peaks of
happiness or peaks of activity where my
kids were born well you know when when
you know I started a new job well you
know so you have these peaks and dips
and you know they don't have that kind
of mapping of ability right now graphing
ability right now but I can see the
graphs in a happening in the future and
seeing the peaks and the dips with in my
life but I mean what would happen if you
plotted that in different levels right
what about our family what about my
community what about my nation what
about the whole world and when you start
plotting these things in different
scales you have a richness of story that
just wasn't available because the data
points weren't being collected in a
coherent way before so I mean you know I
spent one year working on the urban plan
are the opportunity
the incredible / tunity to work on the
open plan for Hanoi of 2030 and one
thing that I learned through that
experience was looking at different
scales of the city is the way that urban
planners really work I mean city as a
whole needs a certain amount of markets
a certain number of airports certain
number of hospitals and certain number
of schools if you take a look at a small
level it needs a certain amount of
recreational facilities and as you get
smaller and smaller and smaller all the
way down to a house there are different
needs that each of those things address
and urban planning and urban design
tries to address things in multiple
levels I mean thinking about just these
things are multiple scales and multiple
levels is is really hard but I mean it
has to do with my life the quality of my
life when it comes down to that I don't
want to be a product of you know victim
of just you know overall planning around
the neighborhood I want people to care
about me as an individual so that's what
I learned through you know this urban
planning and open urban design exercise
however I mean if you take a look at
data that I mean right now it has the
potential to do that and people don't
think of it in different levels and
different scales you know what does it
mean for individual person gathering
information what does it mean for the
family in terms of gathering information
what does it mean for the community what
does it mean for the country what does
it mean for the world and once you start
looking at that in various different
levels and being able to manipulate in
different levels that's when you know
real stories start to emerge and so is
that weren't able to emerge before start
to really take shape so this is this is
what the incredible person Jonathan
Harris he does a lot of work with data
this is a project that he worked on
called the whale hunt he went on a whale
hunt and he basically documented took
photographs in a veteran analog way took
photographs every at every 30 minute
interval and when he found that his
heartbeat was really beating faster
because of the adrenaline flowing
through him he would actually take
photographs at a shorter interval right
you know a whale hunt isn't isn't a
pretty sight and this is something that
he
really experience for the first time
this is one of the more kind of tame
images there are some really really
graphic images and you can tell when
those graphic images happen by the
density of photographs that map directly
to his heartbeat so over here is where
they caught the the whale and they start
taking it apart by cutting it up and you
can see you know what he's going through
just by the density of of information
that's flowing through this story so
that got me thinking right so I mean
this is this is a jawbone Jawbone's up
this is a new wristband that tracks your
health and tracks other metrics
biometrics automatically and you know
fees it to your smartphone so it's not
just about health information but what
happens if you start mapping there to
actual like photographs and other things
in your life of when you know jobs died
or when beyoncÃ© announced she was
having a baby you heart skipped a beat
right and that could be tracked by this
guy and what happens if Nielsen ratings
has have not just you know calls people
up and asked what they're doing and how
they you know how they're feeling about
certain television programs but have
these devices on people you know what
really excites people what really you
know once you start mapping that kind of
bio data with actual you know
informational data I think that's when
you start to have a different level of
collective information gathering and
collective storytelling which might be
really really compelling so this is what
the photographs look like on a on a
circle Jonathan Harris and another
project that Jonathan house really did
much earlier than that was the we feel
fine project where he you know scans
blogs and scans Twitter for the word I
feel dot dot dot and these are all the
things that people feel I've you know
and you can actually take a look at the
words take a look at and various metrics
and start you know manipulating the data
to see how people feel how women feel in
their 20s when it's sunny within
certain country on a certain date right
so that that's another way of you know
collectively looking at information and
you can actually take a look at you know
some of the the more common ones we feel
I feel better was a really good I feel
bad I feel good I feel right and you
have this whole like long tail of people
expressing their kind of feelings and
this site really gathering that
information and presenting in a very
compelling way so I mean once again if
you take a look at this photograph of
through a plane window you know you see
the bigger picture but you realize
somebody's having a story right there
right it's a big picture and you see the
roads and you see what's happening but
you know this is a neighborhood what's
happening around this baseball yard
what's happening in this house will have
what's happening in this neighborhood
and now with Internet information and
with mobile technology you can actually
go down to that level and start seeing
things in a different way and a
different scale so obviously
photosynthesis doing that incredibly
well I mean I can't you I'm actually
very honored to be standing here and
presenting because you know I respect so
much you know the stuff that's happening
in this in this building but uh this is
a book that I recently revisited this is
called city of glass by Paul Auster it's
it part of his new trilogy and the story
is a very it's a story about this man
who gets visited by this mysterious
woman who says i'll pay you to just
follow this old guy around and see what
he's doing so he follows this guy around
New York around the neighborhood where I
actually went to school and he starts
and you know trying to make sense of
what he's doing he's picking up things
here he's buying stuff there he's
actually walking around the neighborhood
in very random ways and he's thinking
actually it's not just random maybe he's
actually doing something in a very
deliberate way and he starts mapping it
on a map maybe this looks like a hand
maybe the that that looks like a
butterfly on em you know maybe there's
some meaning in this so as he digs
deeper and deeper into this finding and
meaning of this old man's story he
starts losing his story and in the end
he disappears
right so I mean that talks about what is
the meaning in the information and once
we start losing sight of the meaning
within the information that's when we
start losing ourselves in a more
abstract way so we really have to
instill just looking at the data as it
is I mean stories actually allow us to
have a hook allow allows us to have a
meaning allows us to find the meaning in
this flood of data that we're looking at
so this is something that you know
somebody did in on a map and you kind of
look at the way that they're marant
meandering it says I still haven't found
what I'm looking for I thought this is
kind of a good kind of indication as to
you know where where things could be
going if we don't really have a story to
tell through the information that we
present so that's it that's that's my
kind of meandering thoughts about mobile
and the and storytelling and how when
what is possible now we have mobile
technologies and have all this data and
all this computing power at our disposal
