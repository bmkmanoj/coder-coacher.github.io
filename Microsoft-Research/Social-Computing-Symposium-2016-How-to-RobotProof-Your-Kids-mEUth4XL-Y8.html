education is an interesting space and
I've been trying to think about
education differently than it has been
so let me start with a proposition of
what it ought to be which won't sound
all that shocking education should be
about producing happy healthy impactful
lives and letting society reap the
benefits but let me step it up a notch
it should be explicitly and measurably
and solely about those things so let me
talk about how I came to that conclusion
how it relates to listening machines and
why I think this is crucial not just
from an education standpoint but quite
frankly from a civilization standpoint
so I already referenced the fact that my
wife and I did some work once for the
University of Phoenix on a project to
design a system what it did is it
listened to college students undergrads
in a biology course and MBA students in
an economics course so these are
University of Phoenix one the one
positive thing you can say about it is
they've got a lot of data um so this was
ten thousand undergrads and twenty
thousand MBA students and what we
listened to was their online discussion
forum data so this was a required part
of all of their courses faculty would
post a question to a week and they had
to respond five percent of their grade
we didn't look at their homework we
didn't look at their tests we didn't
talk to the faculty we didn't use the
textbook there were no experts involved
we designed a system that simply learned
biology and learned economics by
listening to the students talking to
each other now clearly it didn't know
normative biology it didn't know right
from wrong but it knew how students
thought about it how did we demonstrate
that our goal wasn't to building an
automated grading system but we thought
okay we we have the system by the way
I'm skipping all the technical details
if anyone's interested in the networks
and so forth talk to me afterwards but
we built the system we simply put a
logistic
on top of it given the state of the
network predict the grade this person
McGann okay great
20,000 new students 10 thousands in each
course with new faculty and new
instructors entered the system at week
one we knew a grade they would get just
from them talking to one another that's
it
as the course progresses five weeks for
the biology six weeks for economics we
knew with greater and greater accuracy
what they would get wrong or right on
the final exam and then in the end on a
100-point scale we were in two points of
everyone's final score in the course
again only from the discussion forum
data on novel assessments with novel
faculty now it's a very top-down
curriculum for any of you academics in
the room so that was certainly
consistent across all of the classes of
these courses and there's a lot of
things you can run with right from there
if we can predict the final exam why
have it why waste not just the exam time
but also probably the weeks of prep and
in such a compacted course what is the M
what does that mean for standardized
testing if you can predict all of these
things but let me pause there and make
vague reference to something I talked
about last night so we published a
series of papers both at places like
nips and places like educational
journals about this work and then I
started as chief scientist of a company
called guild that was where we built
this giant database of 122 million
working professionals and we predicted
their career outcomes so guess what
wasn't predictive your grades your test
scores the university you went to your
skill sets all of the things that
education is focused on was not
interesting just didn't provide any
educational value a CS degree in
computer science sorry a bachelor's
degree in computer science from Stanford
turned out to only be a very modest
predictor of your ability as a software
developer you need to know how to
program to be a programmer but beyond
that it doesn't tell me anything in fact
the things that we found that we're
predictive were fascinating and I'll
kind of get a little bit into what they
are
but they're fascinating because they
were just as predictive for a
twenty-year-old programmer as for a 35
year old salesperson as a 50 year old
CEO as the world's best skateboarders so
redbull invited me to come down and yeah
I was on the plane thinking why the fuck
am I going to Santa Monica to visit red
ball but it turned out these were really
interesting people and they showed the
same patterns of behavior that we were
picking up when we followed people's
Twitter feeds and we read the bio
sections on their LinkedIn all of this
stuff and by the way that was the most
interesting things for making our
predictive models was the unstructured
data that people were generating
themselves structured stuff was
interesting to have but boy when you
looked at like the bio section rather
than the skills of the work histories of
places people so rich and so informative
but what's interesting not only is it
was predictive across all of those
wildly different job verticals it's the
same stuff that literally decades and
decades of Education literature shows
are predictive of the life outcomes of
four and five-year-olds so my wife and I
wrote a white paper about this and we
called it meta learning which is a bit
circular because really was just all
these constructs that have been shown to
be predictive so roughly speaking they
fall into four categories general
cognitive ability so things like working
memory span and long-term memory ability
attention metacognition so this is
problem-solving personality and mindset
sothank grit and Carol Dweck's work and
mine said I just gave a TED talk about
endogenous motivation and then finally a
bit of a catch-all of things that
roughly correlated together of
creativity and emotion so these were the
things when we looked at a salesperson
really told us that they would be
effective and it turned out even there
we can do some listening machines work
how do we one of the one of the
constructs
personality and motivation is endogenous
motivation so this is that that drive
that comes from within and it is an
opposition to exogenous motivation which
is largely sensitivity to incentive
systems praise and punishment and
bonuses and so forth endogenous ly
motivated people both my own research
and in reams and reams of others as a
population vastly outperformed
exogenously motivated people well that's
interesting because the entire way that
we structure our companies in our
classrooms are exogenous it's all about
grades it's all about incentive systems
bonuses and threat of firing so what do
we do we simply looked at things like
repository behavior software developers
pushing code to repository or sales
behavior when are people making sales
with respect to their sales cycle every
company I've ever worked at 95% of your
sales come in the last two days of the
sales cycle well who consistently made
sales the day afterwards there's no like
inherently logical reason they should be
your best salespeople
but when you do little things like a
Fourier analysis on that time series
behavior you see inevitably the wider
your sales behavior the wider your repo
behavior the better performance and the
more productivity that person showed
invariably
they were your most productive people
and the same thing in the classroom so
I'm gonna just drop that thread and come
back to education I about a year ago
left field returned started a company
called soco's and we thought let's take
the work we done predicting grades and
trying to teach content and say
something really ambitious what if we
could put microphones in the classroom
with migrant kindergarteners record
everything they're saying and everything
that gets said back to them and then
literally predict their life outcomes
how long they'll live how far they go in
their education how much money they make
across their life and how happy they'll
be these aren't arbitrary constructs
this is what the literature tends to
look at and in longitudinal studies
tracking people across their lifetimes
and it turns out at least in an actuary
sense we can do this so this this was
originally an idea I throw it on stage
giving a keynote at South by Southwest
and this women occult they're all
anthropologist at ut-austin wrote an
email to me saying we can do this we
want to do this and we want to get
started today that's where the South
Texas migrant kindergarteners came into
the mix and but here's an additional
proposition that some of you but not
ever all of you probably don't take into
account which is how do we do this in a
school that can't afford it so if you've
ever heard of it there's a there's a
project called Providence talks where
they have this little thing called Lena
and it's very expensive but they put it
in all of the kids in the providence
school system recording everything just
like I said everything they said
everything that gets set back
interesting fascinating things I can't
do that in Liberia so I'm not interested
what can I do with Radio Shack mics what
can I do with three made Radio Shack
mics in a classroom turns out that's
enough for me able to regularly localize
people's voices attributed to a specific
speaker and then make observations it's
messy it's dirty it's imperfect but it's
enough that we can hang our hat on it
and make these predictions turns out
though it's a cursed crystal ball if I
tell anyone the outcomes of these these
predictions it only makes things worse
so instead to finish up we decided to do
something very different well suddenly
simply send a single text message home
every night to their parents here is the
one thing you can do tonight though of
the biggest impact on your child's life
all designed out of this literature of
what actual interventions that actually
predict and change life outcomes make a
recording with low quality easy to
deploy equipment and then send a simple
text message home so we've now built
that into a product and we're working to
deploy it now in rural China and in
Kenya and Nigeria in Dallas and
Louisville and looking for partners to
do it in other places in the world so
I'll leave it there so much left unsaid
but there's an opportunity to be able to
change the world with nothing more than
simple little devices but there's so
many questions that come along with it
so one for you is how do you gain access
how do you deploy technologies in a
world with the vast majority of people
actively don't want to use them which is
the reality of Education and not to dump
on Coursera and Khan Academy but let's
do it anyways it you know it takes a
couple of Stanford professors to think
the hard part of education is just
making information available it no its
engagement it's not only the economics
of deploying extremely low cost
technology but it is the reality that
most people are simply not the people
that need it the most although you can
help everybody simply are not going to
be motivated to make use of it
I am so thrilled that Viviane could be
here because this this work both excites
me and I think it is fascinating but it
also raises for me really thorny
questions in to at least two vectors and
I wanted to throw two at you before we
probably move to everybody else the
first is this idea of predicting life
outcomes and what worries me in the way
that and many of the predictive tools we
have still let's be honest pretty clunky
we can do some things quite well but the
more complex the data we're using the
clunky at the prediction and what
worries me is when I see children being
attached to predictions is that we're
not allowing for all of the completely
complex strange turns in their lives
that could have enormous impacts on them
and if we've already attached a label
this kid is gonna be this type of person
this kid is gonna be that type of person
then teachers change the way they relate
to them they're like this is the kid
who's gonna be bright who's gonna end up
being a CEO this is the kid who's gonna
end up being the janitor does that
change though I think that does I think
that's exactly the curse crystal ball
problem is not of just our work lots of
people have this it doesn't matter I'm
not just talking about negative
predictions your child's gonna win a
Nobel Prize I just made it less likely
to happen for a variety of reasons
largely about stereotype threat and and
expectation it becomes very exciting us
at that point oh god I got to live up to
that now needless to say when I make
negative predictions where did anyone
make those sorts of things that also has
its oh yeah well I'm not gonna expect
much out of this child anymore
and it becomes incredibly frustrating
I'm not saying that the sorts of things
I'm talking about ought to scare people
that's appropriate the we shouldn't just
say yes or no to technologies we should
make rational decisions about this but
for example you know at age 25 no one
should have bet on me being alive at 30
much less ever having done anything
worthwhile with my life ever
period so how would a system have
responded to someone like me
well I hope one of the things that would
have responded and one of the things we
actually see emerging out of our own
system is recognizing some people like
me just are not going to do well early
in life and don't here are things you
can do with those kids as well so I I
don't just miss the problem at all the
only thing I'll say about it is with our
predictions which are nowadays are
entirely implicit so we have one set of
machine learning tools that make the
predictions and another set that
consumes it to make the intervention
recommendations and no human is involved
in that loop but of course I I don't
want the predictions to come true like
that's explicitly our goal is to change
the future so even if we're correct
hopefully the other side is correct too
and it deploys the right time the right
intervention for the parent lots of
questions I'll begin here and go back
okay so here's the scary thing right and
since you're the theoretical
neurologists I'm curious when you start
to look at the physiological and the DNA
implications to match up with these kind
of predictive datas where what becomes
the overriding piece of information the
data or the physiology so I'll say this
as a theoretical neuroscientist there is
no complex human behavior which is
uniquely defined by anything genes
development what-have-you it all emerges
that of a big complex thing and for
everyone and it isn't even the same mix
of those complex things I'm not afraid
of leveraging genetic data in fact in
general I think a lot of the fear comes
out of the idea that these things are
genuinely predictive and in a fixed way
so the implications for example strength
finders is typically that this is you
period you're done you know these are
your strengths play on them that just so
clearly isn't true let me give I
mentioned to some of you a really great
research study that was done in Kingston
Jamaica it started 25 years ago so
University College London helped design
an intervention system for them
the Kingston government sent social
workers to the home of severely at-risk
toddlers in the Kingston area so these
are kids who'd be lucky you know the
best chance of getting out of the slums
of Kingston is to go to jail one hour a
week for two years social workers went
to their home and worked with these not
the kids but their parents on what we
might call social emotional parenting
skills and then it ended they ran out of
money two years done 20 years later a
group of economists and UC Berkeley and
University of Chicago go down study
these kids they earn 25 percent more
than they're at risk peers they're
economically indistinguishable from the
general population and in follow-up
research they spend less time
incarcerated and they literally live
longer and healthier lives so there is
no sense I mean if you believe in
education then you believe people can
change that is a fundamental precept of
Education and so I'm only interested in
genetics in the sense that I can
identify something that I can actually
improve about somebody it's like with
epigenetics now what we're starting to
see is that you know the whole nature
versus nurture question is coming back
into the forefront in the sense of we
can change the genetic code based on the
nurture you know factor in a child's
environment and then that code can be
passed to the next generation for
benefit or detriment so one of the
aspects of that that's most closely
related to specific interventions we
have in our system is stress reduction
in the household turns out high-stress
households are a causal factor in things
like having a decreased working memory
span so to be Gort asked about it it
literally makes those kids stupider
which then you think the world's a
meritocracy
what about these kids that never had a
chance to be the person they could have
been so yeah that I mean these are
biologically it's complex ethically it's
complex but it is possible to make a
change so I'm curious what do you think
is the role because you you mentioned
how you're listening to things are going
on in the classroom and then using that
data and sending tips to parents
do you see if anything of the role as a
teacher and are you working with
teachers at all to use the data yeah so
we let me say we do this all the way
through some experimental work of
actually doing this in the workplace as
well but there the originally we were
focused on teachers and so for example
we part of the system for faculty where
essentially it came on like Clippy it
would pop up and would say during the
act of grading a paper hey Maria needs
more gentle feedback and underneath we
always provide the explanation so if you
text us what the parent texts us why we
text back to the explanation here it
just came wholesale student this is real
finding and a real intervention students
like Maria that received harsh or
critical feedback or 80% more likely to
drop out of the degree program even if
they're passing and it would literally
pop up in the moment of providing
feedback faculty knows the content they
know the grade they don't know how to
frame it we're gonna help them with that
so you mentioned this study showing that
you know these it had this great outcome
for these kids who had social workers
visiting their parents and you've talked
about how difficult you know setting in
this listening system is and you know a
lot of hard-to-reach places would you
have you considered doing a and also
this would be a useful kind of
comparative trial that and also it's
very hard to do predictions and it has
lots of ethical and privacy issues and
you're listening in on these kids that
maybe you would get some very good
outcomes if you just didn't do any of
the analysis didn't look at the kids
didn't put the microphones in the
classrooms but there's a lot of really
useful advice that you can send home one
text message at a time to the parent so
you have like 300 useful pieces of text
message that might be like you need to
sit down with your child for five
minutes today and talk about what they'd
like to do next weekend or you know can
you have you ask your child to help make
to help choose and make dinner like lots
and lots of useful things that you could
just send out at random apps one text
message and see like do you get
effectively the same results without any
of it but you're not doing interesting
to me a baseline of compare
for projects like text4baby which does
this with very you know prenatal and
postnatal mothers typically again from
at-risk populations there's a lot of
work going on at Stanford just again
taking text generically sending them to
parents so we have a point of comparison
and of course implicitly our system is
basically a itself a giant experiment
that's looking it explicitly actually
behind the scenes is comparing well we
could deploy all these different
interventions which one do we actually
expect have the biggest impact and what
would that impact be let me take this up
to the level of that faculty grading
tool while eleven percent of students
were like Maria and did vast I mean had
this catastrophic outcome if they got
critical feedback we found a similar
size population eleven percent nine
percent actually did slightly better
when they got a kick in the ass on a
regular basis so if I'm a faculty and
you're a completely a social person like
me I have I don't know anyone in my
classes so how would I possibly know
what feedback this person should get so
well I think there's a lot of baseline
good for those systems that's been shown
the the the core of it is that there is
a very genuine uptick in the performance
we can get and also in the relevance of
it so one of the challenges is to say I
told this to a guy named Mitch Kapoor
and he said oh why don't you just text
them read to your kids every night but
that's kind of like texting you know I
have this great app for parents to cook
for their families and every night it
texts you and it says cook for your
family that's nice but it one of the
things we find is by providing
personalized and not just personally for
the child but for the parent
recommendations is hey Dad
Maria's really interested in seahorses
right now take fifteen minutes and talk
to her about seahorses we didn't say
read because we knew he wouldn't be able
to find a book about seahorses we were
able to say seahorses because that was
her endogenous interest we've been
chatting away about it in the classroom
all week long so we were able to make
get something that literally in the
moment of having read it he could turn
to her and do it so there's real value
proven value in basic generic text
messaging systems for parenting and for
education but we found that we can
significantly improve on that
yeah so we're we're running the trials
to do those comparisons we have a final
question just over here you mentioned a
few countries that you're planning to
deploy the product and and I wonder what
are your thoughts about how differently
this is going to be received in all
those so that's an interesting thing we
actually found that we call it framing
but then the nature in which each of the
intervention recommendations gets framed
is actually really crucial so
interesting enough I'm gonna be really
generic about it but if I sent an
intervention to someone like me and I
just had do this thing then someone like
me will just do it when we sent it to
the parents of those migrant kids I'll
be blunt it came across as why is this
rich white woman telling me that I'm a
bad parent
so instead we'd say we'd frame it more
like hey it turns out if you do this
thing you see these neat results just
might want to know and we got roughly
two-thirds of the parents without any
incentive to use the system at all would
regularly engage with it and that we it
dropped dramatically if we were very
directive with them so we have found
that culturally we have to make
significant changes some of that we
build directly into it and we just sort
of tag up our interventions as being
appropriate culturally for certain
populations but also the reinforcement
learning model who also learns that
certain types of things are more
effective certain framings were more
effective with certain families to find
old burning questions very glad you
stayed a lot of past 25 this is so
interesting or fascinating
have you tested these cysts the
listening systems on adults and can
those prompts be self-directed you know
can I get a text message I just you know
I could use it but also just thinking in
terms of you know not only is this going
to affect HR departments the world over
but potentially but and if it does work
with adults does this hollow out an
entire core of middle management across
so business
so there are two points there and I'll
start with the first one because it
relates to we said I'm interested in
augmentive tools I don't build AI I
build glasses to help people see better
so my vision which we are working on in
in discussions and I'm gonna do work on
it while I'm here in New York is you've
got your one-on-one with your direct
report this week here's the one thing
you should focus on or your you've got a
team meeting here's the one thing you
should focus on not the content that's
your job but how to frame it and how the
queues a lot of this work is in bias and
discrimination but it applies
generically also we've worked with
adults in educational contexts as well
so this is big issues for us I when I
think of education I think of it as sort
of -1 through 150 yeah yeah Oh totally
self directed we we are actually doing a
pilot project with a high school and in
LA not that these are total adults but
they're acting as their own parents and
and sort of even though that tool called
Muse is specifically meant for parents
and young children they're just sort of
piloting it for their own experience
because they wanted to and we're
collecting that as feedback to redirect
it towards the self directed system I'll
keep this short how much how much of
what you're doing do you think ends up
modeling them the maze and not the
marble like in other words like you're
able to predict the system and not the
student so maybe a really immediate
response is if it makes a difference I
don't care as much what exactly it's
coming out as so in other words if I can
improve the health outcomes for a kid
and let's be explicit a lot of this like
particularly cognate general cognitive
ability and young children that is
things like stress in the household the
interventions are for the parent not for
the kid for the most part so really it's
a system that isn't just the child and I
hope I'm getting at some of the question
that you're asking the that
we're both measuring and trying to make
a change in but again then the end
result I'm trying to be very practical
about it which is if we really focus on
proximal easily measurable details want
to ruin a great thing build a test for
it and so those sorts of things tend to
go off the rails people exploit those
systems and the same terms that we've
talked about with all these moderations
tools so how do we instead you know
think about the abstract and if in the
abstract
making this change for this kid leads to
an improved outcome even it's it's not
literally about changing the kid but
sort of about clearing the path ahead of
them to be the person that they really
are meant to be anyways then I don't
care I just I just want to live in the
world where that kid is happy healthy
and productive and I and all of us get
to reap the benefits on that fantastic
