polished presentation here in the form
of markdown file alright so I gotta talk
about serverless slack blah people have
been talking about serverless thing for
a little while and I think it's
interesting so we've seen these big
ships can you guys see this at all no I
didn't think so is that better one more
I'm losing my eyesight to its cool then
your computer is weird they're good ok
so we've seen these things happen and
we'd like to think the messaging is
going to be a thing I hope it's a thing
I'm betting on it and we're seeing all
these different terms but what we're
talking about is BOTS and BOTS
effectively are this ephemeral agent
that acts on your behalf it doesn't have
to be this long form a conversational
thing part of the reason this is
interesting is because we're getting
these platforms and all these platforms
share an interesting characteristic in
that they're effectively web hooks slack
hipchat messenger can telegram kick
whatever so it's kind of like a pendulum
in the 90s we were really stoked on
servers because of the web in the early
2000s we were stoked on clients because
JavaScript became possibly acceptable to
use on the client the Google Maps
mid-2000s api's became big deal we swung
back to the server around 2007 mobile
became a big deal when we got back on
the client and now we're writing servers
again bots are just freaky web servers
which is kind of interesting so
simultaneously the smallest unit of
compute has become a function and this
is really significant the metaphor that
we've used in the cloud up to this point
has been a server which kind of makes no
sense when we're scaling we end up
having a whole bunch of these things
behind a web behind a load balancer and
you know it's it's a pain to scale so
the cloud came along and with the cloud
we've got these ideas of lambda
functions and it's accelerating if you
look at this thing on the side we're
getting more and more of these things as
time goes on
functions are cheap you get about a
million requests per month for free so
let that sink in it's free to do
computing now it's kind of big deal I
totally don't understand Microsoft's
pricing by the way to talk to someone
about that so I'm working I think I'll
begin we chose lambda we didn't choose
because we think it's better we chose it
because it was easy and accessible I
think you would be fine to choose any of
these solutions if you're interested in
them so i recommend you actually try
them all people think that they're you
know exciting thing is that compute just
got free the exciting thing to me is
that not so much that's free to do this
because there's always a business case
to build a server exciting thing to me
is that my deployment time is now in
seconds so let that one sink in right
now if I want to deploy a new bot
instance it takes me roughly three to
five seconds that's a huge accelerant to
market that's unheard of up to this
point this is a competitive advantage
for your team and this means that BOTS
actually have an advantage over
traditional delivery vehicles for
software so yeah that's really all I had
to talk about lots of freaky web servers
except for you don't need to run a
server anymore thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
