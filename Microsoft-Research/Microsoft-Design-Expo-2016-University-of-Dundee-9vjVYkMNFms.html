the United Kingdom with Auto
communication aid for autistic children
rolling I'm Connor and this is Sarah
we're going to be speaking to you today
and this is the rest of the team
bringing out auto so we have Sean kami
Andrew on Jana here as well so why did
we pick autism autism something is
really close to all of us as a team
whether it's a little brother or a
cousin weather condition or a family
member that works with autistic children
and we were also really excited to see
how we could implement the
conversational side of conversational
user interface and running alongside the
problems that autistic children have
with communication and so this is column
Collins my well cousin is 12 years old
and he has a specific set of behaviors
like the other artists that kids are we
spoke to the label him as a tested so
these include having trouble and social
situations having trouble expressing and
actually like displaying his emotions
this goes to the extent where he can't
even speak to his mom or his sister to
the people that are closest time in his
life's so when see when we sat down the
column we asked them who really speak to
and he came up with the idea speaking to
his favorite cartoon character SpongeBob
SquarePants so from this we took every
made a character I would promote a lot
more interaction between the child and
the actual device so another issue they
face is they get frustrated a lot less
things that wouldn't bother like you or
me and they measure this frustration on
a set of five scales what Sarah's gonna
we focused on the first four stages as
this is when the situation can be
controlled and brought down to a normal
level stages one and two is where the
child is ball clue deceptive so the
parent can top the child and calm them
down before the situation escalates
stages three and four is when the child
is unable to communicate verbally and
this is when alter would come in to can
the child
ode with our interactions now we're
going to present your project video
you
you
no I come
they know what
Thank that also will be very beneficial
and especially because it changes to the
child as an individual
see you later so he looked at three
specific types of people the child who's
the user so we wanted to get insight and
what they thought then we looked at the
pant and then teachers and in
researchers so he wants to gain their
professional point of view this is
Professor annular wall waller she
designs communication systems for and
with non-speaking individuals angela was
intrigued her author was predictable and
non-judgmental as also gave clear
outputs to the user we then spoke to
proof Julie Julie wall who's a teacher
who works with artistic children and her
insight was very valuable in our
research as she suggested that we
adapted auto to fit each child
individual needs we're now going to
present to your video research video
that sure there's a lot of things that
she feigns confusing and can be really
just chasing for them that it would be
an ideal time to set my Thornton and and
have something came for foreign sale so
we also went along on spoke to the
parents are the national autism society
which is one of the biggest charities
for autism and the UK and it became
really apparent really early that we
needed to make auto as more of our
guides towards conversation between the
child and the parent it couldn't act as
a sever between the two so another thing
they picked up on they absolutely loved
the tactile non-judgmental and and non
provocative game on top we're going to
and they also really liked the
characterization of auto giving the
child something to sort of look into and
trust so
from their feedback we ended up moving
on with the interface on top to design a
light game as a calming element we also
changed the base to make it a bit more
sober for child children and a common
theme that was brought up by a lot of
the parents was that if something had
happened to their child that was outside
of the parent supervision they and they
had already escalated a stage where they
weren't vocally receptive and then when
they came in and say the right point
football and something happened they
came into the house there was already
that server of connection between the
child and the parent they couldn't talk
to them and that could be first written
so the child would you normally go into
their bedroom lie on their bed and stare
at the ceiling mr. Coleman clean bought
by the parents so we thought we had a
projection on the roof to just sort of
grab their interest and draw them in to
interact with Otto it would be a more of
a non-invasive sort of passive way to
bring them in and once auto and the
child we're motivated to interact we
would start with our and light game and
that's quite game is designed to be non
frustrating and non-competitive so that
it's not going to provoke and frustrate
the child by losing it so the light game
is essentially a light little pop-up on
the dorm when the child puts a turned
over it the light will go away and then
when the trail takes sound off another
light will come up and they'll repeat
the process and this is me used as a
calming measure to bring them down the
stages to a stage where they are vocally
receptive and once the child is brought
down to a stage where they are vocally
receptive or also will start to try to
communicate so Otto will open up and
once this is open this is sort of a
signaling as Otto is going to speak so
adds to that predictable element that
artistic job in love so once Otto is
ready to communicate it will suggest
something from Otto's a I that builds up
a sort of relationship with the child to
understand the trail than what the child
likes so all suggest maybe put on a
light game or watching a movie and then
monitor the body language and tone of
voice of the child to then make a make a
decision whether it's a positive or
negative reaction if it's a positive
reaction that can build on this and go
forward with common tell them if it's a
negative reaction it'll take a step back
reassess and maybe go from a different
angle like watch a movie instead so once
the child is down to a level where they
are vocally acceptance unable to speak
also will send a text to the parent to
include them and to let them know that
the child is ready to speak on that they
might suggest playing a game or
something to distract the child while
they talk about the issue and solve the
original frustration and problem and
then once the child is finished speaking
to auto if he doesn't want to interrupt
you can just tell him go to sleep and
that's also a way so thank you folks
that's us if you have any questions we'd
be happy to answer them
which one okay I though that the
disconnection between a like a the
progression of interactions through an
object evolving into like a full-on
characters design I thought was actually
really there's something about that that
evolution of the project product being
something different depending on what
kind of interactions you're having and
then eventually opening up and having
this sort of more clam like interaction
with the eyes and things like that I
thought that was really really nicely
done I think what was um what I let
myself wondering was uh what is what
exactly is the like the user journey
like what what exactly is the
interaction like what is the problem is
being solved and how are you how are you
going through that I you know I just
what I what I was having a little bit of
trouble seeing is actually what exactly
what the use case was that you guys were
trying to get and get at okay so and
give me so basically when the child gets
frustrated they can go into a state
where they are non-verbal so they're not
very receptive it can be really hard for
parents not being able to speak to their
child so they can't actually ask them
what's wrong because they'll just ignore
them and head this is usually when there
are these stages three and four they
just want to be alone they don't want to
actually speak to anyone and that's when
they are vocal reactions start to go
down and their physical reactions start
to go up so we looked at basically
having an introduction with physical
reactions so that they're more likely to
want to interrupt rather than being
probing and asking them questions and
things just straight away and then once
they do start communicate and it can
write and relay them to the parent yeah
and it seems in many ways the kind of
flip side to the previous presentation
and using using the technology for and
using the projection of just the you
know a certain amount of human
interaction for good i mean a non
judgmental
disembodied anyway it's interesting how
it how it plays with the previous one I
mean it and I can see how it could sort
of moving from an object and a piece of
technology and sort of bringing on the
human interaction instead of setting the
stage for a parent interaction I could
see that it be incredibly valuable for
that and you know I I don't know how
many of us sort of but not fully
understand the the problem space but
sort of trusting that I mean you
described it actually very well with the
phases and I could definitely see that
this would provide an amazing solution
and it was really well presented and and
the fact that you have a prototype here
is quite impressive too so again thanks
thanks a lot and that's actually
interesting how you've attacked the
problem at a whole point of address the
problem and a whole bunch of levels and
with a fairly high level of detail and
it's so I really appreciate that from
the design perspective I look at this
thing and I am overwhelmed about two
things first of all I got goosebumps
watching that video just when the little
kids sort of wrapped around and it's
just like how dare you tear my emotions
that unexpectedly it was really
effective but it's also a fascinating
how much personality you've gotten into
such a simple thing and and but also it
draws you in that because he's just
peeking out you have to lean down it's a
physical action which is really
important in this particular type of
situation and and where you have to come
in at intimate and so it is personal so
which makes it safer and in just the
eyes there's this some very it's really
easy to make things hard this it's
really hard to make things get that much
out of that little and with that
effectively and and it augurs really
well for what you're doing and it so if
the same qualities are affecting the
rest of your thinking it gives
credibility to that even when you don't
have time to go into the details in the
short presentation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
