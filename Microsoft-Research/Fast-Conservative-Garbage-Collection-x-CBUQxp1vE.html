you
hi hello everybody so I am giving this
talk next Wednesday oopsla so this is a
work title fast conservative garbage
collection by me and Stephen Katherine
so garbage collection is sooo big
lucious so GC implementations have to
stark choices they can either be exact
or they can be conservative so in those
to the current scenario is most of the
high performance systems use exact GC on
the other hand conservative GC is also
very popular but there is a problem that
is generally used only is less
performance system so systems that I
will not say like do not care about
performance but systems that they use
conservative GC more or less suffer from
poor performance so just have a look
what is the current state of the art
performance of the conservative GC so
here we can actually see two state of
that conservative GC 1 is the mostly
copying collector and one is the bow him
boehm dimmers and voices collector the
use case scenario Apple's WebKit use the
mostly copying the chakra vm for
javascript they use the BDW collector
and if we look at the performance so
this is normalized with a
state-of-the-art high performance xlg
see which is reference counting gimmicks
this is our work in last year oopsla so
mostly copying suffers from like fifty
percent and BTW suffers like 16
performer promise so in most of the
cases the sixteen percent slowdown is a
show stop so that is the current state
of the art so what is our goal at least
our goal is achieved same performance
with respect to a high performance x HTC
so that is our goal in mind as we start
our work based on that so why
conservative GC because it has some
advantages first of all you do not need
any cooperation from the compiler or the
runtime if you need to implement exit GC
then you need to have stack maps and
engineering stack maps is a very
challenging engineering work and also
conservative gcn able some compiler
optimizations like code motion
which is not available if we use GC Maps
or stack maps so it has got some
interesting advantages but what are the
disadvantages first thing it Nast it
needs to handle the ambiguous references
we will look at that just a slide after
that and as we show before it also
suffer from performance so our goal is
is design and implement a
high-performance conservative GC for
managed languages so what's now let's
have a look what is amigas references so
there there can be references from the
stack to the part of the hip and when we
do not have any GC maps the reference
may be a pointers so when we have a
pointers that mean we must need to
retain the reference and also all the
things that are transitively reachable
so we do not know because we do not have
a exact DC map so there if there is a
references from the stack or register to
the heap it might be a pointer so we
need to retain that and also all their
transitive reachable objects so what is
the consequences is known as excess
retention if it is not actually a
pointer then we are actually excess
retain those staffs so excess retention
is the consequence of if it is a pointer
then we have excess retention it may be
values so maybe just some integers but
the problem is we also need to treat
that as there might be a valid reference
so that means we can't modify them so
the and we need to pin them by pin means
if you not if we do not want to modify
them then we can copy them so we can
copy them just by pinning them so the
consequence is we have in the hip we
have maybe huge pin spaces those are
restricted that we can copy any of those
and next
for many GCS we can actually have the
metadata required for the GC in the
object not in the side so if we have the
metadata for GC in the object and we are
not sure whether it is a valid reference
or not we can't actually change that
metadata so if we need to change their
metadata then we need to validate before
updating any part of Jake metadata so
how we can do that we must need to have
some form of filtering that guarantees
that this is really a valid object so
those are the three consequences of
having ambiguous references so now we'll
just have a look at the what are the
state of the prior work so this is the
non-moving conservative collector so in
non-moving conservative collector we pin
everything so nothing gets moved so the
most widely used is the BDW it is a free
list a locator and uses a mac sweet
collector and the references must point
to start off a valid allocated and life
cell so in this way we can actually
filter all the stuff that are not valid
references and this was originally
implemented for a setting which is full
conservative so what is the problem with
this first of all as we saw in our third
slide very poor performance for marriage
languages and the settings that it is
currently used now the design that can
move anything is actually a very
conservative design next comes mostly
copy it's also known as Bartlett style
collector and has got many variants so
it is basically a classic semi space
collector but with to twist one is the
to and from space are not actually
contagious pages rather than a linked
list of discontinuous pages so when we
have a page that is referenced by
ambiguous route we just simply promote
that page we don't like those
that in that page will not move so that
means in the non-moving collector we pin
everything but in mostly copying we
actually pin page so it might happen in
a page there are like 20 objects but
there is only one route there is only
one reference to an object from the
ambiguous route but you can't actually
move those 20 objects because only
single object in that page is pin and
for the validation like the filtering it
actually interest in respect within the
page to find out whether it is a valid
reference or not so what is the problem
first of all semi space actually suffers
from huge collection costs so among all
the canonical GC semi space have the O's
performance and as we saw before the
mostly cup copying collector has also
got poor performance for managed
languages so next we try to understand
what's the reason behind the that
performance cost so in so we do the
analysis and we will have a look what we
find out so this is the number of routes
that is returned when we have an exact
GC and when we have a conservative TC so
this is like a fast study of these
things because in our vm now we have two
different way of GCS we have exact GC
and we have conservative GC that we
implement so we can easily do this
comparison what is actually happening so
this is average over 20 benchmarks that
we run and we find out the number of
unique exact roots is on average is only
98 so the unique references from the
stacks and register to hip and all exact
roots it is actually 2.2 or 21 times of
that so we have like twice breed and NC
and what about the conservative roots we
find out that there is only 4.7 times
conservative roots but among them only
one
six-time sorry unique so that means when
we have conservative roots is only sixty
percent more than the unique exact words
so it's not too much then we see the one
of the consequences of conservatism its
excess retention so we measured that by
running so we have simply to trace of
the full hip one with the exact roots
and one with the conservative roots and
we find out and the difference between
these is actually the excess retention
so the number of objects that are live
by the conservative roots is just 44
kilobyte more than when we do exact rice
which is only open so this is very
surprising because the usual like idea
about the conservative GC is that the
excess reduction is very high and
because of that we have poor performance
but we find out that for managed
language the excess retention is only 10
two percent of the whole rape so this is
very surprising then we find the next
consequences is pinned so here at the
first row so we we see that the actual
pin bites is only 14 kilo y which is 0
point zero five percent of the total hip
but when we have mostly copying then we
actually pin objects as well as other
objects that reside in the same page so
with mostly copying that number
increased to 462 kilobyte which is 2.1
percent so which is also pretty low
because when we have mostly copying the
pin bytes is only 2.1 percent of the hip
but interestingly among them out to 82
kilo byte are false flip in by false
step in means the objects that are not
actually need to be pin as but they are
pinned because they stain on the same
page with the object that needs to be
pain so the two thing that's very
interesting one is the excess retention
is very low and also the number of
object that needs to be pain
if we use mostly copying is also 2.1
percent so those two are thought to be
the main reason behind the performance
problem but we find out that those two
are very low so what is the actual
reason of the bad performance for so now
in order in our ranch I we have so in
our vm we have the exact GC so when we
have exact DC we can actually have
statistics for the exact roots and then
we have the we have the same GC working
conservatively so we can actually go
through the stat read what by word then
we do some filtering and then we can
actually find the number of conservative
roots at the same time right so if we do
to scan of the stacks one with the exact
GC and one with our conservative GC then
we have we can have those statistics
so those pointers we know exactly that
tells you exactly what the roots are or
you or you scan the stack and anything
that looks approximately like a pointer
heat-treated that's right that's right
that's over the real one from our exact
eight points of something and I don't
know what it is maybe well-formed people
get gorgeous we'll all references that's
right somewhere yeah so what we find out
they actually the real reason behind
this is not those two XS retention of
the number of pin objects but the real
reason behind the performance is hip
organization so here we will look those
collected again but now we will look at
their also at their exact counterparts
so now we have semi space and mostly
copy so semi space suffers flight from
thirty three percent so it's pretty bad
and mostly copying is also very poor
semi space have very good mutated
locality because it is just a bum
pointer but the problem is because it
has a very bad GC so that is why the GC

dominates it performance then the BTW so
we have marks with and BTW so
interestingly BTW is only like one
person slower than marks weight but
marks whip still suffer eleven percent
then a production GC and the main reason
behind this is it actually uses the free
least alligator and the freely suffers
from bad mutated locality and also
freely suffers from fragmentation so if
we have a bum pointer and we have a free
list the a locator so the eleven percent
like that performance is actually coming
from just having a different elevator
because we have a free list that suffers
a lot compared to a GC that have a
bumper intralipid and if we look the RCA
mix it actually have good it has a
marked region based web organization we
will leave that a little bit later which
is based on image and the performance is
pretty good which is like three percent
better than the production so again we
will reiterate our goal so because we
already have exact GC with a pretty good
alligator and performance so that is why
our goal is can we have a conservative
GC that perform same as the high
performance the exact GC we have so the
major point is sorry so the major point
is the problem is not the conservatism
but the main problem behind the
performance is hip organization so I
mentioned about our simox so instead of
mostly copying if we have RCA mix and
pinned object based on our say mix then
we can see this is the same step from
the previous slide but when we have a
mix or RCA mix the number of pin bytes
reduces from 2.1 percent to only 0.2%
because the pinning granularity changes
from four kilobyte to only two 62-56 pi
which is used by Enix
so if we use amex we can actually have
reduced the number of pin bites 20 point
two percent from 2.1 percent so what our
findings the direct cause of
conservatism which is excess retention
or number of Pinot objects is very low
and the main reason behind the
performance is the non-moving freely
steep structure so this is not a good
solution to use the free list a locator
because it suffers from pure bad
locality and also you are having a very
restrictive design that you are not
moving anything so those two are not a
good choice and we find out then imix
properties are very well-matched too
conservative cheesy names so what the
what is the so now we will just have a
look how a mix works so a mix is a
marked region base collector so here we
can see a mix works on blocks and lines
so here we can see a block with 32
kilobytes block and a block has separate
several lines so each line is only 256
byte so object can span lines but can't
spin blocks so if we just reconsider
mostly copying so in mostly copying we
have 4 kilobyte pages so in that case
object can only can spend pages so we
have a 4 kilobyte allocation threshold
so the allocation done is just
continuously among the lines and blocks
so when we do the GC is that got a
simple marks face so we mark an object
as well as its line so the
though the region that lines that are
not marks are free so that those can be
collected and amix also support recycled
allocation and defragmentation but by
recycle delegation we means so here is a
block suppose a block that has only four
lines so the alligator actually can
allocate into those two lines and in the
same way the alligator actually can move
the two objects in the last line to the
second line so that means it can
actually do the defragmentation and
their locator then can reuse the last
line also so those those two are very
interesting property of a mix then we
have RCA mix so our same exact chua
combines reference counting any mix so
what it does instead of instead of
having a marked bit for each line each
line have a live object count with the
reference car and with this instead of
having object reclamation we actually
reclaim lines so we just up the
collection granularity from object two
lines so what we got we have object
local collection of reference counting
so very fast collection but at the same
time we got the great me rhetorical
locality that immix offer and also we
exploit amix opportunistic copy so the
mix opportunistic copy is so you can
copy as long as the space permits it's
not like semi space where you need to
copy everything so you can have you can
do the copy suppose you have a copy
reserve of like one megabyte and you can
copy as long as you can feel the one
megabyte if the one megabyte exhaust
then you cannot you can mark the object
in place instead of copying them so
opportunistic copy is good because we
will see when we have like conservative
roots then we can actually pin the
objects and do a opportunistic copy of
all other stuff so by exploiting amix
opportunistic copy in reference counting
we can copy the new objects at their
first GC and we can also copy old
objects by the backup GC which is the
cycle collector so this is the first
reference counting collector that do
copy
and because doing copy we are
eliminating fragmentation socks a mix
collector combines reference counting
and a mix and gives us very good
performance so what are the
contributions we made so I we identified
the real source of overhead is not
conservatism but the hips structure we
design and implement the family of new
conservative collectors and we also
design the fast conservative reference
out and the final outcome is our
conservative reference counting immix
collector matches the performance of a
exact production generational collect so
which was our goal at the beginning now
let us have a look how we achieve those
so our design so the main two things we
need to to we need to have some form of
filtering so that we can filter out all
the bad references and we need to have
some form of pinning so that we can pin
the references from the ambiguous route
and move all other stuffs so to do the
filtering what we have we have a object
map so object maps used to filter
ambiguous references so this is simply a
bitmap so when we allocate an object the
bitmap records the start of the start
address of the object when we are locate
so at any point of time we can ask the
bit ask the object map so we have a
reference it is a valid or not if the
bitmap is set for that object that means
that that's a valid object if that is
not true then this is not a valid object
but we use the object map also to filter
out their objects because in the stacks
we might have objects that is already
dead but it's still residing in the
stack so also need to filter out those
so the only thing is we the a locator
says the bit but at the same time we
also need to take care of when the
object is dead so the collector clears
the bit for the data objects so this is
so for the
yeah no no so but thats so when we that
is not a valid reference right so that's
that is dead but when we have a exact GC
map you will not get that object because
that is dead but when we have a
conservative scan of the state that can
still say okay yeah yeah so our object
map knows it's dead yeah yeah so oh
you're like this enigmatic appeared
again well no they should be buried in
the staff somewhere right in the store
or a random integer that happens to
point us something like once it was
lower than me right it wasn't there a
while ago right I wiliken could have
been to start well no we wouldn't have
no elected at dinner conservative you
wouldn't it has to like not be under a
stack and somehow some local variable or
something gets put back on there that
shows they're hardly are these lawyers
but it does happen okay yeah yeah yeah
yeah we have
so so if it is a concurrent collector we
actually need to update the map
atomically but is also true if you have
a parallel collector so our conservative
GC is not concurrent but parallel so
when we have parallel we also need to
take care of the atomic update yeah so
here so the object map is actually a
bitmap as we say every time we get a
ambiguous route we asked object nap is
it a valid reference then object make
sighs yes or no so that is the function
of the object man how we implement that
when we allocate an object we set the
bit in the map to the start of the
object simply the object map granularity
can be one bit for each four bytes so we
have a dress we are locate an object we
get the bit in the object map set the
bait done but the problem is we also
need to so when we do a location we have
threadlocal a location right so we can
update the those bit nan atomically for
when we update the bid for the alligator
but for the collector we need to clear
the bit for the data objects but those
clear can need to be done chemically
because we have multiple collector
thread running the for the GC is like
reference something we can easily
identify the data objects because
reference counting knows which object is
dead but the other gc's which does
tracing that's tricky right because
tracing only knows about the live
objects so what we did for the dressing
collectors at the beginning of the trace
we cleared the whole object map and when
we do the trace as the object are marked
life we set the bit in the object map so
in this way we can actually keep track
of the objects that are live after the
last collection the objects that are
live in the last collection at the same
time the objects that are allocated
after the last collection so those are
the set of valid objects that we have
yeah but if we guarantee that we're when
you're setting it for the first time so
the allocation okay so this is a so this
is not like anything new so this is an
object map that anyone can implement so
we have some interesting too is to that
object map first of all in the object
map but the bit sets are not by the done
by the software instructions by software
instruction means i have an object I
gave the base address and then offset
and I read the word and then set a bit
with some masking we do not do that we
use the x86 BTS and BTW our instructions
so we have the base address and we just
know which be to set we said that big
and we clear debate and the BDS
instruction give us like Oh point-six
percent performance improvement so we
care about point-six percent why we will
show that a little bit later and this is
object map we say we
have a simple object map where we have
one bit for four bites but our final
object NAB is actually used one bit for
eight bytes why we can do that the vm
that we use week because of the object
alignments and because some specific
rule we can easily identify the tip and
the status word so we instead of using
one bit for one word we can actually use
one bit for two word so whenever we have
a query to the object map we can
actually know whether it points to a
valid double word and then we can see
okay if that's true whether you point to
it starts an object so to optimization
to the object map one is instead of
having the software instruction we use
BTS and we actually have the resolution
where we have one bit 48 x and that have
a good result we will see just a little
bit later so this is filtering and then
how we do the pinning so instead of
pinning in a page granularity like
mostly copy we pin on a mix line so we
have 260 256 byte bit lines so when we
have a references from the roots with
windows objects and all other objects
can be moved so that means with
opportunistic copy that means as long as
the space permits we can move lot of
stuff and we can see only point two
percent of the hippie spin with immix so
we can actually move all the other
objects so this is the different
filtering mechanism so this here we can
see so this is all done on a mark sweep
collector so at the left we have the BTW
BTW don't use an object map it just
check whether the object start from a
valid allocated start of itself and we
have at the middle we have an object map
which is the default object map and at
the right we have our own object map
which is half resolution so here we can
see the object map gives so if we look
at the time then the objects are BTW is
based right
is only have one person overhead and the
object map have three point seven and
the full object map is six I just said
it wrong the last one is the default
object nap the middle one is our half
resolution object map so we have only so
the object map in marks whip gives us
2.7% overheads but the interesting thing
is when we have but the BTW does not
copy anything so when we do copying the
advantage of copy actually outweighs
2.7% so with object map when we do the
copying then the 2.7% is actually not
much because the result we will show so
let's just now look the methodology that
you we use we use 20 benchmarks from
dacapo spec jvm and PG vb we use Jack's
RV m and M mtk and latest machine and
latest operating system so first of all
the results so at the our first
contribution was we design a family of
conservative collector so we design
conservative reference counting
conservative imix our conservative RC
mix as well as sticky mix so here all
the exact collector and their
conservative counterparts so we can see
except us so all our conservative
collectors the difference between the
exact and conservative is less than
three percent but so BTW is good with
risp so BTW is only have one percent
overhead then it exact but BTW suffers
huge than all the production collectors
but our conservative collectors the
difference is less than three percent so
which is pretty good i think so and
except reference counting conservative
every other collector actually copy so
we have low performance penalty for
conservative collectors now this is our
final result so we show our reference
counting gimmicks which was like three
percent better than genomics which is a
production collector
mostly copying 45% and 12% over it and
our conservative reference counting enix
is actually slightly faster than a
production generational collector so
genomics is a production generational
character which is a generational
copying collector and the reference
counting gimmicks conservative is
actually slightly faster so we actually
achieved our goal where we have a
conservative r f+ GC for managed
language with same performance as a
exact racing comment so that so that
improvement actually outweighs the
little overhead that we have because of
using the object man because object
nefyn italy has gotten over it because
when we allocate we need to set a bit
but because we can move most of the
stuffs that post is actually outweighed
by the copy so what actually does so
this is so all these four results are
for java and this is another graph this
is based on different hip sizes so this
is a actually space-time trade-off so at
the bottom we have from 1 x 2 6's heap
size and the x so this will like tells
us the whole story of different GCS so
here we have the plaque the blue is the
genomics collector and the green is the
reference counting amex collector that
we have in the last year so those are
the two high-performance exec GC and
what about the two state-of-the-art
conservative GC sits so mostly copying
we can't even see that in that graph so
but BTW is good but it's still in twice
x it's like twelve percent slower than
genomics so we actually narrowed that
gap so our reference counting immix the
light blue light print one so it's good
but it's suffering in like like very
little small hip sizes because of we
have because we still have that speed
pin space that actually suffers
fragmentation so and also we have that
overhead of the object map so all those
results are actually for java so what
does actually means for laying other
languages
so we tried we also try to evaluate what
our result like how our result can help
implementing like gc's for other
language so first of all one of the
measuring thing is spinning like how
pinning FX star so in MX we see only
point two percent of pinning so what we
did we did an artificial experiment
where we in like advanced in crease the
pinning from 28 x so if we have a tech
spinning like me and eight like
one-point-six percent of pinning then
the reference counting conservative
reference counting imix have suffered
only three point four percent of
performance so if we are if you are
implementing a language that have lots
of stuff from the ambiguous text and
register and you need to pin a lot of
stuff if that number is eight times then
we have for java still the performance
degradation is only three point four
percent so what what we suggest in that
case so you need to do 33 quantify
modify and implement so by quantify
means you need to quantify the ambiguous
references in your target applications
then you need to modify the heap
organization so that is you it uses
lines and blocks on of immix and the
reference counting immix collector the
implementation is not so straightforward
but the implementing a fool if immix is
much easier than having a generational
immix or RC mix collector but if you
just implement the fully immix that will
also give you five percent performance
improvement so if the ambiguous
reference is a new application is in
that ballpark of like 8x percent then
it's very it's a good idea to try to
implement immix and we get we saw five
percent improvement I believe you can
also see that type of improvement in
application so we also looked at the
like performance potential by changing
the vm
so one thing that is very important the
code quality may dampen the performance
so in our VM we intentionally crippled
hour run time we disabled up application
code optimization and at the same time
we do optimize the runtime code so we
try to have a V so our VM it's like it's
a match your vm but we also try to find
the vm which is not so Monsieur that
means it might have interpreter odd so
in both of the cases for both immix and
RC amex conservative we can still see
some dampen advantages so the one major
thing is as as your vm is improving you
will see more improvement so in summary
we have conservative GC which is
dominated by btwn mostly copying
significant overheads and we find out
that not conservatism but heap
organization is key to the performance
we have a new design we use al over it
objective and line based spinning and
our conservative reference counting
gimmicks collector matches the fastest
production so which is a first time
conservative GC for managed language
with the same performance of exact
generational collector thanks any
question
how does it run so here so these are
free delegator right so we have so treat
yourself intermix we have different
brilliance based on size and so objects
are located like so we four subjects are
allocated based on like the size map
size frames right suppose we have free
list suppose a list we have all the
objects may be of size like for whites
or eight bytes so you have that
alignment yeah and it's
I look at itself and life pointer but it
does put the bell logic so unless you
can keep the metadata in a separate data
structure or you can keep it at the
beginning of the flock like that but
they don't have any extra metadata this
is just the stuff they already have in
the trailer this is the point is
leveraging the so the so as we see the
our cost of filtering the free list
introspection is very good right it
gives only one percent over but the
problem is with frillies have some other
disadvantages so in frillies you have
like bad mutator locality and also at
the same time you fragmented right
because of the size so you can so you
can't copy objects so no one copy
objects in privilege so that means so
those two deserve and a here's the
fragmentation and also because of the
bad new data locality freely step good
filtering because of those two that feel
free so we can't use that filtering
that's why in our collector we have the
optimal
and that's pretty good so BTW so our
results suggest that the language that
don't have so languages like C or C++
PDW is actually a very good choice
because you have just one person over it
from the marks we and our last two
slides actually shows that maybe you can
also based on your statistics you can
actually implement our evenings and all
that stuff for c and c++ and maybe you
can get better results
so give it in human soul so you need to
have GC map site so this in apps mean at
some point of time you can trigger it in
seatac so there are some TC same points
so based on that you can't move your
goal you suppose you have a like like
piece of code this is a DC buoyant or
something so you can't actually move
your boat
you can't sometimes may need to
constrain it loses the ocean there's no
question about it but it doesn't stop it
right right cause it could much track
protect information but something that
so teachers can trip to pass the sacred
things thanks so many how my parents
have to be atomic with respect receive
the GC same point has a variance
associated with those e very
organizations here is yeah you can't
like to have some half address jumped up
in a register write some temporary
calculation to get to the middle of an
array or something that can't cross the
boundary of where you actually use some
a point to a valid option some of the
can be compensated engineering but like
you would then have special maps which
associated address this is the same
that's really what it's your animal but
it's not a real pain in the rear and
this is what a lot of it fun and just go
to the Conservatives okay yea i meant to
hot it might be clear to basically zayas
it's a lot hotter than engineer
composite i just ate
you can do something they could you
could all easily the conservative to
pretend of make a you know make the
address in to hof parks and for a while
because 10 thing yeah it was copying
between two to two arrays and decided to
keep the difference between the two
arrays has like one point and the
difference between so that was just
using that as a stride the secondary
action it's a little bug but it actually
have done people have been worried about
as a whole concern that's a conservative
like that is like a pilot it doesn't
know about no it wouldn't because what
happened with the proper conservative
collector and i love it but in a fully
conservative over this you see both
glossy
amazing work you should be more like you
know blowing your horn I think it's
really cool and you should you know it
would be the next hum sperm that is
really easy to use on the llvm like to
make up you know he makes poop dick
banger just linking it'll work right
people people have loved it of course
I'm not sure if your supervisor you know
easy don't say people all your
disablement a little each scan big or
something i'll just leave this there
there are some people actually
implementing our images are seeming
stuff for today are trying to make it
portable for C&amp;amp;C possible supposably lb
nightlies just LVN don't care go with
the compilers are all this now music
it's great advice now it i mean it is
amazing like they'd get so close it's
like a dream like I wish often I wanted
to implement like languages I want like
for performance and just couldn't you
see is my back end basically because of
the garbage they're not the only one so
it would be great like I think men even
will be so bracelet and having that the
reasonably high performance whoever this
is I mean I really I I believe you but
then I kind of don't believe you then
I'll get to that level performance right
but it's definitely faster than the
energy
see an object system you'd write
yourself probably know the one the like
if I would do this for a school would it
really be like food again like I mean
probably right that's how they work from
John Holland Daisy you say Pascal right
yep from ya is an unbelievable number
look like it's a bit of um I get bit but
yeah I mean I didn't expect would see
this number at the end but once we saw
what was going on it became immediately
clear we can do this like most people
realizes all that locality we know that
story very very well right you maybe we
could kill it but but we assumed it was
going to be the things that reset sure
the painting and the excess retention
and it wasn't someone asked a question
it's not just the object you point to
but it's the object that they point to
call you it's the closure for you and so
so it's the case that the first level is
small but then the closure that keeps
alive these extra objects is also small
but in theory it could be the whole
thing great theory it can be either
right then it's also an interesting
question about because especially me
maybe you already care about six
look good when they're bad but again if
you give you already having base point
is I think that comes it's a deeply
impressive with this flexin no
low-hanging fruit anymore in garbage
collection is amazing and to them more
like most of them using bartels time
before my you Chris I just want to
clarify a question you asked during the
door and then it so what r e fed did
about the system that goes really fast
but to do the analysis he built another
system which did votes bow your head
both implemented side by side and
actually get to GCS at once so you never
use it in the production system but that
was a very very useful analytical tool
so we did to closures there for every GC
that was not written and damage your
emotions even in analysis sorry and
that's just actually one well you guys
in the actual collection I'm just
wondering whether the folks for
attention know whether you later Leo
when they do actually you did rerunning
conservative GC but I couldn't exactly
so your viruses on the side when you ran
them as I said you're measuring all the
properties though other locality because
that one indeed yes you go get back his
number right yeah slow is built because
the 2g sees every Tony but that's how
you eliminated the other two writers we
did that was just an analysis tool which
was as calm as it as complicated as the
algorithm this sexy should show we're
looking to give your fluff up there's a
slide they say look I ran to collectors
and now I know exactly right the
exception is properly now you showed
like to point to 1.6 and yours kind of
masking it and even like am i dumb can
ask this I really like that
he was not thinking I hope you know it
was a huge thing I can do this kind of
analysis and if you can talk about this
all right i'll make it more clear and
escalated it debster like main point so
so in my PhD them so Steve gets in and
saw Daniel also was my supervisor so
Steven interesting properties exactly
over so the hardest lingam OTC what I
found ever it's very easy to get good
performance but it's hard to describe
how you are getting so that's the thing
you must it's not really yeah I guess
would be put the premises it is true
that it's very much about what your
number or if its first three episodes
PhD the first one took go ahead of
reference counting from thirty-five
percent to ten percent and the next one
to deficit 20 the next one who did so
yeah he's inside a charmed experience
