thank you so much for coming we're
thrilled to welcome salman rushdie to
the Microsoft Research visiting speaker
series and the Microsoft political
action committee he has won numerous
awards he is the author of 11 books
including his latest two years eight
months and 28 nights which I just
couldn't memorize we're so thrilled to
have him please join me in giving him a
very warm welcome
thank you well can you hear me you hear
me at the back yes good
well Paulo has a lot of you thanks for
showing up taking time off from all
those screens I'm going to talk to you
about this this other technology this
you know it's very sophisticated piece
of software this you can interact with
it in various ways without it without
prejudicing the original text at all you
could you could drop it in water and it
does not lose its data you know it's
it's actually very very cutting edge
this thing well I'm just going to talk
to you about for about 20 minutes or so
about this book and then and then you
know answer your questions I hope and I
think they're trying to get a microphone
but otherwise you're going to have to
shout so first of all this title which
is very very long and hard to remember
and a lot of people at the publishing
company said to me they said that they
said nobody's ever gonna remember it and
can you think of a shorter title so I
did think of some shorter titles and
then I thought you know that's what this
book is called it's called this I'm
sorry and so we left it and now of
course everybody does the math and they
work out that it's a thousand in one
night so then they kind of like that and
then the internet mean what it is
everybody says it only works if there's
not a leap year
to which my answer is there isn't a
 leap year anyway what happened
was that I I mean it's that kind of a
story it's sort of an Arabian Nights
story bit but not set back then set kind
of now and and at a certain point when I
was thinking about it I found myself
asking a thousand and one nights you
know what is that in English and so I
worked it out and then
it seemed quite pleasing that inside
this famous magical symmetrical number
of 1001 there's another kind of shapely
number of a - 828 you know so and sort
of a secret number concealed inside the
famous number and so that's why the
title is that and that's why in the end
I thought it has to be the title because
that's just what it is and really one of
the origin points of this was that I
I've been very interested in what's
something that's happening in American
literature in this in a generation much
younger than me
which is the arrival into American
literature of new immigrant stories from
everywhere in the world I mean American
literature has always been inspired by
immigrant literature and one can think
of the old Eastern European Jewish
migrations which brought in a lot of the
folk tales and fairy tales of Eastern
Europe and then of course the Italian
migration has had a great impact on
American literature but now seems to me
there are people there writers American
writers with Heritage's from really
everywhere in the world so you know
there's Jhumpa Lahiri with a
consultation heritage Kiran Desai
similarly and you know you know Diaz
bringing his stories up from the
Caribbean and and Nam Lai from Vietnam
and Yiyun Li from China and and all
these young writers would define
themselves as American writers but what
they're doing is bringing into American
literature the stories of the whole
world and I think it's been very kind of
enriching and nourishing for the
literature of this country that that's
been happening and I thought well you
know I can do that too
I thought I've been I've been living in
New York now for getting on for 16 years
and so I think I count just kind of
local and I've got the suitcases full of
stories from other places as well you
know so so I thought maybe I would
unpack some of those stories and you're
kind of throw them at Manhattan and see
what happened and so yeah the simple way
of describing this novel is that is that
genies attack Manhattan yep that would
be the Hollywood title should have
genies attack Manhattan one because as I
remember when I I wrote a couple of
books sort of like this fable like books
MIT for younger readers I wrote one for
each of my sons and I remember my
younger son when he read Luca in the
fire of life which was a book that I
wrote for him he said you know dad don't
write novels write series and I thought
well that's right because everything now
is kind of one of seven you know and I
failed to do that somehow I failed to be
smart enough to write series but anyway
I thought that what I would try and do
was to use this this literary tradition
that comes from comes from the east
which is a tradition of fantastic tales
and and and see what would happen if I
wrote a contemporary American where the
book doesn't entirely take place in
America but a very large most of it
takes place in New York City with little
variations little did little departures
here and there and it was just enormous
fun to do you know one of the things I
felt about those two books that I wrote
for my sons
Haroon in the sea of stories and Luca
and the fire of life which are kind of
young adult novels is that they were the
most fun I ever had as a writer and and
actually the kind of response from
readers was was some of the most
enjoyable pleasurable response I've ever
had because you know young people are
very tough readers if they don't like a
book they don't
and and they tell you that they don't
like it and they tell you why they don't
like it all of which is you know
difficult and and on the other hand when
they do like it they tell you that too
and and it can be very rewarding so when
you know her room to see if stories came
out I would get these letters from from
high schools around the country in which
entire classes would have read the book
and they would sent me they would send
me drawings of the characters and hints
for plots for sequels and they would
tell me which characters they liked and
which ones they didn't like and it was
just the most enjoyable reader response
that one could have and and and so I
thought well let me see what happens if
if I write something like that for
grownups maybe I'm gonna get grown up
sending me drawings of the characters
and encourage giving me hints for
sequels and I finally get to write a
series anyway so it starts off from that
desire to to do something which was very
pleasurable to do in the past but to do
it for adult readers not for children
because of course these original stories
these ancient stories though the Arabian
Nights stories and many of the other
storehouses of Wonder tales of the east
they were not written as children's
stories though they were written as
adult stories and rather like you know
the Grimm stories were not originally
written as children's stories they were
written as adult folktales and and then
then there were children's versions of
them you know so I mean for instance the
some of the Grimm stories are very harsh
in their rough and in fact there's quite
often told in very rough language too so
the famous story of the fisherman and
his wife where the where the flounder
magic flounder jumps out of the sea and
grants them wishes until they go too far
and and actually the thing the goat
makes them go too far is when the wife
says that she wants to be Pope that's
that's a wish too far and there and
their return to their early poverty but
in in the kind of children's versions of
these stories it says that they're these
poor people who live in this Inn
poor Hut but if you look at the original
Grimm stories it quite clearly says that
they live in a piss pot they live in a
giant piss pot and then they get these
wishes that they have palaces and bigger
palaces and even bigger palaces at the
end they're back in the piss pot so so
what I'm saying is these are stories
which were not only aimed at adults they
were written in a dull clang guack and
anyway so that was a starting point and
what had happened to me is that the book
I wrote before this had been the
opposite of this really it had been a
nonfiction autobiography of memoir in
Latin so I had spent years I've been
like three and a half years something
trying very hard to scrupulously tell
the truth and not make anything up and I
just got tired of it is the time to stop
telling the truth that start making
things up and so so emotionally I after
finishing the memoir I sort of had this
emotional swing to the other end of the
spectrum and wrote what is maybe the
most fantastic ated book I ever wrote
and and to an extent it's a reaction
against the book before so are we doing
so what it's about really in brief is is
a war it's a kind of War of the Worlds
novel accept the world sometime in the
War of the Worlds makes one think of
invading Martians and HG Wells and so on
but this isn't like that this this
suggests that there are two worlds one
of which is ours and the other which is
a world inhabited by these supernatural
creatures called the Djinn from which
the word Genie comes the Jim that's
actually the plural the singular is
Ginny which is where Jeannie comes from
so the idea is that that this other
world the world of the Djinn has been
separated from our world for a long time
and then there's the book begins with a
with some very large natural phenomena
like huge storms and the suggestion is
that these huge storms somehow break the
seals that separate the worlds from each
other kind of opened the gateways and as
a result these very
powerful supernatural creatures are able
to to enter our reality and and then do
what the what the Djinn like to do which
is to screw things up
because that's that's their nature you
know the Djinn kind of vary from
mischievous to malevolent and and
they're actually very interested in
human beings because we are more
interesting than them one of the they
may be powerful and be able to fly and
turn themselves into sea monsters and
eat the Staten Island Ferry and that
happens at one point to the hook but
they're essentially not that interesting
and they find human life to be endlessly
fascinating because because we are we
are more complicated creatures than they
are really they have very little
recreational activity there's no books
in fairyland you know there's no movies
to watch all they have is sex so they
have gigantic quantities of sex and then
after a few thousand years that gets
boring and no matter how gymnastic you
know but what they like about us is that
we do things other than have sex I think
most of us don't have any sex at all but
so anyway they arrive in the spirit of
curiosity but also some of them the tow
called dark Djinn arrived in in order to
try and conquer try and conquer the
world and enslave it and then there's a
female Jen who is the main character of
the novel in many ways - the princess of
the Jen who actually loves human beings
and at one point thousand hundreds of
years ago had a love affair with a human
being of philosopher of the 12th century
and produced a spectacular number of
children whose descendants are now
scattered all over the world and who she
she she comes back to look after her
kids basically and to defend her progeny
on earth from from the dark from her
dark counterparts and and so she awakens
the magic inside them and then they
become the counter
so there's that's that's the battle that
happens in the book
oddly particularly oddly for me really
the book doesn't have an unhappy ending
it's usually quite a hard fate to be a
character in one of my novels yes yes
you know that the word goes out at
central casting that there's vacancies
for a characters it's all the under
steer ovals everybody shows up then they
realize that they're going to be
horribly treated badly badly beaten up
and probably killed before the end of
the book and it's a tough fate but this
book oddly the characters don't do so
badly and and one of the reasons for
that was again a desire to kind of go
against the grain of of the world as we
see it in the news you know that it
would be very easy right now to write a
book which is in which everything is
horrible and then it gets worse and that
it ends badly and and I thought
precisely because of that let me see
what else I could do let me see what I
could do if I didn't do that because one
of the things I think I mean I was a
historian by training a long time ago
but one of the things you learn from the
study of history is that history is an
endless surprise it doesn't run on
tramlines
you know it it's not free it's not
predestined it's not determinist history
makes all kinds of weird Knights moves
and goes into very unexpected directions
and it's very difficult to foretell
what's going to happen in fact I've
often said that futurology is the
science of being wrong about the future
you know because because it just is very
hard to foretell and so it seems to me
no matter how dark any given moment in
human history might look it's not
necessarily going to go that way and so
I thought to ask myself the question of
how else could it go and the light the
later part of the book has something to
do with that I mean put it like this if
I had said to you in January 1989 that
the Soviet Union would not exist by
Christmas
you would thought I was crazy because it
seemed absolutely set in stone and
powerful and enduring and and yet it did
just blew away like sand and I mean now
somebody's trying to put it back
together but that's another story but
that's what I'm saying about what could
happen these enormous changes can happen
at very very high speed and so you know
the world that the the path of events is
not set in stone and and I wanted to
find a way of making it unexpected
Knights move towards the end which takes
it into some other place which I will
not spoil for you or at least I'll
oblige you to read the book in order to
find out um so that's that's in brief
what it's about how we do I think maybe
I'll stop in a minute and let you ask
some questions I hope it's a funny book
I mean I think it's I certainly tried to
make it a very funny book and one of the
clues I've got is that mine notoriously
ferocious literary agent Andrew Wiley
confessed to me that it made him laugh
out loud on the subway and I thought it
would make him laugh then something is
okay about this book again I think it's
a black comedy because I think it is in
some ways even though it's so heavily
fabulist
I think it is trying to offer a kind of
vision of our times and of what's going
on in the world and of course our times
are not particularly cheerful
but there's a I have this instinct as a
writer the kind of right against the
grain of the material so I think if I'm
looking at something that's kind of dark
and has a potential for tragedy I find
myself having a great desire to write
about it as comedy or farce it can be
black comedy or black fast but I think
it still has to be funny so it's I mean
somebody said to me it was my funniest
book and I'm not arguing with that
except that I think all the others are
quite funny one of the things for
instance that nobody ever says before
they read the satire
versus is that it's funny and and one of
the things that people often say to me
after they've read it is who knew that
it was funny and the answer is people
who read it knew it the people who
didn't read it had a different opinion
of it but I've become less interested in
the opinions of people who don't read it
so yeah I mean I mean I speaking as a
reader I'm not very attracted to books
which have no sense of humor and and
that means that excludes one or two
really great writers you know George
Eliot not a lot of jokes I mean I was
once on this this TV book program in
which we they played this kind of party
game where everybody had to admit to one
one famous work of literature that
they'd never been able to read and I
confess to never having read Middlemarch
and you would have thought that I'd
murdered the Pope
you know because because like the next
day there were these articles all over
the newspaper he calls himself a serious
writer I'd never been never read
Middlemarch and I mean it's true I've
still never read Middlemarch I've tried
and I tried to watch the TV
dramatization of it I couldn't couldn't
watch that either I think there's a
problem I mean look I know it's a great
novel but there's a problem when when
somebody tries to make their male
they're their leading male character is
deliberately characterized as the most
boring man of the world it's very
difficult for that not to make the novel
kind of extraordinarily boring and there
we are
I will not trash George Eliot any
further I think how I think I think her
reputation is probably safe from me but
um so we all have these blind spots and
my blind spot is books which have I
don't mean laugh out loud humor MIT
books but but books which don't have
some kind of ride dark comic note in
them if they don't have that I kinda
find myself not loving them so I try
always to have that note there
some to some greater or lesser degree in
all the books and this one apparently
quite a lot so alright let me stop there
in the way of my way of introduction and
let's talk about whatever you want to
talk about is there a mic alright
sprint yeah they're working it's a
pleasure to have you here and I just you
started off your conversation by talking
about technology I'm going to take you
at face value there because I agree I
think books are truly one of the most
miraculous pieces of technology took a
long time to develop and we work in a
technology company Korean auto
technology for all sorts of things and
let's just assume for a moment that that
technology shouldn't exist for its own
sake and it actually should solve real
problems yeah my question for you is
what technology do you use when writing
and what do you hate most about it oh
well I mean I'm you know I'm quite I
like gadgets you know so I so I'm not in
that sense I'm not a kind of Luddite
writer I mean I used to I've never
written longhand really you know and I
mean I do a lot of I do a lot of
note-taking do when I'm working
something out I'm scribble things on in
notebooks a piece of paper but but when
I'm actually writing I mean it used to
be a it used to be a typewriter and and
then in the mid 90s somewhere it became
a computer and I mean I found I mean I
was I was nervous like many people who
switched their medium you know from from
one thing to another I was nervous about
beginning to use computers but very
rapidly it's like you know when you buy
a new pen there's a moment when the pen
doesn't feel like you and then very and
then very quickly it just becomes an
extension of your hand and it just just
writes whatever you wanted to write and
I think it was much the same with
getting getting to know how to use a
computer you know to write books after
an after really quite a short space of
time it just felt like just that's just
the thing I'm using and and of course it
does have the great advantage of making
revision much easier you know that when
you when you are using a typewriter you
know you either have to X out everything
or use white and wait for it to dry and
then type over it or or you have to
endlessly repeat the paper out of the
typewriter and put new ones in and of
course editing on a computer is is just
effortless and and I came to feel that
that was a big advantage because it
actually allowed more time for the
actual creative work you know that the
mechanical act of revision became so
Swift that it took away a whole whole
passage of time it was just used in the
in the re typing or whatever you know so
on the whole I mean I really liked it I
really liked it and the Moore's last
sign which came out in 1995 was the
first book I wrote on a computer and
ever since then I have I mean I use an
iPhone I don't use that much other stuff
you know I mean I have an iPad which I
find I hardly ever turn on I don't
really read I I do sometimes read
e-books but they're you it's usually
because I started reading a book and
then I have to do this I travel around
the country and instead of carrying a
heavy suitcase full of books I download
them but I must prefer having the books
and what's interesting is it seems to me
that the book the book as an object has
shown remarkable resilience in the face
of the e-book you know that when the
e-book when a books arrived there was a
well traditional publishers were
terrified that they were about to go out
of business you don't agree that this
was going to take over everything and
and what happened with ebooks is that
the sales went like this
- about 17% of the book market at which
point they just plateaued and they've
remained there ever since
maybe even with a slight dip and that
the the sales of ordinate old-fashioned
books have not only held up but there's
some evidence that they're going up a
bit you know so so this the object is an
incredibly resilient thing people
actually just like it you know and the
number of things that were supposed to
destroy books is everything that's been
invented since books you know you know
you know radio was supposed to destroy
books television movies everything was
supposed to destroy books and none of it
has you know it because there's
something that people like about this
but holding it and turning the pages you
know it's something people like about
having it on the Shelf being able to see
it which you can't do with an e-book so
I think it's I think it's probably not
doomed the book you know I think certain
kinds of book probably will just become
electronically for example reference
books you know and I think that because
because of the enormous advantage of
having a search engine so I think if
you've got a dictionary or an
encyclopedia of like I gather the
Britannica now only publishers in
addition and has stopped publishing the
hardcover Edition and I'm bad I get it
you know because if you want to search
encyclopedia britannica for everything
about your given thing you can do it in
five seconds you know so and I can see
that that's a great advantage but for
you know fiction and for you know
creative nonfiction books like that I
think the market for them for the actual
object will remain I don't know what I
don't like about that I don't I I don't
like about computers that you have to
carry them around you know and actually
when I'm traveling I don't bring a
laptop with me and if I have ideas that
I want a job done and I actually do go
back to using pen and paper you know I
take I always carry a notebook in a pen
and that's somehow when you're on the
road it's much easier to work much
easier for me to work in that way then
on a tablet or something I did so there
we are that's
thank you thanks Salman for coming over
here today and spending time with us we
really appreciate that and we're really
enjoying your time so a question that I
you me and my wife we both wanted to ask
she's not here today but she wanted to
make sure that I'm asking you this
question so first of all me and my wife
and like most of other fellows here we
are great fan of yours and people like
you and dust Lima who makes a lot of
controversies so these days we don't see
that a lot of controversies are
happening around you is it we wonder
sometim that has you stopped talking
enough truth or are you trying to tone
down your genre and like write some
novels for young kids you should tell
your wife but I haven't in any sense
toned anything down I don't know you
know I don't want I feel that the
problem of the endless connection that's
with the way in which my name is yoked
together with the name of thusly -
serene I would like that not to happen
please because first of all I don't
think she's a very good writer and I
think her circumstances are very
different and I mean I think I support
her courage and speaking up on
particularly on feminist issues and she
has her own difficulties but I think
we're just separate stories you know
it's not me and Tesla or Tesla mind me
I don't know I mean I think I never went
out there to get to I mean I hate the
term controversial you know I'm not
trying to be controversial it seems to
be what's controversial is the attack
not the book you know it's the attempt
to attack and silence writers as you
know it's happening in Bangladesh great
deal right now with the murder of
several bloggers yeah so that's it seems
to me what's controversial not what they
are writing no they have an absolute
right to write what they what they want
which in that case in the case of all
the murdered long as it was all
secularist writing against religious
extremism and for that they were hacked
to death with blades now it seems to me
that we get things wrong when we called
the righteous controversial you know it
seems to me it's it's the men of
violence who should be tarred with that
brush and if it stops happening I mean
thank you very much I didn't you know I
didn't want it in the first place I
think we just live in an age in which
the subject changes very fast you know
and and I mean the subject with me was
around for ten years which is very long
time but I'm happy to say the subject
changed maybe it'll change back which
will not be great but but right now you
know I never go looking for it you know
I mean nor do I shy away from it in fact
I have a very strong view that
self-censorship is a great crime I mean
I think you know literature is a great a
great tradition full of writers who have
been heroic in what they have said I
mean you know when when the russian poet
joseph Mandelstam wrote his satirical
poem but Stalin and Stalin was still in
power it was pretty clear that Stalin
wouldn't like it but he went ahead and
published it and his life was destroyed
by it I mean he spent most of the rest
of his life in labor camps and died in
one but he still wrote it and published
it and and so I think self-censorship is
a crime against literature you know and
I think my view is either write your
book or don't write your book but if you
were to write your book say what you
think you know and because put it like
this bad writing is not the writers
fault it's just that the writer isn't
very talented
self-censorship is the righteous fault
because that's the one is inevitable you
know that's just that's not being down
Brown you know you can't help yourself
um but but self-censorship is a choice
so that that's the thing that you do to
yourself sorry I should not be rude
about down bro
actually why not so I think
self-censorship is something but must be
avoided at all costs and I think you
know most writers that I know of any
quality at all are very obstinate
bloody-minded people and and they don't
like to be told what to write or not to
write so I think actually one of the
things that I think is kind of noble
about literature is that writers will
write what they want to write you know
and and they don't look for trouble but
if trouble shows up then you know you
deal with it thanks for answering my
question and tell your wife everything
tell your wife everything's fine hey
Salman speaking of literature and other
writers I'm curious to who you enjoy
reading who's influenced you and why oh
well what who do I like as writers and
what influenced you
well influenced me um well I mean I read
you know I read a lot about I mean I
think one of the things one of the
things I would say is that we live in
one of the great one of the unsung
heroes of literature is the translator
and we live in an age of great
translators and as a result a lot of the
world's literature is available to us in
very very accessible attractive form to
a much greater degree than ever used to
be the case and so I find that I read a
lot of literature from languages which I
don't speak you know I'm only able to do
that because of the quality of
translation so I mean I found for
instance before I ever went to Latin
America
I had read quite a lot of the literature
of Latin America I had read boric acid
garcia marquez and machado de assis and
many others and I sort of
felt because through those writers I
felt that I knew something about that
world and when I finally was able to
travel a bit in Latin America I thought
you know it actually is like that you
know Garcia Marquez he wasn't making it
up it actually is crazy in exactly the
way that he says you know so-so
literature does open those doors I mean
I have to say you know I really have
hardly ever spent only a few days of my
life ever in Russia but I feel that I
know something about it because of my
fondness for Russian literature you know
so both the classics are in both you
know Tolstoy Dostoevsky but also more
recent writers the writers of the Soviet
period and so on so I think you know I
would just encourage people to read
outside the box it's my view you know
it's and I know that in the United
States there is a tendency amongst
readers to try and read inside the box
to try and read writers who are writing
about things that are familiar to
Americans know many of those writers of
extraordinary writers like say Jonathan
Franzen for example you know but but
he's but but those are writers writing
about an own world you know and and and
I think one of the great gifts that
literature could give you is to open up
to you the lived experience of parts of
the world which are not yours
and and I can tell you things which the
news can't tell you you know you turn on
the news and you see you know explosions
but but what literature gives you is is
what it's like to be a person living in
these places what is it like to live in
North Korea you know well if you want
your answer to that question the best
answer I can think of is in a novel that
won the Pulitzer Prize a couple of years
ago called the orphan masters son by
Adam Johnson which is those amazing
portrait of life daily life you know
inside North Korea and makes it vivid to
you in a way in a way that a news report
can't so so that's what I find I mean I
do read you know I do read stuff set in
places that I know but I'm very
attracted to reading books about places
that I don't know because it's a way of
imaginatively entering into those other
spaces so that's some of the answer
thank you
there's only one writer I know who ever
said that he didn't read very much and
that was VS Naipaul I was at a literary
event in in Britain where he was being
interviewed on stage and and somebody
asked him more or less the same question
that you just asked me and and he rather
grandly said I'm not a reader I'm a
writer
I thought well I don't know any other
writer who would say that because most
of us know that to some extent all books
come from other books you know that your
your experience of reading shapes your
the the kind of writing that you end up
doing some degree anyway that's V s
Naipaul not me
help Domon so a few months ago there was
a bit of a mouth disagreement regarding
the pen freedom award to the really hear
you could you speak cleared the mic oh
hi okay so a few months ago it was a bit
of a mild disagreement to put it very
mildly regarding the pen freedom in the
world
yo Charlie Hebdo so I'd like to hear
your thoughts briefly regarding that the
ensuring protest and more specifically
how can a writer essentially guard
against self-censorship when it does
seem that it tied both within society
and within the writers there's a very
strong tight in that direction well the
way you guard against self-censorship is
by not doing it you know I mean it's
very simple everybody knows when they're
pulling back you know and the thing is
not to do it the Charlie Hebdo business
was very was very disappointing inside I
thought because the the write some of
the right I mean many many writers were
were supportive of the awards they would
be given to to the magazine and the you
know the number opposing it was a tiny
percentage of the membership of pen but
nevertheless they were on that list a
number of wonderful writers that I would
have I was very surprised to see them on
that side of the fence you know I mean
Junot Diaz Michael and RJ Michael
Cunningham Joyce Carol Oates you know
you don't expect them to be on that side
of the argument and all I can say is I
think they were badly informed because
the argument they were making was
essentially that the magazine was will
put it brutally racist that was that was
the argument and and that it was
obsessed with attacking Islam and that
for that to be happening in a country
where the Muslim community was very
disadvantaged was a kind of liberal
luxury that shouldn't particularly be
celebrated I think that that was sort of
essentially the argument and the truth
is that that's kind of the opposite of
what Charlie Hebdo was you know Charlie
Hebdo was oh they also said it was kind
of an organ of the state you know and
the point about Charlie Hebdo is it was
always the exact opposite of that
you know the reason it's called I mean
abdur just means weekly but the reason
it was called charlie was for two
reasons one is that the founders of
magazine really liked Charlie Brown and
the other is they really hated shall de
Gaulle so the magazine from its
inception was anti-state and as for the
obsession with Islam
there was a Lomond newspaper carried out
a survey of 10 years of Charlie Hebdo
covers this five hundred and twenty
three covers and they discovered that
the number of covers that dealt with
Islam was seven the number the dealt
with Israel was fourteen the number that
dealt with the Pope was over 21 the
number that dealt with Sarkozy and the
government was like several hundred and
and the number that attacked the French
racist natural Front National Front was
also in the hundreds you know it so very
very much against the what was be said
it was actually a magazine that spent
most of its time attacking French racism
and attacking the French state so to
have that magazine accused of being an
organ of the state and racist
was justjust provably not true and and
it seemed to me that these people after
all were murdered for the crime of
drawing pictures you know and and if we
can't stand up and defend those people
then what my view is what right do we
have to call ourselves a free speech
organization and outside America in
Europe people were absolutely been used
by this protest you know I mean I had
any number of writers from like France
Italy Germany say what the hell are
these people playing at don't they
understand what's going on and the
answer is no they didn't because very
many of the people who signed that had
never been to France don't speak French
had never seen a copy of the magazine
and yet were willing in some kind of odd
tribalist way to support each other and
this this attack I mean it was it was
really unfortunate and I mean in the end
everything went off fine they were there
the the gentleman from Charlie Hebdo who
came were justly celebrated and and the
event went off perfectly well but it has
left some real bad taste in people's
mouths that it has left a kind of injury
to old standing friendships and things
like that and that that's that's sad
thank you thanks thank you very much
taking the time to speak with us I have
a question about your writing your
writing process and yeah just to frame
that a bit I think was L dr. o who
described it as like driving a car at
night you can see as far as your
headlights but you can make the whole
trip that way or perhaps you're somebody
who knows your last line oh yeah write
to that or you have a set of Konnor all
right well let me try and say a little
bit about that this is a question about
writing process how do I do it I mean in
fact if I knew how I'd do it I I would
have written more books
so that there is something hit-and-miss
about it you know there's something
about writing which which means that you
only really discover what you're doing
by doing it and that the book you finish
is very often substantially unlike the
book you thought you were beginning I
mean that happens to me quite often you
know and when I started writing
Midnight's Children for example I
thought I was going to write a novel
about childhood which which would have
its origin in my memory of my childhood
growing up in in Bombay and I really
thought it would be just that and and
then at a certain point which wasn't the
point in which I started work I had this
idea of the the central characters being
born at more or less the same moment as
the independent the hour of Independence
of the country and when I thought of
that I thought I think you know that's
kind of a kind of a good idea but it
immediately made me understand that I'd
somehow completely changed the nature of
the book that suddenly you know if the
boy and the country were going to be as
it were twins
then you had to tell the story of both
twins you know and and so suddenly kind
of history came pouring into the book
and I realized that instead of writing
this small private novel about growing
up I was going to write this other thing
which was sort of terrifying
in Prospect and took me more than five
years to get it done and and so the book
that ended up happening was a much
larger canvas than I had originally seen
for it and that just happened by doing
it I mean I on the whole just do it like
an office job you know I'm not I'm not
very good at working early in the
morning I mean I know writers who do get
up it's like 5:00 6:00 a.m. and work
until lunch
and then spend the rest of the day
drinking and playing tennis you know but
but I I can't first of all I can't play
tennis
but I know I and I'm better at working
late at night actually I mean one of the
things I do I mean essentially I do like
a day I do in like a nine-to-five not
not all the time I have breaks and so on
but essentially I do like a working day
but one of the things I always try and
do is at night to read what I wrote that
day and see whether it needs fixing and
sometimes that can be a very small fix
and sometimes a bigger fix but I think
it's it helps me to go to sleep with the
thing in my head because helps me start
again the next day and I mean Hemingway
had this line about always write one
sentence less than you know and that's
it that's a very good trick actually you
know even if you know exactly what it is
just don't type it out you know and you
get up the next morning and do it and
then you've started and writers have all
these these these devices by which they
fool themselves into working you know
having where is very good at it actually
there's a in having ways interview in
The Paris Review the interviewer asks
him at some point about political
commitments and he said you know should
should this is of course the time of the
Spanish Civil War and etc and and the
interviewer says something like do you
think that writers should have strong
political commitments and and Hemingway
said the only commitment a writer needs
is the commitment of the seat of his
pants to the seat of his chair which
contains a great truth which is that in
order to write it they you've got to sit
down so sit down and don't let yourself
stand up I mean there are one or two
writers who have written standing up
there are very very few
I think Kierkegaard I think either
Kierkegaard or Schopenhauer I don't know
one of them I know one novelist from New
Zealand who has a podium in the middle
of his work room at cred of laptop
height
and I'd sort of paces around it every so
often ghost your pipe so that backs away
but mostly to right you need to sit down
so that's it that's a tip and you think
it's silly until you do it and then you
find it works well it's my pleasure to
say thank you from Microsoft thank you
so much for coming for those of you that
are interested in getting sallman to
sign your book he will be signing up at
the front and please help me in saying
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
