Microsoft Research tell us a little bit
about yourself
sure I'm a I'm a scientists in Microsoft
research but in particular I'm a
scientist in a group called
computational ecology and environmental
science which is a group based in the in
the Cambridge UK research lab and and so
that's a job title that probably most
people watching this video have have
never heard of before the fact that
Microsoft actually has a group of
computational ecologists in doing peer
peer research and what exactly is a
computational ecologist sure so so I
would like to simply be able to say a
computational ecologist is just an
ecologist but it's probably more
truthful to say that it's a bit more of
an ecologist of the future traditionally
it's really been a science dominated by
Natural History right people going out
into the wild into the woods and and
observing things for a long time and and
coming up with observations and
hypotheses and and then trying to bring
those into an experimental setting and
testing them to to prove or disprove
their hypothesis but as as the interest
in the environment has has scaled up and
as the realization that that everything
is connected at scales larger than just
maybe you know the woods behind your
house we've had to really scale up our
thinking and and to do that we have to
say ok let's start looking at things
from a global perspective at high
resolutions and let's try and take all
of these data that are coming in from
from sensors and and and scientists and
and lab notebooks and all this kind of
stuff and put it together well you know
you're just not going to do that at the
whiteboard anymore you you need really
strong computational methods and you
really and in computational workflows so
how did you get involved in this field I
know that you you said once that you
took a class on
station that really motivated you tell
us a little bit about that yeah sure so
my background is is probably quite
different than most people sitting in
Microsoft Research I come from from the
woods of far northern Wisconsin 30 miles
from a stoplight running around and
outside as much as I kid avoiding school
as much as I could and and I was not a
computationally minded person whatsoever
I was I was I was anything but I didn't
have my first computer until sometime
during my undergraduate years we never
had one the house you never had a TV in
the house and and so I came to
computational ecology and computational
methods through as a side product of my
passion which is trying to figure out
how to conserve ecological systems so
like you said I was I was an
undergraduate at the University of
wisconsin-madison I was studying
studying well I didn't know what I was
studying to be honest like like most
undergrads and as part of my general
education requirements I needed to take
a course in this wahala G Department I
stumbled upon one called extinction of
species which I thought sounded
interesting and I sat there for the
first 45 minute lecture and I'd never
heard somebody talk about something in
school that was so so close to to what I
found to be important but what I could
see is kind of a life mission I went up
after that class I said how do I do this
basically I'm not I think I I took the
professor by surprise a little bit but
we were friends today and he guys
started me down a process of of studying
wildlife ecology and zoology a two-year
stint in Malawi in the Peace Corps
working for their department of national
parks and wildlife and then a PhD in in
ecology at Duke University's Nicholas
School the environment and then research
so Microsoft research was a bit of
serendipity a bit of luck and a bit of
hard work in preparation I think I never
I never would have sat down you know 10
years ago and said my goal is is to be a
computational ecologist at Microsoft
Research although I hope that within a
few years that
were were recognizable enough that
people in undergraduate institutions
might have that goal I think I think
that that would be a fantastic thing to
see happen but but I had spent a lot of
my time working on ecological networks
so standard graph theory sorts of
questions because what I was really
interested in is what if one of those
nodes in a network is a species right
and what if the the edges between those
nodes who are interactions may be
feeding interactions and so we call
those things food webs or we used to
call them food webs now we call them
ecological networks but but I was really
interested in what happens if I take one
of those nodes out and what's the model
that describes how the you know the
interactions flow across the network and
what's the end result of that because
that that that's a species extinction
right and and that goes right back to
that undergraduate course that I took so
I was really interested in those methods
the computational ecology group was at
that time run by one of the foremost
experts in the world
a guy named rich Williams an expert in
ecological networks he'd he's a
fantastic guy he'd to help set up our
group and I got in touch with him our
research interest really clicked and and
I went you know the standard interview
process the and I met all the people in
the computational ecology group and it
really just felt like you know this is
the place kind of this is these are my
these are my kind of intellectual kin as
it were and I've been there ever since
and what's the value that computer
science gives to environmental sciences
you know we just can't handle first of
all and this is kind of boring but it's
pragmatic we just can't handle the the
amounts of data that are flowing at us
anymore without without embracing
computer science and computational
methods but it's also becoming extremely
difficult to to derive information from
those data without computational methods
so if I've got some sort of model with
with you know multiple parameters and
and different data sets and and I want
to have some sort of hierarchy
model structure and all of this kind of
stuff and and in the day you know I've
got a model I've got some data and and
in a Bayesian framework I want to
confront that model with those data to
how do I do that
right I mean I can I can write that out
I can I can describe the algorithm to
you in conversation I could write it on
the board whatever but the methods to
estimate the parameters in the model I'd
like I need my computer to do that and
that's just one small example are there
any major tipping points in here
intersection of environmental and
computer science there leading to rapid
advancements or realizations what can
you what can you glean from all this
information yeah so so I think the
tipping point that we're at now there's
there's two really interesting things
there the first is this this merging of
of hardware and software I think I've
never been so excited to to think about
technology as as I am now the idea that
hardware is no longer immutable you can
change it to meet your changing needs I
mean a project I had nothing to do with
but I'm hugely excited about is
something that came out of Microsoft
research called dotnet Gadgeteer which
is this plug-and-play built your own
hardware device and and we're using
those in our group quite a bit to build
these one-off bespoke environmental
monitoring systems and and you know you
can write some simple code and put
together some simple hardware and
suddenly you have something that's not
so simple you have a fairly
sophisticated environmental monitoring
device and and the the fact that
software is becoming much easier to work
with right twenty years ago you're you
you kind of needed to be a computer
scientist to to to really truly embrace
computational methods and now now people
like like me can can take those things
and go charging forward with in our in
our own research domains so so that's
one one area and the other area is just
this this
ubiquitous computing kind of things you
know we keep talking about ubiquitous
computing as if it's something of the
future as if we aren't all walking
around with smartphones in our pockets
and tablets on our desks and you know
and and and and refrigerators that no
one to want to cool down and and when
not to I mean the ubiquitous computing
is is occurring right now it will
computing will become even more
ubiquitous but but it's already going on
and and through things like
crowdsourcing I'm trying to figure out
what's going on in the natural world
it's never been easier right I can
quickly engage legions of motivated
individuals to go out and do things that
they really want to do and feel
passionate about contributing something
back and so things like just simply
trying to figure out where species are
right I can marry up machine learning
style models and methods like like
active learning and I can say okay I've
got only a few data points about this
species I've got some rough-and-ready
model that kind of its distribution
across maybe the state of Washington
according to some environmental
variables look like temperature and
precipitation but then using you know
statistical computational methods I can
say well what's the next most important
data point that I need right and I can
then engage with community active
communities of people and I can say hey
you you know you're the best person to
go and get me this information bring it
back you know and and yeah these aren't
ideas that people haven't had before
it's just that everything's now
available
you know crowdsourcing and citizen
sciences is it is accepted we we are all
running around with with some sort of
connected devices whether they be
tablets or smartphones and and and the
and the the machine learning and AI
techniques are coming along as well and
and it's really just creating this
exciting time even for an environmental
scientist so let's talk a little bit
about that tell me about the role that
machine work
I play in your work sure so I'll give
you a brief example in one of your
previous questions talking about species
distribution modeling and harnessing the
power of the crowd to answer some of
this stuff but we actually had a paper
just a few months back in the journal
science using some standard ai ai
techniques to answer a question of
international conservation importance
and it's interesting because I just try
to use whatever computational methods I
need to answer the questions that I'm
interested in and and it wasn't until I
saw a news story saying AI for
conservation that I realized oh yeah
this is these these techniques actually
you know that's the intellectual
heritage here but um but so in this
instance we're trying to ask a question
which is simply there's there's a
there's a convention called the
Convention on Biological Diversity which
is a convention signed by over 200
countries agreeing to halt the loss of
biodiversity by by 2020 by the year 2020
and one of their goals is to set aside
17 percent of land in protected areas
and that's an area that I'd work have
worked a lot on in in my time how
effective our protected areas where
should you put them at cetera etc but
there they have another goal which is to
protect 60% of plant species within
protected areas by the year 2020 so
nobody had ever asked that obvious
question which is well is that even
possible can you you know protect 60% of
plant species within 70% of the land
area can you cram 60% of all plant
species within such a small amount of
area so I want to ask that question I
wanted to ask that question about not
just 17% of land area I want an asset
about 7% and 8% and 28% and 38% how many
species can I cram into 28 percent of
the land 70% and I wanted to build these
nice accumulation curves and and see how
biodiversity really is distributed
cross across the planet and what do you
turn to for that you turn to greedy
algorithms and genetic algorithms and so
we used greedy algorithms to try and
build help iteratively you know step by
step the the optimal accumulation curve
and then we said well is our greedy
algorithm actually optimal and we turn
to very classic AI techniques like like
genetic algorithms and we said okay well
let's use these strongly computational
methods to to ask at seventeen percent
of the land how what are the ways that
we would pick the regions of the world
apart and and put them back together to
maximize the total number of species in
the least amount of area so that's just
one example of of machine learning or AI
techniques that are actually kind of you
know scaling up in relevance to to
international you know biological
treaties between countries and I find
that stuff really exciting so typically
when we talk about sensors we're talking
about sensors and a device or even
sensors in the data center where there's
a power strip and there's networking
you're talking about sensors and remote
locations what are your challenges
around that yeah so uh so I think this
saying gets repeated in all sorts of
domains but I am when I'm not at work
I've my whole life has been kind of
dedicated to work and and to racing
bikes and and in bike racing right we we
have the saying strong light and cheap
pick two you know and and the same kind
of goes with with devices you know I
don't know power efficient you know
robust and and cheap you know pick two
and and and the problem is when you're
working out in remote locations with
resource constrained organizations and
initiatives you don't have the privilege
of picking two you need all three you
need devices that are power efficient
that are connected and are robust to to
anything you know Nature throws at them
and so we've been working on on trying
to solve some of those those problems I
think one of the most interesting things
that we've been doing is designing these
bespoke GPS tracking
devices which which are called maitake
if you go to maitake down at work you
can you can find out more about them and
and they also set up a radio mesh
network amongst all of the devices that
are on animals out in the field and so
if if I'm wearing one of the devices and
you are you know we're constantly
downloading information from satellites
about our location and then we're also
passing our information back and forth
so you kind of saturate the network that
way so that you really only have to come
into contact with one of those devices
to get the network worth of information
but we're also doing things like working
with unmanned aerial vehicles to operate
as roaming base stations so you can
imagine a UAV flying around listening to
these devices right and when it hears
one it flies over and downloads its
information and what's even kind of more
incredible is it can you know you can
say right now have its autopilot
software lock on to that device for the
next five minutes and fly around turn on
your high-definition cameras bring all
of that rich information back and what
that allows you to do is it allows you
to marry up the kind of the the course
GPS you know information that you're
getting about how an animal moves
through its environment with that really
highly detailed contextualized
information for five minutes about
what's going on what's the landscape
look like what are the N other animals
around it what's it actually doing and
and and that's fantastic stuff in it and
it's it's causing us to think well not
now how would we model those data or
well not what models would we use it's
more what models can we come up with now
because we never even thought that we
would have that kind of information so
it's an exciting time what are some of
the unlikely collaborations have come
from your research efforts sure so all
sorts I mean just really briefly I'll
tell you a real one but but just the
other day an engineer who works for me
was was busy stuffing one of these
maitake devices in a rat as it was being
fed to a to a crocodile um so uh so
that's some you know strange stuff
because they're trying to take
crocodiles in one way to to do that is
to put one in its stomach so you know
you're watching that and you're just
gonna look how it
what is going on right now you know I
mean but but no the the the serious
answer to that question is is a
collaboration that I'm actually really
really proud of that's last year there's
an organization called the International
Union for the Conservation of Nature
IUCN it's the world's largest and oldest
conservation organization and it
operates very much at the international
level as an umbrella organization across
governments and and banks international
banks and and conservation NGOs and they
put out something called the Red List
which is if you've ever picked up the
newspaper and read 25% of plants are
threatened with extinction or something
like that that's coming from the Red
List it's I think I'm safe to say it
it's the single most important dataset
on conservation it's the result of over
you know ten thousand scientists across
the world uploading information about of
the species that they know about than
their conservation status so that's been
going on for a long time and and last
year Microsoft was invited to come on
board as the tenth partner to the Red
List we were the first corporation to to
be asked and and what was really
gratifying about that is that we
actually weren't asked because we're a
corporation sure yeah I mean the fact
that we are Microsoft is fantastic for
both parties I think for the resources
that can be potentially mobilized but
the reason that we were asked is because
we are the computational ecology group
with the skills the education and I
would like to think the passion to to
really drive some of this stuff this
stuff forward and so it's the 50th
anniversary of the Red List next year
and I'm really excited that Microsoft's
gonna be able to be part of part of that
celebration and part of that thinking
about what the next 50 years are going
to look like how is the use of spatial
data change the way scientists do
computational environmental work yeah I
think so spatial data is interesting
because we know spatial data is
someone who might not know yeah so
spatial data it's it's information on
locations right XY coordinates and and
what's what's interesting is outside of
environmental science the way spatial
data is often treated is is in in my
mind too kind of simplistic ways one we
like to turn spatial information into
grids right so if you go on big maps and
you and you zoom in and out you're
looking at spatial information
ecologists use facial data probably more
than any other domain because we're
interested in where animals move the
spatial context of of where they're
doing whatever they're doing and and
trying to bundle that all together and
explicitly including that in our models
as well we're interested in figuring out
how you how you use spatial data in a
much richer way then then has
traditionally been kind of taken up
before and and that's allowing us to
push things like our own company's
products the the fantastic geospatial
capacity of sequel server for example
that thousands of probably tens of
thousands or more I don't know of I'm
terrible with business numbers but you
know a lot of people and in the
enterprise world are using these these
these functions we're trying to we're
trying to do science now that I think is
using these products in the way that
enterprise will want to use them 10
years from now and and I always find
that to be a pretty strong rationale for
myself about about our utility here so
anyway that's just a long drawn-out
answer to a simple question but what's
it what's the holy grail for this work
what is one of the things that you'd
like to see happen in your lifetime or
in the length of your career yeah sure I
mean the Holy Grail is probably the the
holy grail of most scientific
disciplines I mean we're interested in
finding out as much information as we
possibly can about what happened in the
past collecting as much information
about what's going on right now and
being able to put all of that together
and to to try and figure out what's
going to happen into the future so my
Holy Grail would be you know
that you could go to a mapping service
preferably Microsoft's and and zoom in
and and start asking questions about
what's there we're in this place what's
there and what used to be there and
what's going to be there and you know
what what's the vegetation there if it's
agriculture what's the crop what's the
projected crop yield
what's the projected crop yield under
climate change scenarios all of that
kind of information I think is is is
wildly useful while held lis important
and and and there's also a significant
business rationale there I mean I before
I came to Microsoft I I had started up a
company called Earth audit which was all
about providing predictive information
about the planet finding out that I
could do the same thing but for one of
the world's most interesting and
important technology companies was a
no-brainer for me so so over I came but
but it shouldn't come as any surprise
then that my holy grail is is about
predictive information about the planet
it we need it
societies need it governments need it
businesses need it individuals need it I
I see it coming so so so that's my Holy
Grail um but but there's a long way to
go and what's next what are some of the
things on the horizon AZ one of the
things that I think has a lot of legs is
is an initiative that we've started up
called technology for nature and it
really is about trying to use technology
to rapidly scale up the global response
to biodiversity loss which which sounds
kind of like a mouthful but it
encompasses incorporates a lot of the
things that we've been talking about
about today it focuses really strongly
on devices and algorithms and software
and and interacting with with
conservation organizations and and and
and other other partners and the reason
that I think
it's so exciting and one of the reasons
that I'm so excited to work at a place
like Microsoft and Microsoft research is
I come to work every day and it's
impossible for me to ignore that I work
with a group of some of the smartest
most dedicated passionate people in the
world working on all sorts of things
that I do not work on that I don't want
to work on that maybe intellectually I'm
incapable of working on but for nearly
every one of those things I can imagine
how it would be enormous ly useful for
studying and helping to conserve
ecological systems and so technology for
nature is a bit of an umbrella term it's
it talks about it represents a research
agenda within our group but it also
represents a collaboration between the
Zoological Society of London and the
University of College London all three
of our organisations have really are
really motivated to try and leverage all
of the fantastic work that's going on
out there I mean it's there's there's so
much more to do than I can do and then
the people in the team that I work in
can do I have a personal passion for for
conserving conserving Earth's natural
systems and and so technology for nature
I think really marries those two those
two passions up quite well and I'm
excited about about the next year I
think it'll be great
thanks for talking to us today always a
pleasure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
