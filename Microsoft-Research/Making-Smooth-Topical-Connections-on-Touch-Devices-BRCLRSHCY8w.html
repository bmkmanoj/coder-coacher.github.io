researcher and I'll give you a demo of
something that we've developed recently
to explain it i'll start with something
everybody's familiar with a word cloud
here's a bunch of words found in the set
of news from one day from CNN and these
words are arranged alphabetically the
weights depend on how often they were
use that day but the I really tries to
find correlations in things that are
shown nearby for example missing money
news but actually there is there was no
news about missing money it's just our
imagination creating creating meaning
out of these if we arrange the same sort
of words in a spatial arrangement like
here so that related words are found
nearby then the whole map is much more
easy to consume you can find for example
words like cliff and fiscal next to each
other the way this is arranged is so
that in any local neighborhood you look
at the words that you find there tend to
correspond to the set of words you would
find in a single news story now how do
we do that well we used a machine
learning algorithm that we've developed
and that we call the counting grid the
contiguity is a grid of distributions
over words if you take a window into it
then combining all the words from this
one area would create a set of words
that you're likely to find in the
particular new story now if we try to
put a lot of different news stories
together into a small accounting then
inevitably we will force these new
stories to overlap so here what we see
is a summary of a very large number of
news stories and you will again see that
your eye now travels over topics that
are related here you have an area that
talks about crime whereas here have an
area that talks about protests and so on
and you can zoom into any one of these
and find that the news of interest and
you can also refine it here's my
favorite example we crawl the web and
found thousands of recipes from various
cuisines all over the world and you can
click on these and immediately get the
recipes on the right you can be verified
this grid by typing in a search term in
this case i'll type in shrimp and
immediately the grid will refine for you
now this is an extremely useful
interface for touch devices because you
don't type a lot you click and touch and
zoom a lot so this particular demo would
be extremely useful when you're shopping
if I found that my local store has some
fresh shrimp i dint might browse through
this grid and find the recipe of
interest for example maybe I'll go for
the coconut shrimp recipe so what I've
shown you here is how you can take a
large collection document and summarize
them using machine learning and then
browse through it using visualization
that really matches the representation
that machine learning algorithm have
come up with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
