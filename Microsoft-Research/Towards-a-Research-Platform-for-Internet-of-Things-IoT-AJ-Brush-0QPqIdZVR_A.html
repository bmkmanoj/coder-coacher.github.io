ok so the scenario we're going to use
today is I AJ and we're researcher who
deploy stuff into people's homes which
happens to be true and I'm going to
chris's home anybody here named Chris
okay we'll pretend chris is right there
and so what we're going to do is this is
chris's home wireless router right here
chris is good and has a nice fancy
password which I'm sure he'll change
right after I come there and so what I
have here is a windows laptop that is
running home OS and it's going to serve
as my home hub it's going to be the
local computer in the house that's going
to talk to the sensors and also stream
the data and talk to the cloud so the
first thing I need to do is join get
this computer onto the home network so
this is going to do two things it's
going to put my computer on the home
network it's also going to tell the Home
Hub the name of the home network and its
password so that it can give that to
other sensors that it's configuring this
is all one time setup right I've shown
up at chris's house I need to get set up
and we're trying to make it as smooth as
possible so i'm going to give chris a
home ID he's not going to be i'm not
going to be as good about the password
and a default email so that'll set the
home idea at this point the hub is
basically configured it's got a home ID
it has remote access which will come
back to it later and actually if I go
over to our management portal here these
are different hubs that I've deployed so
I can quickly see that the hub is
already sending a heartbeat up to as
your so I as the researcher can always
monitor and no you know is it still
working do I need to call that
participants do i need to go visit i can
know that remotely which having had some
stuff or we didn't have this and then we
found out later it wasn't working really
handy so that again that was one time
setup if i decide is the researcher that
chris is going to interact with my UI is
not just the logging study this is the
dashboard that Chris would see it's run
its built using html5 so that you can
log in on other web browsers other
devices all of those things so the study
that I am putting in Chris's house is
we're actually going to look at how many
times Chris uses his front door so I've
got the z-wave door wind
a sensor and I'm going to go ahead and
add it and so frizzy wave as some of you
know there's a z-wave dongle here that's
actually connected to my hub and I need
to put it in the pairing state so I'll
go ahead and push pair here click the
button on that and I'll get into this
final device setup menu so we're going
to call this the front door or sensor
see that it's a door window sensor I'm
actually going to say that it's at the
front door because maybe I'm like kameen
and I'm going to have you know 50 of
these on every door at this point also
the Home Hub knows that there are
certain applications that can use this
kind of sensor in fact this alerts app
which I wrote as the researcher and it
offers me the opportunity to install
that here if I want so we come back to
the dashboard the alerts app is there
this is just an example application with
the helpful fake sensor but if I go
ahead and simulate a door opening and
closing you'll see that it shows up here
in this case I've written the app so
it's going to email chris i might want
it to email a researcher and what it's
also doing is recording that data up to
the cloud so again I remotely can make
sure and I can look and I can analyze
the data that's coming in and retool
talk more about the cloud in the design
overview so let's go look at chris's
email and we can see is it about 330-4
yay chris got the alerts we already have
that wired up as well oops okay so now i
think you know alerts are nice but maybe
chris actually wants to see who's at the
front door when the sensor fires so i'm
going to go ahead and add this foscam
that's right here so what's happening
right here in this add devices menu is
that the Home Hub actually has a bunch
of scouts and it's looking for devices
that are already in the environment just
to make it easy for you to set up so
we'll talk about custom devices in just
a second but in this case it's found the
integrated camera that's on my laptop
which is super handy for trying the
platform out and this exciting very well
named mac address thing so this is a
foscam it asks me if I'm going to be
setting up a wireless camera if I choose
yes here the platform will actually take
those credentials and shove it over to
the
and help you configure it for the
interest of time I'm just going to say
no but you can come to the demo tomorrow
and see that in action so we'll call
this front door cam I'm going to also
put it at the front door and here you
can see a new application has become
available because I've now installed a
camera so let me go ahead and install
the camera viewer and it lets me choose
you know if this wasn't a camera that I
wanted to be triggered by the alerts
application I wouldn't click this but I
do so I'll go ahead and do that not
surprisingly new app down here so this
is the first time startup of the camera
viewer you won't see that again and
everyone over here should smile and wave
yes hello and so this is also just
another simple example application we've
written that shows how to get cameras
how to move them around how to do simple
recordings people still waving so those
were as kameen mentioned those are at
casa sorry commercial devices and that's
really handy and the platform already
supports connecting to the z-wave
sensors and other types of sensors but
sometimes when you have research you
have to build your own sensors so we've
actually been building a bunch of
sensors using.net gadgeteer and
primarily because we want to get to
really really simple setup and I
encourage you to come tomorrow and see
those but what I thought would be more
fun is for Aaron whose communes student
to to show you the door jamb sensor so
that occupancy sensor that she that
kameen talked about Aaron's been
spending just a tiny bit of her
internship connecting it to the lab of
things so what Aaron did first was right
a little scout so that when i clicked
add devices you may have already seen it
the door jamb food sensor shows up and i
can go ahead and click on that maybe
click on that there we go and it's very
familiar final device setup will come up
we'll call this the door jamb Center and
Aaron also wrote a small application
to look very familiar again this is the
one time setup of the device talking to
the platform so it just waits and then
it will come up which always seems
longer when you're demoing and so now
looking shocking like the alerts app if
Aaron walks under the door she might see
something she saw something this morning
you try it one more thing and then you
know why live demos are so much fun okay
that means the driver crashed and if we
an reinstalled it will probably work but
you can come tomorrow it was all just
the thing to get you to come to our demo
session tomorrow to see it actually
working ok so that was off the shelf
devices and some custom mostly custom
devices and then the last thing I wanted
to show you was remote access so if you
ever have people with studies you put it
in their house they might want to sit on
their phone when they're not there so
I'm going to do that we use Microsoft
Live ID and authentication so you can
permit people like yourself to have
access to a hub running in there and so
I thought I would just show you brush
home which is my hub running at my house
and I'll go ahead and look at the camera
that is on my front door wonder if I
lost internet connectivity that would be
fascinating there we go okay so this is
my front door camera which will load
shortly and we can move it around and
there's no one at my on my driveway
right now and then of course as soon as
you put a camera up your children want
to go run out in front of it and dance
for it and have you do recordings of it
okay so that was just a taste of the
platform and what ratul is going to come
up and do a design overview and that
will make clear sort of what's already
built in the platform what you as the
researcher plug-in for your particular
studies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
