cloud gaming
we're data center servers execute the
games on behalf of thin clients that
merely transmit UI input events and
display output rendered by the server's
has emerged as an interesting
alternative to the traditional
client-side execution
however cloud gaming faces a key
technical dilemma how can players attain
real-time interactivity in the face of
internet latency real-time interactivity
means client input events should be
quickly reflected on the client display
to overcome internet latency and deliver
a responsiveness out of time employs
speculative execution on the server and
compensates for miss speculation on the
client the basic principle is to use
statistical inference to speculatively
generate possible output frames and
transmit them to the client a for round
trip ahead of the clients actual
corresponding input if the speculation
is wrong the client applies a simple
warp on the speculative frame to obtain
a result that is a close approximation
to the ground truth the server can undo
wrong speculations in real time the key
is that clients experience zero Network
wait time between submitting and input
and receiving a corresponding frame that
is ready to show
let's first look at a case of navigating
an environment in the baseline case
where offloading is performed without
speculation note the delay between the
users mouse and keyboard movement and
the actual movement on the screen
now observed that the responsiveness is
much better without attack
we can directly compare the differences
side-by-side as well
you
let's next look at a case of triggering
an in-game action such as firing a
weapon again in the baseline case note
the delay between click and on-screen
event
now observe the improvement
a direct comparison highlights the
differences
you
finally let's observe the overall
action sequence
side-by-side many shots actually missed
their mark in the baseline case whereas
at a time is very responsive at a time
effectively masks Network latency even
for demanding twitch interactions
