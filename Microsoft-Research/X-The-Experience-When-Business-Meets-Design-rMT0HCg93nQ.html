solis com please join me in giving him a
very warm welcome thank you thank you
Amy there's such a soothing voice I just
got so relaxed well thank you very much
for being here I very much appreciated
to all those who are online thank you
very much I am an author yes seven books
this is number seven lucky number seven
I guess but I also feel like it's my
first book because when you're talking
about the idea of experiences there's a
great irony in talking about experience
design in a book format because it's
2016 and we live in an always-on world
where you could swipe right pinch and
zoom do all of these things yet we
haven't really reimagined what a print
book could be now right and it's the
same thing you look around everywhere
what could we do differently today if we
just took a step back to realize that
maybe we're just taking these processes
or things for granted and reinvented
them for today so I started with the
idea of what could a book be now and i
use teenagers as sort of my inspiration
when i started the book took three and a
half years to make this book partly
because the the subject was a little bit
crazy and the other part was just having
to you know think about a book
teenagers three and a half years ago
when doing their homework could focus
for six minutes before reaching for some
kind of device and I thought at that
time oh man what am I going to do in six
minutes how do you engage someone in six
minutes purse and by the time i was done
writing the book it had dropped to 60
seconds and if you think about what
happened in the last three and a half
years rights march smartphones became
more pervasive we've got more devices we
got more tablets we got more youtubes we
got more snapchats and technology
essentially permeated every aspect of
ours theirs lives and now the ability to
focus for six minutes would be a luxury
right and that is where this story
begins because now everything changes
because you have to capture attention
you have to be relevant you have to be
engaging in these little micro bursts of
attention and they have to matter and in
that regard everything could and should
be different today and that was the part
of the inspiration for this book the
other part was we all talk about
experiences we all love great
experiences we all hate bad experiences
but when I ask people you know what
makes an experience matter to you I got
thousand different answers and then I
started to look up well what seeks
what's the definition of experience I
just couldn't find anything like that I
could hold on to and then write a book
around so starting from scratch with
what a book could be what well what
could an experience be or should be and
then how do we design them so for those
who get the book you will notice firstly
that it's a different shape and i used
the ipad air as you know or a surface
depending on which one you want to look
at as the inspiration for familiarity
because that's a blank canvas right and
it's a familiar canvas whereas the
textbook is sort of our floppy disk
right it just doesn't necessarily have
to have relevance today and then you'll
notice that there is no table of
contents turns out that when you study
today's brain and how it engages online
and also how it engages in the small
screen we tend to look for things very
quickly and grab on to them and move
from there so i reverse-engineered a lot
of this I studied you access any to you
I studied how people engage some of
their favorite apps and tried to bring
those insights on the paper rather than
trying to create the coolest digital
experience why not show you what it
could do in an analog world because if
you can take all those insights and
apply it to a paper bound book imagine
what you can do with everything right
because it affects preferences it
affects decision-making it affects
values I also had to relearn how to
write sentences which is crazy right
because as an author the first thing I
tended to do was start writing I have
all of this expertise I want to share it
with you but then no one would read it
right because the brain would shut off
or retention would go down or the
willingness to want to turn the pages
which is sort of dwindle and then how
many sentences could you put together
before you need white space or before
you need a visual or before you maybe
are inspired to translate a paragraph
into visual learning to say that my mind
was blown is an understatement I was
completely debilitated I didn't want to
finish the book I wanted to give up I
missed about five deadlines to get this
thing out and that was all because it
was a very human experience to go
through and all in order to share with
you also then how do you build an
experience and it starts quite literally
with an out-of-body experience one of
the quotes or one of the things that
inspired this book was a commencement
speech by David Foster Wallace where he
talked about this is water how many of
you have seen that just a few well then
I'll explain it so he is speaking to a
group of university students and he says
that tells the story of some fish
swimming in a fishbowl and these two
fish are just sort of starting their
morning and another fish passes by and
says hey boys how's the water and the
two fish look at each other saying water
what's talking about
and the story to me is a metaphor for
how we sort of live life right we go
through everything with the processes
and the systems that we have and we try
to be innovative with in those
environments right and that's that
that's a perpetual box we're supposed to
think outside of but in the concept of
this is water I I think about water as
sort of a canvas right these are the
things we go through daily yet we take
them for granted when we could actually
look at them as opportunities for
inspiration because you get to
consciously decide what has meaning and
what doesn't right and the more
connected you become I found that the
more empowered you become and the more
empowered you become the more demanding
you become this is why we see so much
disruption today right because people
have choices and they're starting to
exercise them differently because things
are starting to feel foreign things are
starting to feel old and when they do
that's someone's idea to come in and
just change the game right and one of
the most often use examples is uber
right nobody who uses an uber goes back
to taxis but at the same time it is the
quintessential customer experience
because it brings something to you and
you can track it I've also studied how
long patients lasts for uber i think the
number now is four minutes or less
anything above that you're canceling
right yet you've got a car coming to you
and you can track it wow it's like the
louis ck i don't know if you've heard
his rant about Wi-Fi on an airplane the
same same sort of thing and so I looked
at experience then from the all aspects
right from music to movies to brand and
brand seemed to be the one that stuck
the most because business goose is
really in dire need of reinvention and I
couldn't I mean the same things I've
learned about business and brand I've
learned about education I've learned
about government I mean all of these
things about how technology is changing
us we have to reinvent all of these
things but the idea of it is that
there's what we say we do right and then
there's the reality what do people
experience and more so what do they
share because the shared experience is
actually what
matters right and in today's online
society none of these experiences
disappear they just compile and collect
and they become indexable and so I think
part of our work is to study well what's
the experience divided right our promise
versus what people do right no one
tweets united airlines because they're
happy right yet if you look at united
site they talk about how amazing they
are and i'm sure they're trying but the
reality is is that you have to design
for human beings and you have to design
for the moments of which they experience
your products and services because how
they react is the reality right and that
is then what is experience because i
don't think we have really sat down and
swallowed this one yet because once we
do i think there's an empathetic pill
that you know we can start to create i
closed my eyes these are the first words
of the book you know close your eyes and
try to remember that last moment that
really touched you that really moved you
that really inspired you what was it
about it right what made you feel
special what inspired you to do
something differently because it's
moments like that where an experience
begins because it's something you feel
right it's something you sense it's
supposed to affect what you do and
that's the power of an experience and
they require design and today we leave
those moments those deep moments up to
chance right we could get away with it
for a long time but now we're starting
to see that we can write everything is
ripe for disruption and I think if we're
waiting for somebody to tell us what to
do were on the wrong side of innovation
this is that moment we're not just in
this book but in all of my research and
study and innovation it starts with
perspective right it starts with seeing
things differently in order to do things
differently
all businesses have to have some type of
emotional attachment to their customers
now I just wrote a paper everything
every business could learn from the
state of the music industry except the
music industry of course when I was a
kid I used to put posters of my favorite
artists on the wall right because they
were going to be around a while I wanted
to be like them and if you think about
artistry today most of the time people
don't have time to put well first of all
they don't even know a posters are of a
second second of all there's no artist
that really lasts long enough to be
relevant in the moment except for Drake
or Beyonce but think about or what's her
name Taylor Swift but think about to the
level of which they have to compete
right there drop in surprise albums
they're taken over concerts or create an
experiential things all over the country
to try to stay relevant and the idea of
what happened is that people stopped
looking at artists as the thing that
they were that they wanted to be now I
call us accidental narcissists because
technology has shown us that we're at
the center of everything that we want to
do now we take celebrities and we take
artists and we make them part of our ego
system right they're just little
satellites we pick and choose who we
want to represent us and that's sort of
the reality of business today businesses
and brands are no longer created their
co-created and the idea of an experience
a shared experience is the thing that
becomes defining it's the ultimate
metric did you experience this and
everything the way that I designed
because that's the way it should be yet
we still create products in the absence
of actually thinking of where they
should go and what they could do we
still shout at people using all kinds of
traditional forms of marketing we use
new forms of technology in order to do
the same things we used to do I call
that medium ism right so we get all
these social mobile apps and networks
but we don't necessarily bring a new
philosophy to it we don't recognize that
part of the power of all of these
technologies that are happening today is
the fact that they're completely
democratized right that they're driven
by us not from the top down and the
minute we understand that it's a minute
we could become part of it instead of
trying to dictate it or talk to it or
talk down to it so there's design right
and there's creativity and there's
reality I've gotten in a ton of debates
with people saying well Brian what
you're really talking about it's just
creativity and design but the answer is
no no I'm not what I'm talking about is
what I did with the book is reverse
engineering people how they behave their
aspirations right because they're
different and let it start to affect me
differently in order to do something
differently because that's what true
innovation starts right it's unlocking
new value right otherwise it's just
iteration which is just doing things may
be better that's X the book is called X
because we have all of these disparate
movements within an organization brand
experience we have user experience we
have customer experience we have with
view we have xbox but at the end of the
day x is experience it is going to
happen whether you design it or not and
the thing about business today I mean
we're all customers of some business and
there are aspects of businesses I'm sure
you love and there's aspects of
businesses I'm sure you hate but why
does that have to be the case anymore
because anything can come along and
change that now and I think that
experience is rooted in the little
things and you have to design for them
all right you have to design for the
things that you want to be special that
you want to stand out you know I work
with one company that after they talked
to a customer believe me this is not as
scalable as you know a contact center
but after they talked to a customer they
will send a handwritten note and just
blows people
right and of course their retention
numbers sore and then word of mouth then
kicks up acquisition and like oh there's
some roi who knew because I always
wondered like what's the eye and ROI if
it stands for ignorance like what
happens we don't do anything and I
realize some of the greatest sources of
innovation came from outside of our
normal day right we tend to look at our
markets our usual competitors right and
I found that that absolutely limits our
creativity so you look to other things
how are people engaging folks today how
are they engaging folks yesterday you
know for example at Disneyland the
bricks in all of their buildings get
smaller as they get taller and that's
the force as we were talking earlier
perspective so that you as an adult can
feel like a child again in the park
which is supposed to rekindle your inner
child but to the extent of which they go
to that detail right there's no reason
why we can't go to that detail these are
experiences these are the things you
remember these are the things you love
and every one of these moments counts
right technology I think is best when
it's invisible there was a time where it
didn't have to be I grew up programming
das at Fortran and all of these things
that I glad I forgot but this is a
moment where technology comes to life
right and I also look at this as being
an example of customer experience as
being some of the greatest because it's
not just about what she's wearing it's
about what's happening behind the scenes
and the fact that a company like Disney
had to build an entirely new
infrastructure to reimagine the customer
experience right this is the magic band
right to her she can get into the park
she can get in the fastpass she can open
her hotel door she can pay for souvenirs
and food it's got proximity devices in
it so that if she makes a reservation at
one of the restaurants it knows when
she's coming and it'll greet her on the
wall and there are people that I have to
debate with that say well that is just
creepy nobody wants that that's
violating my privacy but that's the way
it used to be right but I promise you
that the word privacy doesn't mean what
it used to mean right privacy now is it
a currency of which we exchange for
value and so to her those are all things
of value and the back end of Disney is
studying all of these movements they're
studying all of these engagements and
they're looking at ways that they can
innovate and park design that ways to
reduce the queue they got rid of all of
the turnstiles or thinking about new
ways of currency within within within
the park so they're taking this and
improving the experience right so for
now they're trading that data for
experience and it's intentional right
its purpose driven and so that's why I
believe that it's all just a matter of
perspective and that's what unlocks or
better yet unleashes possibilities I get
in my way every single time I try to
write every time I try to research every
time I try to design something new and
it's just good old psychology right
cognitive bias and validation bias I
don't see the world as it is I see the
world as I am and then make decisions
accordingly our entire life our entire
career or entire education has brought
us to these moments that are now may be
partially relevant the one thing that
I've learned I've learned is that
perspective actually triggers learning
when you shift perspective you learn
something you allow yourself to learn
something and this is when I realized I
was just a student I had to relearn
everything and I still have to relearn
everything and I'm not saying you all
need to just go out and start learning
new things but this is the heart of
experience design and when you shift
perspective you could see it in
everything right how many of you seen
this picture before just
just one or two okay well this is a
picture I wanted to share with you
because it represents sort of the
challenges that we have today right now
every executive I meet with will look at
this picture and say this is exactly
what's wrong with society no one can
live at the moment they're all on their
phones they can't look up except for
this dear sweet woman right here in the
front she's in the moment look at that
smile on her face but you could argue
with the shift of perspective well I
want people who are on their phones
sharing this moment with every single
one of their audiences who have
audiences with audiences because now
that moment is bigger than just
whomever's there and look at this
selfish woman here in the front not
sharing this moment with all her
Facebook friends that couldn't be there
so the idea is you can see what you want
to see in anything right and validation
bias cognitive bias I mean especially
for those of us in the room who are
parents we tend to sort of let that get
in the way of innovation so this is an
art series where the photographer
removes the phone from everyday
scenarios
and I use it to illustrate the point
that we live in an ecosystem right
everything is so counterintuitive about
design and the idea of what an
experience is right and what an
experience is to me versus what an
experience is to someone who lives the
digital lifestyle are just radically
different right I would have just
written another book had I not gone
through this and the one thing that it
unlocked and me was empathy I realized
that empathy I always thought I was
empathetic all right but I realized the
closest I ever got was sympathy may I
can I could I could I could feel you but
I didn't go through life as you in the
minute you do it changes the game right
this is this is a sidewalk in China
where you walk on one side with your
phone and on the other side without your
phone it's very real by the way I
promise you were going to have this in
airports because I can't seem to get
around anybody or this see to them it is
the best party ever right the telling
each other that they're telling
everybody that they're snapchatting
these moments there's probably a
thousand selfies going on or things like
tinder right some of us think it's a
dating app but the point of it is is
that all of these things are sort of
changing your expectation each one of
these apps each one of these services
each one of these technologies is
basically programming people to know
that they're the center of the universe
right every app tells them that right or
the idea that if you think about
Maslow's hierarchy of needs you would
get a whole different set of answers
from people who live online or people
who live a connected lifestyle yet we
tend to design still for the world that
we know not for this hype I mean if
people freak out in moments like this
one of the things that I didn't share
with you which changed my whole world
was I'm a digital analyst by trade but
about 10 years ago I became a digital
anthropologist as well because
technology
well it's accelerating right and the
ability to track all of the technology
networks apps devices you know what all
of this things I track it in the wheel
of disruption which gets crazier every
single year but understanding
technology's impact on us was a pit
slower but more so is a bit more
meaningful and it was these stats that I
wanted to share with you they're really
started to bring things to life for me
we right now look at our phones on
average about 1,500 times a week which
adds up to about 170 7 minutes a day and
I promise you that there is all kinds of
science that shows not just Millennials
all of us that we're reprogramming our
brains as we do so right you're becoming
a little less patient you're becoming a
little bit more let's just say
optimizing what it is that you're trying
to do time suddenly there's not enough
of it and as a human being this is
affecting you as you make decisions
around the company's you do business
with and over time this means that whom
you're working with and how you're
working with them is now changing your
expectations right so this is why an
uber comes along and decimates the taxi
industry while I was writing this book
the reason why I decided to look at how
people engage with digital and mobile
and social and then apply that to paper
was because of a video I watched many
years ago of a one-year-old baby using a
tablet right just all very intuitive her
father thought it would be funny if he
handed her a magazine and of course the
first thing she does is this and it
doesn't work she starts crying and her
father says you know to to my daughter a
magazine is an iPad that doesn't work
and it will be that way for the rest of
her life and I was like oh mind blown
because here i was on youtube just
having avoidance behavior syndrome
and I'm changing me because it was a
demonstration of cognitive bias I had to
learn what a tablet was I had learned
what smartphone was there's an entire
generation in another generation behind
them that had to learn what a magazine
is right and if you bring that to an
intersection of how you would make a
decision versus how they would make a
decision it's radically different and so
we were designing the world with hoops
and touch points and journeys that were
completely outdated from the get-go but
it's not just about younger generations
I've got all kinds of studies that show
that we're all becoming just a connected
society right of course but I can
promise you that a 55 year old who lives
an active digital lifestyle makes
similar decisions or exhibit similar
decision-making behaviors as a 25 year
old right and now that means our
opportunity for engagement for
experience design now has to take
extraordinary leaps of moving forward to
the point where now there are groups
studying the effect that tinder has on
younger brains and whether or not they
can take that into testing right because
if you think about it they're getting
really good at left right Yes No a bee
and it's engaging and so that's then if
we can make things more engaging and if
we can reinvent a book you know I wanted
to take all of these insights why am I
am taking all these insights and giving
them away to textbook companies so that
they can hopefully do something a little
bit more relevant but if you play this
out in a daily environment whether it's
business or whether or whatever it is
right the way people go through life now
is very clunky because they're now
having to go through these touch points
that we've put out there that are just
rooted in pre or internet 10 sort of
philosophies and perspectives right
again remember the design we've put out
there versus the design that people take
loops too fast is different
and so I use ketchup as a metaphor right
because there's years that none of us
challenge the ketchup bottle right we
all even came up with strategies for it
Oh 45 degrees or the soft part of your
hand no no no no a knife knife is what's
going to do it every time and then
someone came along and said you know it
works gravity with a bit of a squeeze
that's that's going to work that's far
more effective but it is an example of
experience design right and so we tend
to just go because bottles have been the
thing that everybody's always done right
but then I you know I live in Silicon
Valley so but it's the way it's always
been done is a quote said by no
successful entrepreneur ever right and
so everything then could be reimagined
and I work a lot with Google and they
found these crazy things called micro
moments that now take experience design
to a whole new level so you can imagine
Google your you know or being right you
you think traditional search when people
aren't actually using search engines on
a smartphone because in those moments
what comes back as websites or web sites
right and nobody loves a wobble website
experience for two reasons even if you
have responsive design we haven't
reimagined the definition of a website
since 1995 it is still brochure we're
right yet now we have so little patience
so remember 60 seconds on the high
school student front now you have to
make a decision they found that in these
moments are going to other places right
I think one of the biggest threats to
search engines right now is Amazon and
YouTube because people just want things
fast but one of the stats that they came
back with just blew me away which was
ninety percent of people who go into a
micro moment to make a decision our
brand agnostic so now when you're
thinking about creating experiences the
nature of an experience has to
what's going to get your attention based
on what you're trying to do and then how
are we going to move forward together
because most people in those
micro-moments who get information that
helps them they will move forward with
them so now everything is up for grabs
right so the idea of why our company is
being disrupted by startups that come
out of nowhere well here's here's why
right because these things are relevant
and when it boils down to what it really
is all about its perspective it's what
you leave here today with whether you
look at things the same way or you're
open to new possibilities but I get it
right part of the process is the process
all right I work with people who are
booked all day every day on the hour
perpetually running a few minutes late
to every meeting because the other one
ran up against the hour and then they
have email on top of that and they're
supposed to try to do new things but we
can't do new things if we don't do new
things and so I found all kinds of
examples I could I could be here all day
with you I I had so many examples of
things that we take for granted every
single day like quotes like if Henry
Ford if I would have asked people what
they wanted they would have told me a
faster horse or be the change you want
to see in the world I found all of these
things that we take for granted every
day it turns out that those really
weren't the sources who said that stuff
or 1971 TV Guide all right for some of
you in the room we used to get this
magazine that showed us what's on
television for the week so you have
essentially a brand new device of which
to explore television yet we haven't
innovated much in how you navigate this
beautiful screen because no one saw the
opportunity to say well what could this
experience be for a new generation of
people right what could television
programming be so what's happening now
right this experience basically is what
it is but now you have things like
Netflix yet program
content you have things like YouTube you
have all of these different apps that
are starting to change how you think
about programming well I wonder why it's
because we never really reimagine the
opportunity well it's everywhere
everything you do in life could be
reimagined for a modern experience right
this sucks it sucks so bad that in part
of the book I studied it what happened
turns out that going back to the 1950s
we decided that what we should do is
just add more buttons remote controls on
average have 70 buttons today in a world
of this right the first app for the
television was a remote control just a
bunch of buttons on your smart screen
this is iteration and this is what we
tend to do when we are introduced to new
technologies and when we're gifted with
this opportunity to reimagine
experiences we can't really take an
iterative approach because you'll end up
with the remote control you have to take
a completely different approach right
parking signs think about that moment
when you have to park you probably are
under pressure there's cars honking
behind you and you're trying to make a
decision about whether you can stop here
so the city of New York says this is bad
we hear you we're going to come up with
a whole new parking experience so they
open it up the creative agencies and
they got a parking sign so there's a
great a great artist in Los Angeles who
said well I don't know if that's any
better why not something that we could
all understand based on how we visually
take cues from the screens that we use
all day long all right oh I guess I'm in
the red at this moment so sympathy
versus empathy this is an app that turns
the camera on your phone so that you can
text safely without getting hit by cars
or running into streets or poles
it's also not the most popular app
because it's hard to do that but it is a
metaphor for seeing the world
differently right because it is
different it is so different that in
order to design meaningful experiences
we have to be inspired by how people are
different right and I look to the good
old days of Disney and storyboarding
because there's a magic to storyboarding
I think a lot of us didn't know I didn't
know actually what storyboarding really
was about I thought it was about
basically putting together snippets of
the story to sort of test it out before
you went into the animation process it
turns out that it's a way of humanizing
the characters making them believable
testing the story forcing you to act
them out so that other people around you
can say yes say no and air B&amp;amp;B about
three years ago I mean this is a
seven-year-old startup so about four
years into their life decided that there
was a problem with Airbnb in terms of
its scale and if you remember all of the
news reports back in the day about well
Airbnb that's a that's the place where
you go to have drugs and sex parties you
know and or you get your stuff stolen so
they realize look what we need to do is
go through they were inspired by the
storyboard process that Disney used for
Snow White and they got all of their
customer data they got all their user
data they also got data from some of the
best like the ritz-carlton like what
made a great ritz-carlton experience and
they put all that data into storyboards
if they first came up with these
characters right who are the types of
hosts we have and who are the types of
hosts we want and who are the guests we
have and who are the guests we want and
how do we bring those stories to life in
ways that air B&amp;amp;B can then be a real
alternative or real central imperative
to them and it turns out that there was
a lot of things that they took for
granted in their journeys and also in
their host and guest experiences and
that was this things like if you're a
guest and you were in traffic
on the way to the property or you
encountered some of the wonderful people
at TSA at the airport all of those
things were contributing to the guest
experience so for them they realized
that the Airbnb brand was in the hands
of their hosts so they needed to better
understand their hosts why were they
hosting what were they looking to get
out of this how could we be sort of
their partner and delivering experiences
that matter to them and to the guests
and realize that they had to invest in
experience architecture which is almost
like saying this is what people are
going to feel this is what people are
going to leave with and this is how
we're going to make that happen so for
example a good host now is being trained
and conditioned to help their guests
build a relationship before they get to
the property so that they can understand
what are your preferences what do you
like for example I just went to one in
santa cruz and all of those questions
came to life in the form of my favorite
wine on the table a nice handwritten
note and just a wonderful journey and
wonderful experience that was
intentional and all of that because of
this storyboarding experience they hired
at Pixar storyboard artist his name is
Nick sung and he came out and brought
this all to life and I brought him out
once I heard this story to help me
storybook what I wanted my book to be
based on who the reader really was and
what a day in the life was and it was
such a profound experience that I had to
start over I'd her trash the book and
start over I hated him for that but I
loved him for that and so I actually
believe that all these different
disciplines uxc xbx these are all the
things that just bring up the letter X
and the letter X to me is part
storytelling right part user centered
design definitely human Center design
but coming together in a meaningful
experience architecture of which then
literally transforms the entire dynamic
of business right every thing someone
touches around your company whether its
employees or customers affect the
experience and believe it or not none of
these things work together today
in fact in often times they're
competitive but now in an age of
accidental narcissists or the ego system
every bit of this has to be optimized
streamline and integrated to deliver
something that people want because if
they don't they'll leave they'll go
somewhere else and there's a science to
all of this this can all be this could
all be drawn out this is an experience
map around a particular moment and it's
made sure that everything is accounted
for this is an experience flow that
shows you how all of those moments come
together to play out and I actually
believe that when you design for people
based on how they are not how you are a
lot of really cool things happen so I
want to leave you with this innovation
is something that begins with the shift
in perspective it's never technology
technology is a byproduct of how you
shifted perspective and how you knew
about something you didn't know before
to design it experience and innovation
is something you have to feel right you
have to be motivated and inspired to
want to do something differently about
it and then it's about action right but
it's got to be the type of action that
where it's okay to try what's okay to
take risks right is one of the biggest
things that prevent any kind of
innovation is fear or politics or egos
or a lot of just stuff right but in
reality this there's there's no choice
all right this is what I want to leave
you with this is a blank canvas and I
realized the only way I was going to get
this book out was to just start from
scratch it was harder and easier to do
so but if you think back to the
beginning of this is water right in the
story of the fish this is space and it's
yours to design in a time and in an era
that's different than what we came up in
and that's okay right because that's how
we continue to earn relevance not just
with with our roles right but think
about what this means to what you're
going to mean tomorrow
and more so the relationships with your
colleagues and with customers and their
customers and everybody that results in
the process right because now what
you're essentially doing is recognizing
that innovation is something that starts
with you so thank you very much and
we'll go to questions but not all at
once so who has a question for me yes
the business model for a beautiful
coffee table book that has great
business insights this seems
disconnected not just the price point
here but but just in the marketplace
itself how did you pull that off okay so
his question actually was a part I
forgot to tell you because his question
is this huh the the economic model of a
book like this versus cover price versus
the infrastructure that it took to get
the book out how did I pull it off it
was a very very difficult series of
conversations right because there's one
thing to sort of come up with a
beautiful book but if any of you have
ever bought a coffee table book you'll
notice that they're much more expensive
that's because the production process of
a coffee table book is is not at scale
of the regular text books or regular
business books that's why business books
all look the same my idea was I had to
make the case to the publisher and there
was a little bit of history right I
don't think I could have done this on
the first or second book but I had to
also help them find a new economic model
to produce this book because it would
have been easy to do it at a hundred
dollar price point however I had to
bring it into the neighborhood of a
traditional business book so we we had
to find an entirely new supply chain for
this book and we were able to bring the
price points down in fact as you saw it
I don't know how many of the first ones
were they were only ten dollars we were
able to find a whole new supply chain
model build this book now this was hard
wasn't easy in fact the first the first
I think the first ten thousand copies
that came off the press about four or
five thousand of those
her hand fed because we were just trying
to get it to make it work but then we
found the right processes of which to
design and build it and now it now it
works it's a thicker paper the color
saturation had to be able to sustain
that wasn't easy however every author
after me is going to have it easy
because now there's a whole
infrastructure for this yes I'm curious
if you could elaborate a little bit
during the course of your research when
you talk to different organizations
about how they approach design have you
come across new models of how to
integrate the whole practice of design
and I say design I mean that the big
design that's not you know the visual
design maybe I can look a little bit
nicer into into the whole business
operations because I think that's
something that these are wrestling with
including ours we're moving from a
traditional functional hierarchy to one
that is specific more that ordinary
interest yeah part of that so I study
this also in my research it's a lot of
it falls under what's called digital
transformation so there's this movement
within organizations that are realizing
that a lot of their infrastructures to
compete in the digital economy are let's
just say slow and process driven and
this prevents decision-making which
prevents speed and also prevents
collaboration right so the closest a lot
of organizations get are sort of matrix
but if you look at some of the companies
that I think we've all celebrated for
years like Disney or Nike they have a
design culture right it's just that way
but how do other businesses get there
it's really difficult so one of the
things that's a catalyst turns out is
the customer experience and they're
looking at the digital customer
experience specifically to show where
they are weak and then they form groups
over time of course and all this
research is free that you guys could
just download just my name Brian solace
and digital transformation because I
show exactly what they're doing
to create the case how they create the
case the way it's done is they look at
the differences between their digital
customers and the customers they think
that they're designing for and they look
at where the friction is where the
differences are and where they are and
where they need to be and they come up
with this prioritized roadmap and then
the quash the conversations begin by
saying what do we need to do to get
there well what we need to do is bring
this person in this person and this
person together to start forming so it's
almost like a matrix approach but they
actually end up forming new divisions
within the organization so it's process
reinvention that's model reinvention and
a lot of these things start as little
pockets of innovation if you will right
to solve big problems or solve for
bigger opportunities now that plays out
over time which becomes digital
transformation because they get momentum
they always get momentum and then that
starts to to grow and in two weeks i
have a report called the six stages of
digital transformation that specifically
detail how companies get from one stage
to the next so that companies like
Microsoft can just say okay here's where
we are we can benchmark ourselves here
here's what other companies are doing
and now let's let's prioritize these
things by the way the big one of the
biggest challenges of this isn't is an
intention right everybody I think wants
to do the right thing it's just it's
just culture culture gets in a way a lot
of times yes how does brand relate to
experience design make the brand as we
have to I think brand used to be
something that was creative right we
used to used to bring the life with
imagery with messaging with scenarios I
think that the best way is to look at
well what's the experience you want
someone to have right i mean the disney
the girl with the smile that's that's a
disney experience and that is also the
disney brand right it's just meant to
evoke sort of this smile and everything
that you do and to remember that
whatever age you are you are a child and
you are allowed to be imaginative and
you are allowed to be creative that is
although Imagineering everything that
Disney does is based on architecture
and as a and they apply that thinking
it's rich throughout the culture they
have a university in florida teaches
this type of thinking and they try to
bring businesses through to say it's not
you can't just have a brand a brand has
to be something that's experienced and
then in turn the measurement is well
what did you think well this is what I
this is what I felt and that's a perfect
because that's what we designed it for
you know Disney takes imaginary all the
way down to to everything they do like
their cruise ships that the rooms they
thought of all the little things like
that families were going to be in this
room probably too many people that
should be in one room but they designed
the room where the desk becomes a bed
this thing folds down from a wall to
make another bed the bathroom and the
sink are split in a tiny little cruise
ship quarter system someone could use
the restroom or someone's taking a
shower you know these things are all
intentional but they all ladder up to
the Disney experience which is then the
Disney brand right so it's it's human
centered and in reverse engineered in
that regard yes do you have any ideas
run ways to get your voice of the
customer i'm running a service right now
and it I just feel like I have to go
grab it out of out of my users to figure
out ways to improve you know there's two
there's two schools of thought that I
think should be merged one is the voice
of the customer right and then there's
the voice of the customer you don't have
and Starbucks for example will say that
they don't look at other coffee
companies as their competitors they
actually have you know to your point
about digital transformation earlier
they have a new division that starts
with merging an aspect of IT but
specifically for innovation and
specifically around mobile and payments
a group around basically what's this
chief digital officer in order to build
architectures to rapidly test and learn
and they do this because they think
their biggest competitors or PayPal and
other companies like that because
they're finding that the mobile payment
sector the there's a ton of things
they could learn about that customer
that they could design for in Starbucks
which is why Starbucks just came up with
the deal with instacart think you could
like uber you could have a you could
have your coffee brought to you right
and people people do that so how do you
then activate that a part of it is that
a voice of a customer program sucks if
you're really just trying to yank things
out so you might as well be a dentist or
you could build a community an active
community a thriving community of which
that thing is always on and there's
value of being in that community there's
value to belonging and then part of that
is you're providing in for insights and
information and benefits to them and
you're getting something in return which
is feedback in insights but what ends up
happening this as you build up community
and there's a lot of case studies out of
a company like lithium for example where
you can you can you can get how this is
done turns out that the more you invest
in communities as your v OC program the
more I guess the better your feedback is
because the more engaged people feel
that better the satisfaction a lot of
these things retention goes up all
because ended up doing something to get
something that ended up becoming
something better I should have a lot of
questions online but one is because
although anyone including engineers can
design products with empathy have you
found a correlation between the
innovation and companies that are
structured around on engineers example
is hearing that at Apple the designers
and marketers lead on lead on product
development and the engineers just
execute on designers markers vision well
there's I mean he brought up Apple III
wasn't going to be
you know I know I know one of the
original six on the iPhone design team
it's good friend of mine and the stories
he tells argistix i mean incredible and
one of the things he's he's partly
engineer but he's also part design
thinker and one of the stories he tells
was how they were originally forming the
team for the iphone and they went out
and they found all of the best engineers
in the game to bring on to the iphone
team and they presented the Steve about
their ideas of who the superstar team
was going to be and Steve did one of
those things basically said no I don't
want anyone who's ever worked on a phone
to work on the iPhone and so that is
sort of do you think about it he wasn't
an engineer I there right but you have
to bring into that moment not just
empathy but vision right so there is an
aspect of what people do that unlocks
empathy of which you feel which is
supposed to unlock innovation of which
you see and then you bring in the team
of engineers and architects to bring
this to life because it can't just be
onee any one aspect of it right i mean
we're not all going to change overnight
we're all going to bring our little
cognitive biases to that meeting but
that's why we have to work towards this
vision and somebody has to have that
vision because then that gives everybody
purpose and that i think is is it's a
very complex answer but that's the way
it's always done that's how it happens
and and by the way nobody said you know
going back to uber what if we design an
application of which it was driven by a
moment where we all got stuck in Paris
in the snow because if you get just a
sprinkle of snow on the ground all the
taxi drivers decided take the day off
and so we were stranded from a
conference called leweb in Paris and
that was that's that was driven by an
idea of pain right and then uber became
what can we do to solve for that
so that's just that's just one approach
okay one more
there was another question online oh
I'll use it Amy please represent the
voice of the online customers there's
several questions around too similarly
your de saying that around non design
organizations like HR like how do you
get this perspective into an
organization that doesn't typically
think this way which is ironic because
it's human resources right but when I
talk to HR this is why my next focus is
on culture because this is actually the
crux of what what we're starting to talk
about when i talk to HR about this how
do we design employee experience right
and I and I look at what's your greatest
challenge you know what the answer I get
is you're going to love this the answer
i get from HR their biggest challenges
Millennials so what what do you mean
just a blanket statement like that well
they don't work within our processes
they they always want to be reviewed
more than the review processes are there
they don't like their management
infrastructure they want a little bit
more freedom they want to be able to
switch jobs and you know brick is so you
know so I said okay so you're going to
just basically change the fundamental
nature of who they are is that what
you're asking me how to do that because
I have kids and I'm asking myself how do
I do that right so I walked them through
a scenario I said just give me a real
world problem something that you're
dealing with today and they said well
okay all right so we can't hire
Millennials and we need them because it
is the future of the company I said well
what what do you mean you can't hire
Millennials well because it go in a
green door or or glass door they're
going to youtube and they're typing in
our company name and the getting a lot
of things back that say that word well
that we're not the best place to work so
what you guys think about doing we were
going to produce a bunch of great
YouTube videos about how great it is to
work here so that sounds fantastic
but are you lying I mean are you are you
looking at the problem the problem is
they don't want to work here because of
probably things that don't relate to
their values or aspirations their goals
right those are those are core questions
you have to ask yourself like are you
are you willing to design for them
because everything is evolutionary
doesn't just mean because that's the way
we've always done it is the way you're
supposed to do it it's called creative
destruction it's a long time standing
economic term something new comes along
and completely that's a definition of
disruption by the way and I'm going to
apply this to HR iteration is doing
things better innovation is doing new
things that creates new value and
disruption is doing new things that make
the old ones obsolete right HR is
obsolete right and so if you do not
disrupt it it will be disrupted for you
and I said let's just now come up with
the core values of what the organization
could be because that's a leadership
thing right I think we're caught in a
rut of management second thing is what
if I wanted to apply for a job how would
we do that oh here we bring on these
forms you get through this job code
which brings up another form and I said
all right well let's go through it so I
got I got out my phone and I said okay
give me that URL oh no you can't it
doesn't work on that said exactly so
you're asking someone to conform to you
when your human resources and your job
is to basically cater to the human being
inside the organization look out for
their well-being and that's that's the
hard part right because that's human
resources is a perfect example of how
same with call centers right they're all
just perfect examples of how we lost
touch with human beings and that's why
I'm a big believer in empathy in terms
of any experience design everything can
be reimagined and has to be thank you so
much thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
