athlete you know with with the things
going on in the background I actually
just completed my first marathon three
weeks ago so I'm in good shape ready to
go you know the theme of the conference
is decoding the future and I wanted to
to touch on that theme in my first set
of slides by pointing out that that the
future really isn't what it used to be
and by that I mean that that in some
sense if you look back in the past in
those days when we look forward to the
future we had very different
perspectives on where we would be today
I came across this quote in a in a
review of of a book called slant science
fiction book from the 1940s and you know
the the point here was that you know
it's very charming how people in the
past thought about the future you know
we we somehow didn't wind up with with
roads that that flow through the air we
didn't wind up with flying cars or and
certainly the International Space
Station doesn't look quite that
interesting as as they had on the 2001 a
Space Odyssey of course there were a
number of predictions that were made in
particular in science fiction in the
1940s and 50s and early 60s that did
come true arthur c clarke in a early
story in the 1940s described the first
communication satellite which of course
was not launched for several decades
afterwards in star trek in the TV series
they had a device called a communicator
and you could flip it open and you could
talk to people almost anywhere and that
seemed really like science fiction but
of course today we all have cell phones
and we communicate with people all over
the
world any time that we want of course
another concept that you may have seen
this was also in Star Trek but in many
other science-fiction stories from the
1950s and the 1960s is this concept of a
data crystal and that's come true as
well you know and I I say that and then
sometimes when I say that people will
say but wait a minute we don't have data
crystals and the answer is we do right I
have gigabytes of information stored on
silicon crystals on a USB stick that I
keep with me so we we were able to
create that as well of course sometimes
when people predict the future even very
smart people they get it very wrong so
here's a quote from Thomas Edison you're
fooling around with alternating current
is a waste of time no one will ever use
it well obviously that didn't turn out
to be true here's another quote from
another very very smart person Albert
Einstein who questions the possibility
that we would ever be able to harness
nuclear energy even sometimes predicting
something like future real estate trends
can be very very difficult here's a
quote from arthur c clarke in a issue of
Vogue magazine in 1966 where he makes
some predictions about what the world
might be like in 2001 and well that
didn't quite happen you know houses
aren't quite able to fly unless you
count the the house and the movie up
with the balloons and for the most part
cities don't migrate from one part of
the country to the other so that didn't
quite happen either here's a quote from
TJ watson from 1943 sort of looking at
what the future might be like and and
watson said well maybe in the future
they'll beef
opportunity for five computers that
turned out not to be very accurate even
John von Neumann in a quote in an
article in 1949 made the comment that it
would appear that we've reached the
limits of what's possible to achieve
with computing technology well that
didn't quite work out either of course
there were very optimistic predictions
and what computers might be here's one
again from 1949 in popular mechanics
magazine where they predicted that
someday they could imagine that
computers might weigh less than 1.5 tons
I don't think I would be carrying around
a 1.5 ton computer I don't think that
would be very very hard of course if you
actually read the full quote from John
von Neumann what he really said was that
you know we may be reaching the limits
of computing technology but that you
have to be careful with the predictions
that you make because you can look very
foolish in five years and well that
prediction did look very foolish in five
years here's another prediction this is
from Ken Olson at the the no longer
existent Digital Equipment Corporation
you know saying he thought there'd be no
reason one would want a computer in
their home well of course just a few
years later the IBM PC was released and
became the basis of what eventually was
you know the home computer and home
computing and so that that obviously
turned out turned out very differently
than what Ken Olson was predicting now
it isn't just that we can't predict you
know when the technology is going to
come into existence or or you know how
that how the technology will impact a
particular segment but often we don't
understand how a technology will be used
you know so people in the early days of
computing
tended to think of computing as being
something very lofty that it was going
to be focused on on solving really hard
problems and and they didn't realize
that it could be used for other things
as well so what I'm about to show you is
a is a commercial that was aired in the
1990s for a computer graphics company
where they make fun of that idea here we
are using technology to save the planet
our tiny chip it has 100 billion
operations per second
that is power most awesome
we are using it to make a difference
imagine Tina
pure water and a new future
I wish my family back home see me now
we are most proud knowing that we are
doing our part to help save that
attention everybody we're gonna forget
that environment stuff and use a chipper
computer games back to work 3dfx bc
accelerators so powerful it's kind of
ridiculous slap just break it up so
again you know it hears it here's a
that's sort of a funny funny version of
this but but the point is that you know
we're constantly changing in the way we
think about how technology is going to
be used and what it's going to be used
for and the notion that that a lot of
the uses of technology would in fact be
for entertainment you know was not
something that if you went back and and
talked with john von neumann or some of
the early pioneers in the field they
would necessarily have have thought of
now sometimes you predict the future
very well but you still don't
necessarily wind up being the
beneficiary of your of your prediction
i'll give you a microsoft example this
is a slide i personally used in a talk I
gave in 1993 actually the the the slide
itself came from another gentleman that
i worked for at the time Nathan Myhrvold
and he laid out this vision for what he
described as the wallet pc i mean we
would see this as a modern cell phone
and you can see this again from 1993 all
the elements of the modern cell phone
were in this device as it was described
now of course back in 1993 we didn't
have the technology that could create
such a device but because of this vision
you know at microsoft we actually
created a group even in those early days
to pursue this idea and this group
created the early versions of what
became the
pocketpc from Microsoft the the compaq
ipaq was an example of that from the
from the late 90s and early 2000s it
became what became windows mobile but
what was not foreseen was that these
types of devices would become much more
popular much more prevalent with the
introduction of another technology in
this case it was the capacitive display
that allowed people with their fingers
to interact with the device and it was
apple with the original iphone that was
really the beneficiary of that
innovation they were able to take the
capacitive display technology that had
been invented by others merge it with
the devices that they were designing and
suddenly they had a completely different
kind of device it still had all these
elements but because of the
interactivity that was created by the
capacitive display you know they were
able to develop a tremendous market for
what they did so you can sometimes see
the future work hard at it and not
necessarily be a beneficiary of it in
other cases you you see the future you
do the right thing but you may not be
doing it at the right time it may not be
the right time to be making those
investments or doing that work this is a
from 1994 it's a system that I built as
one of the projects we had early on at
Microsoft Research working with
Microsoft product teams and we built in
1994 and deployed in 1996 a fully
interactive fiber optic to the curb TV
system I was deployed in a suburb of
tokyo in japan in conjunction with NTT
and NEC each home had over 100 megabits
per second of data access all the
elements that you might think of as an
interactive TV system we're in that
in that in that system unfortunately it
was the wrong time because we were
developing that system and bringing it
to fruition in roughly 1996 you know
they're about well it also turned out
that in 1996 the United States passed
sweeping telecom legislation that
dramatically changed the incentives in
the in the telecom industry and while
when we were doing this work there was a
lot of interest among these companies in
investing in what was in those days
described as the information
superhighway and interactive television
suddenly they became much more
interested in buying each other and
merging and changing the way they they
thought about their businesses in a
different way and was really ten years
later when these types of systems became
became relevant again so in that case it
wasn't so much that that it was the
wrong time for the technology but it was
the wrong time because of legal and tax
constraints or changes that existed in
the system and those can be significant
and they can have a huge impact on the
the release of a technology so the
reason why it's predicting the future is
really hard or decoding the futures
really hard is technology really doesn't
move in a straight line new approaches
catch you by surprise so what was you
know even though you know Thomas Edison
had a sort of a negative view of
alternating current in part because he
owned all the patents on direct current
it was also the case that it didn't seem
like it made a lot of sense until the
introduction by Westinghouse of the step
up and step down alternating current
transformer which suddenly allowed you
to send enormous amounts of power long
distances over relatively thin wires and
that chain
the value of the technology tremendously
and caused alternating current to become
the standard that it is today it's hard
to predict how how cultures and
individuals will react to technology you
know just think of the cell phone when
then cell phone was created people
actually thought that it would be used
for voice communication you know people
would call each other but you know many
of you are students you probably don't
call each other very often you're mostly
texting you're mostly sending email
you're mostly reading the web the uses
of the cell phone changed dramatically
as time went on because in fact it could
do different things and so even though
began as a technology that was sort of
an imitation of the the original
telephone it turned into something very
very very different and I mentioned
issues about tax policy so i was born in
1951 so this is an indication how old I
am and here are some examples of things
that existed in 1951 you know my parents
car looked a lot like the car in this
picture this is a Ford Victoria we did
have a radio that looked exactly like
that that's a 1951 radio and you know
our TV looked exactly like that TV in
fact I have some pictures of me as an
infant you know near a TV that looks
exactly like that interestingly enough
in 1951 the first univac computer was
sold in this case it was sold to the US
Census Bureau so even in 1951 as I was
being born you know suddenly computing
was becoming becoming relevant of course
I didn't know that I was growing up in a
small town in a poor area in rural
America and so I didn't see a computer
until I went to college the first
computer I ever worked with was this it
was an IBM 360 67 you know big mainframe
style computer that they
had at the Stanford University where I
was a student and that's the first
computer I learned the program now
luckily for me I was able to work in the
very early days with the Xerox Alto this
was the very first personal computer
created around 1973 and my original
graduate student career in computer
science started at the University of
Rochester in 1974 and we were the first
people outside of Xerox PARC to have
access to the Xerox Alto in fact here's
a picture of me from 19th this is 1975
typing on a Xerox Alto I had more hair I
still have that jacket but I don't wear
it but I still have it now the world's
changed enormously in that period of
time and I've certainly personally been
the beneficiary of that change you can
see some of the differences here between
the Xerox Alto that I programmed on
which literally its performance was one
tenth of a mil right today we talk about
billions of operations per second this
was a hundred thousand operations per
second very slow by modern standards in
fact really really slow you know
microsoft surface pro 2 today you know
is a hundred and thirty two billion
instructions per second so put so it
puts that all very much in perspective
storage of course you know the alto had
a very small amount of storage and in
fact the even in the in the mid-1980s
your the entire planet had less storage
capacity than a typical memory stick
today so that puts things in perspective
you could however do some pretty amazing
stuff this is a screenshot from the game
that Han mentioned that i developed as a
student when I was at the University of
Rochester for the Xerox Alto it was a
game called Alto track and was really
the first Ethernet space combat game and
it helped to define what was eventually
the multicast standard for the modern
Ethernet because this game required
multicast in order to work and so I
developed a technique for using these
devices and and using them in a
multicast way in order to make the game
function properly so it was a lot of fun
and you know it back in those days this
was you know very very useful
interestingly enough you know more than
20 years later I actually developed
another game this was for Microsoft but
it was based on the same game it was
based on the same code obviously very
much improved and changed the game was
called allegiance you can still play it
on the internet it's actually still
available and there's a community of
people that still do play this and
clearly graphics and computing power
changed a lot in the meantime but I am
very proud of the fact the game got very
very good reviews about they got the
best reviews of any Microsoft game until
halo so I thought that was a great a
great statement about that but again it
goes back to the fact that I had early
access to some very powerful computing
at least for that day now I was also
present during a period I think of
tremendous opportunity in creating
operating systems that would define the
future of computing and certainly a
personal computing when i was at
carnegie mellon university created a
couple of different operating systems
first one call accent which was a 8
operating system designed for in a term
next generation alto like device a
personal computer
that connected on to the internet but i
also created after that working with my
graduate students a system called mock
which took the key concepts from accent
but carried them over into a new world
of multiprocessors so it didn't just
work in a networked environment but in
fact it worked across both small scale
in very large scale multiprocessor
systems in fact i coined some
terminology because no one no one really
had terminology for describing the
different kinds of multiprocessor
systems in those days and so i coined
the terms Yuma Numa and Norma the one
that's preserved the most out of those
three is Numa but they were I needed to
be able to describe to people the
different kinds of computing
architectures that the operating system
we created would would work on and so I
needed to have names for those things in
order to do that now Mach went on from
being a system built in a in a
university environment to having an
enormous impact even on you know you on
the things that you do it became a the
basis for something called the next
computer that steve jobs created in the
late 1980s and became from there the
basis for mac OS so yo Mac OS X or 10
was the was based on the mock operating
system kernel and all versions of the
mac and iOS since then have incorporated
elements from that system it also became
the basis for many versions of unix and
in fact mock was the first was the basis
for the what was called OS f1 or digital
eventually digital unix compact unix and
it was incorporated into many different
other versions of unix and the
technologies and ideas were adopted in
to even versions of Linux today and of
course it had an impact on Microsoft as
well the earth the early versions of
Windows NT incorporated some of the key
concepts for mock and in fact the
project that started Windows NT was
originally based on the ideas that came
out of the mock work so so it's had an
unusual amount of influence over the
years so probably you're using code that
I wrote back in nineteen eighty-three on
some device whether it's an apple device
or a linux-based device or Windows
Device you know you're probably using
code that I've written now why was macht
so successful why did it have such a big
impact you know in and I think this is
illustrative of the question why do some
technologies succeed even when they're
doing things that that you never would
have imagined so obviously when I when I
began work on the mock operating system
back in 1983 it certainly would not have
occurred to me that it would eventually
be used on a cell phone and that's
because there weren't any cell phones I
had no idea what a cell phone was
because there weren't any back then but
it eventually became used for things
that it was not originally intended
because it was designed to be extremely
flexible and was that extensibility and
flexibility that had a huge impact on
its adoption so certainly the ability to
support other systems was important
because in every instance where mock was
used it was used first as the basis for
something else a version of unix or mac
OS or dawes or windows it had a very
flexible architecture remember it was
designed for a multiprocessor
environment and so as a result you know
it could span many different kinds of
computers both small and large again
that gave it an advantage
so just to tell you a story this is the
the the the man that actually did the
original mac OS x and then went on to
create the original iowa's was avi today
nyan with his team and avi was my
graduate student at Carnegie Mellon
University working on the unmarked and
you know he tells the story of how iOS
came into existence so originally when
the first ipod touch was being designed
at Apple they were planning to use some
kind of specialized real-time operating
system and avi and his team thought that
this was crazy they felt that it would
be better to leverage the work that
they've invested in the mac and the mac
OS but everybody told them no that
wasn't going to work the system was too
big it wouldn't be adaptable for that
purpose so he and his team working
really without permission as a skunk
works project took it upon themselves to
create a version of the mac OS at that
time based largely on the mock mock
kernel that could run on what was then
the the prototypes of the ipod touch and
could then become the basis for for a
larger larger kind of system they were
successful in that they were able to
convince the company to go in that
direction and because of that the the
apple devices whether we're starting
with the ipod touch and moving on to the
iphone the other devices had a much more
flexible much more supportive you know
underlying systems technology and
probably that was one of the key success
factors that made those devices work now
after i left carnegie mellon i went to
start microsoft research i think ha
already mentioned that i was found I've
been the founder of microsoft research
and and I think again you go back to the
investments that we made at Carnegie
Mellon in basic research those
investments paid off
simile in the sense of having a huge
impact on on products on on industry
even though we were not working within a
company when I went to Microsoft my idea
there was to go to Microsoft to create
that kind of research environment where
we could create the kinds of artifacts
intellectual artifacts and technologies
that could have a huge impact on not
just Microsoft but on the broader
corporation it's interesting that
Microsoft even wanted to do it you know
this slide points to the fact that it
was really decision by Microsoft Word of
Directors in 1990 to make an investment
in basic research I was contacted in
1991 to become the first director and
when I got to Microsoft I had really a
philosophy with three key elements these
are these were the basis for the mission
statement that we use even today within
Microsoft Research and those elements I
think are a statement about the things
you need to do to make the investments
that do allow you to create the future
first was expanding the state of the art
the areas that we do research and for me
that's always been the most critical
part of what a research organization
does is we move the frontier forward we
learn we test we try we fail we
understand what works and what doesn't
work once you understand what works and
what doesn't work then you can rapidly
take your ideas and try to move them
into product and that's of course what
we do within within microsoft research
as well but ultimately this is about the
future it's about making sure that not
just microsoft has a future but the
field of computing has a future i mean
the reason that we work as researchers
in computing is because we want to
create a future we want to change what
people will be able to do we want to be
able to solve the key problems that
exist in society and make people's lives
better
so obviously the organization has grown
I think hon probably referenced this as
well you know Microsoft Research Asia
you know started 15 years ago and I
think it's interesting for me to think
back today on the creation of Microsoft
Research Asia because when we started it
it was very controversial not just in
the United States but in China and it
wasn't so much that it was politically
controversial but that it was
technically controversial people ask the
question could you create in China the
kind of basic research organization that
that we had in the United States and
that you know you existed in places like
MIT or Stanford or Carnegie Mellon and I
think we've proven over the last 15
years that not only can you do that but
we have done it and Microsoft Research
Asia today is one of the premier basic
research organizations in the world in
its own right not just as part of the
larger organization this just talks at
this slide talks a bit about you know
some of the key things that I did to try
to create an environment where
researchers could be successful and
frankly a lot of these ideas I took from
my time as a university professor at
Carnegie Mellon University where I
really felt that that type of
environment that encouraged
collaboration that encouraged
risk-taking and encourage the ability to
work as groups to solve problems that
that was the kind of environment I
wanted to have within Microsoft and
that's that's what we've been able to do
I've also felt strongly over the years
in investing in in universities and
really this event is an example of that
where we have made a huge investment
over the last 15 years and in reaching
out and in work trying to work with
students and in talking to students
about the value and the potential of
changing the world by in by working in
the field of Technology
this just talks about some of the we've
clearly had huge impact this is a really
old slide from 2009 but you know you
look at the conferences and the things
that we've done you know there's there's
just enormous amounts of change now I
talked originally about wanting to be
able to impact you know the real world
and your microsoft research has changed
every product that microsoft produces
every product has something from
Microsoft Research and that that's
really a testament I think to the the
opportunities that exist in a company
like Microsoft and the fact that basic
research really can make those kinds of
contributions now when people talk about
you know the impact you why do you make
investments in basic research you know
they they often talk about these things
you they say oh well you accompany
invest in basic research because it's a
source of intellectual property and new
products and certainly we do that within
Microsoft Research they often say well
you're a problem solving group if you
got smart people PhDs they're going to
solve problems they're going to to find
solutions and we do that I love solving
problems I have loved solving problems
since I was a little boy I still love
solving problems that's what I do and
and that's a great value to a company
like Microsoft because we have lots of
problems that need to be solved
obviously you know early warning system
you know that's a great value to but the
real value of investing in basic
research and the real value for you in
in putting your career into creating new
ideas and new technologies and doing
research is is the ability to survive
not just you know for Microsoft it means
the ability of Microsoft to be agile and
and to be able to change and be able to
survive for for society it means about
society being able to survive you know
Vannevar Bush will create the National
I foundation you know pointed out that
the real reason to for the US government
to make investments in basic research
was to make sure that as a country we
could survive if there was a new war we
just come from World War two where
technology was really important there
was a new war or if there is a famine or
disease you need the smart people and
the reservoir of ideas that let you
adapt that let you change that let you
survive you know and that's as true for
a society it is true for the planet as
it is for as it is for a company like
Microsoft here's a very simple example
this is actually from 1990 to the we
began work in 1992 and I was involved in
this in developing a technique for
reducing the working set size of
programs so basically trying to reduce
the amount of storage needed for for
computer programs in those very small
computers of those days now the
technique we developed worked for a
32-bit code and we were very proud of
ourselves and we it was very early days
for microsoft research and we we talked
with the product groups and we assume
the proc groups will be very interested
in what we were doing and they were
certainly very very interested in very
polite but they had no use for the
technology each meeting would end with
the person from the product group saying
you know you guys are very smart but we
don't have that problem because we don't
have 32-bit code I mean that was back in
nineteen ninety two in 1992 you only had
16-bit coke in major products and also
there was another element of their of
their concern which was that they
assumed that memory sizes and memory
prior
pieces we're going to continue to go
down because of Moore's law and so they
figured when they when they did have
32-bit code and when they were going to
be able to use this technology it
wouldn't be important to them because
memory sizes would be so big that it
wouldn't be interesting well what
happened and you see this on that little
blip in the slide around 1992 1993 and
so forth is that not only did memory
prices go through a period where they
they didn't really change very much but
in fact they actually ticked up just a
little bit and had to do with you know
trade issues between the United States
and in and Japan and Asia and all there
were a lot of other reasons why it
happened but as a result in 1995 when
Microsoft was about to ship windows 95
and office 95 which were 32-bit products
they wouldn't that that system wouldn't
fit in the computers that existed in
those days those computers only had four
or eight megabytes of memory that's
megabytes not gigabytes and the are
there are software been optimized for
16-bit code and 32-bit code took up
twice as much space because in Microsoft
Research we had developed the technology
to reduce the working size of programs
by a factor of two we could take windows
95 and office 95 and make them run in
those smaller computers that allowed
Microsoft to ship windows 95 in office
95 when otherwise it wouldn't have been
able to in that year it allowed us a
tremendous lead on our competitors which
they never recovered from so it was it
was a huge financial impact to the
company but a huge strategic impact on
the industry one research idea one
research idea and that's what can happen
is when you need a great idea when you
need a technology suddenly it might be
there if you've made those investments
well Microsoft Research I think over the
years you know has had many firsts I've
just listed a few here certainly we had
the first terabyte database on the web
something called the terror server the
first large-scale use of program proof
technology in something called slam
which became the static driver verifier
the first practical use of 3d computer
vision as an accessory the connect
device that I'm sure you're all familiar
with the first major use of program
synthesis the ability to automatically
create a program from examples and
that's in the flash fill feature and win
in office 2013 and just last year the
first real-time speech-to-speech
translation on stage which is I had a
chance to do this does give you a sense
of the terror server which became
Virtual Earth and and being earth
eventually the technology was used to
create what today is the worldwide
telescope here is flash fill which
basically is a technology where in Excel
where you take give the system a few
examples and then it can write
effectively write a program that that
will do what you wanted it to do and
tremendous feature and i recommend you
experiment without it and play with it
on your own of course connect
microsoft's just about to release the
this second version of connect with xbox
one again i think that's going to be a
huge a huge product for the company but
also it's going to set even a new
standard for real-time 3d computer
vision the precision on the new connect
two is tremendous you can detect small
movements of fingers you can tex mall
movements of your body and gestures that
you were never able to do in the earlier
versions of kinect and it's going to
change the way people think about
interacting with their computers once
again and the last thing I'll mention is
something I did I did last year on stage
at in tangen the which is too in some
sense this was the culmination of
something I've been wanting to do
for a very long time and I've been
trying to get teams within microsoft
research to do with me for a long time
which is the ability to be able to do
simultaneous translation from one
language to another now I don't have the
setup here but I do have a short video
clip so you can see what that was like
last year when I was on stage and and
did that the last step that I want to be
able to take in this process is to
actually speak to you in Chinese now the
key thing there is we've been able to
take a large amount of information from
many Chinese speakers and produce a
text-to-speech system that takes Chinese
text and converts it into Chinese
language and then we take it an hour or
so of my own voice and we used on to
modulate the standard text to speech
system so that it would sound like me so
what you see now is the result of that
change I'm speaking in English and
hopefully you'll hear me speak in
Chinese in my own voice
again the results are not perfect there
are in fact quite a few errors jiggling
pool done made there's much work to be
done in this area save your phone you'll
 so it goes off with this
technology is very promising you'll do
the t-shirt video she loved then we hope
in a few years that will be able to
break down the language barriers between
people shooting info woman she
loganville da hood in contrition that
personally I believe this is going to
lead to a better world to order it is
Rachel jeantel champions how their shoes
yet I hope you enjoy the rest of the
presentations today she won't until you
see punchy pantich I'll talk
thank you
yeah yeah well
yo for me that was the culmination you
know not just of a you know long career
in computer science but also dream about
the kinds of things that we would be
able to do with the technologies we
created I will point out I'm wearing
exactly the same suit today and exactly
the same time so so what does the future
hold well obviously I think I tried to
explain to the beginning of the talk
that it's very difficult to know that
you know now strictly speaking you know
I should know because I'm a character in
a science fiction novel there's a
character named Nathan trash hood in a
novel called slant by Greg bear and the
that character serve a half Nathan
Myhrvold was a guy worked four and half
me you know and that character creates
the world's first true artificial
intelligence and helps to save the world
so maybe that's what will happen but I
kind of doubt it I think the key thing
to realize and recognize is as
scientists you know we it's not that we
create the future we create the raw
materials we create the pieces from
which a future can be created at the end
of the day it's really you it's really
me it's it's us as a society that create
the future that determine how these
technologies that we create during the
course of our lives and our careers are
going to be used and going to be taken
advantage of thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
