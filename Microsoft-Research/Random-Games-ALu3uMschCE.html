Claire afternoons are some folks at
u-dub already heard this but we were
envious so we asked under to also tell
us about random games okay thank you sir
random games to imagine two players
compete in a game of skill and so how
might you model this mathematically so
you have a graph a directed graph of
positions and so the vertices of the
graph are positions of the game and the
edges represent moves and you have two
players so maybe you start at this
position and then Alice moves first and
these are all the positions that she
could move to on her first move you can
get to and then it's Bob's turn so Alice
has a movement on so so I'm going to
assume that Alice and Bob take turns
they alternate moves there's not really
much loss of generality here because you
know first as if you had some strange
game where Alice has three moves and
then Bob has one then you could think of
Alice's three moves as just what you it
would just be a different graph and
however I'm certainly not going to be
considering simultaneous moves so game
theory
nash equilibria type stuff and I'm not
going in that direction it's just taking
turns and all right so well how does the
game end well I'm just going to say some
terminal positions which are simply
vertices that have out degree 0
designated wins for Alice or wins for
Bob okay so maybe this node is a word
for Alice this position is a win for Bob
okay so it's very very simple
and if you want to you might want to
assume and again there's not really any
loss of generality in any of these
things you could assume that the graph
is directed a cyclic meaning it doesn't
have any directed cycles where you come
back to you can come back to the same
session because if you did have a game
like that you could always just declare
it to be a different position when you
come back to it the second time and the
third time and so on
if you want to do it would be a
different graph again and if you want to
you can you can label a position by
whose move it is next as well that can
be part of the position and also if you
want to you can assume that the graph is
a tree because you know if you had two
possible ways that you could come into
the same position then again you could
just call it a different position
depending on how you got that if you
want to you can assume industry and and
I mean I won't always ask you of these
things but but you can assume that if
you want to so finally and this is kind
of important to just note and if you
want to you can assume that the the way
you decide whether it's a win or a loss
is by what's called the normal play rule
in combinatorial game theory so the rule
is simply if you have no possible moves
when it's your turn then you lose and
the other player wins okay so you know
again why is this without loss of
generality because if you had a game
that wasn't like that then again you
could just always modify the graph of if
this is if it's Alice's turn but a good
example if it's Alice's turn but it's a
win for Alice then you know you just
give one extra move for Alice to make
and then Bob loses lots of thing so I'll
assume this most of the time it's kind
of convenient okay so I want to think
about optimal play so that means just
the players are very very clever so a
strategy so Alice say is simply a map
that assigns a legal
moved to every position that she might
find herself in just a rule book for how
to play the game and you know so you
imagine Alice uses one strategy and Bob
uses another and you call Alice's
strategy a winning strategy
if guarantee is that Alice will win no
matter what strategy Bob uses and it's
pretty easy to see that if you have a
finite directed acyclic graph then
exactly one player does have a winning
strategy the game has to end and someone
has to win and it may be difficult in
particular cases to decide who does but
it goes but on an infinite bath there's
a third possibility and and sort of by
far the most interesting possibility at
least in the sort of directions I'm
going to be discussing which is that
it's a drop which is that neither player
can force a where neither player has a
winning strategy so very stupid example
if the game graph is simply a directed
path off to the right then the game
never ends you just keep on moving to
the right and so that's a draw and
throughout I'm going to assume that the
players know the entire graph and
they're infinitely skilled so I'm not
going to consider computational
questions of how how hard is it to
decide on your strategy although those
might be interesting as well
so okay and you can do some things you
can classify positions vertices of the
graph as end positions which means a
position from which the next player went
in this next player to move the first
player or P position for which the
previous player ie the player who just
moved or the second player has a winning
strategy or a draws this is the outcome
of the game with optimal play and it's
not very difficult to convince yourself
that there's a sort of a recurrence for
it trying to compute these things if
this is a node and these are all the
nodes that you can get to from it and
you know the outcomes of them then you
can compute the outcome at this one so
so for instance if you
get to appiy position from here then
that's an excellent move to make because
that means you're leaving your opponent
in a position where they will lose so I
said that's a very good move so that
means this is a winning position this is
an end position and if all the things
you can get to our end positions then
too bad for you you're going to lose so
that's P position and then when you
involve draws you know if there are no
peas but there is at least one D then
this is a D but note already that this
recurrence in itself is not sufficient
to determine game outcomes and because
consider this stupid example where the
game graph is just an infinite line then
this every vertex D is a solution to
that recurrence and it's the correct on
that really every vertex is a draw but
these two alternating PN or NP are both
solutions to the recurrence so on the
graph you know you need to know some
more and and and note if you were to cut
this path off at some point then you
know either this or this will be the
truth depending on where you cut it off
at an even or an odd distance so it so
saying that that it's a draw is
something to do with saying if you cut
the graph graph off a long way away it
depends how you do it what happens at
the beginning okay
so again I'm assuming everything is
known to both players and there's no
randomness at all you just have a
deterministic graph and you play
deterministically so okay what what are
interesting games to look at well
there's kind of a bit of a tricky
question here because on the one hand
you have you know some simple
mathematically idealized games where
there's some interesting theory of them
and but they're not really the kind of
games people play in practice and on the
other hand you get you have games like
chess and go where people are very
interested in them in practice and there
are it's definitely interesting
computational questions like how do you
make a computer play go and but you know
theorems about chess and go
you don't expect there to be many
interesting ones because they're just
too specific so
you know what what is a good thing to
ask well here is one perhaps interesting
middle ground you could try and you
could ask what happens in a typical game
what does a typical game look like so
that's what I'm going to focus on so I'm
going to choose the game itself at
random so there's still not going to be
any randomness in the gameplay it's just
I bring in two players and I tell them
here's a game I cooked up for you to
play I let you play and I chose it at
random ok so that's what I'm going to do
and I'm going to talk about three
examples I'm going to so again remember
with the way I'm doing it a game is just
a directed graph so you just want to
think about some interesting models of
directed graphs so I'm going to talk
about three cases they're all all these
joint work with James Martin who is now
here for few months and depending on
which one it's also drunk with Aaron
Mark Avicii and Reedy Basso and you're
on Westland so I'll consider
galton-watson trees and I'll consider
directed percolation clusters and I'll
consider undirected percolation clusters
and bear in mind the way I described it
it was a directed graph so I haven't
told you what it means to play this game
on an undirected percolation cluster but
I'll come back to that I know I'll give
a sensible definition and well you know
this isn't going to be one of those
talks where I just try to impress you
with how clever we are having solved all
the problems it's not going to be like
that it's just I'm trying to open the
door to some interesting I think
interesting circles of questions we
managed to prove some things but there
there's a lot more to do we've just kind
of scratched the surface so and it's
already interesting that in in trying to
answer essentially the same question in
these three settings we ran into just
all sorts of interesting old friends
from the world of probabilities
continuous and discontinuous phase
transitions probabilistic cellular
automata hardcore models bootstrap
percolation and maximum matching all
thumb is considering the same question
essentially all the topics and they'll
kind of be a and increasing difficulty
gradient as we go down so here really
all the proofs most of the proofs are
kind of exercises or although the the
results are quite interesting and
striking and and and you know give you
some clues about what you should be
asking lower down and here it's kind of
it's just odd the cusp where somehow
magically the theory is just strong
enough to be able to prove some
interesting things but it's sort of very
fragile although there if anything broke
it would be much harder and down here by
far the most interesting questions are
completely open we have no idea how to
attack them I think they're very
interesting and we managed to find some
consolation prize us some things he we
could prove and the main question is
open so galton-watson trees so let's
suppose that the the graph this directed
graph that I choose to play my game on
is a galton-watson branching process
with this non-deterministic offspring
distributions you just have one vertex
that sharpened that has a random number
of children and each of those had a
random number of children and so on or
with this same distribution and I'm
going to play the normal game on this
graph so you start at stop you take
turns to play and if you find you are at
a vertex with zero offspring and you
lose and the other player wins okay so
of course if the if mu has mean less
than equal to one then the branching
process dies out so that the tree is
finite
and that means certainly there are no
draws like draws can only have not an
infinite God but if it has mean greater
than one then the tree is infinite so
you can ask can there be a draw right so
you have an infinite random tree and so
you know draws can take place but but do
they happen with optimal play so maybe
there is this infinite path but somehow
it's not thick enough so to have a draw
you somehow have to have a thick path
not really a path a cluster that so that
neither player can force the other one
off it and and and cause a win right so
it's a question that's not so
surprisingly if you've thought about
questions like this one can do really an
exact analysis on a galton-watson tree
so first of all and this is pretty much
generally there's a sort of a
compactness argument that says if a
player if Alex can win say then she can
guarantee to do so within some finite
number of moves which and that number
depends on the tree so it's random right
so somehow winds are local in some sense
and therefore the sort of the sensible
thing to do is truncate the tree at
level N and declare all the vertices at
level and to be draw so you just play
the game on this top the finite piece
but with different rules you say if the
game ever gets do the bottom we call it
a draw and then you see what happens
okay so you can just apply the recursion
upwards to to figure out what don't
figure out what the root is and because
of this thing it's pretty easy to see
that the say the probability that the
root is an end position when you
truncate converges to the probability
it's an n position in the infinite tree
and similarly for P
therefore it's true for D as well
because that's one - the other - right
so and on the other hand you can compute
all these things using generating
functions if you take the generating
function of the offspring distribution
then you can just translate this
recursion into a recursion involving
that you if you know and and you can
compute n plus 1 etc so the upshot of
all this is and you look at one - the
generating function of the offspring
distribution and it's all about the
fixed points of that so D the
probability that the root is a draught
that the game is a draw with optimal
play start from the root is the
difference between the biggest fixed
point and the smallest fixed point of
not F but the the iterate F of F in the
interval 0 what that easy computations
and in terms of that as well
so there were draws if and only if this
function the the interet f of f of X has
multiple focus points in the air tour so
here's an example just simplest example
is binary branching your offspring
distribution is you have two offspring
with probability P and zero offspring
otherwise okay so of course you know we
know what the meaning of this is so the
tree is infinite if it only appears go
to the north so here's what happens with
the game
here's P along the bottom increasing
this P which is the probability to
offspring and in any vertical line the
width of the red part is the probability
of an end position there with the blue
part is the probability of P position
and the width of the green part is the
probability of a drop so up to root 3
over 2 which you'll notice it's not
equal to 1/2 so so the the again the
phase transition for the tree to be
infinite is that P equals 1/2 so but you
don't have any drawers until you get to
P equals root 3 over 2 and then you
start having drawers with positive
probability and the probability is the
width of this green bit so it's a
continuous phase transition so right at
the code
it's still zero and then it goes so
that's one handle all these curves are
computable in this simple example so
basically what's going on is you have
this f of f of X and you're interested
in fixed points so you'd better subtract
X from it and below the critical point
it's just some nice curve with the root
somewhere and then as you cost the
critical point it starts to have a point
of inflection yeah and after the
critical point it has three books points
m and D outer to move apart and the
distance between them is d okay so you
can do I suppose you could look at a
binomial distribution which is
percolation on a regular tree and you
have a similar picture as P varies
basically you have a continuous phase
partition where you start having draws
not at the not at the critical point for
percolation but strictly higher and with
a pass on distribution turns out similar
you the critical point is lambda equals
e the draws and interestingly where the
geometric distribution you never have
any drawers and you know once you
understand this picture with fixed
points you can concoct weird example so
there are examples where you vary the
offspring distribution continuously but
D has a discontinuous jump from 0 to
positive and you can even if you concoct
it's originally you can even make a jump
from one positive value to a different
and you know you do this just by
figuring out what you want this curve to
do to to make the fixed points behave
strangely so ok every sort of the short
answer is anything is possible if you
can capture strange distribution so ok
couple of other things you can do this
was the normal game which is where you
lose if you cannot move there's also
what's called the MS air game where you
just change the rules for winning you
say if you cannot move you win and and
then there's also this sort of
intermediate one which we call the
escape game where you have one player
called the stopper who is trying to make
the game end with someone not able to
move and the escape is thank you
I could continue forever oh you can do
some things with these for the MS their
game no things come up only to the
normal one for the escape game it's
actually different for the escape game
it seems that discontinuous phase
transitions are the norm from no
probability of the escape we're winning
to suddenly jump into a positive
probability so again for binary
branching the picture ends up looking
like this you have one fix point and
then some point this curve dips below
the axis and you suddenly have a fixed
point much further to the left you have
a jump but again you can concoct
examples with continuous transitions it
turns out so it's not as nice as you
might think
we wanted to sort of salvage some
rigorous statements that are clear in
general so for the normal game P and
then a lower semi continuous functions
of the off swing distribution so
basically the only way you can get jumps
is is by D jumping the games and from
you where the support is too small all
these probabilities are continuous and
finally here's something that says so
the escape game which is the one we're
sort of discontinuous phase transitions
are the norm there's this special way
that the escaper can win which James
actually mentioned in the lunch
yesterday if the mean times the
probability of having one offspring is
positive then the escaper can just keep
letting the other player have no choice
at all so it's so that's sort of very
special way to escape and the places
where they escape a wins yeah the place
the set of distributions where they
escape a wins contains the set where
this is greater than one and it's a
closed subset over the set where it's
less than one so it's not quite saying
that this is a closed set if I could say
this was a closed set that would mean
you only get discontinuous phase
transitions and it's not as strong as
that but but the only way you can get a
continuous phase transition is by sort
of carefully going across this boundary
we have so how about some inequalities
you can compare these three games and we
have ten inequalities between like the
probability the next player wins in the
in the normal game and the misÃ¨re game
the twiddle means misere game and they
sort of come into three categories these
ones just hold point-wise for any
directed acyclic graph or they come from
arguments like if you can win in the
normal game then you can win as the
stopper because that's just an easier
thing to do tasks and then there are
these ones that are a little bit more
subtle they use strategy stealing
arguments they say that because it's a
galton-watson tree after one movie or
some still in the same situation in
distribution and and then these are
inventing they're not super hard to
prove but but we don't really have
intuitive explanations for them so the
maybe the motor most interesting is that
draws are more likely in the misere game
we cleave more likely in the moszer game
than the normal game so if anyone has
any intuition why that would be true
they kind of interesting kind of
interested and okay so that's trees so
let's talk about another random graph so
let's do site percolation on the
directed square lattice so you have Z to
the square lattice and make it directed
so every edge is directed to the east or
north and we do site percolation on it
so each site is closed independently
with some probability P so I'm just
deleting some vertices at random and
they play the normal game on the open
sub graph that the vertices that remain
so you're not allowed to move to a
closed site so again
if so for some reason our peers won -
the usual percolation prefer accident so
if P is big there are lots of closed
sites then the the set of vertices you
can get - this should be the PC for
directed site percolation you can even
say that then the set of vertices you
can get - is finite so definitely don't
know doors but if not then the graph is
infinite so maybe there could be lost
again so here is the picture so here's a
simulation so P equals 0.2 so 20 percent
of vertices are closed or deleted and
again what you want to do is I mean
consider diagonal right if you know the
outcome of the game on the diagonal like
this then you can compute what happens
on the next diagonal down so the thing
you want to do is put a draws on the
boundary so here's what happens if you
declare the game a draw when you get to
this boundary and then propagate
backwards so red denotes draw positions
blue and green so you can see well the
sort of draws certainly persist down
quite a long way and if you want to know
what happens on the infinite lattice
then that's the that's equivalent to
asking you know what happens if you just
propagate further and further down do
you ever see any red surviving and you
ask that question for each PT of course
so this is P equals point 2 and this is
P equals point 1 so here it seems pretty
clear that the draws die out and then
maybe if you go back to this you sort of
see that the red doesn't seem to grow
very often and then it gradually seems
to get eaten away I said so perhaps it
always gets even way but but the
question is is there any P for which the
Reds are both so okay well here's a way
of looking at that
so you can regard if you want to you can
change the rules of the game you can say
rather than it being forbidden to move
to a closed site
you can say if you move to a closed site
then you immediately lose that's
equivalent because no one will ever want
to do it so it's the same game so it's
just convenient to regard closed sites
as n positions and again we can imagine
turning the lattice this way around so
if you know the game outcomes on one
diagonal then you can compute the next
diagonal down and one way to look at it
is there's a probabilistic cellular
automaton so if you know the two states
above you and they're just some rule for
computing the the one below and and
sometimes you have to toss a coin yeah
so here's a lamp huh so drawers occur if
and only if this probabilistic cellular
automaton has multiple stationary
distributions the stationary
distribution means you have some
distribution on the configuration of a
diagonal and then you propagate it one
down and it still has the same law okay
and furthermore that's also equivalent
to it has multiple stationary
distributions without deeds so if you
just consider you don't have any D's you
just have keys and ends and you just use
this rule that gives you a simpler cell
Tom Burton with just two states and it's
equivalent to that having no drawers and
I'm not going to prove this but you know
you should think of it as being a bit
like these pictures we started with
where you know if one player has a win
in the game then they can win locally
there's it's not a global property it's
a local property so if if there are no
drawers then they ought to be just one
stationary distribution and on the other
hand if there are drawers then it's
somehow telling you that there are even
with just P's and ends there were
multiple solutions like
like in that picture the beginning with
Z alternating ends and peas so if you
can't have draws it's it's telling you
that there are multiple possibilities so
in any case this this is true not too
difficult proof so we so he want to know
does this have multiple station who
distributions now it's this who exists
to some difficult territory and it
widely believed that all simple
one-dimensional probabilistic cellular
automata with positive rates have unique
stationary distributions
what does positive rates mean it means
you know you have some rule like there's
some cellular automaton rule and you no
matter what symbols you see above you
you always have positive probability of
producing any other symbol below you and
this isn't actually true here because
you know here you definitely produce an
end for example but it's kind of almost
true in the sense that if you for
instance if you take two steps then
locally you could produce anything so I
mean morally not just morally this this
cellular automata is certainly in the
category where it's widely agreed that
you would expect it to have a unique
stationary distribution however it's
although this is widely believed it
approved only in some very specific
cases and it it's hard to prove it in
many cases and it requires different
techniques and different cases
so it's potentially a hard thing to
prove and related to this I mean what
does simple me in it of course there's
no specific meaning but but there's an
extremely well and back up yeah it was
for a long time believed that you can
remove the word simple so that so that
any one-dimensional probabilistic solar
automaton with this positive rights
condition has a unique stationary
distribution this was widely believed
it's called the positive rates
conjecture but then catch in 2001 gave
an extreme
complicated example counter example to
that however it's an exceptionally
difficult 200 page proof and it gets
fair to say that no on other than the
author really understands it and maybe
not universally accepted to be correct
but but in any case this is extremely
complicated and the construction is
extremely complicated so one certainly
doesn't accept expect multiple
stationary distributions for a nice
simple rule like this it would be it
would be extraordinarily surprising and
ok so we expect unique stationary
distribution there for node was proved
it well here's a very interesting
picture and so consider just two
successive diagonals and let's just look
at the picture where there are no DS we
just have P's and ends so you have some
configuration and of course you can
compute the configuration on the next
line and actually the rule is if you can
see a P above you then you're an N and
if you see two ends then you toss a coin
so now well you could imagine keeping
going of course you compute the next
diagonal and well to save space I could
actually write the next diagonal above
instead I could write it up here because
this is the same shape zigzag path and
again the rule is if I see to what was
it again if I if I see two peas I write
an N and otherwise I toss a coin and and
I compute the dangle above and I could I
could keep going like this now here's
something else that you could do on Z
and look at the hard core lattice gaps
which is a standard statistical physics
model this is a hard core model is a
distribution on configurations of zeros
and ones on the vertices of graph with
no adjacent ones allowed and weighted by
some parameter to the power of the
number of ones at least that's how you
do it on a finite graph and then if you
want it to do it on an infinite graph
there were ways of taking limits
and there's a global dynamics on which
is for which this measure is a
stationary distribution which is you you
choose a vertex to update and then when
you update a vertex you if any of its
neighbors is one then it has to be a
zero because you're not allowed to have
two adjacent ones and if all the names
of zeros then you toss a coin with some
appropriate probabilities that depend on
this parameter lambda and okay and well
if you think about the hard core model
on Z one thing you can do is apply
glabra dynamics alternately on the odd
and even vertices of it and the hardcore
measure will be stationary under that
dynamics so you just you know you have Z
and I grow it and this is exact fashion
and you alternately apply that rule on
all the odd sites simultaneously and all
the even sites simultaneously and of
course that's the same thing as the
picture I just showed you and zero and
here's some function of lambda over and
so on so because of this correspondence
it's a fact that gives distributions for
the hard core model on the line are in
by jected correspondence with reversible
stationary distributions for the
probabilistic cellular automaton with no
DS and it's reversible well and well
yeah
it is reversible because this look at
this picture is reversible I won't go
into the proof of the but on computer
and and well it's well known and not
surprising that the hard core model on Z
because it's a one-dimensional graph has
a unique Gibbs distribution so that
means that my PCA has a unique
reversible stationary distribution but
because that's not enough for what I
wanted that's not enough to prove no
draws because maybe there are some other
non reversible stationary distributions
so unfortunately that doesn't help
however using different methods
kind of new methods we did manage to
prove what we wanted and so on the
square lattice but no matter what PE
there there are there are no there's a
unique stationary distribution and there
are no drawers and moreover if you're
interested in the game you can even
compute the probability that the origin
is an N position it's some function of p
and just to sort of show how fragile all
this is so how did we prove this first
of all we've proved it by a very
different method by assigning a rather
subtle weight function to configurations
and proving that that weight function is
monotone and it's not so obvious how to
come up with that weight function and
and just to show sort of how fragile
this is there's another game called the
target game where you win if you ever
move to a closed site for which we can
still prove that there are no draws but
we cannot compute the probability of a
first player win like this and it's
really a fundamental obstacle it's not
just we didn't work hard enough and also
for the misere version of the game it's
unknown whether drawers are correct
somehow this correspondence well this
technique doesn't seem to work so why
did I bother telling you all that
business about the hard core model if
it's no use well okay you can try to use
it in the other direction in other
settings
so so we can still try to use it in the
other notion if there are multiple hard
core Gibbs measures then you have draws
and one place you could try to use that
is in higher dimensions so here's a case
where it works so take a deed I mention
Ã¬letÃ­s so not ZD but the even sub
lattice of ZD the vertices whose
coordinates have even some and
considered the game where you're allowed
to move you have to move up in the
vertical direction and you can move in
in one of the coordinate anywhere you
want yeah that's a graphic directed
graph and this corresponds to a hardcore
model on
zedd d -1 on no mention lower by a
similar correspondence to the one i
showed you and this the hard-core model
is known to have multiple Gibbs measures
in dimensions two or more do you - one
being the two or more and so that means
in dimensions three or more this game
does have drawers I mean four P
sufficiently small the probability of a
draw is positive and well you might ask
what about the usual lattice is there D
if I want to consider three dimensions
that that may be the most natural
directed graph is just set D and you're
allowed to move northeast or up now to
increase any coordinate by one that's
the directed graph well here the this
hardcore correspondence really breaks
down and and again it's not just because
we were too lazy it's there's a
fundamental problem so basically the
kind of thing you would want to do is if
you're on z3 you could consider three
successive layers of z3 and sort of
imagine how the collector each are then
and you get a triangular lattice but
then what you want to do is there are
these three classes of vertices that
they naturally fall into and you want to
consider hard core dynamics where you
you know you update the each of these
sets of vertices in turn but for example
you update the green vertices just
conditional on the blue vertices and
that's no good because they're adjacent
to the red vertices as well so that's
just not the hard core so it really
doesn't work there but but we conjecture
nevertheless that that so again in two
dimensions you do not have cause that's
a theorem and in three dimensions we
conjecture that you do a piece of
visionaries well all right so finally
third example and as I say this is in
some ways the most interesting but also
the hardest so let's consider and
undirected lattice and again I'll make
it random by making each site of the
lattice independently closed with
probability P toss a coin for every
vertex and make it closed so somehow the
normal game is very boring on an
undirected graph the the normal game
being you there's a single token on some
vertex and when it's your turn to move
you could move it along an edge and and
and you lose if you can't move so most
of the time no one's going to lose you
so for instance you know anyone who
feels they're in a losing position could
just I don't know why I drew a cycle
like this you could even just make the
token shuttle backwards and forwards
between two adjacent vertices if you if
you fear you're going to lose so that's
not it's not a very interesting game and
so here's a way we could make it more
interesting and there's a game that we
call trap Alice and Bob take turns to
move a single token there's a single
token locator on some verdicts and you
move it along an edge and you're allowed
to move it to any open site provided
that site has never been visited before
okay and you're not allowed to move it
to a closed site and again if you can't
move you lose it's kind of a fun game
you're trying to trap your opponent very
like trapping them in the path where
you've been already but using the closed
sites as well so this is an interesting
game and since we're concentrating on Z
D and since D D is bipartite I'm going
to rename the players there's one player
who always moves to even sites and
alcohol that player Eve and the other
one Odin and so here are some
simulations so here is course not z2 but
a square and as before the good thing to
do is declare the boundary to be a draw
okay so we play the game on a square
board but if the token ever gets outside
the boundary we just call it a draw it
so the sites that outlined in black are
closed and white is places starting
vertices for which the game is a draw
with optimal play and red is Odin wins
Eve blue is Everett hey so you see some
very interesting things if if there are
not many close sights then basically
it's all draws not very surprising
because the closed sights aren't enough
for anyone to trap the other person you
increase P a little bit and there are
some little regions where maybe Odin can
force a win locally but globally it's
mostly gross and then he gets a little
bit bigger and suddenly there's a huge
region where it happens Eve can force a
win anywhere in here and there are these
interesting checkerboard regions as well
that a half blue half white and here's a
little region that favors Odin and then
you make P a little bit bigger and there
are sort of more of these regions and
smaller regions somehow so that's a
square of size 50 I think here's a
bigger square of size 200 and
so there's a big difference here which
is that the P equals point one picture
here it was mostly drawers and here it's
not so here if you take a bigger square
suddenly there are these regions where
one other player can win again but
they're very big and it seems like
somewhere you need this whole region and
the previous square wasn't small enough
to contain it
so so the picture I have in mind by
looking at these simulations is the
following that for each P there is some
typical size of a region within which
one player can force a win and this size
diverges as P gets smaller and if your
square isn't big enough to contain one
of these regions then it's mostly draws
that's that's sort of the the picture it
it seems to be showing because either
here they're big regions and then they
get more grainy when P gets bigger and
furthermore it kind of appears that at
least perhaps if you take the square big
enough even with Wu
and if you take the square big enough it
may be even with P equals 0.05 you
someone went and you don't get so many
drops so it so it's it's hard to tell
but you might guess that the critical
probability is zero so that when you
take the whole infinite lattice is e 2
you don't have any drops and again you
know you and there's a lot more you can
say look at your the pictures it sort of
seems that these red and blue regions
kind of abut each other so there's no
corridors of drawers in between and
again you have these interesting
checkerboard regions you probably can't
see it but that's checkerboarded red and
blue for a while so the first player
wins from this video so very very
interesting and we can't prove any of
that but they said a reasonable
conjecture is that on z2 maybe for all P
you have no drawers and again we don't
really have much to back this up but but
if I had to guess I would say in three
or more dimensions you have a phase
transition screen again in three of my
more dimensions I had to guess I would
say perhaps you do have a face position
you do have drawers for P small enough
okay we can't prove any of that so we
backed off to see if there was something
we could prove so yep replace the work
easier for all image
like I mean I just don't know but by
analogy with the direction place I would
say I just don't know but I think these
are very very interested questions and
probably very hard ok so how can we save
face and prove something so because the
because the graph is bipartite on Z Z D
is bipartite you can you can give one
player a big advantage so you can say
you have odd and even sites of Zed D and
I could assign different probabilities
to them different probabilities of being
closed and the extreme case is odd
vertices are closed with some
probability P and even vertices aren't
closed the top all the universities are
open so this gives a massive advantage
to Eve because Eve moves to even
vertices and she never has a problem
they're all open so it definitely gives
easy even advantage but you can ask how
big is it trying to make that
quantitative so here's kind of how this
game tends to go so suppose Odin moves
to this site we can get it back so then
well Eve is going to just move that and
then she's won immediately because it
has no moves so that means really that
site there is effectively closed it's
forbidden to to Odin if he ever moves
there he's dead and yeah Yuval sees
where this is going so now you know you
could iterate this argument so anytime
you have a site every time you have
three sites that are closed or even
effectively closed like this you could
make the fourth one effectively go so
that means that one is effectively
closed as well and therefore that one
and so on and so on so it so this model
is it's on a rotated version of the
lattice it it's a variant of bootstrap
percolation
called modified butcher percolation and
so the model being whenever you see
three sites in the configuration like
that you add the fourth one in the
square and a standard but rather
surprising result on this is that on z24
for every P all the sites end up blue if
you start with random sites no matter
how small p is they all add up blue so
you can deduce from this that Eve wins
from every initial vertex and this
extends to various d damage that could
likely be extended to D but it's a
little bit harder because the lattice is
not really the one the standard one and
could probably be done and so okay let's
try to make it a bit more interesting
again so this made it too easy for Eve
let's give her in some some advantage
back again so let's play it on a finite
board let's play it on a finite square
and we will choose the parity of the
square itself so that we give the
boundary to Odin so we just choose the
parity of the square so that the the
external boundary vertices are ones that
Odin moves to don't like it if Odin
moves to here he's one so basically Eve
tries to win by using the closed
vertices and Odin tries to win by
forcing Eve to the boundary that's
roughly what happens so you know you can
all said let's play it on the size n
diamond so now we have two parameters we
have n the size of the square and we
have P the density of closed sites and
this bootstrap argument tells you that I
mean bootstrap percolation gives you
bounds involving finite square so it
tells you that Eve wins with high
probability if n is big enough compared
with P if it's bigger than exponential
of constant over P which is pretty big
of course but that's not tight the
bootstrap argument is not tight for the
game so here is a place where Eve can
even though this argument from two
slides ago doesn't tell you that this
argument of effectively closed sites so
you know you can work it out in this
example maybe I won't do it right now
but but certainly this vertex doesn't
become occupied by the bootstrap oral
and but but even when starting from here
and here's one way to do so the correct
scaling is actually not this exponential
one that you get from from bootstrap
percolation but it's n is approximately
constant over P so more precisely we
know that if you do this on a diamond if
size and P so if n is large compared
with one over P then evens almost
everywhere on the screen and if if n is
big with respect to one over P then Eve
wins if n is small and Odin wins and
it's not quite for every site but it's
for most of them and there are some logs
that we couldn't go so it's not quite
that tight not and and you can deduce
things about what happens if you have
our sites closed with probability P and
even sites with probability Q as well
not very tight results so so where all
this comes from is there's a little bit
of magic there this game of trap on any
graph actually is related to maximum
cardinality matching so here's a fact on
any finite connected graph the first
player wins starting from a vertex V if
and only if V is included in every
maximum matching of G maximum not
maximal so it's all about maximum
matchings and this is easily enough to
prove it's just by induction you say if
this is true then you you find a good
first move and if it's
you find all first moves are bad and so
so there's another interpretation of all
these questions which is at least as
interesting as the game one that they're
questions about sensitivity of maximum
matchings to boundary conditions you
take a big chunk of your graph you cut
it off somewhere and you ask what the
what maximum matchings look like in the
middle near the origin does it depend
exactly how you cut it off or not so
that's so that's what draws are all
about so yeah I guess I should but the
way we prove that theorem is by finding
that rings and finding ways to modify
them so as much questions as I said most
interesting one play trapped on an
undirected percolation question cluster
onto d2 or on z3 are there any draws we
don't know the directed game on z3
remember that there's this hard I
was honest but it doesn't work on z3
happens and yeah so it's not one thing I
didn't talk about really you can ask
whether you have phase transitions in
any of these cases so take in for
instance this this three-dimensional
even lattice that I showed you towards
the end and three dimensional directed
even lattice so we know that you have
draws if P is small enough and not if P
is big enough but we don't know whether
the probability of a draw is monotone in
P so we don't know whether there's a
just a phase two insertion point you can
try to improve these bounds that we have
up to a logarithm or you can just ask
what actually happens in here and and by
the way if you want to if you want to
understand this first question what
happens on the on the undirected lattice
then it wasn't just a face-saving axis
that is that we looked on this finite
dime and you know you probably want to
understand how the game works on finite
region
first because there are these supposedly
there are these red and blue regions
that are but each other so you better
understand how they work and so what
happens within this window you could ask
yeah well there are many many questions
you can look at the target game it can
compute the winning probability things
back to the back to the to Z that was
and misery versions there's non
bipartite graphs etc etc
these are incorporate random twenty
different question because you don't
know the randomness ahead of time I mean
what what we're doing is we're saying
the randomness is all in the graph and
then you know it possible sinabi bounce
yeah you come from a probabilistic
construction yes yes so the g's once yes
yes I see so I want to think we could
level those sure there's a randomized
construction but yes you might expect
that yeah yeah we really don't know it
wouldn't be surprised if you could if
you could improve one other bound but
but it's perfectly possible that there
is a real interval in between as well
wear something different happens like
yeah even wins in certain places and
Odin wins and in other places it's an
interesting question yeah I mean I mean
pictures like this you know we
explicitly construct matchings I mean
for the one band we explicitly construct
good matchings and then we somehow
modify them along alternating path so
that we can produce different ones that
correspond to different vertices and
there's probably some slack in our
constructions and and then the other way
there's some how will we prove
non-existence well if I will leave
almost you've been saying all this
yeah so we find a right
so you so basically you on this side of
the boundary want to prove that there's
a matching that matches all odd sites
but leaves any particular even site that
you're interested in unmatched that's
basically what you have to do so we
start we start by constructing one
matching and then we modified along an
alternating path to get ones are the
ones we want the other way yeah I mean
you know behind these that there are you
know fairly concrete constructions and
it's perfectly possible one could
improve them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
