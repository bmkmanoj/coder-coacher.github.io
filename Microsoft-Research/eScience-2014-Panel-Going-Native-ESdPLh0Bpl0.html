you
thank you thank you for Deanna thanks so
the thanks to all the local hosts for
putting on just great venue for us good
morning everybody I hope you enjoyed the
demos from last night I think you
there's lots of smiling faces but that
may have been the caipirinhas that we're
adding to some of the fun well done for
getting up this morning coming in for
the panel session I'm sure it's going to
be great Anna I'd like us to just for a
moment think about you know some of the
justification some of the reason
reasoning behind is holding the panel
and he goes back to some of the thoughts
and comments that were made yesterday in
awarding Paul Watson the 2014 Jim Gray
award and that was that Jim sent a lot
of time immersing himself in the
scientific problems and needs of
researchers although he was a computer
scientists he would totally immerse
himself in the context the language and
the problems that allowed him to
properly understand and then solve or
help solve some pretty tough scientific
data analysis challenges and the quote
that we've chosen to use for this
channel from jim is as follows in order
to really understand the computing needs
of a scientists you have to go native
and proudly a yesterday actually I think
misunderstood a little bit what the
going native was she thought it would
involve a level of nudity but I'd like
to reassure you all that that isn't
going to happen although having spoken
to some of the panel members yesterday
over lunch this conversation could go
anywhere so I'm sure it's going to be
fun so what I'd like to do now is
introduce the three panel members and
invite them to come on stage so these
are I'm going to give you a little bit
more
an introduction to each of them but this
is Paul Watson Anthony Williams and
Stephen keling thought you'd like to
join me on stage and as they're coming
on stage I'll just remind you a little
bit of Paul's background so he's a
professor of computer science director
of the digital digital institute at
newcastle university as you may have
heard yesterday he has been involved in
a range of different a science project
she'll be giving us a little bit more
thoughts and details on to some of those
Anthony Williams is VP of strategic
development of the royal society of
chemistry he has a passion for
integrated data he's worked her a range
of different information related
problems to do with chemistry and done
battle with organizations such as
Wikipedia so there's some amusing blog
posts that you might want to search on
later on then going on to Steven killing
Steven as I find this quite funny
actually his bio says that he
coordinates the following lists of
people which you know is a group of
people that's impossible to coordinate
so he coordinated team of ornithologists
computer scientists physicians
application developers data managers and
projects that about his he's responsible
for the e bird project so you're going
to be hearing I think a little bit more
about that we're all expecting his
presentations be quite a hoot sorry
that's my one on ethology related joke
so with that I'm going to invite paul to
come up Ferb and to just spend a few
minutes taking you through some of his
thoughts on immersing ourselves in these
sides
you're not going to tweet about this
session and down okay so well pleasure
to to speak to you on it to talk about
some of the experiences that we've had
in a project at your castle and Dundee
universities of the pus over the past
few years and this is what I mentioned
yes there for those of you who are here
which is the side project social
inclusion through the digital economy
and the aim of the project is to try to
use digital technologies to transform
the lives of communities and individuals
a socially excluded and in order to do
that we realized that computer
scientists on the run one couldn't be
able to to achieve this so this was we
had this I had a revelation quite early
on when we're thinking about this
project when we talk about all of the
different aspects that we needed to
worry about if we were really to
understand this problem and maker make
some sort of doing in it that that
really on our own we weren't able to do
that and we need to get a paucity of
people with different sorts of skills
and we ended up pulling together a
project that has computer scientists
electrical engineers sociologists people
from business skills experts in user
centered design gerontologists and
designers a very wide range of groups I
mean even within that so some of the
designers for example reading musicians
so there's lots of different subgroups
within these these different parts of
the project and one of the things that
we had to do is big project 20 million
dollars so there's a lot of postdocs or
a PhD students and ten professors
involved in the project and so one of
the things that we had to do with
understand to how to get these people
working together on these problems now
in some ways say they're going native
analogy I think it doesn't quite capture
this you know and i think in lots of
ways it
quite captured some of the things that
we do because you know the idea of going
at it is you perhaps you immerse
yourself in it in a discipline and then
you become like one of the people in
that discipline but actually what you're
what you're really doing here and in
most of these sorts of projects where
you get involved with people from other
disciplines is that you're you're
learning as much as you can about their
discipline book together you're going to
create this new land which has a
different culture to the one that I love
you have come from so there's a sort of
an element of terraforming in it every
year if we push the if we push the
geographic metaphor and and so the
question was well how do we how do we do
this study in this project with a group
of people and the things that looking
back that I wish I would have done when
we started this project still going but
we started five years ago is to a stable
but so this is the first question to ask
do you really want to do this okay are
you really committed to this because
it's an it's an enormous amount of time
and energy and you don't get a pay back
immediately in my in my experience the
payback can come after two or three
years and so what you're going to have
to do is you're going to have to give up
an enormous amount of your time and
academics are terrible for taking on
more and more commitments to the point
where they stop delivering on on almost
anything and so I would ask anybody who
decides to go and immerse themselves in
there in somebody else's subject and
work with other people what are you
going to give up because you can't just
do this whilst you're continuing all the
other commitments see that you have and
I think that's one of the reasons why
sometimes these these projects don't get
off to it to a good start so so i would
encourage people to have a no doubling
rule so don't go into another discipline
and take up people's time skim through
the first 20 pages of an introduction to
subject X and then turn up the
occasional meeting and not see at that
that's the end of their going they're
just part of your career so you've
really got to sleep
to to make a big commitment to it and
then is there getting off to a good
start problem so this is things can go
around very very quickly unless people
unless you really think about how to get
going in a collaboration with people in
another discipline and it is important
to obviously due to do the thing that
downloaded to the gym grade said about
you know immersing yourself so I when
economic going to jim's house for
example an 11 day and he decided to move
into biology and you had rows and rows
of biology books which he was which he
was working through in order to in order
to do that who is deadly serious about
really learning about a subject and you
need to do that because otherwise you
won't even be able to understand the
lingo that people speak when you're in
meetings with them and you need to
understand things that don't often come
out in introductory textbooks which is
what are the real challenges in this in
this subject so if you don't understand
that you have to find yourself immersed
in some quite trivial things which seem
you which people in that subject think
may be useful for you is it in my case
the computer science get involved in
like could we have a good we have a web
page please weather for the project
because you could you create a database
them and put this put this Excel
spreadsheet into it pleasing so you've
got to get beyond that the only way to
do that it's a co-production so you have
to really understand what the goals are
in in in the subject what you're going
to try and do and then it's this things
that sometimes you don't even think of
what can cause enormous prams like that
the reward structures so in different
scientific subjects people are trying to
do different things and they get on in
their subject for different things so is
it a is it the subject we're collecting
data gives you gives you rewards or is
it do you get your rewards only from top
quality journal purpose but computer
scientist like me we always have this
issue about publishing in conferences
and publishing in journals and a certain
endless meetings at my own University
and other places where people high up
don't understand that in different
subjects our goals for publication are
entirely different and if we followed
one general
rule then our careers would come wrap
quite rapidly to it to an end you know
it might make it easier for people more
senior in the university to take boxes
and count things and then convention so
I've seen somebody in tears because they
were listed as forth on a list of
authors rather than the third that
they'd hoped for and in that discipline
there was a very precise ordering that
you put things and when you went for
example you went forward for promotion
they would take into account the order
that you were on me on the author's list
of a of the purpose whereas in my own
discipline are I I think I usually do it
in essentially in a random order
occasion we try to create conventions
like person who puts the most definitely
pair but goes first but all the times we
do it up about agree I don't really
think there is one support it's very
easy to to miss these Salty's when
you're moving into it to work with
people a key thing is table so if you're
going to get immerse yourself in a
subject you're going to end up spending
a lot of time with with other people you
really need to find good people to work
with you need to find people who are
going to treat your subjects with
respect and vice versa you don't want
people who think you're sort of higher
hand is coming in to do a little bit to
work here and there that they think
would be useful what you need is to be
able to is to work with them on problems
that you both think are interesting and
important where you both see the benefit
of doing so and then there's some
low-level things which didn't seem
perhaps important but how are you going
to have regular meetings are you going
to start off with her so we try to start
all of our projects were there with a
couple of days away with all the
participants we find that that's that's
good so you learn a bit about the
subject and then you you have dinner in
a few drinks together and you start to
get to know people that it's I can't
stress how important it is to to be able
to get on with with the people you're
you're going to work with you going to
spend time with and to tell you
something that I did which which fell
almost entirely for example so the idea
that by putting people in the same room
it
make them collaborate well together so
there's an occasion one project I was
involved in where where I thought the
guy did have some the musicians who were
working on the project in the same room
is the computer scientists and this all
ended when one of my most mild my
computer scientists came to me and said
something on the lines of and if that
person picks up a ukulele again then I'm
going to and and it kind of i minus to
jump in and stop them completing the
sentence but it was just because they
the different ways in which they were do
you need a lot of do you need a quiet
time to work or is it do you want a
buzzy space to work in where people are
always jumping up with ideas or ukuleles
in some kids and so I think you've got
to be clear about the approach of say
one thing about the about setting
expectations and and the thing that I've
noticed particularly in collaboration
with people in the social science so
social scientists versus versus other
sorts of science then in computing the
fashionable way to organize projects
these days I think in both industry
academia is this agile model where what
you do is you try to create something
quite quickly you try it and then you
you iterate it over time and the idea is
you get something out there and you
learn from people's experiences using it
and I think a lot of computing research
is gone in is now done in that way
whereas in a lot of the social sciences
then the the model is one of which used
to be the case in computing which used
to call a waterfall model which many of
you will know where you spend a lot of
time working out requirements reading
literature and then you come up with a
plan for what you're going to do and
then yourself off to do it and then you
evaluated and a lot of social scientists
still write like so if you try to create
a project with where one groups going to
do an agile model while the other group
are going to do a waterfall model then
it just doesn't work at all
you have to think about how you're going
have the works going to develop over
time what the immediate benefits are to
both parties are you going to get some
early things out that give people warm
feeling that they're pointing in the
right direction and perhaps an early
purpose or are you going to go for the
more traditional longer model and I'll
just end with a couple of couple of
things to one is that what's the main
problem that I see well I think it's
inertia so it's to do with coming back
to that initial question I posed about
do you really want to do this or people
put a lot of effort into the initial
stage of collaboration in particular
people have put enormous efforts into
writing grant proposals in my opinion
which are going to give them some
resources sometime in the future and at
that time it may honestly feel that they
are going to really get deeply involved
with people in other and the other
subjects involved in the grant proposal
but what happens is once the money comes
in it gets divided up amongst the
parties and they meet want to once a
year to talk about what they what
they're doing but basically the inertia
people continuing along their current
academic path stops them from actually
interacting with the other people in a
meaningful way and going and getting
results which are much better than they
than me then they would do if they were
doing what they are really doing which
is just all to work individually and
finally a question of so based on this
experience so this is this is our latest
attempt to try and do something and
create did you create these natives so
this is our new topple training center
so we get about 12 new PhD students a
year 45 in ticks we just had the first
intake this is this is us on a retreat
that we had to to get to know each other
which involved all getting wet largely
in that very cold lake in Northumberland
and and what we what we're doing is
we're trying to say can you take people
from the start is it easier to get
younger people to become natives rather
than to try and take somebody who's old
it was further down in their career has
more commitment so we're taking in
people who've got first degrees or
masters
in either computing science or
statistics then we teach them about each
other subjects and then we bring them
all together and we teach them about the
in this case the cloud computing and big
their analytics and then what we what
happens is that once they've done that
and they do that for about seven or
eight months then they go off and do a
more traditional PhD but with three
supervisors statistician a computer
scientist and somebody from another
discipline who's a problem owner so some
it might be somebody who's a chemist and
astronomer and ornithologists whatever
subject but there that there's a key
part of the the team who's supervising
the PhD and the idea is to see whether
if you start to inculcate these
practices of learning how to be a good
native in somebody else's land early on
can that help to develop those practices
right through your career thank
so I'm a chemist by training and then
moved into computers and but I have
never lost the tendrils that stay
embedded in my initial training that's
become very very important so I'm going
to tell you about a vision that was set
a few years ago that we still haven't
delivered on we're definitely making
progress it's an enormous undertaking
but going native has become more and
more critical as we try and deliver one
of us one question first and that is who
in the room has this thing called an
orchid notice the spelling that is
wonderful that is what you call people
being immersed in e science because
you're following the trends if I ask
that question in my own field of
chemistry hardly anybody has ever heard
of this we want to bring together
information data recognition for
contribution this particular social
security number of a science is going to
become critical so there's one thing you
get from from what I say I would suggest
you go off and take a look at orchid org
and make sure that if you're a scientist
you pick one of these social security
numbers up and you'll see why they're
very important I hope as I go so on a
set of vision this vision came at a
watering hole in in Washington DC a
number of years ago late one evening
over a napkin and because that's what we
do in the evening with people like Tony
hey we sit and drink water and come up
with crazy ideas like we did last night
so let's laugh together as much
chemistry data as we possibly can all
the historical data that we can lay our
hands on everything on the web let's
bring it all together heck let's go a
little further because chemistry and
biology are so intimately integrated
let's map all the chemistry that we can
onto as much biology as we can
at the end of the day every single one
of us in this room is going to end up
taking something to extend our life so
we depend on chemistry dramatically
let's out in disease data too because
that's absolutely critical if we can map
all of that information together we're
going to start to do very interesting
things like predictive science around
disease states biology and chemistry and
bring all that together in fact let's
model as much as the data as we can
bring together so that we can start to
do predictive modeling in different ways
we it's well proven that prediction can
take your one way let's make a
quantitative let's make it qualitative
now that sounds like a big undertaking
what I can tell you is we started this
project about seven years ago a couple
of guys who hand-built two computers we
bought one little computer which touted
aggregating data we put ten and a half
million chemicals online none of it was
funded by any funding agency and today
is one of the world's top chemistry
websites it was acquired by the Royal
Society chemistry at 50,000 unique users
a day we have 31 million chemicals and a
lot can come from immersing yourself
directly with people who care about what
they're trying to deliver whoo-hoo
absolutely understand some of the
challenges and are really willing to put
their passion into things but it sounds
like a massive undertaking what we're
trying to do it we're going even further
let's think about one thing let's try
this challenge we're going to map the
world we're going to take photos of all
the places we visit we're going to put
them in places and mash it all together
on this map we're going to let people
annotate and curate the map then we're
going to make it available free on the
web then we're going to make it
available for decision-making like
where's the nearest restaurants are
there any reviews on the pressure on how
do I get there maybe I can put it on a
mobile device so that I can actually
start tracking things heck maybe I can
even take a run and it will track all of
that information put it on a social
networking site well we've done allow it
we use it every day so if we can make
that type of challenge happen and the
only thing that's saying and standing in
the way of doing this for the sort of
science that we want to do is skills
resources commitment and infrastructure
so it's absolutely freezing
so let's think about chemistry data for
a moment and is it a value yes chemistry
data physics data mathematical equations
any person operating in any field wants
to go for reference information where do
you go for reference information today I
was sitting with this gentleman down
here yesterday and he was talking he
ordered a bottle wine and he wanted to
tell me about the grapes so where did he
go Wikipedia we're having discussions
about many other things in the evening
where do we keep going we go to
reference sources all the time Wikipedia
is one of our primary ones I'll tell you
a little more about that particular
going native activity shortly not the
detail that I gave you yesterday and the
reference databases in all fields
generate millions of hundreds of
millions of our dollars euros whatever
your preferred currency is peeing okay
but bet they're built by very dedicated
teams who curate very very carefully but
wikipedia is not built that way in fact
most of the reference databases of the
future i judge will not be built by
commercial fantasies there's so much
data generated the goat that could go
public and never does so I work for a
publishing house but in my entire career
i believe i've only ever published five
percent of all of the dates I've ever
generated ninety-five percent of
everything I've ever produced has
decayed it's gone i can't find it it's
sitting on storage media i can't even
read anymore so what would happen if we
could make all of that data available
would it would it enable decision-making
would it help science would help
research absolutely there is no journal
of failed experiments it's not going to
be a best-seller nobody's going to jump
into the frame and started to that
journal of fail synthesis journal too
poorly and analyze data but all days
there is valuable to science and clearly
it as a way to to annotate the make it
more value funding agencies are starting
to demand open data it's more and more
critical so a decision has been made by
most of the funding agencies in Europe
right now that at least five percent of
all the funding must be put into data
management plan
it's easy to say that and it's actually
quite easy to get people within science
to commit to doing that but the solution
is not so easy to produce and that is a
big challenge and also scientists may
want funding to exist and to get their
work done in two to produce amazing
science but the end of the day many
scientists want recognition or even if
they are to produce station to
contribute it and come up with data
management plans to put it out there
what they ultimately want is recognition
for what they produce and the challenges
how to do that so of course we're all
seeing this shift to openness we're
seeing open access changing the world
Royal Society chemistry as a publisher
we've embraced it most of the mainstream
publishers today have embraced open
access there is no reason to fight it
it's absolutely beneficial to society
into science it's the right thing to do
but of course there are challenges
around how to how to move into that
world more so open data is here there
are more and more conferences on open
data there's more and more thrust to
release the data to do it correctly to
have it available to be able to mesh it
to have it contributed that's that's a
big challenge that we still have to deal
with so it's chemistry data value
clearly clearly in chemistry they chose
navari but who's going to fund and build
a system with the platform's the
software there is going to make this
happen just in our little domain of
chemistry so going native is a matter of
it's interesting the ports use the word
lingo so you've got to speak at the
lingo if you want to work in our world
so these are things that we have to deal
with we'd have to deal with chemical
structures we have to deal with
analytical data we have to deal with
piece that have been interpreted we have
to deal with the complex graphs most of
you will get a basic understanding of
this at any level when you when you
think about chemistry but trying to
interpret these things and trying to
capture them and deal with them
computationally can be a very big
challenge we try this is something we
built this is called chemspider to free
resource for the year for the world as I
say we put it together on a very small
shoestring budget running directly out
of a basement on how
build computers and today it's a much
bigger platform what did we learn by
trying to get this done and hundreds of
not thousands of hours of sitting with
chemists who are using platforms like
this so what we learned very quickly as
data quality on the internet is very
very poor for trying to mesh together
information we figured out very quickly
you really need to understand the data
sources that you bring together because
most people don't understand the depths
of this of the computer science that
they need to do to build these databases
properly so we made some very early
mistakes and we're actually still trying
to clean them up because we brought
aggregated a lot of data together
without really understanding how people
had built it that was a real problem for
us everyone wants access to the highest
quality data at no charge but few are
willing to contribute so how many of you
use Wikipedia I think I know the answer
every hand will go up how many of you
write wikipedia articles is a different
question how many of you want very good
reviews about books sitting on Amazon
this is how many of you will write them
so we all want to take and it and it's
just part of human nature we will only
contribute to those things we really
care about we will take but very visible
very few others will give back in many
cases the prayer primary concerns for
contributes is really are down to it
needs to be easy well we're making that
happen with the computers interfaces
design that's that's getting their data
licensing is an absolute confusion for
so many people all of us have her
creative commons but if we sat down and
try to discuss all the variants of
creative comments and how it's morphing
with time i think we would get lost just
ask this gentleman down here about BSC
and GPL and you'll have an entire
conversation that goes on all night
shooting Paul so even software license
is an open-source licensing is very
confusing and the recognition
contributions at the end of the day this
is what I want I want to have an impact
in fact that's what I think we all need
we all need to go through our life of
scientists making sure that we have the
greatest impact possible that we feel
good proud about what we do and in order
to do so we
have to immerse ourselves in the right
conversations with the right people and
in many cases just do the right thing
that doesn't always mean following the
crowd by the way because some of the
things I've done I've collided over and
over and some of the things that Tony's
done and Microsoft do we collide with
the crowd and that's the right thing to
do sometimes to have an impact now
nevertheless we're all being measured
also so impact is a very interesting
thing these are some of the things about
me I've got a number labeled on me
research gates bottom left-hand side I'm
a 40-point 36 which i think is something
to do with chest measurement versus hips
I have no idea i'm going for 42 and for
those of you who know Douglas Adams the
answer to grab the universe and
everything and all of these things are
being captured on me these are metrics
of my contributions for presentations
publications etc etc in fact altmetrics
is the new term how many people in the
room of heard of altmetrics it's a
pretty small group so I would recommend
that you go and do a search on all
metrics the top thing that will probably
come up it's called the altmetrics
manifesto and we'll talk about how we as
scientists are going to be measured
moving forward and it shouldn't just be
a poll so so what so willingly point to
that shouldn't just be wed where do we
publish the articles that the citations
the highest impact articles it should be
everything that we contribute to science
okay and these are being aggregated
together by a number of groups already
so there's three of them altmetric plum
analytics impact story and because many
of us participate in things like blogs
Darren was saying yesterday how how is
part of the careers efforts and in
Microsoft like them people are being
encouraged to block every couple of
weeks to be a part of the community to
get out there and when you when you get
out there with a blood commonly you get
immersed in new collaborations new
discussions that you actually didn't
even see coming it's a very very
powerful way to participate research
data sets can be contributed to the
world and they can be re-examined and
interpreted and great things can happen
from
stadium announcer scientific software of
course you should be measured by
software that is put out there
downloaded thousands of times pushed
into other systems underpinning things
that should absolutely be a critical
measure you might not even publish it
and yet you can make a great
contribution we've got posters
presentations pcs dissertations
performances youtube videos and lectures
online classes all of these things that
we do a scientist above and beyond just
publication and then invoke very
important to be acknowledged so in order
to encourage participation in changing
this world to build this research data
out for everybody to consume the
question really is how can we make that
happen can we can we recognize people's
contributions so just a small story and
I decided one year to dedicate Christmas
time to cure aging Wikipedia I thought
maybe it would take a couple weeks
christmas through new year I would look
at every single chemical compound on
Wikipedia and check it check every
awesome every bond and see whether or
not it was accurate these are chem boxes
on the right hand side you can see a
chemical structure you can see a set of
identify as entities are all related
there and I sat down to do this it was
supposed to be a two-week effort it
turned into three years and six of us
have to work together to get it done
thousands and thousands of chemicals now
here you've got a quite a common
chemical be glucose and but just
checking those chemicals can take time
this is a slightly different one here so
this is three days of discussion to
change one bond earnest in this molecule
to crow lamas you can see of this on
this molecule on the right hand side
there's wedge buns those staff wedge
buns and there are hash funds one of
those was incorrect it took three days
of discussion with the scientists to
figure out how to change it checking
peer-reviewed literature checking
databases checking crystal structure
three days of discussion to change one
molecule there were 6,000 done would it
be to the time for 10,000 today if you
if you happen to operate in chemistry
the pd and you see the quality is good
that's because a lot of people have
worked very hard let's talk about
crowdsourcing now that was six people
this so-called crowd is actually very
very small there are very few people who
are willing to contribute to that level
and his the discussion that goes on so
in terms of understanding Wikipedia boy
did I ever go native I went into that
system very very hard for a long long
time not not so much anymore I had a few
interesting run-ins with Wikipedia
pedals as Darren says go to go search
the web now there's one bond matter in
the world of chemistry do we need
reference data do we need high-quality
data well for those of you who are a
little bit about chemistry hands are
mirror images molecules can be mirror
images okay so one bun can indicate the
status of that molecule so here we have
two molecules that differ only in one
bond orientation one experiment one is
caraway just because one bond is coming
out of the plane and one bond is going
to the back of the plane that's the
distinction between the wedge and the
hash of the button does that matter yes
thalidomide one bond cause the
difference between being sedative action
and a teratogen there's one of the
world's worst situations that we've ever
faced because of one bond by the way for
later made it back on the market it's a
great drug once you understand the
complexities of chemistry and you learn
her work educating chemists and data
making high-quality data making it
available providing their input is very
very difficult because most chemists
don't even understand the complexities
of computer handling of data they don't
know what they have to produce in order
for us am a computer side to do the
right things with it they don't
understand most international standards
for data representation they have no
idea how to produce data in the ways
that they need it so while we encourage
data management plans the fact is
chemist don't know how to do it so we
actually have to educate them we have to
work out but computers are very good at
dealing with standardization and they're
the real engines on the Vista so we're
building ways to do this for chemists so
all they have to do is provide those
files
we will go through and we will validate
and standardize and give them feedback
and encourage them to check the quality
of the data computers are perfect for
that type of activity but to understand
that you have to really be in there
where do you host the research data
we're building platforms for compounds
reactions analytical data so we can even
generate models and if we can generate
models the chemistry we can do better
research so the new horizons are already
here they're coming and computer
scientists are essential to step into
the SAT these forms of science chemistry
is one place we have to get our heads
into so that we can save lives we're all
at all at risk of antibiotic resistance
today you have to figure out how to
solve these problems so let's take what
we learn about historical data so better
solutions for modern data so the
publications are more enabled so we
don't do this I think this is crazy this
is that this is a spectrum from a PDF
file that was originally digital data
came off an instrument we create figures
for mr. and while I can go to this the
bottom one is the figure the top one is
it is the extraction while I can do that
that is not the right way to do it we
should take digital data and its roar
roars formats and and put it into
systems not extract it back at a PDF
files so the path forward I think is
right here mation aggregate publish data
encourage deposition of research data
chemistry is one form so many other
forms of science that we have to do the
same computer scientists need to get
into that work there we'll figure it out
really immerse ourselves go native
folios jim said we have to provide open
ati's for access to the data not just
lock it up and we have to educate the
various scientists in digital literacy
most scientists are not digitally
literate yet funding agency should
mandate data access and collaboration is
key don't do it alone that's why work of
people like Paul and scientists all over
the world we cannot figure it out on our
own and if you're interested in the
slides that will go up on my slide share
tonight thank you
whoo-hoo
I was a birder before I before I turned
15 I was a I'm a conservation scientist
professionally and I'm an information
scientist now I can't help thinking
about the significance of of
biodiversity and and the opportunity to
be in Brazil which is one of the the
biodiversity hotspots in the world is
really a special occasion for me I work
at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology we
study bird populations we do
conservation science and we do this
we've really worked a lot with this
concept of citizen science where we get
people to go out and collect data for us
which we can then process and while
there's been lots of attempts to to
develop algorithms and machines that can
identify birds to species that the only
machine that really can do that right
now our humans so beginning around 2000
we decided to test the hypothesis
whether we could actually engage the
birding community to submit observations
into a central database that we can then
do conservation science and ecology with
that data so in 2002 we released this
project called eburg and we build it as
an academic project it was asking people
to help us save the birds well needless
to say for the first couple of years of
project we weren't collecting any data
at all so we did this we went native
we basically went to the birding
community and found the best and the
brightest young birders and says what do
we need to do to make this project work
and they told us we can't focus on
science we have to focus on building the
tools and the functionality the bird
watchers want so we totally flipped
around the car the ideas of what ebird
the project was and all of a sudden the
data collections is started to grow
exponentially to the point now that
every month we collect more data than we
did the first three years of the project
but the trick that we did and we always
stayed within our discipline was we we
fold the participants to give us good
quality data and with that data then we
could bring a community of computer
scientists and statistician
ornithologists together to start looking
at that data and that's what I want to
talk about the first thing I wanted to
show is this picture of a house since
this is a bird that occurs in the
western part of the United States and I
want to tell you how our first foray
into machine learning associated house
finches with Eskimos which stone Eskimos
don't really occur very frequently in
the United States and the state of Maine
in the state of Maine is in the eastern
part of the United States and when we we
ran our first machine learning models we
created we organized thousands of
current variables that would help us
predict and look at the relationship
find correlations between the birds
observations that we collected in eburg
and all of these variables and one of
the variables that we use or one of the
data sets that we were able to get was a
human census data for the United States
and what the results of the and the
highest correlation we got from from our
our decision tree models was that in the
state of Maine almost a hundred percent
of the time where you found an Eskimo
you would also find how stinky there's
probably about ten Eskimos in Maine so
we we found that this correlation really
while it was strong for the computer
science group made no sense of all of
the ornithologists and conservation
biologists so that really God is
thinking about this notion that
correlation does not imply causation and
that's a huge invaluable lesson for us
as information scientists and computer
scientists and it really changed the
paradigm now on on the way that we study
our systems because even though we
collect a lot of data with eBird there's
never enough data and we always have to
find relationships between other kinds
of co variables with our bird occurrence
data to make predictions and models on
their distribution so that brought us
that and really forced us to move into
and across disciplinary team where
initially we would have incredible
arguments almost fights particularly
between computer scientists and the
statisticians were where they were they
were adamant one side or the other was
adamant that that the the correlation
process is the volume of data that we we
have the sufficient to show patterns
where where the statisticians were
saying you still need to include
probability in and how we look at these
these kinds of results so so then we
brought in a team of statisticians we it
is a big group there's about 40 of us
now are working on this project but now
I want to focus back and go back to the
the US Census data and another piece of
information that we found was that there
was a really high correlation which was
a high probability value to between
minorities in cities and the occurrence
of birds that live in wooded areas in
cities in these cities included
Baltimore Seattle we had a new york and
chicago so we couldn't figure out why we
were finding this correlation so we went
to a group at Cornell that studies the
social and economic research primarily
both based on census data and they
started talking to us about the
phenology of humans in the United States
and basically what's happened is that in
the 40s and 50s right after World War
two there was a massive grow
both in housing development around
cities and this was the first suburban
areas around these large cities
everywhere and people who bought these
houses planted shrubberies you know the
major gardens planted trees and things
like that 50 years later those people
passed away and a new group of people
moved into those reasons it happened too
often these people were minorities as
they moved out of the big cities into
these areas so what was happening was
that the the bird populations were now
being attracted to essentially mature
forests where these groups live that the
minority groups lived and and that was
the Association the correlation that we
found and it was only by us bringing in
multiple disciplines and and being open
to different ideas on how we could look
at this data and study it that allowed
us to get the kinds of results we did
that's what I wanted to focus on thank
so you'll just have to bear with me a
second while we just a microphone okay
so what I'd like to do is just move into
the the sort of discussion phase and I
like to start by challenging that the
three speakers who have the unfortunate
qualification of all being successful in
their e science projects clearly they've
learned a lot on the way but what I'd
like to do is is ask you what do you see
as the major sort of derailments now
clearly you've all had some great
research results or outcomes so you know
what are the sort of failure modes that
you see most often in these you know
large complicated relatively diverse and
challenging projects that you're
undertaking call you okay so i think i
mentioned a couple one is that people
don't really give himself enough time
we're going to become to become Amerson
the other one is the problem of inertia
one note i used to see and the courts in
a couple of projects which we now try to
avoid in the design of the project is
where the computer scientists like may
get excited by the possible of bowling
some cool new technology which will
transform the lives of the of the
scientists and it's a three year project
and you get to at the end of year one
and you things look like they're on
track as far as the computer
infrastructure building concern violet
end of year to you starting to get some
early results from it by the middle of
the final year of the project you're in
a position where you feel comfortable
I hand it over to the scientists who
then get having had a wait around for
about two and a half years who then get
six months to do wonderful science and
write it up before they before the
project end and so one of the things
that we try to do too to avoid that is
that we try to always get some early
wins so we don't try to have a project
where there's this stage one is that we
build infrastructure stages we hand it
over to the scientists and scientists
and then they can do something useful
with it so we try to move our get this
agile approach I was talking about
earlier work within the first few months
you were able to give the sign is
something that they can use and it's a
it builds a conference in the team ball
so quite often what you find is that you
find what assignments are really trying
to do and haven't perhaps in the
discussions it hasn't really become so
concrete boy becomes very clear once you
give them some summary technology and
they pry it and then they discover it's
not actually addressing the needs that
they have that it's something else would
be much more useful for them problem to
do so we we talk about these virtuous
circles in which you give scientists and
infrastructure they try something out
and give you feedback and then you build
the next generation is actually so from
my experience it's the factory long-term
commitment staying engaged it's very
hard to get people i think i think is a
i think it's the come societal that we
expect very quick wins and so many
things we expect things to show up
results very very quickly and some of
the some projects of large scale and
important scale take time you really
need to to try and come keep your the
community that you're working with to
move things forward engaged that can be
very difficult people are very willing
to walk away into the next quick win if
they can that's my biggest
for us to see this the realization that
it's okay to fail you can make mistakes
you can follow paths that really don't
get you to the end result that you
really want to be at but unless you're
in an environment that allows you to
allows bright people to make mistakes
you're not going to be successful the
one thing that the one thing that we
found two and now 15 years of this kind
of work is that typically our
publications first come out and computer
science or artificial intelligence kinds
of publications and then over another
year or so switch into the domains where
where those publications occur so we
have to have a long-term commitment we
have to think a lot about sustainability
of our projects to ensure that we can
follow this evolution publications so I
have a couple of other questions are
going to ask and then throw it open to
the folks in the room the first one's
about team health okay the reason why I
raised it is both Paul for you and and
see that you talked about very large
teams and I know within Microsoft one of
the things that we do is try and Rachel
what we understand different people
styles different characteristics so
modes of working the way they like to
inject information what motivates people
and we go we gone we do some exercises
which actually helps us characterize the
strengths and weaknesses that we have so
have you found that necessary clearly
Paul you did an off-site with some of
the doctoral students be
got there but but is this something that
you systematically do to understand the
health of the team or or is it just you
know if you're aware of it in some way
but there's no systematic approach that
you just so I guess the question is how
do you make sure the team helped is good
you know what tools and techniques to
you well so I don't think we're
systematically it sounds as if you are
practical can can turn to learn there
but so we try to get things which is
probably how we try to get things off to
a good start by getting the clean
together and getting them to spend some
time together doing things that
everybody's on come forward like falling
into a lake in the middle of
Northumberland and and then start to
develop from from there what I think
what we find is that this various ways
in which singh skin can go wrong and
sometimes one of the problems that we
see is that where people are effectively
being shielded from the rest of the
group so you might have different groups
working together in these meetings and
this is one person from a large group
comes with other people don't and that
sometimes a sign there is some problem
within the team of these people who
aren't comfortable working spar this
broader team and they're being shielded
or perhaps they're being used to work on
on other things other than the team is
going to is supposed to be doing so we
always try to even after the initial get
together we always try to have every
three months means we're actually
everybody is there and everybody talks
everybody up to talk about what they are
doing a lot of this as part of this
project rather than just one or two
people particularly seeing you people
are very good at at putting a stain on
how things are
going to you you need be all the
researchers to be able to present
honestly on the phone network but my
team is actually quite small when you
consider who is delivering the system
but the community were engaged with is
very very large so we put a lot of work
into to try and keep people engaged by
like communication etc terms of our own
team I don't think we do enough
personally but what we do do is give
people opportunities when when people
wish to participate in new things when
they want to try our new ideas where we
can we agree support them we encourage
them the lip service of its ok to fail
we actually and try and encourage that
to be real go up and try and see if you
fail in most most cases my own
experience of you know encourage you to
fail is have been lip service but we try
to do it really now go try the
experiment come back in a month and
let's see where we get to people want
new opportunities to to play and I think
that's important we're really selective
and careful about bringing new people
into our group we're lucky that we are
researchers on a very charismatic
organism and the kinds of data
visualizations that we do people like to
see an end and our best successes where
when we get by and from computer
scientists or statisticians that have
begin to show an interest in in the
projects themselves but the exciting
thing that happens is that the
ecologists and ornithologists then begin
to want to become more quantitative so
there's a merging of the two fields
which is really pretty exciting some my
my second question relates the project
management so if I think about the team
that we use we have within microsoft
research for trying to achieve are you
know II science program and get the
results that we sort of celebrate a key
part of that is for us is introducing a
where p.m. a project manager from
clearly owns you know the tasks of
coordinating people it's a very valued
skill within Microsoft as a whole and
the projects that you're describing to
me are a proper you know project
managers or program managers task do you
have that function of clearly identified
is it it's spread responsibility you now
have have you can you see that coming
yeah so so I'm very lucky that I've got
a actually excellent team of people who
help me and help everybody in the work
that we do I think the input these two
important things I've learned about that
one is for you to decide what you want
to do and what you prepared to give to
other people to do so for example I
don't really do money so at home my wife
does all of our finances and it work all
the projects i have i have somebody who
are brought in came in from industry
from this dead background and he very
worries about how we're spending money
on the project where it's going to where
we need to bring in more money and he'll
put a lot of effort in
into helping to bring in grunts all
holes into that so so I'm quite clear
that I don't do that a 94 that somebody
else and is very naive questions to him
and he does all the details I ask are we
running out of money yeah yeah can we
employ somebody else those sorts of
questions and leave that to somebody
else similarly we in the UK to nowadays
it's important to to cut your impact
talked about this in lots of different
ways in which you can measure impact and
and so rather than have us all do it in
a in a in a wild amateur passionately
it's typically happens at the at the end
of the project where yall scratch your
heads and try to remember all the
peppers that you've published and
whether anybody had ever given a talk
anywhere in the world about the project
we have somebody who captures as we're
going along and I think be a good thing
about lies the thing about how they can
develop their careers become even more
effective part is their of the team so
they become a little alien of games
who's doing that for our for our project
she's currently in California and
avenges written a pair representing that
on the challenges of capturing impact in
these in these projects so I think that
it sorts of discussion about you know
developing the magnitude team giving
them opportunities I think that includes
those people who are helping you with a
project management in your new project
so we we expect each person to be quite
independent manage their own slice of
the project but keep the primary project
manager very very informed and the
person that we have managing the project
is is very communicative literally daily
touches with the team members stays in
touch of everybody we have weekly
reviews it's very very important as
staying on schedule delivery stop you
know making very clear decisions about
what to do what can
it's essential for you a smaller team as
we have could we have a really spread
team across the united states and and in
the UK and one of the things that we do
is have a series of weekly meetings
using gotomeeting or that kind of
software too so you can see and interact
with people and share desktops things
like that those has been really helpful
but for me personally the my role now is
really to try to empower people to take
the lead and have be able to give them
the opportunity that I had to really
develop take off in their own specific
careers how it relates to the project
okay with that I'm happy to open up to
folks that maybe want to challenge some
of the speakers any questions that you
have
fine
yes I I work also with a couple of
multidisciplinary programs myself and my
experience is that funding is all people
are very busy so they optimize in time
and give you the only way to get them to
do things sometimes it's saying if you
don't do this for me then you won't get
any more time so my question is how is I
mean with so many groups in different
disciplines are is everybody getting
their own hunting or is there any
central planning for activities how does
it really work we have a real diverse
sustainability model about a half of our
funding comes from foundation support
national foundations a variety of
smaller foundations those those
proposals are submitted usually in
collaboration with with all of our
disciplines so we do a lot of great a
lot of proposals to the computer science
part of National Science Foundation but
we also go to small smaller foundations
to do things like
very specific task which which will they
like the impact piece of it the
foundation see we also look within the
university system for endowment and and
developing some kind of basic level
support that we're guaranteed every year
and then we also do services so we
generate reports for federal agencies
countries we partner with conservation
agencies and provide them information
and things like that so by maintaining
this sort of diverse income stream we've
been able to sustain and grow over the
past five or six years it's hard though
and it's probably that one of the areas
that I and a group of people at the lab
morphology support me
from what I heard from Tony some of your
activities were very much bottom of
unfunded works initially and in contrast
Paul some of yours are mega brands is
that correct or the deal of the size of
the project that you're talking about
yeah well we'd be lucky because in May
in the UK for the past 15 years has been
an emphasis on multidisciplinary search
through specific programs that you can
only go to for money if you have a Molly
additionally team so there was Tony hazy
science program from 2001 and they're
not that morphed into something called
the digital economy program which is
where we've got most of our recent
recent money from I think that I mean
the danger is that in everybody
everybody in academia tends to need
money to do things that they want to
that they want to do and so there's a
part of money available from somewhere
Lex a poor Molly discipline researchers
and the dangerous that you might get
people who won't that interesting Molly
disagree sir just saw as a way to to get
funding so although it's true that a lot
of the grunts has been large they've
often what we often do is to start with
very small pilot projects where we might
do six months work with somebody
probably unfunded and I'd build up an
understanding of what they're interested
in what the care law is our weather we
could work with them and then it's only
then that we would get them involved in
some large multidisciplinary project in
and even then what we try to do is to
retain some central control to the
beside project was 55 years then the way
we organize it was that at the beginning
we said exactly where the money would go
and who would be doing what but then we
had a review after two years and we made
it clear everybody of a start that's
what we would do say expectations and we
got people to write a little mini
proposal for what they wanted to do
whether they wanted to continue the work
they've been doing the food from
it failed to me we try to you know we
tried to say though it was okay to fail
but we didn't want to keep people i'm
suing failure for the second half of the
of the project wanted them to come up
with with some other better than what
they've learned with something else for
them to do so we did that and rely to
reviewed it and those project run for
two years and then we did this same for
the important video of the project so so
that's how we try to encourage people to
that's how we try to build projects with
people where we think they're going to
contribute we can work with them but we
try to make sure that they're actually
succeeding in the motor disciplinary
aspect to the research as you go through
the long project like the one we've
we've been working on okay tell you yes
the research danger alliance is funded
by the NSF you're failing national data
service I'm slightly confused as to what
it should be doing is not a standards
body and they're different disciplines
have standards bodies and so on so what
in your view should the research data
allowance be doing to make the data more
shareable interoperable what what are
the important things it should be
focusing on I've heard of the research
that rely on some not really engaged
with it much at all what I what I've
heard from people who participated is
it's a lot of discussions right now
trying to figure out exactly what
they're what they're supposed to be
working on I think they should probably
set up a set of teams that are specific
to sand aspects of science they should
charge those bodies with working on a
set of particular issues including
standards including particular mandates
that they they should be working on data
giving an open access to data is easy to
say and hard to do and one of our
biggest challenges has been to develop
the infrastructure in-house to be able
to not only provide open access to data
but actually to provide open access to I
think currently we have four different
data versions each of those are version
so so all of a sudden a simple concept
of making data open changes and becomes
much more complex and my experiences in
the biodiversity field specifically are
that those groups are not prepared to
handle the complexity of what it means
to ensure that a data set that a
researcher used in 2010 is still
available even though you're constantly
adding new data to that basic versions
access management and who is who's
asking for the day this that you have
metrics on dated use all of those all of
those particular areas are our novel and
Tony's still on the RDA boy
yeah so I'm pleased you're on the on the
board and you're going to sort this out
for us all because there it's a it's a
terribly difficult thing in one of the
reasons is that these different
conventions in different disciplines
people expect very very different things
I was going to talk last week someone he
works in finance and there they made
introduced it's wonderful this is
financial researchers wonderful new
system where they could put metadata or
about the data that they had in the file
names which is which is something that I
thought that scientists had given up in
about nineteen seventy two or something
like this well this is in that in that
subject this is the newer new coming
trend and in it I think it's just very
difficult to do things that generally
across a lot of tradition to think the
thing I worry about though is if you
look at the data that we create in them
in most of our projects then actually
it's pretty useless unless you've got
the programs which can interpret it and

thank you all for spending the last hour

to talk to them over cutter thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
