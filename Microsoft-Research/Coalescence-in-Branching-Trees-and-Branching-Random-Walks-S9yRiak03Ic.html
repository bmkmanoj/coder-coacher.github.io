you
good afternoon we're delighted to have
krishna's we are here some almost 45
years ago he wrote the Bible on
branching processes that even though
there's a lot of further work on the
topic it still looks a state-of-the-art
today in many many results were just
optima so there's nothing better to do
and yet is continued and had lots of
impact on the area later and
particularly you tell us something about
branching processes today please thank
you
thank you all for asking me to speak
here this is really nice I want to talk
about their problem are called
coalescence and and I will talk about
coalescence in branching trees so here
is a very simple version of the problem
take a binary tree so you a rooted
binary tree that is so you start with
one vertex at time zero splits into
exactly two vertices and that in turn
split into two and so on so you notice
that at level 1 at level 0 there is
exactly one vertex at level 1 there are
two and level two there are 4 2 squared
and so on and you can guess that at
level n there's going to be two to the N
vertices so now supposing so supposing
you choose two vertices from level n by
what is known as simple random sampling
without replacement which means there
are 2 to the N vertices available there
are two today and choose two pairs that
you can choose and you choose one of
those pearls with equal probability
supposing you choose say two vertices
and now you trace their lines back until
they meet call that like all the
generation where they lines meet
Aksarben so picked so then trace their
lines back their lines back in time
till they meet say at Generation X at
level XM clearly they will meet Aldred
they will meet at the origin but they
could be much before that so the
question is what is the xn is going to
be a random variable the tree itself is
deterministic but I've injected
randomness by my sampling procedure so
the question that we want to ask is what
is the distribution of xn 1 and 2 what
happens to it this as n goes to infinity
so this or two questions that we want to
ask and this is actually very easy to
answer in the following sense you notice
that the following probability
calculation is very easy if xn is going
to be anywhere from 0 1 2 3 up to n
minus 1 i'm looking at the m3 generation
so the meeting place must be at least n
minus 1 all the way down to zero but if
i wanted to be less than k then at level
k i have 2 to the N vertices each of
these individuals have a time n minus K
left to them so they would have 2 to the
N minus K descendants by time n so if I
want xn to be less than K that event
happens with i have 2 to the power K
vertices and I choose two of these guys
and then look at their descendants and
then I want to choose one from each of
these things so that are 2 to the N
minus K times 2 to the N minus K so
these are the number of favorable ways
of producing or X and less than K
divided by the total number of choices
which is 2n choose to
so this is the exact probability for k
equal to 12 all the way up to n now you
can choose this is this is indeed equal
to 2 to the K times through to the K
minus 1 over 2 times 2 to the N minus K
2 to the N minus K and the same to say
denominator is going to be 2 to the N
times towards n minus 1 over 2 and that
two will cancel with the numerator one
and hmm this is so xn less than crazy
salute XL is less than K wanted to first
choose the common dojo what is a good
level K there are 2 to the K vertices
and I choose two of those guys and I
look at the number of dissidents apply
at time n minus K at time future time in
which is n minus K so that's what is
this calculation but this is this is
equal to I can pull out the 2 to the K
from here so it is 1-2 to the minus K
and then pull out the 2 to the N from
here which is one minus 2 to the minus N
and then I have 2 to the K times towards
the gate true to the 2k due to the
hookah cancer through the 2n 2 to the 2n
all of that cancels so this is the exact
probability and this converges as n goes
to infinity to 1 minus 2 to the minus K
so we have shown that X sub K X of n has
an exact distribution which is
approximately geometric and in the limit
it is a geometric random variable now
clearly what we did for the case of
binary tree can be done for any binary
tree where memory tree but it's at least
deterministic well since Simon I worked
in branching processes as he said for a
long time so a natural question is what
happens if the tree is not deterministic
is a purely random tree so the question
that we want to ask is so this is
what if the tree that you have the
rooted tree that you have is a Galton
Watson or refer word or to be honest
with Australians BG wbp bien ma Galton
Watson branching process and is it is a
tree now you remember how that is
generated so you are given the following
a probability distribution pj j grid nor
equal to 0 pj non-negative and then
summation p j equal to 1 then you
generate so this is one to generate aw
indexed family of random variables
Jagran or equal to 1 n equal to 0 1 to
infinity of iid random variables with
distribution pedic then you define the
population size in the n plus first
generation to be the number of children
bond to the individuals in the answer
generation so if there are ZN
individuals in the anti generation each
one of them produces children according
to our this process and then C&amp;amp;J is the
number of children bond to the JH parent
in the anti generation and this works if
veteran is positive if the n is 0 the
population is already gone there is
nobody to produce anything so it will
stay at zero oh sorry
so 0 is what is called an absorbing
better once you hit zero you're stuck at
zero otherwise you can go this so then
the following result is is a well-known
theorem goes back to Galton himself and
then whatever and Watson who produce the
wrong solution is that the probability
there an equal to zero for some N
greater than or equal to 1 conditioned
on Z naught equal to 1 is equal to one
if the mean number of children produce /
parent is less than or equal to 1 and is
strictly less than 1 if this M is
greater than 1 so that's a very
well-known resultantly the mean number
of children produced has a role to play
in the tree surviving for indefinite
time or in terminating in a finite time
so there are many more results and here
is a classification m is the mean that
quantity there m greater than one is
called one sorry one less than m does an
infinity that is called supercritical m
equal to one is called critical and m
less than one is called subcritical
and I'm going to discuss one more case
which is not been discussed in my book
can order any other book before the
model it's called m equal to infinity
case explosive case I will talk about
that as well alright so now let me
describe the results for rod these cases
the visual means we all studied in the
literature first so if you take is
supercritical branching process and let
us assume that there is no extinction it
is p naught is 0 so here is the first
result that we can state so theorem 1
let p not be 0 no extinction and let the
mean number of children born to one
parent is be finite so then well i'm
picking only two individuals at random
from the nth generation the acceleration
is not going to be dead it's going to be
growing very rapidly then the
probability I'm going to call the
coalescence time accent2 that the
generation number when these two
randomly chosen individuals meet their
lines meet xn 2 is less than K
conditioned on the tree itself so in
other words remember there are two
sources of randomness the tree itself is
randomly generated and then I'm
injecting randomness by sampling but
suppose the tree is generated in the
next room and you bring the tree here
and then you do the sampling on the
vertices that is what this conditioning
means given the tree you look at this
quantity limit as n goes to infinity of
this exists and is a function of K and T
the tree for K grid k equal to 1 to
infinity exists
and what is more for almost all trees
this is a proper distribution and by K
of T converges to 1 as K goes to
infinity so in particular the limited
distribution exists for extent to it's
going to depend on the tree and of
course by the bounded convergence
theorem the unconditional average also
exists so this implies in turn that the
probability that xn 2 is less than K
without the tree averaging over all tree
also exists because this is bounded by
one and taking expected values okay will
converge to PI K which is equal to
expected value PI K of T now so this is
theorem one when m is finite but greater
than one so this is the super critical
case and if i have time i will indicate
the proof for you then let us look at
the critical case here is a problem in
the critical case we know that the tree
is going to die out with probability 1
but then I want to do some sampling so
I'm a mathematician so I will assume
that the tree is not dead so I'm
conditioning on an event where the event
probability is actually going down to
zero I am NOT the first one to do this
cosmoGirl of already did this Kolmogorov
did this way back in the late or early
forties so the critical case is this is
Emmy Qin to one and of course m equal to
1 is a possibility with p1 equal to 1
but that's a purely deterministic tree
everybody produce is exactly one child
and we want to rule that out if you rule
it out and say let's assume P 1 is less
than 1
if you want is one there is no
extinction the same everybody produces
one challenge so on so forth okay in
this case what is your intuition xl2
well we have to condition on the fact
that a time n the population is not
extinct number one number two it has at
least two individuals well fortunately
for us kolmogorov had proved a very
beautiful result long ago and that is a
following it requires the finite second
moment hypothesis so let me quote that
result for you so m equal to 1 and then
p naught p 1 is less than 1 and
supposing you assume that the finite
second moment exists so assume all of
these three conditions so given if all
this conditions hold then the survival
probability is going to die like 1 over
N and the population size is going to be
off daughter and then one the
probability Zn is positive that is the
process is not extinct we know that that
probability has to go to 0 but n times
that converges the Sigma square over 2
as n goes to infinity this is something
that kamagra established number of one
number to the probability that Z and
over n is less than X condition or non
extinction if the process is not extinct
how big is the population roughly
speaking of water n which is distinctly
different from the super critical case
where the population explodes at a
geometric rate it turns out that this
converges to 1 minus e to the minus 2
over Sigma squared X for every any X
positive so he proved this result
so hmm second one is no limit law yeah I
said well if it's a goblin was a student
it was not there is also a subcritical
result which is attributed the oblong so
we did some research and then eventually
we attributed to kolmogorov but you are
right here there's the name of well
again there are 2 o'clocks so we have to
be IM you are long in the a.m wroclaw
which you know which one you know it so
I just thought I'll call me Rodney
students with us so then it turns out
that the in the critical there is one
more result that we need which was not
proved by calm overall but which I
proved just a few couple of years or a
few years ago and that is the following
here is x 0 and here is timing supposing
a time n the population is not extinct
condition on the event that's an event
of some very small probability then go
to level k the population is not extinct
by men therefore it cannot be extinct at
like 10 k but then there are large
number of individuals at that time say Z
K and look at the lines initiated by
each one of them each one of them has
certain number of individuals left but
some of the lines could be dead some of
the lines of not dead so now look at the
following process V sub n is going to be
you look at Z n minus K Super K comma i
divided by n minus K time the indicator
function of Z n minus K I super k+ for
all those for i equal to one to ZZ k
in other words I go to level K there are
ZK individuals each of them initiates a
line of descent and then look at what
happens to their population size in each
one of them divide that by n minus K and
look at only those lines for which the
population is not extinct by time n so
now this is a collection of points on
the non-negative offline it has a random
collection of points so it's what is
called a point process question what is
happening to this point process and I
showed that this point process so this
is so blah blah blah you can put my name
on it if you like 3v and conditioned on
Xion grid nor equal to 2 or Xia not
equal to 0 it touch but enough to this
is a point process so you have to go to
the spacer point processes and talk
about V convergence in the space of
point processes you can use a Laplace
functional blah blah blah and so on so
look yeah it is a good point k has to go
to infinity and n has to go to infinity
so so let me write it down let K the den
go to infinity k go to infinity such
that K over N goes to you where you is
between 0 and 1 so it has to be roughly
of the same order as n okay supposing
that happens then so this is the third
result then VN conditioned on Zenon
being non zero converges in distribution
to random point process where the number
of individuals number of pub so it's
going to converge to remember there is
this is a non-negative quantity a whole
bunch of non negative quantities and
this will converge to the following is
going to be converts to Etta one so
either too
either say a random variable V where the
haters are going to be gull exponential
distributed and B is going to have a
certain well-defined distribution coming
from here so let me write down that
precise result I because this is very
useful to sell that tariff it comes up
in another context also in this not in
this paper it is
I don't remember where it is it
converges to a point process a
terminator to etta n sub you where the
eight eyes are independent random
variables exponentially distributed n
sub view is geometric with parameter you
so you generate a sequence of iid
Gaussian exponential random variables
and then generate an independent
geometric random variable with parameter
you call the den sub you then go fix
only these random variables so this is
going to be a random point process on
the non-negative offline that's what
this will converge to so it's not easy
to prove that result but it requires the
Laplace functional and then this book of
this Norwegian mathematician who is at
Auburn what is his name I keep
forgetting I will give the reference
recital choice Kellenberg kallenberg has
a very nice method called Laplace
functional method to prove this so you
have to use that so the be here xn 2 so
in the end in this case you look at xn
to xn 2 is the conditioned or non
extinction population is not extinct now
xn to you to take two individuals at
random in the end generation trace their
lines back and see when they meet and
the question is what is happening to X
in two now notice in the super critical
case X into is way back in time here it
is not way back in time excel to is
roughly of the order n it's less than
you converges to some a function H of
you
and this H of you age of 0 plus is one h
of 1 minus is one H is absolutely
continuous on 01 so there is a proper
distribution function such that xn 2
over n converges to that well orexin to
over Exeter has to be between 0 and 1 so
in other words the random variable that
it goes to is a is in the open interval
0 to 1 yeah h of 0 plus is 0000 sorry
not one of course thank you it is 0 plus
is 0 I meant so the H is a distribution
that is sitting on the open interval 0
to 1 is an honest redistribution it is
non-trivial distribution so the
coalescence takes place somewhere in the
in the middle of the interval its native
close to the present nor close to the a
will the past you yes I can bide Onix
but well you asked for it so i will
write it down if you have early
complicated thing it is going to involve
this random verbs h of you is going to
be equal to 1 minus expectation of fear
when you you know when you remember is
going to be a geometric random variable
with parameter you and then so our fee
of j is going to involve expectation of
summation 1 to j @ i squared over
summation 1 to j inter I whole square
where yet I 1802 8rj are iid exponential
one random variables so the the formula
for H is not very simple it's a little
bit it comes from this point process
idea now notice that this quantity this
is an interesting problem in itself if
you take iid random variables X I BIID
so this is a problem
hmm maybe won't use a different thing
that 10 is too all right okay so I have
the cover here so here is a interesting
problem with xib iid random variables
say positive random variables then if
you look at 1 to N X I square the
numerator denominator is 1 to N X a
quantity squared the behavior of this
sequence was studied by number of people
in the lab for example long ago and
noticed that if the mean of if the
random variable to a finite second
moment the numerator is going to be like
n the denominator is going to be like N
squared so this whole thing will go to 0
but if x i's are have heavy tails if x
is supposing the domain of attraction of
a stable of water all for less than 1
then these two guys are going to be
roughly the same order of magnitude and
so they will not go to 0 but that kind
of a thing comes up here but then here
there's no problem because yet eyes are
going to be I ID at I are iid
exponential one random variables so
everything is going to be ok if this is
going to be dying at the most i decorate
like 1 over J and that's enough to make
this thing proper so in the super
critical case Collison six plays way
back in time in the critical case
coalescence take place neither close to
the event either the infinite past or
the present somewhere in the middle and
it turns out that the in the so-called
sub critical case sub critical case is
the following where m is less than 1 so
theorem 3
sub critical here m is less than 1
remember what M is M is the mean number
of children produced by per period and
it will resist that one the population
is dies out so the question is again you
have the condition so it turns out so
that is that exam the season 1 so
theorem then the probability X n 2 n
minus xn 2 is less than K conditioned on
that and positive so the coil ourselves
is very close to the present it is not
way back in time remember the index sub
critical case the number of individuals
are live at time n is going to be proper
going to a proper random variable that
will that so this converges to PI K and
for every K 1 less than or equal to K is
an infinity oh and then PI K goes to 1
as K goes to infinity so to summarize we
have the following situation so far if
the mean is greater than one and the
publish is not extinct Collison is going
to be way back in time if the mean is
one and the population is not extinct
then the coalescence is going to be very
cool somewhere in the middle roughly of
the order n times u where u is somewhere
between zero and one and if it is M is
less than one the coalescence is going
to be very close to the present so now I
want to consider one more case and that
is the explosive case and then I would
like to apply these arguments to what
are called branching random walks so
explosive case explosive cases when M is
infinity when each person produces
number of children random number of
children whose mean is infinity but then
it turns out that I need one more
hypothesis the probability so I own
this is in addition I have to assume
that summation pj j greater the next
this is the so-called tail probability
and it's going to go to 0 as X goes to
infinity but I wanted to go to 0
reasonably slowly it is equal to X to
the power minus alpha times a slowly
varying function that means what L of
see x over L of X goes to 1 as X goes to
infinity for every 0 less than C less
than infinity like log X would be a
slowly varying but any power of X will
not be slowly very square root of x will
not be slowly varying as X goes to
infinity and with alpha between 0 and 1
so that's my hypothesis about the
distribution of PJ if this is so then
one the probability that the coalescence
now and again i'm assuming p naught is 0
so they there is no extinction at all
possible and in this case again the
coalescence is very close to the present
X and less than K converges to pikin as
K goes to infinity in other words in the
rapidly growing population coalescence
takes place very close to the present in
reasonably growing population Collison
sector is very close to the beginning in
a critical case it's somewhere in the
middle in the subcritical case also is
close to the beginning now in the
explosive case something interesting
happens also
this is so here is a sidle result this
is due to PL Davis a danish dutch
mathematician and then david gray an
English mathematician and that's the
following so assume M is infinity and pj
belongs to the domain of attraction of a
stable of water / namely this condition
this is a necessary and sufficient
condition for repeat it to be in the
domain of attraction of a stable law
proved by feller if this is the case
then you take two individuals have them
produce branching independently of each
other then one of them will wipe out the
other so this as follows namely if you
look at the population size at the n
plus first generation that is equal to
summation c &amp;amp; j j equal to 12 is he
seven the population is made up of the
individuals produced by the people in
the nth generation now these random
variables are all independent
identically distributed conditionally
independent of ZN so it divided by 1
over Z n to the power 1 over alpha and x
ZN to the power 1 over alpha so take
logs on both sides logs en plus 1 is
called this quantity say we sub in for
the moment is equal to log VN plus 1
over alpha log z in so that in turn
suggests that alpha to the power oops
again I keep it outside Albert the power
n plus 1 times log z n will be equal to
alpha to the power n plus 1 times log BN
plus alpha to the power n Times log ZN
ZN plus 1 here and slugs here and i can
go down the line and then it will
essentially so the form alpha to the j
plus 1 log bj j equal to 0 to n so this
would suggest remember alpha is less
than 1 all four to the jay-z is
geometric sequence summation alpha to
the J converges Vijay's are identically
well we will converge in distribution to
something so it takes some more work to
show that this quantity converges and if
that is so so this is a theorem let me
write down as a theorem and the it is an
indication of the proof but it is not
really approve yet so theorem let PJ let
em be equal to infinity and summation pj
j greater than X be asymptotically X to
the power minus alpha times L of X else
slowly varying at infinity alpha between
0 and 1 if that is the case then all
four to the power n Times log z n
converges to a random variable say you
with probability 1 and the probability
that you equal to 0 is 0 u is a
continuous random variable which says
basically if you think like you know own
intuitive base is alpha to the N times
logs a ten its approximately like you if
that is the case logs en is
approximately like 1 over alpha to the
power n times u alpha is less than 1 1
over alpha is bigger than one call it
Rho equal to Rho to the power n times
you if that is the case the population
size Zn is like e to the U times Rho to
the n that means the population grows
unlike the Malthusian rate of growth it
is super exponential and the pop well we
know the offspring distribution has
doesn't have a finite mean so this is
not that much of a surprise but here is
the interesting thing supposing you
start one line of descent and I thought
one line of descent both of the same
distributions then Z and super one is
going to be like e to the U 1 times Rho
to the power n Z and super 2 is going to
be like e to the U two-time super it
you won and has a continuous
distribution so you one cannot be equal
to you too which means if I were to take
the ratio of these two guys is going to
be u 1 minus u 2 times Rho to the power
n later go to plus infinity or go to 0
so one will wipe out the other so which
may explain the fact why the color sense
is very close as a present if you take
two individuals very likely they are
coming from the you know same ancestor
that sort of proof that's an economist
proof not a mathematicians proof but
that's roughly the idea is so now so I
have described some basic results for
what's called coalescence coalescence in
this case is the problem of generations
that are meeting ok after some time now
I want to give an application of some of
these so you can see where to go in a
number of directions you can think about
what happens to a continuous-time
process what happens to to type
branching processes multi de branching
processes and so on lots of things so if
you have good students put them on but I
wanted go into going to write a
different direction and I want to talk
about is called branching random walks
ah this is the problem I should I kept
it outside for too long a keyboard ok
branching random walks so branching
renta what is a branching random walk
well it's a branching process plus a
random walk in post on it so you started
an ancestor at time zero and then this
answer sir has a random number of
children and this answer is located at
some site X X naught is a location of
this ancestor but this children
essentially migrated from where the
parent stays and go to a new place so
they go to X naught plus x 11 x naught
plus x 12 and then x naught plus x 1 c 1
the number of children ball to this
parent okay and then the children of
these children do the same thing they
migrated from where the parent lives to
a new place and so on so I if you look
at Zeta n is the actual position of all
the individuals in the end generation x
+ 1 xn to xn ZN so this is the position
the point process generated by the
positions of the certain individuals in
the nth generation question what is
going to happen to this in particular we
know well this question makes sense only
with let us assume that p naught is 0
and 1 is less than M less than infinity
for the moment consider that case and
now what will happen to this point
process as n goes to infinity there is
true source of randomness the tree
itself is random and then the jumping is
also random so we need to make some
assumptions about the jump distribution
and I already mentioned my assumptions
about the tree structure so let me not
be 0 let x 11 x 12 x 1 rc1 this random
vector well supposing i make a simple
assumption that they are all identically
distributed with mean 0 and then finite
variance so that is not such as well
where's essential otherwise let's
subtract of the mean and an expectation
of X 1 1 square equal to Sigma square is
finite so now the question is what is
going to happen to the empirical
distribution what is the distribution
that I am looking at 1 over n summation
indicator function of xn I
or equal to X i equal to 12 CM 01 / CF
that's what I'm looking at the
proportion of individuals whose out to
the left of X but I roughly know well
okay so here is the idea of analyzing
this think you have a large number of
individuals located all over the place
and you want to know what is going to
happen to the empirical distribution of
the point is it on the boundary line or
whatever space that you are now notice
if I pick two individuals at random from
this collection and trace their lines
back they're going to make way back in
time which means that they have lot of
time to evolve independently that means
that positions are going to be like an
ordinary random walk and they're
independent as per and therefore you
would look at the empirical distribution
namely this particular quantity so this
is a theorem under this hypothesis if
you look at number of individuals which
are over to the left of say sigma x
square root of y sorry sigma x y times
square root of n divided by the total
number of individuals this is the total
number of individuals this is the
proportion of individuals whose children
are the number in the end generation who
are located to the left of sigma x y x
call it event not surprisingly this will
converge to the normal standard normal
distribution function in problem in
probability as well as in mean square
and the reason for this is that if i
take two individuals at random and trays
that lines back they're going to meet
way back in time so essentially their
lines are any independently developed a
but yeah that is a little bit harder but
yeah it's almost surely so so this is
one or something and now you can also
there are some variations of this if you
don't want to assume finite second
moment but if they assume
these displacements are in the domain of
attraction of a stable law there is a
corresponding version of that could I
will not go into that so I will one last
rest of that I want to state is that
there is in what happens in the
explosive case so again take the
branching random walk p naught is 0 m is
infinity and summation pj r belongs to
the domain of attraction of a stable of
water alpha children all fathers and one
in this case notice what is happening if
you take two individuals at random from
this collection then their lines of
descent are going to be meet much sooner
very close to the present so they have a
lot of portion that are common and then
there's a small portion which is not
common and that's going to get wiped out
by the denominator so what happens is
this in this case this is a theorem ask
you again the techs expectation of X 11
is zero expectation of X 11 squared is
equal to Sigma squad is finite then if
you look at the number of individuals to
the left of Sigma Y times square root of
N and divide that by nzn consider this
stochastic process why so it index by
the parameter y over the whole real line
for each fixed why this converges to a
random variable so this is converging
time or going to claim this Delta Y
minus infinity less than oil is an
infinity where Delta Y is going to be
the indicator function of a standard
normal random variable does not equal to
Y where n is n 0 1
and then here I have to I I deliberately
left what in what sense do I mean by
this well this is this is a family of
random variables index by minus infinity
to plus infinity of why this converges
to this for every finite collection y 1
y 2 y que but then these processes live
in the skoura hot space minus infinity
plus infinity so it would be nice to
prove that this converges to take place
in this cohort apology as well but
finite dimensional convergence plus
tightness is required I have not been
able to prove tightness yet but I've
been able to prove the finite number
converges so this converges in
distribution to this Delta Y where Delta
Y is you go to the next room generate a
standard normal random variable bring it
here and then construct the trajectory
notice that if i give you the value n
the rejected is going to be 0 for a long
time and then jump up and then you're
going to stay at one so i have proved
this result they namely for finite damn
finite number of coordinates y 1 y 2 y
que the convergence in distribution
takes place but i would like to prove
that this is tight as well j have not
been able to prove this is the number of
particles that have moved less than
single have this explosive yeah in
reinstate also did you remember the
coalescence explains very close as a
present that means the DD T yeah so this
is brigette reproduce to the coalescence
happen close to the present that means
that much of the trajectory is how much
of the things i have a lot of things in
common only the last bit is going to be
different
alright so let me see what time do I
have 420 I'm supposed to stop now right
yeah well okay so let me where is the
original paper right Syria then there is
there are many many directions you can
go to for example one direction would be
what happens in the two type case of a
multi type case in the multi type case
you choose the two individuals at random
from the end public and the empty level
they could belong to two different types
and their answer could be a net another
type what would happen to these things
and then you can talk about what if
individuals live a random length of time
in other words continuous-time branching
processes and then there is a process
that my my another are three of my
brother's son he is a probability as
well and also in the indian instead of
Indian Statistical Institute in
bangalore and when shrikant I are we
vote on it and we considered the
following problem you have a branching
process and each individual has a
certain random length of life and during
their lifetime they move accordingly a
Markov process so this is a branching
random walk but branching Markov process
as it were and then again you look at
the distribution of the point process
generated and there are some results and
there we I did that paper was written
long before I did this work on
coalescence so we have only results with
a finite mean but the internet mean case
is open I mean a number of homes or open
i have listed a whole bunch of open
problems in that paper that I wrote for
the conference in Spain bought six
months ago so i can describe them to you
but that i will stop thank you very much
these papers of it yes okay welcome if I
know how to do that but I just on your
webpage yeah my son was able to find all
of them there you know I told him dick
he did something and then out sort of
all these papers but I don't know how to
do them myself but he may you have
copies of all my papers of no not yet
yeah you can download them so findable
online find it yeah actually yeah silly
in the last page of this there are
there's references and I can at least
write down the references so you can
take a look at by the way there is a
beautiful paper by llegale all it was
extension theory and random trees where
they also talked about the coalition's
problem and that appeared in this
statistics or stochastic process an
application and there is another paper
by Adrian Lambert coalescence times for
branching processes and annals of
applied probability and then kersting
Schwinns Burke and wacoal binger the
evolving beta coalition in an electronic
general public and then there's a bunch
of papers of mine so the references are
here all right okay okay it's thank you
