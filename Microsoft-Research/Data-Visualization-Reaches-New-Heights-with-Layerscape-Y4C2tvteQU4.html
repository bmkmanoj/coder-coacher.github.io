you know nobody has ever seen before and
you're like wow this is a big piece of
that great puzzle out there so I've been
handed a piece of the puzzle that makes
you want to go and look for more what I
love about the ocean is that we
understand it so poorly it's still in
the street we're exploring areas that
have never been explored before we're
doing new things with technology that
have never been done before it's what
drove humanity for much of our existence
we talked about it being the ocean
planet although we live on land and we
look out on that we say what's going on
underneath those waves and I think
that's what's really inspiring
important to understand a you these are
really opening a new window into the
ocean they're letting us become
permanent residents in a way of a place
which up to today we've really been only
very occasional visitors and tourists
when you begin to replace a human with a
robot making measurements and creating
digital data you start creating enormous
repositories of data so one of the
biggest problems for environmental
scientist is to break down that
incredibly complex system into solvable
problems that they can address in their
work layer escape is a tool that
scientists are using to visualize their
data particularly their data if it has a
spatial component and possibly fit as a
time component in the past the way we
visualize data was we created a plot we
printed it on a paper we put it on the
wall we thought about it what lay escape
lets us do is it lets us interact with
the data later scape helps us tell
stories we can put a data set in it and
we can play it like it's a movie and see
how the organisms change we're working
with Leon visualization of geothermal
datasets both wells that have been
drilled and then the temperature
profiles down those wells visualizing
that the thing that caught our attention
initially was the tour capability one of
the great things about layer scape is
that you can see the Earth's surface but
you can see into the earth as well and
you can fly down into the earth we
needed something like that to showcase
the data networking / building so we saw
the rollout of layer scape saw the tour
capability and immediately said that's
it we've been working with Rob and
others on the microsoft research team
now for a few years they asked us
questions about what should the software
do what capabilities would you like to
see in it and then bounce ideas back off
to us and give us a chance to play with
it we're also working with Lee Allison
on the Arizona Centennial and creating
stories that are told in the world wide
telescope around the state's history we
have 150 years of Earth
in an Excel spreadsheet and when we
brought layer skate back into the office
and showed it to our team here three
minutes later they had loaded all of
those earthquakes into layer scape and
we were doing timeline videos so it's
been really exciting
I think there are two big changes going
on in the ocean one is a process that we
call ocean acidification the other is a
warming of the ocean and a change in the
circulation addict as the world
undergoes climate change it's the
complexity of the data sets that little
individual sensors are some sense
looking at the ocean in many ways
through soda straws and trying to piece
that together to understand how is the
ocean behaving as an integrated system
layer scape offers the opportunity to
look at a whole range of variables and
overlay them in space and eventually in
time so you can see how these ocean
landscapes change and respond to forcing
in the environment
the more rapidly we can share data the
faster can be the pace of scientific
understanding and of innovation layer
scape begins to take this to a new level
we get these new tools to allow us to do
things and go places we've never been
before how can you not be excited about
that nobody goes to sea on a ship by
themselves not only do they have a crew
there are other scientists other
technicians who bring their talents to
bear on this very complicated system
collaboration is absolutely essential
one of the things that's really great
about the collaborations that I have is
that scientists are giving me their data
and your data is your stuff right that's
the stuff that your work is made of and
they're trusting me with their data so
when I get it back to them and I say
here's what I did in their eyes light up
that for me is the biggest thrill
because you know what I'm doing matters
to these guys they're doing that
