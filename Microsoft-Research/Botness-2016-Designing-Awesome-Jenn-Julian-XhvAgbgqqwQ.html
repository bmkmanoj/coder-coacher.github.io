of Philadelphia and in my town sports
mattered a lot especially basketball it
was a kind of town where our school gym
class teachers always let the basketball
section of the year go on for like twice
as long as all the other sports and
clearly the other sports were like not
anywhere near as important and I
remember being really young and just
realizing that man i really was not good
at playing basketball and i think i was
in gym class and like the third grade or
something just trying to shoot baskets
and just like maybe missing nine-tenths
of them and so it was really tough
because I practice that I tried really
hard but I just no matter what I did I
couldn't really get better at it and the
years went on and I continued trying and
failing at getting better at playing
basketball and it was the first day of
our middle school gym class and I had
just gotten chosen like pretty close to
last on our sports team for all the
various teams and those are the teams
that we would have to play with for the
rest of our gym class session and I felt
really crappy like you can imagine like
any John Hughes movie or something you
know getting chosen close to us in
middle school makes you feel not that
great and I came home and I remember my
dad was sitting in the kitchen he was
home early that day he was making a
sandwich and he could tell that I wasn't
feeling that great so he asked me what
was going on and I was just like well
you know and I told him like I basically
blew by shot of being like a cool middle
schooler this is not going to work out
for me I don't know what to do and
here's like look you know I'm going to
tell you a secret it doesn't really
matter that you're not good at playing
basketball you could be like basically
the worst player in the world and it
wouldn't matter because you have other
strengths and you just need to figure
out how to learn how to play to those
strengths and if you learn how to play
To Your Strengths and basketball won't
matter and so of course at the time I
probably responded with something like
oh you don't know you're talking about
you
no me or my life but of course in
hindsight his point was spot-on well
sometimes it can be really easy to focus
on the things that we want to improve we
also need to really remember the
importance of playing to our strengths
so hi I'm Jen I work as a designer for a
company called awesome we are working on
building tools to make it easier for
teams to communicate by letting
technology take some of the overhead off
of people's shoulders i joined awesome
earlier this year and i'm excited to
share a little bit about our design
thinking and the design process for one
of our features and because we knew we
wanted to focus early on on building
communication tools for teams we decided
that initially we wanted to build
something that focused on staying within
slack so we built a bot and it's called
awesome and it comes from a future where
technology works and service of people
but what does that mean exactly well our
starting point was to ask ourselves what
are we good at where do our strengths
lie as people and people are good at a
lot of stuff like conceptualizing
creating inspiring and then we asked
ourselves well what are BOTS good at and
bots are good at stuff like monitoring
routing aggregating classifying and
you'll see that a lot of our strengths
have to do with collaboration and
creation while BOTS drinks have to do
with things like organization and
classification and let's be honest
people are good at a lot of stuff we
didn't want to set out to build
technology that replaces people instead
we wanted to build technology that helps
take some of the annoying overhead off
of people's shoulders so they can get
back to doing the stuff that they really
care about doing we had to figure out
what bought strings are even so that we
could design tools to play for them to
play to design the tools to to play to
bot strings and it also doesn't hurt
that a lot of the things that BOTS
happen to be good at are often the
things that we as people find pretty
annoying so because of this we decided
we didn't want to build a people
and bought communication tool per se
instead awesome would be the facilitator
the generous teammate that helps take
some of those annoying tasks off of your
plate to help you get more out of slack
and awesome is the pine Naseem's
assistant that ensures that your show
goes off without a hitch so think
switchboard operator not the person on
the other end of the line and we looked
at things that bots are good at and we
started then tying those things to real
use cases we created a few features to
help round out our initial beta so the
first of these is called sidebars so
side bars are dedicated spaces in which
to you have focused discussions oh and I
had a gift there and I guess it's not
going to play so using our imagination
you can you can invite your team members
to to join your conversation you can set
a goal for the conversation and then
once you're finished also will help you
create a summary and then share that
summary out with the rest of your team
and again this is something that happens
all of these features are things that
happen inside of slack and next we
created a feature called work logs which
are a simple / command that help you let
your teammates know what you're working
on doesn't show on my screen ok let's
good to know so you can see an example
of where clogs here and finally
highlights let you annotate noteworthy
messages in real time in your feet as
important or questions decisions or just
plain awesome
so early one morning following or beta
launch I stumbled into the office to
chat with one of our users his team is
based in Europe so I had the pleasure of
speaking with him at around eight
million and I should probably mention
not a coffee person so you can also
safely assume that I am NOT a morning
person either but needless to say our
talk was going along as best as it could
for 8am when he suddenly said you know I
keep putting my updates in this thing
but when am I going to get something
back and that woke me up a bit more and
it struck me that awesome wasn't really
holding up its end of the bargain we had
successfully created a bunch of tools to
help people create an organized content
but where was it going off into the
great beyond somewhere we needed to
figure out a way to let people recall
their content so yes and because of the
real time and also somewhat ephemeral
nature of slack channels we wanted this
new feature to act more as a permanent
system of record for all of the content
that we were getting through awesome
slack head released its post feature a
while back so we figured why don't we
start with that as a way to aggregate
data it allowed us to keep all of our
content within the same location AKA on
the same platform and we could reference
other users and even better its
indexable content but for all of those
rational decisions aside on a
fundamental level it made sense because
now we'd finally close the loop on on
our content creation now all of these
features finally had a place to live so
we built our new feature and we called
it recaps recaps let you roll up all of
your team's sidebars wear clogs
highlights into a single post
to share them with innocent anyone
within the team could create a recap for
channel or for another user and when
they did so they'd see that previous
week's worth of content aggregated into
that post we decided to release recaps
initially to a small group of teams and
then open it up to all of our teams on
our beta which was still at that point
closed and then yes and so then in
addition to that than following to add
in new teams through our weightless
harvesting and we thought to ourselves
well this is going to be great we're
filling the other half of this content
transaction our users will be so happy
now that there's a clear purpose and a
goal for the content that they've been
creating and that back and we waited to
see how our users would respond and as
an aside that's just kidding of course
we're not sitting back we just shifted
focus to work on some other stuff but
that's not really relevant to this talk
so we're going to leave that out but
what happened next did awesome and our
equally awesome users right off into the
digital sunset together well kind of
when we first began thinking about use
cases for recaps one idea that came to
mind was the weekly reflection meeting
so wouldn't it be nice to be able to
generate a recap to help the team
quickly and easily see all of the week's
progress questions decisions another
idea was how to make progress reviews
for managers easier so now all you would
have to do is run a recap for your
direct reports and you'd have all of
their updates ready to go at your
fingertips and all of us on the team
liked the idea of tying recaps to these
real-life aspects of collaboration and I
know I wasn't fully expecting to see
some crazy up into the right mountain
peak action but I was at least hoping to
see some positive signs that our teams
had adopted this feature and we're using
it regularly but when the numbers
started coming in the first few weeks
after we shipped recaps we were faced
with a bunch of math and math is in yeah
a few of these teams are using
use but not nearly as many as we had
hoped and not as frequently as we had
hoped for either so our starting point
at this time was to take a closer look
at our numbers as well as our hypotheses
and since we weren't sure exactly
whether the low adoption numbers were
caused from the feature itself in the
design of the future or in the way in
which we introduced that feature to our
users we started first by trying to
simplify the way that we introduce
recaps to our teams now instead of
limiting the number of teams with access
we opened up recaps to all of the
current teams and on top of that we
called it out as a special like very
distinct feature within our new user
onboarding flow and next we looked at
the recaps themselves of the teams that
were using them we did see recurring
usage on a regular repeating basis often
this was just one or two times a week
which indicated that probably our weekly
reflection meeting use case was valid on
some level so going off of this
assumption we then asked ourselves ok so
what aspects of this could we further
automate and then that led to the
question of what would happen if we gave
people a better way to a more easier way
to schedule these recaps to recur on a
weekly basis to coincide with these
meetings so since it felt like a
relatively low-risk decision both from
an engineering and a design standpoint
we started to we decided to just go for
it we updated recaps and we allowed any
new user who signed up through the new
user onboarding flow at that point
forward to be able to schedule weekly
recaps and they could do this per
channel we then prompted all of the
teams to to schedule so again we called
it out very explicitly during our
onboarding
and in the weeks since releasing this
update we've been fortunate to see our
engagement numbers with our future
recaps increase and though we don't have
enough data yet to fully proved out this
hypotheses of ours we can at least say
with some confidence that baking in a
certain number of a certain level of
automation has definitely helped
increase that usage of our feature not
only with recaps but also just in
looking at the number of recurring teams
that were seeing week-over-week as well
and then where does this leave things
for awesome so we're continuing to
design things and tools allow us as
people to play to ours we're in a pretty
exciting place and I hope you'll keep
following on with our story as that
continues to unfold and because I know
this is kind of a lame conclusion I'm
going to be with this awesome gift tada
