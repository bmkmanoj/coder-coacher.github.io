conversational designer i started off in
computational linguistics however the
issue with this topic is that it's
 broad so are there any specific
topics or specific types of bought
interactions that you guys are
fascinated with like anything from
health education gaming ok so how do we
avoid reinventing the wheel is that
concise enough around conversation so
when I first started a kick essentially
we started looking at user inputs in
order to create an AI that would allow
us to classify all of this information
into relevant fields and answer them
properly now that was obviously a
reinvention of the wheel naturally but
in order to avoid doing this I mean we
are in a stage of tremendous
collaboration which is something that
I've noticed here a lot of the studies
and a lot of the learnings that we're
having should be shared so that would be
one way of avoiding that does that
adequately answer your question yeah
sure yeah right well now that since so
many of the platforms that are available
to create BOTS exist I would stress in
in my experience finding good creatives
now these are creatives that aren't
necessarily limited to just writing
stories but find people that are good
with improv find people that are good
with script writing and ensure that all
the conversations that you are creating
have the user in mind so yeah that would
be the that would be the ultimate
conclusion is fine great writers find
writers that really and truly give a
 about your audience so yeah does
that answer it a little bit absolutely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
