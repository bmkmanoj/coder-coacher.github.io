today the lane will present the metric
design principles she is a designer with
the Windows Phone design group and
she'll tell us all about what metro is
and how you can use it in your apps to
link you next
all right oh you do that I did not I
wish I could take credit um this is not
working the way I thought it was going
to wear how do I get out of this again
so as jivko said I'm Darlene Wong I'm a
designer with the windows phone design
studio and I'm going to talk to you guys
today about the Metro design story and
here you guys are all app developers
right you guys have all developed apps
how many of you have developed an app
that's on the marketplace today Chopin's
cool so I'm really excited because you
know I'm glad that you guys are here to
hear me talk about design for one so you
guys must all be really familiar with
the windows phone UI and what that looks
like you know tiles and lists and stuff
but there's there's a whole story behind
how we got there how we got from 6.5 to
seven and so with my talk tonight I'm
going to break it up into two parts
first I'm going to tell you the story
how we got to Windows Phone 7 how we
came up with the Metro design principles
I'm going to talk about what they are
and try to relate them to that story and
then we'll switch gears a little bit and
i'll talk more about the design language
and those are you know the actual
controls the motion and the parts of the
UI and i'll also try to connect that to
the principles so hopefully that gives
you a better understanding of how to use
them as you're developing your apps so
many of you may have heard of the reset
which happened a couple years ago with
Windows Phone and that was when we moved
from 6.5 to seven and if you remember
this is what 6.5 looked like
and you know it looks so different from
what we have today with metro and just
looking at it from a design perspective
I mean just it's a more iconographic
style of design and what that means
basically is using icons to represent
things in real life so looking at just
the bevel and the gradient and besides
all of that just you know like in your
contact list here using instead of
imagery to relate who this contact to
this person is we're using a little blue
3d man you know and that really doesn't
distinguish one contact from another and
then here in the home screen I guess
there's a little set of playing cards
that represent possibly games there's an
icon of a photo that represents you know
where your photos might live and you
know I never I've never used 6.5 so I'm
kind of just guessing and what this UI
how to use this UI and as you can tell
I'm struggling a little bit to to kind
of understand how to use it there's
nothing really wrong with this approach
but you know I think that the design
leads at the time recognize that there
was something missing here you know this
UI doesnt really communicate or say
anything to the user it's just you know
it's there and really for you know when
you take a look at some of the
embellishments that they've put on there
like this box around the date and time
on the lock screen I mean what does that
really accomplish what does that do
right it's it ends up just becoming
noise and blocking the user from saying
content that maybe they they're looking
for so this is oops this is albert Shum
he's our studio design lead and he was
one of the main voices and starting us
off thinking about metro so he
along with you know he wasn't the only
one we have many design leads
researchers designers a lot of really
great thinkers that came together to try
to point us in a new direction so you
know windows phone wasn't the only one
in the company at the time thinking
about good design there was windows
media center which I think was in the
mid 2000s and Bill flora worked on it
from here you you start to see just a
really open open clean design you start
to see open space bold use of typography
here large font and you know I
referenced earlier bevel and the
gradient and I know here that you do see
gradient but I feel that here it's feel
secondary and it doesn't block you from
really seeing anything instead this
larger this larger type really draws
your eye in and you know it says start
so obviously you're going to start there
and your I kind of moves to the right
with the horizontal navigation and then
as you pick your menu item you start
using the menu vertically so it's all
really clean simple structured and then
here with the music library you know I
think it's you could think of it like if
we did this the iconographic way you
could have come up with a representation
of them an album title he could have had
a picture of a CD in a CD cover kind of
peeking out and you could have listed
them down the page that might have
represented albums but here these are
the actual album titles album covers and
you can you can see them in a grid and
the grid kind of helps put a lot of
information in a small smaller space and
I know it's a subtle difference you know
going from just an icon to the actual
album cover but I feel like that subtle
difference
is a really big one it really gets the
user to look at this UI in a different
way and think about interacting with it
in a different way then we have the zune
music experience again you start to you
see the clean of you see the clean
layout the use of grid but what I found
interesting here was down in this corner
that we recommend to me this is where we
really started talking directly to the
user right we we said hey you know we
know you you've from what you've
listened to in the past we think that
you might like this and we're starting
to really connect with the user and
something that they care about the music
that they're listening to and then the
zune HD music player what I feel is
probably a stepping stone you know
getting to that mobile UI so we moved
you can see the the huge difference
between the more iconographic style of
design to the more info graphic and
infographic what we're used to today not
just change the design look and feel
overall but I think that it really
changed the way we thought about the
experience that the user was having we
thought more about who they were and
what was important to them we thought
about what their journey was as they
were using the phone and a lot of times
when I talk about the you I think you
know it's it looks so simple right you
maybe just make a title in a larger
oversized font maybe you just put some
images in a grid but there's a lot more
to that you know it seems effortless but
there's a lot of work and thought that
went behind that went into the thinking
behind this design and to get everyone
on the same page of this new way of
design thinking we came up with a
to Metro design principles we we think
of these principles kind of as a golden
rule not hard and fast rules but more
like a guiding light more like a
direction that guides us towards
creating enjoyable and meaningful
experiences so this is a poster that we
have hanging up in our design studio and
it basically states the five principles
which have highlighted in red and I'll
go over them so the first modern and
clean sometimes we call this clean light
open and fast and basically this means
to just clean up the clutter include
only what's necessary so like the
examples I just showed you know take
advantage of that negative space open
space is ok I think that it helps the
user focus their I in on the actual
content and what is really important and
you know take a look at your existing
designs too and try to strip away what
is not needed if you can free your
design from clutter the design starts to
feel lighter and if you focus to your
users attention in on that message the
user can more easily move through the
experience and they can get to their
task faster alive in motion so motion is
you know it's delightful it's fun and
motion a lot of the motion in our device
actually teaches the user something it
actually guides the user to how to use
the UI take for example panoramas and
how those animate in as they animate and
you see the full image you see the list
passing by really briefly and it's
really quick and subtle but when it
lands it lands on the leftmost side of
the pan oh and you can see the text kind
of trail off and truncate off the side
of the device you screen and that kind
of
the user a hint that there's more you
know there's more to the right look here
look discover if you pan over you can
find it and it's kind of fun you know
that sense of discovery and also think
about the lock screen that that little
bounce it kind of alludes to you know if
you just swipe this up we you can find
something you can unlock your phone and
all all of this is instruction without
words it's all just with subtle motion
cues and it kind of makes the user feel
smart right you haven't told them
anything yet they figured it out and so
you know it's pretty delightful content
you hear this may be a lot content not
chrome and again this refers to you know
cleaning up some of that bevel and that
gradient it's not to say that you can't
use it but maybe thinking about how you
use it thinking about where it makes
sense to use it because if if it's a
little too gratuitous you know if it's
all over the place sometimes it just
blocks the real intent from what the
users trying to get to and then
celebrate typography so typography can
be useful and and beautiful it's it's a
way to it's a way to organize your
content like if you think about it most
types of content is text right like this
poster for example it's all text but
it's using text in a smart way it's very
visual you know especially it can create
that hierarchy of start where to start
how in how you want the user to move
through the content what's most
important and then finally authentic
this one you know sometimes you hear it
being called authentically digital and I
think this is just another way of saying
you know we're a digital space a lot of
times with being more iconographic where
you're trying to represent the world
no in a digital space but you're trying
to represent the real world we get lost
in trying to just copy what's in the
railroad versus being authentically what
we are which is a digital environment
and there's got to be a better way you
know other ways of moving through the
digital space something that makes sense
for the digital environment so these are
our principles and it's interesting to
know that Metro is actually inspired by
wayfinding signs wayfinding signs in you
know airports subways and metro systems
hence the name metro and wayfinding
signage actually has its roots in the
Swiss style of design also known as the
International style of design and
there's a whole history you know I think
back in the 1950s and it can go even
further back to the 1930s but back in
the 1950s there was a whole history of
designers started with the Swiss but
then became more of an international
movement that they centered on the
thought that design could be simple yet
functional it could swiss-style can be
defined as the authentic pursuit for
simplicity and it's devoted to minimal
elements like typography and content as
opposed to textures and the gradients
and illustrations it's a fierce
reduction of elements much like our
principles I just thought this this
quote kind of embodied it perfectly you
know as you're designing you know it's
not really you know how do I design this
app what else do I put on a lot of times
it's just stripping things away and the
simplest thing which is just the content
or just the message is really all you
need so you might be asking
yourself what do wayfinding signs have
to do with the phone you I like how do
those two things relate well I think it
you know it's the Swiss style is a way
to communicate to a really broad
audience in a clear and concise way
regardless of language for example if
you're in an airport you need to get to
you're about to miss your next flight
and you need to get to your next gate
right away without clear signage you
could possibly miss your next flight and
the same thing goes with the phone you
know if you're you're rushing to your
next meeting and you don't know where
the meetings at you may not be able to
to get there as quickly so these are
just some examples of wayfinding signs
and just some examples of how it
embodies the swiss swiss design what you
can see here is you know the use of
color for organization here with the
subway map you can see use of bold
typography here to indicate a direction
where this subway is heading and the
swiss style also talks about this grid
system and the grid system i feel really
provides that structure so that you know
you can snap to a grid and they're still
feels like there's organization without
necessarily having you know to
explicitly give organization these are
some like real examples of Swiss design
the Olympics I logo for example this is
interesting because there could have
been so many ways for them to design
this logo I mean it could have been a
bunch of athletes you know standing
together in a circle it could have been
and people holding hands it could have
been a bunch of different flags you know
from different countries but instead of
all of that they decided to go more
abstract it's just a plain white
background bold graphic circles that are
interlinked and I think that you know
you can pull a lot of meaning just from
these simple shapes and colors it's
still to me represents the joining of
something and indifference there's
different colors so I think it's pretty
successful this is some examples of
brochures from the 72 German Olympics
again really bold use of color and big
typography but you can also see use of
the grid here where all of these
paragraphs are left aligned to the
bottom of the two and it's super subtle
I don't know that a lot of people
actually pick that out but just that
simple alignment really gives a koranda
structure to the content and again you
know with the Olympics use of metaphors
to speak without words these are some
some icons that were created to
represent the different events so it's
really easy to see you know what you
know what event do I want to see
gymnastics swimming running and you will
you know you don't have to know whatever
language you know the host country you
can tell just by looking at the image
and again wayfinding signs you know it's
really easy no matter where you are to
find the bathroom I mean that's probably
like the number one looked for sign
right and another reason we pulled
inspiration from the Swiss style is just
that it's timeless you can still see
evidence of Swiss style today even
though it's you know been around for 50
plus years movie movie posters use it
advertisements packaging
posters and none of this feels dated
right still feels fresh and new so with
all of that said what does this really
mean right we talked about all the
inspiration and wayfinding and this is a
picture here of a guy who is clearly not
connected to his experience it's not
enjoying moment he's in he's stepped
trying to do something on its phone and
so on top of all the principles you know
basically what we're trying to say is
these principles are like the foundation
but what really makes our phone
different and we believe we believe it's
the end user and the end users
experience in that's what really infuses
that life into the UI we want to know
what their story is we want to know what
they care about and we want to really
connect with them so next I'm going to
show you a video it's a little bit dated
you might be able to tell but it's of
albert chemin he is talking about this
personal relevant connected being
personal to the user giving them the
information that that is you know
relevant are most useful to them and
connecting them to those experiences
when I came to Microsoft that I looked
at wow this was a candy store we have so
much amazing technology you have a great
music experience if you have great
gaming experiences we have great female
experiences and how do you bring that
all together for a user in a simple
seamless way I think that's really
speaks to the power of Windows Phone now
we're saying we're going to connect all
this for you you don't have to think
about it how do I bring that to our
users presents you a way to navigate but
a also a way to interact with the things
that you care about and that's really
that the new fresh start that we're
bringing to Windows Phone it's really
stepping back and saying what I really
want it and what our consumers really
want and I think that would that was a
really difficult since they say hey if
we could do anything what can we do and
looking at you know there's a lot of
ideas about hey how do you make
smartphone smarter and how do you make
make it you know run faster bear
graphics but you know in some ways
that's really not what users waiting for
they just want a better experience and
we really said hey let's think about
that what do people really want in their
lives and we really key off on those
kind of thinking and start building kind
of what we start saying you know our
design philosophy or making a connection
of our users and bringing those insights
to the design and really working with
the engineering team to say hey what if
we could do this and how would we build
this I think that was a really great
opportunity I'll how Microsoft because
we have this great amazing technology
and I think bringing some insights with
design we can really harness potential
of creating a whole new phone experience
for our users windows phone what is it
about what makes Windows Phone Windows
Phone and not so penis I think of some a
couple really key things that we thought
about we really thought about the
end-users king now what is really
important I think that hopefully you'll
see that it's really authentic that we
really talk to you wheel users out there
and we spend a lot of time talking to
our user not just a listen to what they
do but also saying hey we have this idea
what do you think so really driving some
of those insights but also making the
design come to life for them
and listening to how to use it but also
improving design I think that process of
iterating and refining and building I
think that's a really really speaks to
the craft and care and passion we put
into the product so that the authentic
cell phone has come soon hey we have to
take design not just as a as a way to
make it look appealing but I think we
got it free about making it desirable
it's always that balance when you do
something new you also have to ground it
in something that people can understand
what would our users see first I think
hopefully they'll see themselves in the
phone I think that's a really key part
of how we design it it's really focus on
making this phone your phone we took the
idea of making it personal so that when
you look at it the start experience it's
about your content it's about your
people it's your pictures it's your
music it's presented way up there and
it's my phone it can be different than
your phone and I think that's a really
key part that personalized way of
navigating the things that you care
about the things that you want to share
the things that you want to listen to it
and then and really I think those are
the key moments of the worries first
present it's your phone yeah I don't
know what that is oh how do I get it off
okay sorry about that that was pretty
scary
going then okay we're back alright so
that was the design principle so
hopefully you learned about you know
where the principles came from what they
are now we're going to talk a little bit
more about the design language and this
is you know actually going through the
controls and sorry so here on the left
you can see these are the principles
right and really like I was saying
earlier it's the foundation it's not
meant to bind you in any way as you're
developing apps it's really meant to
just create that solid base for which
you can then spring off of and use all
of these elements on the right the
navigation the touch gestures themes and
all of that and really use that to
create an app that's unique to you so
first off this is our navigation model
it's a hub and spoke model and what that
means is that we we always start at the
start screen at the hub and take you off
on your merry way down your task
linearly when you're done you always go
back to start before you start a new
task and we think this works because you
know going back to the wayfinding
example it's really about knowing your
way around right so if you were again in
an airport and you see a sign that says
gate a is this way and you're walking
this way you expect gate a to be at the
end of wherever you're going and then
eventually you come to a cross section
and it says gate a is back where you
came from you'd be pretty frustrated
right and you'd be lost so you know I
think that that's why this works it's
it's just an easy way for people to know
where they are at any point in time
gives them control over where they are
and then the page structure you know
again if you've developed apps before
you probably pretty familiar with this
but status bar up at the top with the
time and status of the phone battery
life
connection and all that the application
space is actually the entire middle and
then the application bar at the bottom
which you know can expand and minimize
this again just shows the canvas and
that the canvas extends beyond the
screen limits and that's done
purposefully to really create a sense of
space an open sense of space and then
the grid you know we talked about this
with the with a Swiss style of design
right having that grid really keep keep
you organized and this is this is our
grid but you you can see that it's not
restricting in any way you can actually
break this up into any number of
different ways it's really very flexible
and if you take some examples of real
you I like our Start screen and overlay
the grid on top of that you start to see
how it really does snap to this grid and
then you take another screen in our UI
the app list it still snaps to the same
grid and the people it it just kind of
shows you that all of these screens they
look so different yet they're still
rooted in the same in the same grid
structure and and you're not limited to
two any one type of design and then
orientation what I just wanted to stay
here about orientation is just that you
know there's portrait and landscape and
as you're developing your apps you don't
really have to you don't always have to
use both orientations there's sometimes
where your app may just work better and
just one orientation that's fine to just
leave it that way for example are our
Start screen you know it only works in
portrait mode and because that's the way
it looks best it's presented best
alternatively another way you could
think about it is the calculator app if
you use it in portrait mode it's a
simple calculator if you turn it
horizontally one way I think it's a
scientific calculator
and I to realize this but actually if
you flip it and turn it horizontal the
other way it's a third type of
calculator so it's kind of neat how you
can actually use orientation to change
up the way a user would use your
application and then again typography we
used to go and to go is you know it's a
default font you get it when you
download the toolkit it's a sans serif
font meaning it's clean line there's no
curls or embellishments and it's created
specifically for use on the device
screen so it looks best both with a
light background on a dark background
and you know it's not to say that you
can only use this this font you can
definitely use you can even use a serif
font you know the curlier more
decorative type of font and I have some
examples I think the New York Times and
DC comics are two great examples of apps
that successfully use serif fonts it's
just more of thinking about what makes
sense for your app and just not using it
in a way that'll make sense you know
something that's not too over-the-top
keeping it subtle but still using it as
a way to bring that personality into
your app and emotion you know again with
all the motion it's besides being really
interesting pretty it's like i said
earlier used to communicate something
and most of these are available in the
toolkit but you know like turnstile here
it's used to go between large spaces so
jumping from task to task or app to app
continuum this is once you're in you're
in an area like email and you're
drilling down so then you drill down to
the list and then are the animations
actually playing our
they not they're not playing they're
supposed to play I'm sorry about that
you want me to switch back to the
four-point what I didn't we switch we
did to see a video there's some motion
on these slides you just switch to
powerpoint down on the bottom i'll have
it here
here we go facing slideshow know how do
I exit out
it's not on the right slide yeah you can
pray ask what right place like you want
there we go there so yeah it's turnstile
I'm going into apps continuum drilling
in like an email drilling into the
actual email and swivel this is kind of
more a transient so where you just need
to tell the user something quickly and
then leave and then a slide this is I
you know mostly used in wizard type
scenarios just to get from screen to
screen and then of course there's always
custom animations and here you know this
shows some custom animation I think it's
best to try to get some help from
someone who's experienced with motion
design with when creating custom motion
but you know it is possible and just
again thinking about what makes sense
with your app what would be something
that would enhance the users experience
while they're using your app and still
concentrate mainly on the content and
iconography these are icons this is just
you know really small set we've got
hundreds of metaphors that we've created
and these are all icons that are
associated with some kind of action they
all mean something and say something to
the user imagery and photos definitely
you know it's it's part of the Swiss
style designed to use photos / / images
/ drawings and illustrations so
definitely you know photos really bring
a sense of life and a sense of space
like here and the Start screen really
makes you feel like you're starting off
you know on a golf game and just the
only thing to think about to though as
you use photography is just
to remember that that it's used in a way
that enhances so like this one the
people are here on the right and it
leaves this nice kind of dark open space
so that the text is still readable so
that's why this works right you've got
this nice you know big image which is
interesting to the user but it doesn't
block them from what they're trying to
the menu that they're trying to use and
then panoramas in pivot so panoramas
with this you know we kind of recommend
that there's no more than three to five
panels on this panorama just you know
thinking about this is really more of a
place for people to navigate I guess you
could think of it like a magazine cover
right so usually there's a really big
picture in the background and each of
the panels kind of represent that little
blurb or that little tidbit that teases
you into the app a try it just tries to
get you interested just enough without
telling you everything and then you
would then dive in for more so panorama
should only be used in portrait view and
you can see how we just try to minimize
all the distractions so like the system
tray at the tops gone the at bars
minimized and yeah these are just more
examples of other apps that and how they
use panos and then pivots which is very
similar and just to give you an idea of
the difference if a panorama is like the
magazine cover I sort of think of pivots
as the table of contents it's much more
about the content and about the task
what you're trying to do with this app
with pivots you know maybe no more than
seven
you just really think about the
navigation and how your user is going to
get around your app and here it's okay i
mean you the the app bar is a lot more
visible stuff like that we're not we're
not trying to focus the user in on
anything specific here except that
they're navigating through your app and
finally tiles so tiles are what we feel
really differentiate us the look of our
phone from from other phones it's very
unique to Windows Phone there's a lot of
functionality that can go behind the
tile so you know there's live tiles and
with your apps you can use a live tile
to your advantage to surface things that
you think the user might need to know so
for example if you I'm sure you've seen
these apps but like news apps might
surface the latest headline a weather
app might show the temperature for a
certain location maybe a shopping app
could show the latest sales it's really
up to you what you want to surface to
the user and they can be really
customizable to I mean you can you can
really bring it to life with your your
logo if you want it to be customizable
to the users theme you know there are
ways to do that so that's basically
everything I wanted to tell you about
you know story of wayfinding how the
design principles and kind of going over
some of the design language but just as
a little extra I thought maybe it would
be helpful to go over some app examples
some real apps that
we feel are designed well we could maybe
talk about why we think that they're
designed well and point out what they
what they do so here we have Amazon
Kindle just curious what do you guys
think like what of this you I do you
think is Metro it's got its got the grid
right it's got the list and you know
logo right up in the corner it does but
at the same time it's also very amazon
it's it's really got their their
personality in there and you know it's
the use of this this image here it's a
really recognizable image in the
background here for Kindle right but
it's not taking up the entire screen
it's kind of in the background it's kind
of off centered but you know that it's
there and it's just a really simple you
I just you know book covers as the way
to navigate it's a good balance I think
of both Metro design and of Amazon's
personality and here's the example I was
telling you earlier about DC Comics and
their use of the serif font so their
logo is this very recognizable font
they've used it here again in the titles
which is which is good but again you
know it's it's not gratuitous they've
they've only used it they're down here
in this part of the list it's they use
to go and everything's just very clean
and simple the logo is small
it feels very appropriate for the type
of app that it is with Evernote here
again like so this is where you know
they're starting to go a little off I
think from exactly what is Metro right
so they've got this really bold start or
a splash screen where it's very it's
very obvious you know this is evernotes
their logo it's sign in then when you go
in going from this really loud splash
screen they go to a really small logo
here and then everything under here is
basically lists and stuff but they've
they've customized their buttons and
they have customized the color in their
list they've done a few things a little
different but it really says Evernote
the color is very recognizable no that's
so it's still successful you know it
still works with ESPN again there were
it's basically pivot but there's a
couple of small things that really
differentiate this and make it
specifically ESPN one is the ticker down
at the bottom here which is you know
obviously that that's not something that
we do with the phone UI but it's
something they add it in because it made
sense for them and then also the design
of the score boxes where there's an
outline around it I know we've said a
lot of times you know strip out all the
things that you don't need but in this
case this did feel right this did feel
like it was something that was needed
in New York Times this is the other
example of a serif font it works here I
think you know it's a really simple
layout for for the newspaper just it
looks like a very simplified version of
their their website right all of their
text is a a serif font but it feels
appropriate for a newspaper they've got
their breaking news up here at the top
in the use of their logo as the pano
headline and then final example is the
bank of america app and then again you
know i think this is my favorite just
because it kind of really goes off of
the Metro design principles as we've
stated earlier like there's the sub
gradient here and none of these lists
styles are really are Metro the styles
but what's nice about it is that you
still feel like there's some hint of
Metro here right it's still clean it's
still really simple and pared down but
it's a bank gap and it's okay to be to
be what they are which is you know they
have to show you this if they're they
have a lot of information to show you
know and so they're going to surface it
to you and so I guess if there's any
message that you take away from this
whole talk is that the Metro design
principles really are just a set of
guidelines and it's something that you
think about as you're you're developing
it's definitely something that you try
to stick close to but it's not hard and
fast and its really up for your
interpretation how how is best for your
app to be designed so I hope this is
really helpful for you and thank you for
letting me present to you
I can do a fear should we welcome any
questions you guys have any questions we
thought that was big afterwards but
we're not good no I think we can do them
after okay okay let's stop the
presentation move talk at this point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
