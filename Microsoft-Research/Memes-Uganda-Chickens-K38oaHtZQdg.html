hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
we are so excited to open up SCS 13 this
year with our under the radar stories to
insights into action session and in our
session we don't even know what a tal
que is because we just tell stories and
I but first I have to say that it's
really awesome that every year as he has
opens up or less I don't know since I've
been last year they always open up with
a drinks night where it's in the dark so
I feel like this is always the morning
after we were like did we talk like last
night was that was that you and I have
to say the best line of the two lines of
the night where when stevie nicks said
you know have you seen my new algorithm
on social and i was like i haven't so
much tom lehrer mcconnell say why don't
you show us Stephen and then but Belinda
Thurston came in and then said well at
least I did aerial yoga and you'll find
out during my panel so those are the two
best lines of the night if that's what
you missed but here we are under the
radar from stories to insights to action
and I want we wanted to bring all these
people together because over the last
few decades you know the public private
and nonprofit sectors have started to
look into the tools and approaches of
ethnography and what is ethnography it's
like you know this touchy cultural stuff
you know it's always a difficult
definition so instead of actually trying
to tell you what ethnography is we
wanted to show you what it is and one of
the core things that f nog refers do is
that we gather stories because without
the stories we can't get to good
insights and finally you know the action
for whatever it is with development to
develop a good service or product or
deployment or advocacy or intervention
but still you know it's actually
interesting the idea of actually getting
context-specific insights is still
really new like even in the US it's
still really really new to be like hey
what are users doing let's go in on the
ground and understand their practices
first before you know a full deployment
so one of the things that I'm though
companies are having two are starting to
realize and also the private and public
sector is that especially as you expand
into new markets or regions
um you know to reach these you know
communities that we're calling under the
radar is that we actually have to work
even a lot harder to understand their
you know culture beliefs because you
can't go as much on intuition because
sometimes intuition does work really
well but sometimes it doesn't so that's
why we wanted to bring together this
amazing storytellers for you today who
are have been working all around the
world you know for the last 10 years
trying to understand users practices on
the ground we're going to start first
with on shell Mina who I call on and on
Chow is a artist and designer and she
and I actually met in China when we
first became internet friends and while
we were both doing fieldwork we were
both doing kind of some sensitive stuff
and we'd always would be texting each
other in Spanish so that the sensor is
you know we're like they're not going to
understand this language so on Shah has
been studying means for a long time
she's been doing this work in the US and
in China and Philippines and all over
Africa and I call her the Kenyatta
cheese of global memes this a lot of
people understand and she is going to be
speaking at a three-letter word
conference and edinborough this June
about global memes and so you should
definitely ask her about that and she's
starting a new website called the Civic
beat but in the meantime let's hear a
story from mon chou about some chickens
and goats in uganda good Thank You
Trisha thank you so much for having me
here apologize my first time presenting
some of this emerging research so I'll
be referring to notes but being in this
space actually reminds me of my first
week in Uganda actually my spoke at ma
Carrera university and Victoria
University how many of you have been to
Uganda so you might be somewhere where
those universities the flagship
universities and academic spaces that
were quite familiar to me in the US and
in Asia but on my way there I have you
know i was living in a little
neighborhood in Kampala i had to cross a
dirt road i was crossing chickens and
goats and at the time it was just my
first week I was just learning learning
the ropes of the country but I was
actually coming across something that
would actually give me insight into
internet culture around the world so at
ma career in Victoria I spoke about what
like to speak about with such internet
memes and in China and in places where
is limited political expression
afterward a number of youth came up to
me and they wanted to talk to me about
internet memes so I said okay I schedule
some time with them afterward and I
wanted to introduce them to some of the
American memes so I talked to them about
law cats and I'd shalt loll cats to
people in China Philippines and they had
laughed they found it funny they didn't
understand the grammar of it but cats
were funny to them but when I show them
their ego when I showed them pictures of
cute cats I'm in Uganda people just kind
of stared at me blankly and i was like
huh this is not funny to guys i was
showing him north special aired grumpy
cat i was showing them a long cat but it
just wasn't funny to them and so i said
okay i guess this just not a thing here
but over time I started adding people on
facebook i started talking to some humor
researchers urban legend Kampala is one
of my favorite humor sites in Uganda and
I realized that the funny animals are
choice over there are chickens goats and
often cows chickens often take the kind
of the first place and they're kind of
like the lolcat you might call him a
lull chicken and kind of emerging as as
a practice of for sharing for sharing
femurs images and I realized it's
because well you're passing chickens
you're passing goats all the time I
didn't really see many cats in Uganda
and so the cute animal the funny animal
of choice became these creatures and
then as I started to look at internet
culture more in Uganda I started to
realize that internet cultures reflect
local cultures the visual vernacular of
internet culture you can see here you
can kind of understand that these are
internet jokes you might call them memes
you might just call them internet comics
or humor the visual vernacular is is
kind of more or less the same but the
actual content is is very particular to
a local culture even if yu gardens are
using Facebook and speaking in English
the actual culture of what they find
funny reflects reflects their daily life
styles and so over time many of these
jokes started to become funny to me but
only after I was spending six seven
weeks in Uganda and understanding the
lifestyle there and so in ethan
Zuckerman is cute cat theory which is
quite influence so much of my thinking
about about internet culture one of the
first premises is that the web two point
O tools exist for sharing pictures of
cute cats and of course by this he means
any any kind of Monday and activity from
cute cats pornography but if that theory
had been written in Uganda you might
have called it the cute chicken theory
because what people find cute is if
people find like to share cute things on
the internet but what people actually
find cute is actually very particular to
the culture and to the space and and
also as I'm starting to look more
closely at memes in Uganda and starting
to see what's emerging there you know
what's really fascinating that Uganda
has it's an emerging internet culture
about thirteen percent of the population
is using the Internet at least once a
month so that's about four million
people but even within their you're
seeing a lot of commonalities between
what's happening in China what's
happening in Philippines where
individuals have limited political and
social expression are using the norms
and and practices of internet humor to
talk about often very serious difficult
issues whether it's Civic infrastructure
or political corruption and so I'm going
back in in two weeks back to Uganda i'll
be looking more closely at this and
we'll be blogging about it and i'd love
to engage in more dialogue and as they
say in a Lagonda which is the local like
one of the local languages in uganda
we're blessed so thank you
Thank You on chels</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
