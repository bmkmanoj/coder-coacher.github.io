about the International Women's
hackathon so much is that we know we
need diverse teams to make the latest
and greatest technologies and there are
so many challenges in our society today
that we need to solve and we're only
going to be able to solve them if we
have a diversity of thought diversity of
experience and diversity from different
regions and locations so the more women
around the world we get into computer
science the better we're going to create
solutions that will solve the hardest
problems this year we're excited to have
two amazing NGOs who have very impactful
challenges so the first is teens against
distracted driving we've seen how
texting while driving has killed many
people and we need to stop that behavior
I started the organization teens against
distracted driving with the goal of
educating teenagers about the dangers of
driving while using their mobile phones
that if i can just affect one life if I
can save one life stop one person from
texting and getting in an accident that
I'm doing my job and so I'm hoping that
by partnering with the international
women's hackathon that we can really
expand that region instead of just
saving one life we can save thousands or
millions of lives one of the things that
people don't realize is that it takes
the average person about 4.3 seconds
studies have shown to engage in sending
or receiving a text message if you're
going just 25 30 miles an hour say
you're on a residential street that's
about a hundred feet that you would
travel without seeing what's in front of
you when you amp that up to highway
speeds say 60 miles an hour 4.3 seconds
you actually go the distance of end zone
to end zone in a football stadium
without seeing where
you're going I believe that technology
just like it's caused the problem has
also got to create the solution the
obvious solution is to do something to
the mobile device however that's just
one Avenue that you can go down there
are several avenues and I would be
really interested in seeing some sort of
creative social media game type of
application that has the ability to go
viral that could the market group about
the dangers of texting while driving the
second challenge is with UN Women and
what they're looking at is how do we
empower women around the world and we
know that stem and careers in stem are
the way to do it and so we're asking
young women to figure out ways to get
young women all around the world to get
excited about stem understand stem and
what can we do so that all women can
unleash their full potential and do
amazing things across the world UN Women
is the organization within the UN system
that is responsible for promoting gender
equality and women's empowerment we work
with governments to implement their
commitments and to advance global
standards and women's rights advancing
women's empowerment is the cornerstone
of the development agenda but incredibly
important in all countries worldwide and
girls and women's engagement in stem is
at the cornerstone of their ability to
shape their daily lives and critically
important their future yet we have a lot
more work to do when it comes to
ensuring that stem meets the specific
and concrete needs of women in girls and
that they're entering this sector and
much greater numbers and then rising
into decision-making positions within
sectors I would go online and look at
the free tools out there to help you
prepare there's great tools on helping
you learn about storyboarding and also
mobile programming and then lastly I
would just go have fun and talk to lots
of girls on campus girls that maybe not
in computer science to show them why
computer science and hackathons could be
cool because anybody could be an
inventor if you put your heart to it
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
