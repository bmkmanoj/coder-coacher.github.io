hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
all right first up is Tania come on down
usability and console gaming shed i was
hoping not to be first so yeah i talked
earlier but this is just a quick thing
of my credentials I do hold the stem
degree in human computer interaction and
user centered design so this is a great
interest to me and I like to I like
things to work and work very quickly and
very easily because i am lazy when it
comes to technology i want to press one
button for things to work that is not
the case with the kinect or with the
xbox and kinect so i talked about this
I'm not reading the slide at you because
I have five minutes and I already talked
to you fast as it is but that's why I
want to talk about these things so I
will move on so I am one of those folks
that got a xbox one very recently you
know post them getting rid of the kinect
bundle and one thing that I noticed was
that without voice commands or without
the connectivity voice commands it's
actually very difficult and
time-consuming to do basic functions
like take a screenshot start to twitch
stream things like that so as someone
who's interested in usability it annoyed
me to no end because you know I freely
admit it I had a ps4 at launch I took a
day off to go get this thing and so I
got spoiled by one button press
functionality and when the xbox one
didn't have that similar functionality
it made me irritated and I I kind of
fussed online a little bit and fussed in
my inner circle about it well these are
just some things that I noticed that you
can do with the Kinect and without a
connect i blatantly stole a screenshot
from kotaku from some article they had
it comparing xbox one and ps4 user
interfaces so who here has an xbox one
who has one with a connect
who has one without a connect besides me
who has just connect you know the other
thing that I didn't like is that if you
had a connect on the 360 it doesn't work
with the xbox one she had to shell out
another 150 bucks or hundred bucks to
have a connect to work with your new
five-hundred-dollar system or 400
depending on when you bought it so again
this is my personal experience if others
disagree feel free to find me we can
chat about it but I found the UI very
confusing to use very counterintuitive
because it was just like here's a bunch
of tiles hears things you can do but no
clear way to manipulate those tiles and
kind of put things the way I like them
supposedly a new UI is coming out or
came out late in the fall and if it did
come out I either don't understand the
xbox you I well enough or it just is
still confusing even after the changes
the other reason I am not that
interested in it connect is because I
literally don't have the space for it it
does require some room to get the most
out of games that are connected abled
and the Xbox one elite controller gives
a lot more functionality to you but you
shouldn't have to pay double the cost of
what a standard controller costs which
is already 60 bucks for a peripheral
which is ridiculous to get functionality
that should be standard in my totally
not so humble opinion so this is the
case for me where user friendly design
comes at a higher cost and I'm not
spending 129 a controller I don't care
what it does but to me this is another
usability issue where to get that
functionality you have to spend even
more money so these are just
considerations I thought thought about
as as a better usability well the main
thing is if you turn your xbox you set
it up and there's no connect give me
other UI functions give me other options
to to map the buttons so this is just
something I thought about and since
we're at a Microsoft sponsored event if
someone is here from xbox I will happily
talk to you and I if you want to give me
a job about this I will take it
I have no shame but you know things like
one button press because right now
without a connect I have to double tap a
button and hit the home button and hope
I get screenshot I want which is really
ridiculous and then I have to go back
into the game I'm playing to save that
screenshot accessing your friends list
it is one button press sort of but it's
a long button press you have to get out
of the menu that you're already and
twitch is a pain in the ass like it
literally took me a month to figure out
how to stream on twitch from the xbox
because of the snap function everything
else and it should be hey one button
twitch opens therefore we go to stream
and trying to navigate between the store
and everything else is kind of a pain
because you have to kind of browse and
then even when you get to like the game
area you still can't just go I want new
games I want what's on sale so a better
navigation would be greatly helped Wow
and I had a typo that shows you how
quickly i put this slide together so
allowing users to reshuffle their UI
layout when you're logged in on your
computer and have it sink kind of like
when you change things with your iPhone
and in itunes and then when you turn on
your xbox it then syncs to your
preferences instead of trying to figure
it out on the menu on the fly so those
are just some things I thought about
that at least for me make my xbox
experience better I don't know how
quickly i spoke if we have any time for
a question we're done okay thank you
okay hi my name is Katie Davis I'm an
assistant professor at the University of
Washington in the information school and
I study the role of network technologies
and different aspects of teens lives and
recently I guess it was about two months
ago I was introduced to this concept of
a finsta Graham does anyone have a
finsta Graham probably not if you're
because I don't think there are any
teenagers in here but I found it really
interesting and I found a way to
incorporate it into recent book chapter
I wrote about teens and emerging adults
and their online identities I found it
particularly interesting because a lot
of the work that I've done in the last
couple of years that I've written about
in a book i recently published with
howard gardner called the app generation
is this idea of a package self so the
idea that teens when they're going
online they feel especially in online
platforms where like Facebook where you
kind of have to give your real identity
and they feel this real pressure to be
perfect and attractive and get a lot of
likes on all their pictures so we talked
about this in our book and I've heard a
lot about from talking to teens about
this pressure to be perfect online I
think a really good example of that
maybe some of you read this article in I
think it came out in September about
this girl in New York lily hymowitz the
called the prom queen of Instagram and
just how carefully she curates her
Instagram feet she has posted thousands
of pictures on Instagram but she
actually only has a few hundred on it
now because she constantly is going
through and just weeding out ones that
she doesn't find are totally perfect
some of you hasn't did anyone hear this
This American Life called status update
is on mate I think the round
Thanksgiving it's really interesting the
beginning of this program listening to
13 year olds talk about how carefully
they choose the photos that and just one
really good photo a day of what they're
going to post on Instagram and then
seconds later they're monitoring how
many likes they've got in and what sort
of responses they've got it and when I
when I hear things like this and when I
talk to teens I think wow that's
exhausting that just takes a lot of time
and energy and just nerves you know is
this a good picture of me do I look good
and so when I read about this new trend
of instagrams I was really interested
because I'm always interested in how
teens are kind of taking the
technologies they have and then making
them work for them and what they need
and so with if you're not familiar if
you didn't read this article if you're
not familiar with this idea of Instagram
basically there are a lot of young
people right now are creating fake
Instagram accounts but they're not
really fake they're just closed accounts
sort of their kind of in stealth mode
where they're only friends with their
close friends they use different names
and they kind of keep them very closed
and they can kind of in that space break
free from the constraints of that their
typical Instagram so they can kind of
post more than one picture every day and
they can post ugly selfies and they can
post goofy things about themselves so
there's they're creating this more the
freer space on Instagram which is this
platform where they're typically
supposed to be perfect and so this is
another example this model australian
model acenta O'Neill she has recently
gone through her pictures on Instagram
and and changed the captions to what
really was going on so this one is kind
of saying how she was what she was
thinking like please like this photo I
put on makeup curled my hair did all
this stuff just so that you would like
this things that we don't really usually
here we just see the output and the
perfect part so it's just something I
think is really interesting and there
are a bunch more examples of where she's
taking these beautiful shots of herself
and said things like you know I didn't
eat for days just to get myself looking
like this and it's kind of refreshing
kind of putting casting a new light on
what's going on behind the scenes so
when I think about trends like this
and I'm what I'm seeing happening is
teens are creating spaces for themselves
online where they're deliberately being
imperfect and they're really kind of
calling out the pressure they feel
they're pushing back against this
pressure to be perfect online and so I'm
thinking that instead of or maybe in
addition to asking how is technology
affecting teens development which is
something that I focus a lot on maybe we
should also be asking how are teens
shaping or reshaping technology to meet
their developmental needs sorry okay the
five minutes gotta move okay you see
these images they're incongruous images
weird and everything your job is caption
contest is to make something funny out
of them you had me at Olay I'm afraid I
can't discuss my other patients your
last drop sounds terrible have a hammer
I'd say you wanted an earlier flight hey
where do you see yourself in five
thousand years okay The New Yorker was
confronted with the idea of a caption
contest in 2005 honestly all the other
caption contests are this is the ER
contest everything else sort of comes
one's giving the imprimatur The New
Yorker so the width thing was for a
stodgy magazine like The New Yorker how
do you have one every week actually have
to have a contest you enter a contest
you vote on and a winner so it's a whole
five week process before the reveal
happens and you finally see which one
wins so here was okay let's hope for
some nut allergies oh yeah everybody
like that except of course people who
have nut allergies so the New York is a
really sensitive sensitive magazine if
you do a cartoon where you say a woman
is talking to another woman and she's
saying they've only been gluten-free for
a week but I'm already annoying you get
more letters on that then okay so tooth
out that we have all these entries two
thousand six million entries 503 winners
weekly average ER is that your chance of
winning is that okay you'd have if you
enter deaf
every single week your chance of winning
just by chance by the year twenty twenty
Vic's would be twenty percent and you
would seriously should to think about
your priorities if you spent that much
time at The New Yorker contest which
many people do okay Roger Ebert one
after a hundred and seven entries
actually people have entered 450 times
he won with this cap caption I'm not
going to say the word I'm thinking of
which of course was which we never
happened the new yorker in a in a
cartoon because a children okay so Peter
McGraw and feel for amber cognitive
scientists say that we're going to
figure out the contest we're going to
find out the rules that will help you
win the contest and what they came in up
with was okay you know the contest more
novel it's likely to make the shortlist
of captions punctuation less capture a
shin don't yell cut fewer words and more
abstract so you can't imagine what was
in the picture well were they right well
look at this look at this cartoon here
objection your honor alleged killer
whale here all the captions there are
all the captions that came in that were
basically that caption so when you look
at novelty the truth is people don't
like novelty and you me they like a
little novelty in a cocoon of
familiarity like the thing that they
could have thought of that's the most
popular so generally if you actually
look at all the things what you really
need is to be funny okay that actually
that act see this is just short of the
footprint of humor it really has nothing
to do with humor itself okay I work at
Microsoft where Eric Horvath and Daphne
shahaf and we try to make this a little
better what we did was we use sort of
linguistic analysis to cluster the
similar caption and we looked at various
factors in which we also ahead amazon
turkish look at both the image and ray
captions and we came up with prediction
of 64% which is lousy sixty-four percent
which is the ground truth of what humans
would do so back to humans okay that's
my human that's Colin Stokes he looks at
all five to ten thousand captions
that every cat come in every week he
breaks them down into these categories I
take these categories and I send them to
the editors at The New Yorker using
SurveyMonkey they rate the categories
and then I pick the one I like that's
not true oh you really go with them okay
that's not the greatest system what I've
done recently is i'm using this this
system by data scientists at the
university of wisconsin so I'm opening
it up actually to everybody who ever one
or who is finalists in the contest so
what happens there is now you I'm what
I'm doing is crowdsourcing not only the
the user but crowdsourcing the other
side and when you get there is actually
pretty good ratings okay and what we
will be doing actually on the new yorker
site what will we be doing is will be
opening up the contest in general in
this way to everybody at The New Yorker
site okay but if none of these what if
none of these work for you remember
there's always the universal caption
Christ would an asshole what a
misunderstanding and I'd like you to
join my professional network on link to
the other thing to remember is sometimes
the very best caption is the simplest it
sort of makes you stop and think doesn't
it I hope I have made you stop and think
a little
okay I didn't get a lot of feedback
about which of the topics I should speak
on so I took that as a challenge we're
gonna do five graybles here in five
minutes um there we go all right so what
you're looking at here is a neural
network oh you couldn't get the image
well you would have seen it dreaming
about faces what did we do with this
about eight years ago I built this along
with website called sexy face and the
idea was the neural network understands
faces and perceptions of them so well
well I could even slow down that we you
answer a couple questions about which
faces you think are sexy and then we can
crawl through all of facebook and find
all the faces that you would think are
sexy for free and for five dollars will
find all the people that think you're
sexy um but the reality was that it was
a Trojan horse for a UN project called
refugees United the system learned how
to understand faces so they could
reunite orphan refugees of which there
are about a million with extended family
members and I'm on to the next one um
this is the first and perhaps only
presidential portrait taken with Google
glass which I did at the White House at
the first or second pride White House
celebration and when he heard that there
was some crazy woman with like blue
fluorescent headgear on he just had to
meet me also the Secret Service wanted
to kick me out so um so he came and
chatted with me the real reason is that
the reason I'm wearing it you'll find
out in the next slide the reason he's
there is because his smile is kind of
ambiguous I can tell you when he was
looking at me he wasn't smiling he was
shaking his head and just looking
totally disgusted and so we built a
system for go class based on work at my
old undergraduate lab to do real-time
facial expression recognition and give
them to autistic kids so they can learn
how to read facial expressions through
natural interactions day to day
throughout their lives instead of with
cartoons on flashcards
it was actually the most interesting
thing is Facebook just won a bidding war
with Google over my lab turn startup
which did facial expression recognition
on the last Republican debate and okay
this kid is scientifically proven to be
the cutest kid in the whole world a poll
of two scientists came to that
conclusion by coincidences other mom and
I and Felix is my son was diagnosed with
diabetes for years ago slightly more
than that the worst Thanksgiving ever
and the reason I were Google glass is
because when we got out of the hospital
and we started collecting an enormous
amount of data I mean we crashed Google
Docs the spreadsheet with all the data
we collected we brought it back in for a
first visit with the doctor and she got
angry that we were wasting her time and
I thought this is crazy you think
diabetes is complicated try the brain so
we built a system called jitterbug that
actively predicted we had to hack all of
his devices continuous glucose Fitbit
everything a little Python code old
Android phone send it off to my personal
server where it literally predict about
an hour into the future whether his blue
glucose levels will go higher low and it
was sending to me on my google glass
which is where I got a message that he
would go low an hour from now while I
was in the White House and he was in San
Francisco Medtronic just released a new
technology four years later at 10
million dollars in development that does
the exact same thing um this is jose's
amaura he claimed he was he wrote a blog
post that went viral about how he was
sending out 100 resumes a week and
getting no responses so he replaces his
the s's in his name with nothing and
suddenly Joe Zamora is getting all these
responses so us a news report calls me
up says this is plausible I start
quoting a thousand research papers it
says it's more than plausible but i also
thought I have a database that one of my
last companies 122 million people why
don't I go look and see what's different
between every actual Joe and every
actual Jose because I've only got three
seconds left here the punch line is we
computed something called the tax on
being different and the tax for being
Jose was half a million to a million
dollars in the tech end
three just paid up front through a
fancier education all those sorts of
things he needed to get for the same
work to be valued the same level and and
finally LGBT this is really new research
that I haven't shown anywhere before but
we looked at the migration patterns of
LGBT entrepreneurs and we found that if
you take them into account even
accounting for how entrepreneurs tend to
migrate toward San Francisco New York
Seattle and other places that in the
heads of these entrepreneurs are
migrating millions of jobs so the story
that you want business-friendly
pro-growth states like Texas no more
jobs migrate out of them in the heads of
entrepreneurs particularly for
marginalized groups than ever go back as
data center and call center jobs and
that's it thank you very much Thank You
Vivian Latoya alright so how many of you
haven't actually been on vine excellent
how many of you understand what makes a
good vine video kind of okay let's go
over this very very quickly because the
first thing I realized while doing this
is that it is impossible to explain what
I won't explain in five minutes there's
gonna be a bunch of time so I'm like
yeah we'll talk about that later I'm
sorry so the easiest way to explain vine
is blue thing called Kanye's pen all
right so I'm going to select I'm going
to slow it down for a second and we're
gonna watch it again all the vines I'll
play at least twice because they go very
very fast so vine is a remix culture
that's the first thing you should know
about it its people layering jokes
underneath other memes underneath other
jokes underneath other references so
Kanye spin is actually one the concept
right you click the pen for kanye song
called click right you see kids doing
very popular dances while they're
clicking his pen and then they spliced
together a video of Kanye West who's
freaking out the paparazzi goin stop it
all y'all stop it so once again Kanye
spin
okay so this is the anatomy of vine this
is what makes vine run okay this idea
that we can layer together these
experiences these jokes conversation
about our identity and remix it together
until almost this new cultural way of
talking that is very very very well used
among teenagers they also use cultural
works that you see in other forms of
media and so also if you're so if you're
not familiar with a joke read the
caption the caption here is when you get
a little health in a video game and some
 kills you okay that is what
this is based on and so it's a way that
people are culturally expressing
themselves it's a way that people are
using language and for me as a person
who runs a blog about race and pop
culture's been following it be
particularly the race and memes and race
on the internet vine has become a
fascinating to study about how teenagers
are talking about race and identity so
vine is kind of used to both challenge
and reinforce stereotypes because of you
don't even need the sound for that one
but I'll turn it on to hear
and there's a lot of ways that
particularly young black teenagers are
playing with their identity online and
what people expect to see from them
versus what they expect from themselves
I'm including things that used to be so
geeky that it was you be called white
now are just parts of the overall
experience and this one again is another
complex joke listen to it here second
letter ok area Delta colitis is from a
spelling bee where are these kids
watching spelling bees and why are they
always on every part of the internet
anyway from a big spelling bee mistake
that went viral and so err DOTA colitis
was like all over people were doing
remixes of it like it was ridiculous it
was on vine for like 2 20 weeks so once
again the harry potter send up we got a
lot of this is also meta commentary on
your own identity or the way that other
people perceive you in this queue park
video know what you're talking about you
know asian guy looks like that hahaha
you Matt yo so Mike you know asian guy
looks like that hahaha you Matt no just
don't like you so there's also other
points where Q comes out on top i want
to put one of those in we don't have
time um other ones too are about like
other people's playing with their
perception of who you are and your own
identity we're getting a gender in a
second you guys for this year this
better
there's a lot of a lot of playing around
the bounds of identity and particularly
like kind of cross-cultural mistakes are
kind of the bread and butter of racial
humor on vine particularly this one
again from Hugh do nikka nikka the
caption and this is I'm never seeing
Korean music again caption neega means
you in Korean he's actually and then
when a vine is popular a lot of times
the Viners will do three or four
versions of the same joke just in
different kind of scenarios there's like
four or five of these and this is also
king back so kingbach is actually he got
the cover of New York magazine late last
year as being one of most popular viners
of all time right and so he's made it
into TV he's transitioned over and he
does a lot of particularly race-based
humor around stereotypes in
african-american ask you Larry how are
you to fight until I've been doing this
evening us wonder if you like Dave
Matthews I was no don't give me oh no
caption on this is what they hear when
we talk and so automatically to on vine
just like on you know what we now call
black Twitter you start seeing a
shifting of who the intended audiences
and who the general speaker or default
user is right it's no longer necessarily
a whiteness and have a whole page in
like the long version it's about kind of
hip-hop culture as a lingua franca even
long white kids it's like a whole thing
we don't have time so we're going to
that later alright gender performance on
vine it's also very complex I didn't
have time to go into it it's just said
so fine suffice it to say female Viners
under more pressure than actually their
male counterparts and so it's very rare
to see a female Viner without some kind
of sexualized video in order to stay
popular they have to almost in some way
show off their bodies men don't quite
have those same requirements there's a
lot of other types of masculine
performance but this is just happened to
be very cute when I don't the turn on
the sound for this you know it it's
Victor that there you go but vine
influences popular culture in a way that
a lot of places are overlooking right
how many people know with the shamani
dances oh are you kidding okay sorry I
didn't even put the video in else like
this many nights are so old and now I
have to go back and
and edit this anyway so there was an
artist by the name of bobby schmurder
that rose to fame I will turn this down
in a second so you can see it that rose
to fame because he had this ridiculous
music video and he does a very
distinctive Vance in the middle right
and it was commented on it was
reproduced Rihanna has a version of it
when she's on Instagram there's a bunch
of people doing it and it even made it
to the NFL but where does it no sorry
change the interface in the video some
like what anyway so the Nene the whip
things that you guys have probably seen
on Ellen started on vine right and they
started we normally kids of color doing
it and making it extremely extremely
popular I'm not gonna talk about the day
anyway we don't have time but we can
talk about hit that Super Mario which is
one of my favorite vines of all time
that's it or not we me but about for the
great white flag off the flow Nene will
kick in that elbow so there's actually a
minute and a half long version of this
on youtube where there for them are
dancing there's another version of it
that they've done for various places but
it became popular once a lot of vine
women on vine started dancing to this
video became a viral sensation it was
written up in billboard but
unfortunately the cultural creator
there's Caleb arrays who made the dance
and Eugene the dream who did the beat
neither them actually got any money off
of this because it's not their
copyrighted material remember vine is a
remix culture and the way that our
intellectual property rights at our
copyright works means that these
creators generally can access this if
they even are allowed to keep producing
these types of things at all alright and
so why talk about that part of this
right well Tonya yes 10 0 seconds okay
time to remind me about this idea of
like black cultural property being
co-opted but it's a little bit more than
that right it says idea that vine kind
of wants to be something else so even as
these black creators and these young
creators are making these things that
are making vine super super popular
what's happening is vine is choosing to
st. know we're really not about that
we're not about any of
things privileging like creator voices
over black creator voices and generally
showing that they'd rather be a
stop-motion animation platform then the
thing that is actually being currently
popular which q bark actually that's the
end thank you
so the question I'm looking at is did
your face evolve to lie and the reason
I'm interested in this is that I'm
working on a book about honesty and
deception and it's a book that starts
with an evolutionary view point that
there really has been throughout history
not just our history but all animals and
even plants and arguably even things
like yeast a arms race between honesty
and deception because if you think about
it it's almost always profitable to lie
if you can get away with it to say that
you're better stronger faster than you
actually are but if all communication
was lies there wouldn't actually be any
communication and so from this
evolutionary perspective there's this
arms race between the signal or who may
want to say that they're better than
they are and the recipient who wants to
demand something honest and so one of
the questions is what about our face
which we tend to think of as the sort of
point we look at when we try and figure
out whether we believe someone is did
our face evolve to reveal emotion or to
you know to reveal our feelings or to be
completely under our control wait
thought just get something sorry this is
there we go okay so culturally we tend
to not think that lying is a very good
idea and there have been a variety of
philosophers most famously Conte who
basically said you should not lie he's
famous for basically saying if there's a
murderer at your door and he's after
someone in your house and he asks you is
this person there you should tell him
because maybe he'll go you know that
there's some other bad effects can
follow on more recently sam Harris is a
contemporary philosopher whose come out
with a book called lying that basically
says around the same thing that in some
way that all kinds of bad things will
happen if you lie where they could
happen but that you could just simplify
your life by just constantly telling the
truth and that I think is a fairly naive
you about the world
but our views about the world in general
do tend to be naive if you think about
how we think about where you get two
faces a minute don't I didn't forget how
we think about language for instance
there's something that linguists call
the conduit metaphor when people think
about how communication works it's like
I have a thought in my head and what I
am doing and it lectures kind of work
this way a little bit but you're still
trying to figure out if I'm reliable
enough I should if I'm interesting
enough and knowledge of a lot that you
should believe me so it's not quite that
I take these ideas and go and they land
in your head sort of pure and as they
came from mind but our very language
itself uses the metaphor of like a
conduit to think about how it works you
know you say things like she got her
ideas across to him or your note
conveyed happiness it's about flow the
reason that these conceptions about
lying and conversation are important for
technologies and when we design things
we tend to design them with these goals
in mind that the ideal world is one
where nobody lies and the ideal world is
one in which when people communicate
it's just totally straightforward and I
think from a very engineering
perspective and I spent a long time at
MIT so I've been around a lot of
Engineers and i am one there tends to be
this goal of efficiency and that what we
should be doing is to the extent the
communication doesn't work like this or
that people can prevaricate that the
goal of if you're trying to do social
good with technology is to make it so
that people can't lie and the
communication become much more
straightforward if you think that life
is more complicated than that it's
really important to understand why in a
somewhat counterintuitive way you might
want to defend lying and unclear
communication so one of this is there's
a this was actually a picture from a
like nine minute compilation of
Christmas present fails of videos that
but being in a hurry I wasn't able to
embed very an amp that so you just have
this little screen shopping go to
youtube and watch it it's a little slow
but it's like all these pictures of kids
getting presents that
didn't like and their reactions to them
and if you think about the what you know
for for those of you who've been around
small children one of the things you
know one of the most important things we
do when kids are like old enough to
start like dealing with other people is
if we teach them to lie we teach them
you know you don't say I really hated
this when someone gives you a present
you say yes to a lot of things you want
to say no to you don't stare at that
like interesting person with one arm
over there you don't say ooh when they
walk by you know they're just like
you're constantly teaching kids not to
say what they're thinking so even know
so even from a common sense level if you
start thinking about it if everyone was
like that toddler who is just bursting
out all the time saying what you think
all of civilization would fall apart
immediately we would have no more
society so if to be very careful of
people who are trying to invent worlds
in which that is happening so but from
the the facial expression studies one of
the most influential do I is that I
actually gonna have that little time
left or is that not moving okay oh oh
yes we don't know where we are here ok I
will go fast ok I will go fast so ekman
was very influential and still is in
terms of facial expression what he's
famous for is both work on the
universality of faces that they're very
very innate but he's seat and he's a lot
about lie detection and the idea that
your face kind of emotion is just the
outpouring of emotion that the way you
feel comes out in your face and it shows
that we can do all these things to
detect what people are really thinking
that is a fairly problematic view and
one of the arguments against it when you
go quickly here is the one that says in
the source of vocabulary of evolutionary
theorists obligate communication it's
like a cat so obligate carnivores they
just have to eat meat so obligate
communication of information would often
not be in the interest of the organism
in other words if you
that things do not including your own
face should not have evolved to get you
in trouble that doesn't make
evolutionary sense it's supposed to eat
you things generally evolve for the
benefit of it if making you know if you
would be getting into trouble all the
time by telling the truth your face is
not going to evolve to make it
impossible for you to have control over
it so this is actually a fairly heated
debate in the world of evolutionary
theory and exactly how the face evolved
but it basically seems that it's kind of
fallen and ain't no as common sense
would tell you in the space where
there's a lot of immediate communication
that's very very fast but that what's
interesting is the extent to which we do
have control over faces over expression
and what are the times when we don't
that it looks like most of it has
evolved for cooperative communication
but with enough control to deal with non
cooperative communication which is very
important to recognize in this era of an
increasing number this is a fairly
primitive one this is a at home USB
polygraph which is marketed partly as a
child's game and but if you look at some
of the other marketing materials it
looks like you can have an angry spouse
holding you down and lie detecting you
in which they will probably find out
that you're upset but they probably knew
that anyway but what on a more
sophisticated level than this there is
an increasing amount of work in
biosensing etc as social interfaces and
seeing you know there's a lot there's
work now and saying you know even with
your camera phone you can see blushing
that's invisible to the human to the
human eye and that gives you a much
better sense of what someone's
underlying emotions we're moving into an
era where we actually are going to be
able to see more of the non
communicative emotional response of each
of others and so understanding much
better how our face is evolved over an
enormous amount of time to enable the
type of sociability we have now is
really important for understanding
how we want to deal with emotion and
interfaces thank you hi I'm Annie L dash
I have no slides you're welcome miss my
slides would be terrible never read the
comments don't read the comments how
many people have heard somebody say that
seeing somebody tweet that at you like
everybody right I'm a person who has
left comments I'm a commenter I've been
a personal comment and I've made comment
boxes that people can type in for many
many years and in fact one of the first
times I was in this room was about
almost a decade ago and the clay shirky
had had a class with some of the
students we were talking about oh well
we we built it was very actually very
interesting an elaborate web application
they said and we put a standard comment
box under it and the example they used
was from a tool called movable type that
I used to build that was a comment box
and it was only a few years past when we
made it and that one of these sort of
brilliant students here would just sort
of described as that's how comment boxes
work at the time I thought it was really
exciting we made the standard we made
the default it wasn't that great
actually as it turns out the assumptions
of how we built those technologies in
2001-2002 when a lot of people were
building a lot of early comment boxes
and social media we're actually probably
the same assumptions that date back to
the earliest social apps on what would
become the Internet in general right so
if you put something in this fridge here
in this sort of academic environment and
you put your post-it note on it you
write your name you say this is my
sandwich there's really no verification
about that posted note because it
doesn't need to be because the context
is known and the stakes are low well I
mean sandwiches are great but the stakes
are pretty low and what happens out on
the web is the first sort of generations
of software we're kind of in a really
similar context the places you were
responding to what people were saying
were a fridge and
academic context and it was okay and we
were building the tools thinking the
internet still worked that way and it's
funny because the counter examples were
already countless and obvious right
email was already getting spammed
because they never had real
authentication a real identity or real
accountability or real persistence built
into it and even though the examples
were so obvious we didn't fix it and I i
still am astounded by that because it's
like I said it's obvious in retrospect
but what was clear was how good it could
be so we built those tools and likes of
the early days of blogging is like two
thousand to two thousand three or four i
got married in 2005 and the majority of
the people who attended my wedding or
people i met in the comments on my blog
don't read the comments so i have a
visceral deep and emotional objection
when we say that the state of affairs
today should be that it's normal to say
don't read the comments there are a lot
of reasons as we've heard in a couple
conversations today language really
matters if we describe things as as
trolling as opposed to abuse and we take
it out of the realm of being a crime and
into sort of sounding like an annoyance
things change language matters a lot and
i can go deeper into that but what I
think about more is I live very close by
in the neighborhood and in Alphabet City
and have lived there for most of the
last 20 years and invariably when I
moved there for the first time it was
described as a bad neighborhood right
it's not a bad neighborhood it never was
but the things that people use to
describe it as a bad neighborhood
especially are not true today it is
significantly less violent crime
significantly less chance of random
people being victimized by any range of
threats or dangers and so even if we
accepted that it once was a bad
neighborhood those things shoes have
been
but if it were to be consigned as that
the nature of the place is that it's a
bad neighborhood there would be very
little impetus or incentive to fix it
and today when I hear and I know there's
the joking sort of reflexive cynicism
that we all have when we're very very
fluent and technology and media worms I
never read the comments or full assholes
and there's a very legitimate part which
is about self-care which is if you write
a piece and people are flaming you and
attacking you and hounding you and going
after you with all kinds of abuse then
obviously you don't need to subject
yourself to it and you should choose not
to if that's what you need to do to take
care of yourself but the broader
conversation I think we end up with is
when we say never read the comments
don't read the comments we're accepting
that the natural state of affairs is
that our conversation our dialogue
online is going to result in abuse
especially the underrepresented folks
and marginalized folks and all the usual
groups you would expect to be targeted
and that's actually I think that's
pretty comprehensible I think that's
something people understand is oh yeah
we shouldn't write that off we shouldn't
dismiss it but also i actually have been
saying this for years and i wrote about
a lot of times like if your website's
full of assholes it's actually your
fault you've caused that to happen and
you should be held accountable for it
and there's a really big leap that i
don't understand why we don't make when
we say you know let's take youtube where
the comments are sort of notoriously
awful maybe they're getting better i
don't really know because i don't look
at them because don't read the comments
but this is a company that i think that
i might be getting the details run but i
think google alphabet is like we want to
put a driverless car on the moon right
leg last vaguely in their ambitions and
they have people working on that with
infinite resources and they're like
we're going to do that and then over
here you say could you just not have
open threats of violence on a YouTube
clip that's about making a sandwich
right and they're like I that's too hard
there is no way we have all the smartest
people in the world but that is a bridge
too far and I what if you had more money
than almost any institution in the
history of humanity
could you do it then it's like well we
do have that but we're still working on
it and I think there's a question
prioritization and it was a question of
what matters but some part of the
culpability so I'm part of the reason it
seems intractable as because we all
participate in saying we'll just don't
look there don't look in the comments of
course there's as pool and this is true
on Twitter this is draw out in every
network I'm not singling anybody out
it's true on tools that I built you know
I have been harassed and doxxed by
people using software i created that
sucks it sucks and part of me wants to
say well don't read the comments because
then it's not my fault but I made the
tools and if I'd have thought about it
for another couple days months maybe
years I would have realized where it was
going I would have realized what we
empowered but I didn't a lot of us
didn't and that's where I want to kind
of get to the last point which is the
biggest reason I don't want us to
abdicate our shared responsibility and
then I don't want us to refrain from
holding these companies accountable is
the upside like I said the majority of
the people that were with me on the day
I got married I met through the comments
like the potential people I still work
with or you know create projects with or
am inspired by and connected with in a
meaningful life time way we're
responding to these ideas and if I
couldn't look in there if I couldn't
look at that box down there and see what
people say the loss to my life would be
unfathomable like I wouldn't have any of
the things that I care about I wouldn't
have met my wife I wouldn't have my
child like I wouldn't have everything I
hold most dear and that's that's the
motivation right that is the reason I
think we can actually just reclaim this
thing that was in a very idealistic era
the best thing about the Internet the
thing that we wanted the thing we were
promised was it was going to bring us
closer together we were going to find
tribe you're going to find our people
whatever you remember remember the
rhetoric and the night he's like
whatever your interest is that other
person that's into it you're going to
find them it was true for a moment for
some of us it can be true at scale for a
lot of people all it takes is actually
paying attention some investment some
amount of innovation and invention and
all of us collectively to say yes we
probably should read the comments thank
you okay so I'm gonna go fast like I'm
on crystal meth so just follow I like to
begin with okcupid hello my friend
Franklin who isn't into internet dating
came across your profile through my
account and he's been all over me about
getting in touch with you he said you
seem like a beautiful woman and who has
found balance in all aspects of life did
you do I didn't tell him I was going to
contact you but if you write him at this
address he will send you a picture first
question was this a scam probably second
more interesting question how desperate
was I to find love and how much personal
risk would there be for me if I actually
took this opportunity I call this the
Powerball question the firt the third
question was a something I came to later
which is what if the risk actually
wasn't mine but somebody else's for
instance what if somebody wanted to ruin
some guy's life and they contacted me
asking me to send something to an email
address for him and then told the guys
wife that women were writing him and
then she checked the mail and you get
the rest so welcome to my life which is
something I'm talking about in a book
called strange intimacy touching social
media which I've already been told as a
gross title
I was originally going to call this book
strange familiars I liked that name
because it was an inversion of stanley
milgram's term familiar strangers
familiar strangers are people who
recognize each other by face but because
they physically come in contact each day
but they don't know much more about each
other than that by contrast strange
familiars are people who touch us or
whom we touch but whom we've not yet
physically encountered and I mean
touching two senses here emotionally as
in that was touching and also skin based
especially when we talk about the
physical repercussions of having strange
familiars like stalking assault the
kinds of things we've been talking about
today notice that I'm using the word
familiar with a noun here the way they
used to do it in Middle English like you
would call your familiars your servants
or household members or other family
members with whom you were intimate as a
noun the term familiar reminds us the
intimacy takes a range of forms it can
be sexual it can be an exercise in trust
or risk it can reflect differing beliefs
about attachment and detachment but no
matter what we use the word intimate to
signify a significant relation at the
level of the body the intimacy I'm
interested in for this particular book
is the kind that feels of the body but
is in fact over distance it's a sort of
intimacy that leads people to debate
whether certain online practices are
empowering or traumatizing or both of
these traditional media theories speak
about this type of intimacy in their
different ways cinema people talk about
it through the power of the gays
television theories talk about the
glance Malcolm Gladwell had a little bit
to say about glance in his book blink
and all of these work in part for what
I'm trying to get at but they don't get
it all of it the computer science notion
of haptic visuality shout out to Tom I
go what's up is closer to what I'm after
because it explicitly links things like
the eye and the skin but remember i'm
interested in touching both in the
physical sense and the mental one so
going after 10 million words i came to
the word grab i like it
because it combines the phenomena of
touch with the politics of uncertainty
think for instance of terms like land
grab or attention grab or even up for
grabs so now we're a long way from
internet dating and I'm going to take
you a little farther still but stay with
me because I want to show you what a
theory of grabbing can do for us in a
time of strange intimacy beyond the
world of dating sites so in the news
today after what seems like an endless
stream of police brutality cases the
bush has grown strong to equip every
police officer with a body camera in the
interest of Public Safety but this
relatively straightforward belief in
omnipresent cameras for good otherwise
known as souvent has already been
critiqued and what doesn't get caught
talk through is the way that images
grabbed us emotionally physically and
how these images are themselves grabbed
at three levels the screen level which
we've been talking about editing
cropping filtering upvoting forwarding
remix in facial matching so forth
beneath the screen through metadata
utilized by companies in the police
industrial complex like canon
hewlett-packard all those folks who make
the products that I work with your body
cameras this is subject to zero
regulation because of the state-based
nature of policing and the skin level
which we've talked about before one more
second promise I know it's cheeky but
I'm going to circle back to my dating
life now very soon after i got the
okcupid contact I talked to I notice
that my profile had been viewed by
somebody who matched exactly the
description of this mystery guy who was
it normally online had this fellow
convinced his friend to get online I
wondered maybe the two incidents were
unrelated I don't know he didn't contact
me and I sure she didn't contact him
every day I work against I way my desire
to find my new love against what feels
like an eighty or ninety four five
percent chance that all internet dating
will blow up in my face basically I'm in
a space of harm reduction but it's okay
because I don't really need to go on
dates anymore and I have
things are more dire when it comes to
police brutality I think of the hundreds
of companies serving the police
industrial complex a bit like I think of
my mystery matchmaking pal on okcupid
maybe they're sleazy maybe they're
serving a legitimate need either way we
cannot trust them to take care of us
because we're not paying their bills the
police are but there's also the
powerball question and consider we want
protection from criminals we want
accountability from police we want some
shot at limited consensual casual sex
without having our bank account drained
through an internet scam if there's one
thing police camera advocates and dating
site users have in common it's this we
both need to get familiar with strange
intimacy because it's already familiar
with us thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
