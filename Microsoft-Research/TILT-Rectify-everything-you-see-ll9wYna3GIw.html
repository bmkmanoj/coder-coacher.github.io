computer vision expert who recently
enjoyed my cell research Asia and leads
the computer vision group my cell
research Asia prior to joining my cell
research he was a tenured professor you
know the Illinois urbana-champaign today
he will give us his talk on how we can
rectify everything we see let's give a
warm welcome to email okay good yeah
thanks everyone so I mima actually I'm
the manager of the computer vision group
so you know that about computer vision
do we actually just move around pixels
so today you will see a lots of videos
showing how we move around pixels and
this is actually some of the recent work
actually the work under the title tilt
the work I did in the past couple years
at a precisely at the Microsoft Research
Asia actually provided to the
environment for me to really
substantiate some of the ideas that we
had back in the cornfield in Illinois
and actually show some of the good
applications so the world is full of
regular objects right we're interested
textures buildings faces license plates
barcode or all kinds of texts right so
there's something interesting about
those objects or those images that their
image is actually the inner up front
upright position that you excavate some
interesting thing properties there are
actually low dimensional structures you
know we all recognize the upfront
position of text or human faces why is
that right what's what's what's special
about this particular pose so well maybe
you say there's a lots of local
regularities global symmetries right so
then how can we utilize those for our
purposes
especially provide natural user
interfaces with not a recognized barcode
with our self cell phone or google gaga
has advocated ideas already recognizing
any name marks in the world using a just
a camera and also orleans controls
instantaneously translate english to
spanish and vice versa can we do this
but why we have not yet had those
gadgets yet because the warp secrecy's
through a camera are distorted deformed
right you can take a picture from
arbitrary angle the image is this up
right image can be distorted by maybe
just to a view angle or maybe distortion
by the curved surfaces surface or can be
occluded by a tree or could be you know
have a severe distortion introduced by
the camera we'll see you later so this
is actually presenting a very
fundamental technology challenge can we
recognize object despise the distal for
deformation right why our human beings
can do it very quickly very efficiently
then hence the title how can we rectify
those objects so there has been a very
challenging problem turns out actually
recently in past couple years a few
years that we some fundamental
mathematical breakthrough that provided
us unprecedented efficient and powerful
competition tools right allow us
actually to recover such important
structures in the signals and images
despite you have severity undersampled
measurements or errors gross errors such
as occlusions or corruptions and despite
huge domain transformations and we'll
see quite a few examples what kind of
deformation we can already handle
potentially suggest the more things will
come right obviously the first
deformation mostly we see is through
your view angles right you would like to
recognize this building hopefully from
the front of you and the depending on
where you take the picture the facade of
the building will be severely distorted
probably very few
of us have ever seen that the Empire
State Building from this particular
angle right so this actually this kind
of techniques allows you to correct this
kind of strong perspective distortion
what enables is to do enables us to
reconstruct large scale buildings 3d
models full 3d models and including
camera positions from a various few a
few set of photos this has been a very
challenging problem has been tackled by
a computer vision in the past 20 or 30
years right so far I think we are about
to develop very efficient tools allow us
people to do this very very efficiently
now in the future and also other factor
also introduce deformation such as your
lens you know you have a balance for
example fisheye lens right so you take a
picture and it was things will get
severely distorted and you don't have to
worry anymore you just have to point
your camera to anything that is sort of
a regular and then the computer can
automatically recover to stratify make
all the straight line straight no longer
looks like a fish eye and will be like a
standard camera right this can be done
automatically without any human
interactions actually at this point why
this is useful because well we're
selling a lot of cheap cameras right the
Kinect actually is a very very very very
affordable camera but the one of the
challenging is that the lens associate
with speed camera has severe distortions
especially loudest we're using camera
longer as a teleconference as a monitor
we're actually using it as the interface
between human and computer right for
that purpose you have to calibrate it
right so this the old technology of
canterbury camera takes painfully many
many a lot of time but also that's not
accurate but the listen to what you
using some of the new techniques were
developing at msra and we can just do
this in matter of seconds and 40
automatically without any human
interaction so you just have to point
your cameras to a few patterns and you
are done you get a perfect calibration
despite the severe distortions and the
prospect or interest parameters and
extrinsic right in fact the five minutes
is a really exaggeration of the
performance of the current tool box
anyone who have played with
calibration you know sometimes takes out
to an hour still get a wrong answer with
calibration right also that the object
in this thing also could present the
certain types of deformation like the
curved surface like this now unless you
really can recover this lady shape than
you are also the camera pose you will be
able to recover what's truly the
intrinsic upfront pattern right so this
is example of you know temple of heaven
that if I simply with a simple utilizing
as you can see the pics always gets
moved around according to the intrinsic
structure by the way I mean these
techniques actually involved it's truly
very interesting because it only deal
with the raw pixels without any low
level image processing filtering or
feature extraction we just deal with the
raw data automatically and get what you
what you see is almost what you get what
you get is what you see almost right and
what is this useful as I mentioned
earlier you know you have a cell phone
while the recognized text but
unfortunately you cannot stay inside the
traffic to take a picture of the sign
you're interested right if you want so
bubbly the angle you took is from this
angle a very oblique angle but the
current OCR cannot handle this kind of
deformation so what you can do detective
text rectify it and send to the OCR so
as you can see some of the demos showing
that process and we elaborate what this
detection rectification and the
recognization and there's a little
comparison between do the rectification
what would happen to the current OCR
technology right though actually the
comparison is a pretty drastic so unless
you can really rectify things then the
system will be able to recognize okay
this is one of the things we're also
hoping that help Lisa be mobile in the
future and as we say they directly fits
all type of text barcode license plates
chinese-english right without exception
actually works remarkably well and also
recognize many types of objects anything
with some kind of irregularity or
symmetry I barflies you know faces lives
and so on they have this nominal
position
these kind of tools can help you to find
it automatically and and the times you
can use the for everything right so and
one of the most popular blog on a
compressed sensing I mean recently as it
just last week they had a blog about our
techniques most of cities and also
category cameras we can sell meeting the
billions of cameras were achieved
despite the low quality we can rectify
them and also we can rectify and
recognized text you know we can do
translation speech synthesis and
integrate all the rest of the products
that be developed at a Microsoft
Research Asia and a microsoft research
in general and hopefully this techniques
will apply to many other objects that
were interested faces science tech
license plates and so on and willing
able make the computer a much better
provide a much better natural user
interface for the computers in the
future I make them much more intelligent
in when they're interacting with us and
also ways the real world that's my talk
