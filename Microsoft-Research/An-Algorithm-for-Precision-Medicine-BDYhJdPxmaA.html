you
hey hi everyone we are really happy to
have Matt might here Matt is from the
University of Utah but he is visiting
Austin he's visiting Harvard Medical
School this year and he is going to tell
us a precision medicine algorithm what
do you do when you're one of a kind all
right thank you well I appreciate those
of you that had to brave the rain to get
here I'm glad you survived as you can
tell my dress shoes did not so I
recognize this is probably a more
computational audience than I typically
speak to so I mean I myself am a
computer scientist but I've been doing a
lot of Medicine lately so let's just go
over some of the basics first so when I
say something like precision medicine
what am I talking about well you may or
may not have seen an announcement from
the president about the precision
medicine initiative and this is really
all about a big change is happening
medicine and I think there are two
factors driving this change the first
one is a shift to exploiting genomic
data so that we can actually use genomes
to improve care and make it
significantly more precise as it were
and the other part of this change is the
use of all the data available from from
patients to drive care as well so and in
some sense you can think of genome is
just another kind of data but it's a
rather big kind of data with very
special properties so I think that's
really the essence of precision medicine
and the way the president put it he said
this is all about getting the right drug
to the right patient at the right time
that is the essence of precision
medicine and it's very strange for me to
be talking about this because again I I
am actually pressing for your science
and most of what I do is cybersecurity
so I always thought if I ever did give a
talk at MSR it would be on cybersecurity
last I'm not here to talk about that but
maybe some other time and the reason I
got interested in medicine in the first
place is that yeah three years ago my
wife and I got some unbelievable news I
mean almost literally unbelievable we
were told that our son it was in fact
the first and at the time only case ever
discovered of a brand-new genetic
disorder so we had to start answering
this question you know what do you do
if you're told that your child is
literally the only case known I'd be
brand-new disease so this is what we've
been trying to answer for a little over
three years now in some sense we've been
trying to answer it longer than that
because we had a long diagnostic Odyssey
beforehand and and the way I look at it
you know what we're really after is a
process we want a process that takes
data in and maps it to a drug on the
other side that's really the goal of
precision medicine in my view and I
think the reason that that's the reason
computer science is so important this
process because we're really talking
about is an algorithm that maps that
data from the patient you know their
genome their other health data into that
drug and if you want the short version
of what's involved in this process what
makes up the majority of it we've
surprisingly enough I would actually
have to say it's a matter of trying the
Internet
so it turns out there's a an awful lot
you can do with the Internet these days
maybe not so surprising to this crowd
but it certainly surprises older doctors
and and the reason I think it's great
that the Internet can play such a major
role is that it's like hey unless you
live in North Korea chances are good you
have access to Google or Bing as it were
so both of them work just as well so
what I'm going to tell you is in some
sense the story of executing an
algorithm on my son's case and we'll
sort of map out what that looks like by
tape tracing the steps that we traced
and showing you some of the branches
that applies to other disorders as well
and I'm gonna clarify that even though
I'm talking about my son Bertrand this
is in no way a unique story anymore in
genome sequencing is discovering
disorders at an unparalleled rate in
human history I mean we're talking about
hundreds of new diseases discovered per
year a rate that's actually accelerating
at the moment so you know the input to
the algorithm of course is a patient and
in this case in reer disease you end up
with again people use the term
diagnostic Odyssey for a reason and it
often begins on a place that a lot of us
call undiagnosed Island which is a place
we have a population of one patient or
one family and these oddities odyssey's
take a varying amount of time but they
share some some stuff in common now in
our case we didn't know why my son was
having seizures or why he was
developmentally delayed or why he
a strange movement disorder or why for
some reason and this is one of those the
stay on symptoms
he couldn't cry liquid tears yeah so
this there was a lot of stuff that was
very unusual about my son and we just
had no idea what was going on but it's
also an island where as a parent you
know when you watch it your kids go
through this you learn about this
tremendous resilience within the human
spirit and of the power of just never
giving up and never giving in and and
really that was our life for quite some
time but I would say that even before we
had a diagnosis we were already engaged
in what you might call a precision
medicine because we were collecting data
and acting on data actually back before
you could even build iPhone apps
I built an iPhone app to track all of
the seizures my son was having along
with all of his other medically relevant
events like medicine well like when he
was getting it how much he was getting
and all of his food and by mining this
data we could figure out that his
seizures were actually correlated to the
timing and dosage of his particular
medications but and by spreading them
out we actually eliminate about half a
seizures from that so even without a
genome you can do data driven medicine
and of course we actually did some other
stuff that's considered part of the
precision medicine initiative back then
like you know right now the state of the
art is you still get mountains and
mountains of paper records when you're
when you're dealing with anything like
this and we were I would say religious
about digitizing these I would take them
into the high high speed scanner at work
every week and add add to the collection
and then end up posting them in a secure
site online so that every time we went
to a new hospital signing physician my
son had one of very first truly portable
EHRs because we could send him a URL and
say here's your login here's all of his
records and we ocr'd them so that they
were searchable so they could search for
anything anywhere and his records and
this tremendously I think accelerated
you know what we were doing with that
diagnostic Odyssey and unfortunately I
wish I could say that we're better than
this but we're not much better than this
right now if you are spread across
multiple institutions this is more or
less state of the art for EHRs and
that's just an embarrassment
so for 48 months that was our life we
had no idea what was going on and then
we engages for what I would say is the
first step of the precision medicine
algorithm which is sequencing and a team
of Sciences from Duke University who'd
been working it for quite some time said
you know what we think your Center is a
really good candidate for this new
technology called exome sequencing
so that's what they did they sequenced
myself my wife and my son and they use
this so they could check for novel
mutations and any ultra rare inherited
mutations and what they found was he had
in fact inherited a premature stop from
me in a frameshift from my wife that led
to loss of function in this one
particular gene called ng ly-one or
angle i1 so this gene was knocked out
and that's when they also said at the
same time that hey but he's the first
and only case we have ever seen with
anybody missing function in this gene
there's literally no one in the
literature with a disease associated
with this gene so this is really our
best guess that this is what's causing
it and they were pretty confident but to
raise confidence you have to go to the
bench and do some more stuff so this
leads to a very critical phase of the
algorithm which the interpretation and a
lot of this right now is done at the
bench and I guarantee you most this
needs to move in silico there's a huge
role for computation and interpreting
variants and to the extent it's being
done in silico at all right now a lot of
us doesn't be being done with machine
learning although I think there's a lot
of room for doing some rational
construction of algorithms for variant
interpretation so what they did is they
made sure that the protein wasn't there
and that's what this means the protein
wasn't there at all it really did
destroy the protein but then what we had
to do is we had to take my son and as a
collection of data points had to take
his phenotype and try to map it back on
to this purported genotype and to do
that you have to say well what does this
protein actually do or what does this
gene actually do when it becomes a
protein so we looked at the structure of
the protein well there's actually some
information on the protein itself out
there and we knew it was responsible for
D glycosylated misspelled a
glycoproteins after the retro
translocated from the endoplasmic
reticulum into the cytoplasm so you know
there are phrases you think you're gonna
say as a parent Sunday and I guarantee
you that was not one of them it was
being born anyway it's it's a recycling
protein more or less and if it's gone
then you don't recycle certain waste
products inside the cell so we said well
if this protein is gone we should expect
to see an accumulation these waste
products and and and and this could
plausibly explain the disorder so to go
further than that we had to reach out to
an expert in disorders of glycosylation
dr. Hudson fries at the sanford burnham
Research Institute and we said hey you
know if you saw a patient that had this
effect do you think this would it would
cause this disorder II and he said you
know what I think it actually what I
think you've got a brand new disorder in
this case so again at that point we were
pretty sure that we had an answer to
this disorder and you also oftentimes
hear an instance like this that this is
not an actual diagnosis if there's
nothing you can do once you're told that
your child is the the first and alert
even if it's an ultra rare disease day
off and say there's nothing you can do
because obviously no drug company's
working on a disease that it was
discovered yesterday that just doesn't
happen so they were a little and they
even said it was gonna take probably you
know five to ten years to find another
patient because that's typically how
long it takes when you get a brand new
just sort of like that so I but what I
would say is but there's one thing I
could get across today it would be that
these these words this phrase which is a
clinical phrase used all the time it has
it is really lost its usefulness and
certainly lost this truthfulness when it
comes to modern medicine starting with
the easy stuff so here's my my third my
third child Winston and the reason he
exists safely is because we got an
actual knock when I was saying an actual
diagnosis we were actually able to make
sure that he would be born without this
particular mutation and that's something
you can do if you get that that
information so that's the eatest of
low-hanging fruit for action because
once you get an answer you can start
doing science and this is the part that
I think is gonna have to scale up
tremendously for precision medicine to
work and I often argue that in the
absence of a medication that you can
take its science itself ends up becoming
the medication becomes the medicine
because science is a form of action it
may not be traditionally what you do
when you get a diagnosis but it's a
perfectly viable thing to do in
precision medicine and I can tell you as
a parent that as soon as you your your
set of potential diseases goes down from
dozens to one then once you have one
target to shoot at you you just go start
looking for arrows it's what you do so
that's what we did as parents we started
looking for girls and I think this is a
process that really begins by checking
to see whether or not you can build off
of stuff that other people have done so
we checked PubMed and we found out that
there were in fact that we fact we knew
almost nothing about this particular
protein so I did a search recently and
there's now eleven papers on this gene
when you did this search three years ago
when this order was discovered I think
there was like three or
and this this this gene had been
discovered 20-some years prior so if you
think about it we've almost tripled the
amount of our knowledge on this gene in
just three years compared to what we had
done in the prior 20
so there's actually as it turns out
tremendous value in having a human model
of a genetic disorder you can learn a
lot from them so we realized if we're
gonna stand on the shoulders of giants
in this case we needed a lot more giants
we need to start engaging the scientists
early on so we went right out to dr.
Hudson friezes lab we said hey let's
let's work together and we said yeah
where where have we where have we
arrived what have we reached and so I
think in a conversation in the lab and
in one afternoon he really took us to
the peak of our diagnostic Odyssey and
showed us just how far we had come and
ultimately how much further we would
have to go if we wanted to reach
understanding treatment and cure and it
turns out that we just can't we just
done the easy part getting an answer is
like the easy part of precision medicine
because now you have to go climb Everest
if you actually want to do something
about it and that's the part we have to
scale up now then I think the amazing
thing is that we took our first
scientifically plausible attack on the
disorder only weeks after discovering it
so what we did is we looked at the
mutations of cells and we said is there
anything actually we can do on these two
mutations is there something to that we
could use to influence them it turns out
there's an approach that works and about
a third of all genetic disorders at
least in theory and this is where I
learned that theory and biology is very
different from theory in computer
science so in theory there are these
things called read-through compounds
where if what you have is a premature
stop in your DNA and and you can think
of a gene is just a long sequence of
instructions that tells you how to build
a protein and a premature stop mutation
just throws a stop sign in there it
early on so it's like a halt instruction
comes too early halfway through the
protein but they're these these reads or
compounds which at least in theory can
force a read through that that stop
instruction and allow complete
construction the protein but when we
tried all of the existing ones in my son
cells and dishes none of them actually
worked so that's again that's when we
learned that the theory and practice
differ quite a bit and you might think
it's discouraging to find out that none
these work but I actually I was
incredibly invigorated to think that and
we could go from not knowing what this
thing was a few weeks prior to actually
trying out compounds in a dish
I was like wow this maybe we can move
faster than than I thought so I was very
energized by by that but I also realized
there's no way we could do this alone we
were gonna have to actually find others
and work together with them if we were
going to solve this disease and that's
another really important step and that's
in this algorithm which is to build a
community and to do this we have to
started looking in genomic databases
like so you have these databases like
right now down the street at the broad
or you can look you can look up a gene
and ask you know what's in one of the
frequency for pathogenic alleles in
there and you can use that to solve for
what the pop you know estimated patient
population size ought to be and I came
up with an estimate of about 500
patients out there somewhere in the
world that were alive suffering from
this very same disorder so it's a 1 in
millions disorder but it's it's it's
enough that there should be others and
we should be able to find them and so I
you know I think you know coming home
from the hospital and I see no I I want
to I want to go find the others and we
hatched a plan to do exactly that so
what I did to find them is I use social
media wrote a blog post that was
designed to find other patients and to
do this I engineered it to do two things
it had to go viral and it had to rank
very highly in Google or Bing said of
other patients were out there searching
for the same thing that they would they
would find us and that's exactly what it
did so this is the post I wrote so this
this this is the part that makes it go
viral
and there's 5,000 words below that that
make it rank highly in Google so that's
you know it it's you know I hate to say
we exploit an internet cat picture
theory but we did the Internet is like
sobering ly predictable sometimes so um
yeah this thing took off I mean it just
rocketed out there it was seen by by
millions in a very short amount of time
and ended up about a year and a half ago
in The New Yorker so this thing has just
kept snowballing and getting ever more
evermore coverage and it did in fact
rank highly inside Google so that if
somebody was out there searching for the
same symptoms they would they would land
on it and then patients started showing
up so for a disease that no one knew
existed
two months later suddenly had a
community because we had two more
patients in Turkey and then a few months
later two more patients in Israel and
then a few months after that we had a
patient
in Palo Alto and over the past three
years patients have been popping up
everywhere and and it's it's it's almost
impossible to really describe what this
means to an individual patient or to us
as a family to suddenly have this
community but what I would say is it
really washes away that dark night of
uncertainty and isolation that comes
with not having a diagnosis and replaces
it with the light of science and
community and that community is in fact
very United so there's now 39 confirmed
patients with several more likely to be
confirmed in the very near future
they're all working together to try to
figure out how to understand treat and
cure this disorder and now we're gonna
ask questions okay what can you do with
the community of 39 patients that you
just couldn't do when you only had one
it turns out there's a lot you know so
as soon as you start having a patient
community nature starts running
experiments for you and if you're
keeping along this is step three be
point a and the algorithm I won't keep
tracking a keep tracker map from this
but I'll mark where individual steps are
I'll show you a flowchart at the end so
here's some example of natural
experiments that happen so this this
child right here in addition to having
and gly one deficiency the same disease
my son also had horrible liver cancer by
the age of one is that which insensitive
a full liver transplant and the crazy
thing is as after his transplant he
recovered from more than his liver
cancer he also recovered from many of
the symptoms of ny1 so this has sparked
a number of hypotheses about what
exactly might have caused this to happen
and it's definitely driving the you know
sort of the clinically oriented science
of this disorder you also end up with
patients like these two right here where
in most the patients are clustered in
terms of severity down near the bottom
end of the severe range where these two
even though they clearly have the same
disorder are you know extreme outliers
they're much more they're much more
high-functioning than all the rest and
so by by volunteering their their
genomic data and their their health data
they're helping us sort of crack the
code of what makes them different
it might provide us targets that we can
act on therapeutically you can hold
conferences if you have a community so I
think barely a year after we discovered
this order we gathered all the patients
parents and scientists in one place and
said let's figure out what the strategy
for going after this disorder is and
we're about to have our fifth conference
in three and a half years coming up in
December so we've made a lot of progress
in terms of getting scientist actually
figure
what the key problems to attack are you
can build foundations in fact we have
two foundations for our patient
community so I like to say that if we
could maintain this patient to
foundation ratio going forward I think
we're gonna do quite well but I think
both foundations work very closely
together to make sure that we're
maximizing the the ability to use our
resources and 13 patients have already
gone through a Natural History study
sponsored by the NIH so if you're not
familiar with what a natural history
study is I'll show it to you in just a
second but I would say this what this
really is is this is deep phenotyping
this is really uncomfortable or Doretta
very broad level so I'm very grateful to
people like Lynne Wolff the study
coordinator and in Bill gahl at NIH for
actually supporting this research and
allowing us to get 13 patients through
in one year and then having them come
back every year after that so to give
you a sense of what it's like to go
through a one-week you know high-level
NIH study what I have here is a single
picture for every poke prod procedure or
appointment that occurs during the
course of this entire week so in one
week all of these procedures happen this
has now happened to 13 patients my son
has already been through for his second
year so if you do this on a large
patient population and 13 is getting
large then what you get when you
aggregate the data are biomarkers clear
clinical indicators of what is happening
in a disorder like this and what we
found you know yeah this I guess less
interesting to us see it to a computer
science audience but we found things
like certain kinds of low protein in the
CSF and very unexpectedly hypo
glycosylation and the CSF as well so
these sorts of things are very much
guiding the basic science going forward
and also providing markers that an
agency like the FDA could look at when
you're doing clinical trials but more
importantly when you start to get all
this data it starts to make that target
bigger makes it easier to hit every time
you uncover some some chain and the
mechanism of harm for for the disorder
and that gets you back at a more
traditional route of drug development
and one of the mainstays of drug
development is something called
screening so it sounds crazy but I'm
about to show you is really what state
of the art is when it comes to drug
development what you do is you need to
build an assay which can detect whether
or not some
pound has the desired effect in this
case to build the assay all we had to do
is Google for it because we were
actually in the process of building it
independently when my wife said wait a
minute what if somebody else has already
done this and sure enough there's
already an assay out there for this
particular gene so we sent that over to
dr. Hudson Freese and he started working
with it
and what you're seeing here is it the
green glow means that the activity the
enzyme is present and if you don't say
green glow means the activity is not
there so if you find a compound that
actually restores the activity then you
expect to see green so what we're after
with with this is green and what we
really want to see is as much screen as
possible if you do this at scale so
there's these robots out there now where
you can test literally millions of
different compounds to see if any of
them can give you any green glow at all
so we're we're working with facility to
do this at at sanford-burnham
and again the idea here is it's very
brute force you just take as many
composit you can get and you just try
them all and so you're not you're not
thinking rationally which is what you
might think you might do if you're doing
drug design and there's something called
rational drug design but that's not
really all that popular yet you just
throw everything you've got at it and
hope something lights it up these days
you can also do a lot with model
organisms and the cost of model
organisms just fell but probably two
orders of magnitude thanks to a
technology called CRISPR you've probably
heard of CRISPR because you can very
rapidly edit the genome of other
organisms at this point so we have a
sort of like little island of dr. Moreau
of n1 animals at this point we have mice
we have flies we have zebrafish we have
worms and we have yeast and I don't know
if ours retain the wonderful nutty
flavor of regular yeast I'll try them
out at some point I guess and you could
even think of you know really large
molecule therapies to actual biologics
so in this case there's a natural
biologic which is the enzyme itself like
if we can synthesize the enzyme and just
put the enzyme back in the cell
presumably that would give you the
activity back but again this is a little
bit easier said than done
and the first step is synthesizing this
at scale for a reasonable price because
it turns out then the synthesis problem
is is solved because if you again if you
google for synthetic human angle i1 it's
out there you can you can just buy it on
the Internet
the only problem is if you look very
carefully it costs $400 for 10
micrograms
so again if you just extrapolate that
out to what she would need for a human
patient it's about 2 million dollars a
week so it turns out most insurance
companies will not go for this so well
okay we're gonna have to work with the
insurance companies on whether or not
this is a reasonable strategy but even
if you do that turns out there's still
some biological problems that stand in
the way like the fact that if you just
inject this this enzyme it actually
doesn't go to the right part of the cell
it ends up in something called the
lysosome but it needs to go to the
cytoplasm so first you have to do
regulate it for a number of other
reasons and then you want to tag it with
a peptide stolen from HIV to make it
cell penetrant so this this is you know
enzyme level engineering and if you do
this then it gets into the cytoplasm and
then it might actually be biologically
active in the right place and of course
we're also very focused on repurposing
and and I the reason I like repurposing
is that it's a very it's a very
computational a way to go about you know
drug development or drug discovery the
whole idea here is that if which what
you have you have a coordinator who's
essentially some sort of deviation what
I'll call fee no space the space of
phenotypes where each of each of these
is some feature that's that's out of
whack and what you're looking for when
you do drug development or repurposing
is the drug or the combination of drugs
really that well that is the exact
opposite of the patient in Fino space so
that when you bring these two things
together what you've done is you've
canceled out all the features and
there's lots of ways to slice Fino space
so you can look at RNA expression you
can look at metabolic just lots of ways
to look at what is happening to a
patient and the effect that a drug might
have and again if you if you think about
it in some sense which you have now is
an optimization problem you want to
figure out what combination of drugs
gets you closest to reversing the
effects on the patient so in fact it
Harvard there's there's there's projects
going on right now and and the group I'm
with for figure out how to compute the
drug cocktails that will exactly reverse
a phenotype and I think another really
cool approach you can take building on
some of the early efforts we did with
social media is crowd screening so I'll
talk now a little bit about the
potential here so the crowd screening I
think it can be as unstructured as just
sort of blasting stuff out to social
media and
people what they would do to the much
more structured where you actually
engage in some of these citizen science
initiatives but some of the most
interesting suggestions we've had have
actually started on social media so by
broadcasting over Twitter we never
connected to a post doc in Texas who
said hey I'm working on cystic fibrosis
but I actually happen to need sons that
look like cells that look like your son
cells because he happens to have the
mutation I care about right now
so we shipped him some cells and what do
you reported back a few weeks later was
that with his new companies working on
for CF it's a read-through compound like
I mentioned earlier it was actually able
to store about and it's really hard to
hear but about one to two percent in
normal levels of of ny1 which is
probably enough to actually be
biologically viable at that point so
we're again a connection over twitter
has led to a pretty promising lead in
terms of a novel way of going about
read-through and we've been working very
closely with him ever since to see if we
can if we can actually go to the FDA
sorry so that's that's the phase we're
in right now we're trying to figure out
you know with the FDA what would it take
to start a trial based on on this
compound there's a company right here in
Boston that's actually feels the the
science of angle I one is now promising
of or sort sufficiently de-risk that
they're even interested in starting a
unit to do drug discovery for angle i1
in fact they have started that unit for
angle i1 based on a different approach
to the therapeutics and we actually have
a much more structured citizen science
or crowds crowd screening effort going
on with Andrew sue at Scripps because he
has a platform called mark to cure and
when Mark to cure does is it allows
patients or really not patient but any
volunteer that wants to that pertained
to mark up abstracts so that they can
highlight what the genes are what the
diseases are and what potential
therapies are and if you do this over
enough abstracts in PubMed with enough
volunteers in this case this graph is
generated I think with several hundred
thousand annotated abstracts you can
start to draw out connections in the
literature between disorders and
treatments and a one a very interesting
path that popped out literally last week
so we had a conference call last week
what I saw this graph for the first time
and they said you know is anything on
this graph look interesting to unit so
there's definitely one very interesting
thing on this graph to me because one of
the most successful prior treatments
we'd ever attempted was on this graph
and there's even a compelling rationale
for why it's there so it connected ny1
all the way through a phenotype for a
completely different disorder but very
similar disorder in fact there the lack
of tears to ACTH receptors into ACTH an
ACTH has a it's been been used on
several end by one patients now has a
pretty remarkable effect but the way the
weird thing is that doesn't affect tears
what it affects is their seizures so
after about two months on ACTH the
seizures in angle i1 patients go from
more or less permanent background
epileptic activity to none at all their
seizures are actually totally gone after
two months on it on ACTH and at the
patient level something really
remarkable happens so when my son went
on this he actually started smiling and
laughing for the first time you know so
prior to this had life his life was was
pretty awful but he's in fact he's been
laughing ever since he's been on it was
a very permanent change once once we
tried this treatment so ACTH which
showed up in the search was actually
sort of the key to unlocking his
humanity and certainly I would say his
sense of humor so yeah I I think the
fact that it showed up there was was
really incredible and the cool thing is
we don't we never knew why ACTH worked
but here there's there's a compelling
explanation in terms of its connection
through the phenotype but also a family
of receptors over here that we're
looking at now because sometimes it
works in intractable epilepsy so it's
like it's like literally the last thing
you will ever try in an intractable
epilepsy because it will almost kill the
patient so no one can be on it long term
that's the problem with ACTH so - I'd
end up in the hospital for three weeks
after two months but I mean it did it
did permanently eliminate some of his
seizures and some of them came back but
we again we never understood why but now
we have a whole family of receptors to
look at yeah that interact with ACTH and
hopefully we can target the right ones
and figure out the ones that are
actually suppressing the seizures versus
his immune system because that that's
the problem it'll suppress your immune
system in fact just wipe it out entirely
so that's that's where we are now or and
so we're doing another deep dive with it
the same citizen science initiative
where we're focusing on just the
literature surrounding here to see if we
can figure out what the mechanism for
seizure suppression actually is
and I'm optimistic that we'll actually
turn something up
and another thing sort of key feature of
citizen science is what are calling
patient driven science or precision
medicine really patient this patient
driven science and you know I myself
have actually spent a fair amount of
time switching from I realized switching
just really adding another aspect of
mine to my research portfolio yeah in
the middle of biology medicine and
particularly the intersection of
biologists Biogen medicine and
computation and I've spent more less
three years getting up to speed and I'm
now so up to speed on this stuff that I
was actually able to get a grant funded
for doing drug development for angle I
won over the summer we actually built a
colony of planarian worms that have my
son's disorder and the nice thing about
playing in worms is that if you cut them
in half you now have two planarian worms
so if you want to grow up a large colony
quickly once you've got one you have
many so that's that's a nice feature of
this particular model organism they
turns out this worm can get a seizure
too so that also makes it a great
platform for testing drugs people always
ask you know can you replicate this is
can you actually scale this process up
and the answer is absolutely yes you can
you can definitely scale this up but I
know you can do this because I've seen
it done in other disorders now I mean I
I have a lot of patients that reach out
to me and say we want to start doing the
same thing and so I helped a number of
disorders start taking these exact same
steps this is one of the first ones I
helped a few years ago and they said we
need what we were told we did genome
sequencing they said well it could be
this mutation could be this mutation
could be neither of them we don't
actually know we need to find another
patient so I I told him how to put
together a website that would actually
help find other patients and 29 29 days
later they had another patient and it
confirmed that it was in fact one of the
variants that was flagged by sequencing
so if you think about that for a second
that means in this case it was two moms
exchanging emails who ended up on the
front line of science you know they were
the first ones to actually know that
this was a brand new disorder and this
is something that's gonna happen over
and over again where the patients are
just thrust out to the frontiers of
science and end up being the first ones
to know something instead of the
scientists another mom who said well III
like the idea of using you know I
already have a blog she she you know
after she read our story she did it
herself without contacting me which I
it's great you don't have to contact me
to put your your kids case on the
internet and within I think a couple
weeks she had eight cases of a brand new
a brand new disorder and then just a few
weeks ago there's a well while I was
here over the summer I was working with
a family that said you know we also need
to find another case for our disorder
and here's here's the incredible part so
if you if you just look over time at the
decrease in time it's taken when they
put their post online the time it took
to find another case was 12 hours 12
hours so it took us two months than 29
days than a few weeks than 12 hours so
the amount of time it's taking to find
other patients online is dropping very
rapidly and of course we've got we're
getting better at it too we're getting
better at exploiting social media to do
exactly this and the reason there at
Europe this is so effective is that
there's no one large database of all
variants out there but the Internet
itself acts as a kind of as a kind of
database already so they were able to
get through to researchers who are
sitting on unpublished data about that
particular gene and who had in fact
other districts that is that is that is
exactly my next slide
so what perfect question perfect timing
yes there's tremendous value in
standardizing this process and so the
NIH has just backed a major effort
called the undiagnosed diseases Network
part of which is headquartered at hard-r
Harvard and the group I'm with to scale
this process up so there they're gonna
do that you know week long deep
phenotyping and through a partnership I
have with Kim splinter and reach for
money over there
we'll actually putting these patient
profiles on the web in a very systematic
way but I feel like one thing I need to
mention is that one of the most
important things you can do is to put
the information on Wikipedia as well
there's some strategic reasons for that
so if you're not familiar with Wikipedia
because I suppose you've been in
cryostasis for 15 years but we have a
lot to catch up on but let's start a
start here
so it's become the world's database so
you there is a default database for
everything now and it is Wikipedia and
you know obviously anybody can view and
anybody can edit it and this makes a
huge difference and patients and parents
search this all the time I took like I
don't know anything I didn't know
anything about biology
I'm prior to all this and everything I
know I learned from Wikipedia I took six
weeks of really crappy biology in high
school and that was it so it's been
Wikipedia for everything else and then I
see what Wikipedia is it's naturally
self optimizing it naturally rises to
the top of search engine results so if
you put information there there's a good
chance people will find it so I even
created a blog post that tells patients
how to do this and all the other stuff
I've been I've been recommending and I
even have a Wikipedia entry generator so
you can just type in the information and
get out exactly the text you need to
copy and paste in Wikipedia for your
particular disorder so this this this
makes it very easy for any patient to
get their data on there and connected to
other patients as a result they can just
add a section called clinical
significance whether whether it exists
or not the other thing you can do which
of course applies to Bing to is you can
buy Adwords you know if you don't have
you don't take the time to go edit a
Wikipedia entry or get you're supposed
to go viral you can just pay Google to
rank at the top and we do this too so I
think if we really if we really do want
to scale this entire process up from
patient finding all the way to disease
discovery that we do need to pin down
what this algorithm looks like so I'll
describe it now sort of the level of a
flow chart that takes you through this
entire process so again the what comes
in is the input is an undiagnosed
patient or a patient patient seeking
information and I think the next step in
precision medicine is almost invariably
going to be sequencing you're gonna have
to figure out what is going on in their
genome but this then involves actually
interpreting the genome which is again
quite tricky cuz you have to talk to
gene experts have to do maybe studies in
a lab and also I would argue turn to the
web see if the web happens to know what
it is what is going wrong with any genes
of interest that pop up so then surely
you get an interpretation you say well
we think this is the gene that's
problematic or in the case of cancer
you've got to probably end up with
multiple genes that could be driving the
cancer but you get some genes that are
that are acting to cause the pathology
and then depending on the function of
that gene and what has happened to the
function that gene there's other stuff
that starts to happen so you can get a
gain of function maybe the gene
now overactive or a partial loss of
function where it's it's activity
activities reduced but not gone or a
total loss of function like what you
have in my son's case or in the worst
case I think what you have is a change
the function where now the gene went
from doing you know one thing and now it
is a completely different thing that's
that's harder to do it but you can still
still deal with that and the other thing
you can do is of course you can start
doing the deep phenotyping and you can
move into crowd screening as well
regardless of what has happened to the
gene itself so I'll just talk now about
some of the paths down down these branch
just to show you what they look like so
for total loss of function there's a lot
of stuff you can do and some of this
stuff also applies for the other
branches but you guys are building model
organisms you can do structural analysis
of the enzyme itself or the protein
itself it's not always an enzyme and you
can even start developing assays and
once you do these things there's lots of
other stuff you can do as well so I'm
not gonna go into all these in detail
but I'll talk about some of the
low-hanging fruit so I think the
low-hanging fruit is actually really
important to try at scale so one of the
lowest hanging fruits for lot total loss
of function particularly in a metabolic
disorder like my sons is to try and
metabolic diet and and here's how you go
about figuring out what a metabolic
slike for your particular disorder so if
you think of an enzyme as a function
that takes in a's and gives you back b's
then a metabolic disorder is what
happens when that function is gone and
you can no longer turn a's and b's and
with this tends to result in it is a
toxic accumulation of a's and a
deficiency in B's so then there's a very
simple logic that follows which says
okay if that enzyme is gone can you give
B or can you restrict a that's that's a
metabolic diet at that point it's
localized to the specific enzyme that's
been knocked out and there's plenty of
examples of metabolic stores where this
actually works so for for PKU if you can
restrict phenylalanine it's more or less
secure and then for C D G 1 B or C D GMP
I if you can supplement with mannose
again it is more or less a cure for the
disorder so then of course you have to
ask well what does this do in the case
of Engel I want it's also a metabolic
disorder so to do this you actually to
go a little bit deeper into the basic
science because it's it's not in some
sense what the output of the process
here is it is is waste or what we
thought was waste
and what we will to do by looking at the
basic cell biology that sorta was
realize that in the absence of this
enzyme something particularly
interesting is going on when the Sinan's
enzyme is gone you're not just getting
these free-floating glycoproteins what's
actually happening is this very
structured form of protein aggregation
and this protein aggregation is actually
you know tripping up the recycling
mechanisms that you wish you end up with
is a deficiency in one particular rare
monosaccharides and that rare
monosaccharides represented in this
diagram by a blue square and it turns
out this little blue square is available
for purchase on the internet cost around
50 cents a day if you're talking about
therapeutic quantities so realizing that
I went ahead and ordered some I did a
clinical trial on myself for about a
month I didn't die so I realized it's
probably safe so and we know my
household I am the FDA that's basically
how it works
and so when I was pretty sure it was
safe so that's a great question so
there's there's several other disorders
where the treatment involves these
unusual monosaccharides and so we I took
my best guess based on the the
quantities and the bioavailability of
these other monosaccharides to try to
figure out what would be reasonable and
my son's disorder and that's that's all
I could do yeah exactly yeah
so we standardize on a dosage per per
kilogram but yeah I mean it's ultimately
you know for any drug you just have to
sort of do this usually do it with more
people and not yourself but that's
that's what you have to do but the
amazing thing is about three days after
I I gave this to him he actually cried
is the very first year and actually
started crying plenty of Tears after
that so when we saw that first here it
was it was I would say a pretty amazing
moment and and what I did is I actually
collect the tear and put it on dry ice
and shipped it to a lab in California
for analysis which is what any parent
would do in that situation
I'm sure you all did the same thing with
your children's first year and and so
you know maybe it may have been one
small tear for Bertrand but I think it's
really become sort of a notion of
science for the larger disorder because
it what it did is it said okay there is
a deficiency component of this is this
disorder there's also an accumulation
component which is much harder to deal
with but you know there was there was
there was something else out there that
was driving the harm as well now so
that's that's loss of function and
that's one part of loss of function
though you can also end up with gain of
function and here you want to look at
other strategies like can you can you
stop the mutant protein from being
producer so per you know prolifically
produced can you find an inhibitor that
will block the activity that's
overactive gene you can you build model
organisms or can you also look at
dietary changes yeah so in the same way
that you know you might want to but here
the logic gets a little bit inverted and
then the important thing here is that
sometimes inhibitors are easier to build
than you might think
so there's one family I was working with
about a year ago where they got never
done diagnosed as two years prior and it
was in fact a de novo gain-of-function
in a particular gene and at this point
you know the next reasonable step to me
and I would have thought to any
physician would be to at least Google
for whether or not there happens to be
an inhibitor for this particular gene
makes sense right well no one had done
that so I did it and sure enough there's
multiple inhibitors for this gene that
were available now nobody knows if
they're safe nobody knows if you can
actually use them but it's a starting
point you could do medicinal chemistry
on this if it's not safe so I think the
the Marla story here is is if sometimes
the obvious gets missed even by
physicians and in science or maybe it's
so obvious and then I didn't think to
tell a patient that that's what they
should do and that's why it's important
to ultimately very standardize this
process so that as soon as you see
gain-of-function the next thing you do
is run this Google query and if
necessary engage in medicinal chemistry
to improve toxicology and make it more
bioavailable and for partial loss
function you sort of invert what you do
for for gain of function you want to see
if you can up regulate the one working
copy of the gene if there is such a
working copy and and engage in many of
this yet the same behaviors and for a
change in function then I think we
should really want to do here is any
that ends in omics so that's
transcriptomics metabolomic s-- you know
proteomics you name it I think you
wanted to basically all of that should I
figure out what the heck has just
changed with this particular protein
because you know when as a change of
function it's really hard to figure out
exactly what's happening and there's
there's another less scientific step in
this algorithm which I think is really
important for all patients and really
all stakeholders to be engaged in which
is advocacy so I spent a lot of time
engaged with policymakers trying to
explain to them that our current
regulatory infrastructure is totally
unprepared for precision medicine and
that in some ways the science is a lot
easier and I'm saying that I'm not
saying size is easy but in some ways
it's a lot easier than the policy
changes that are gonna be required to
make this really lift off so I'll give
you some examples of that so my um my
wife has been very active in advocacy
back in her home state of Utah and
actually got the she testified before
the Statehouse in the state Senate with
my son to get the right to trial law
passed this is a bit this in law which
is it was starting to propagate to many
states now and what this does is it says
if you have a terminal disorder then you
have a right to try anything past phase
one FDA safety testing so if it's safe
then you have a right to try it whether
or not it's been proven effective and
odds are it's not going to ever be
proven effective for our particular
disorder anyway so Safety's all we're
really after so that's no on the books
in Utah and my son was certainly very
happy to be a part of this process
mostly because he got the pen afterwards
and I spent a fair amount of time myself
working on on Capitol Hill trying to
educate congressmen and Senators so I've
worked with what Diana DeGette
who actually found our story to The New
Yorker and then invited me to come speak
with her to sort of give her my
perspective on on precision medicine I
met a few weeks ago with Orrin Hatch to
talk to him about what's going on in the
space and what kind of kind of changes
might be made and I've even worked with
some some high-level folks at the White
House on what changes are ultimately
gonna have to come about to make this a
reality
and I'm optimistic that in the long run
we'll actually get there I think there's
there's been some really uplifting you
know progress on this front in terms of
recognizing the regulatory obstacles
that are that are
coming to make precision medicine scale
so my parting thought for all of this is
that if there's one thing I I've done
today it's that I've hope I've convinced
you that not actionable simply doesn't
belong in our medical lexicon anymore
it's just not true at this point because
even in the event that there is no other
course of action to take it is always
possible to do science thank you I'm
wondering about clearly it makes total
sense to reach as many people as you can
and the internet is the obvious way to
do that you've had great success with it
thinking about the global scale both of
Geno's and of Internet use there's
obviously a lot of populations and you
end up with 35 out of what you estimated
500 cases or 39 are there do you have
strategies outside of the internet for
trying to find those other people how
are you doing we do we do actually in
fact are most in terms of like most
patients we were found in one day our
most successful strategy was to set up a
booth this is all my wife's doing she
set up a booth at a major genetics
conference you know big colourful with
us at Engle I won and we had my son
there and some other patients there and
clinicians just walking by er like oh I
have one of those patients I'm like
really did you put them in touch with us
you know they're just floating out there
in Norway or South Africa or South
America disconnected from the broader
patient population they said well they
didn't have a novel mutation so we
didn't think there's any value in it
it's just well sure there's no
scientific value at that point but
there's certainly value to the patient's
themselves to be connected to the
community yeah so sometimes the
physicians don't even check to see if
there's a patient community out there
but just
you know having them able to walk by
this booth at a scientific conference
made a huge difference could we found
five patients in one day scientific part
but I would say like read it with the
book in pure science by Steve Epstein is
a tale about how often advocacy is part
of the science and you discover that on
your own you might find it really oh
it's about the process of the science
nor to go and testify what in in the
algorithm that you drew where where
along the way is the part that while it
may have worked in your case is going to
be the hardest part in other cases so
I'm thinking either there's there's a
part of that that like is hugely
expensive or for certain kinds of
diseases isn't so easy or you don't have
the research backing to do it or you had
to go in case another Zoid where in that
flow is kind of a sticking point
sure so the the part where things get
there's two places where things get very
expensive so basic science is expensive
and people are very reluctant to engage
in patients I would say are very
reluctant to invest in basic science for
disorder we've invested a lot in basic
science for the disorder and I think
this because I myself am a basic
scientist I understand that you don't
know what you're gonna get out of basic
science it's a lotto ticket you're just
hoping that something will pop up and
inevitably stuff does but you can't know
what that will be until you just do it
so just sending people to the bench to
look at cells under a microscope to
stain these things and if ago what is
going on is it's incredibly important
but also very expensive it's not cheap
to hire postdocs to do this sort of
stuff so that's that's certainly one
aspect of it another aspect where things
start to get expensive is screening you
know as you start talking about millions
of compounds going through a screen
you're now talking about millions of
dollars for for screening as well so and
it may but I mean I think in the grand
scheme of things you know millions of
dollars is nothing compared to what
say is that you know 2.6 billion that it
currently costs for drug development and
I think there's lots of ways to
potentially short-circuit some of the
the costs and drug developments you know
so right now this there's this very sort
of well-defined model where you start
off or you get something working with
cells and then you scale it up to model
organisms and forums then you start to
go to first and man and and that's a
very expensive process and clinical
trials which I'm now encountering are
also ridiculously expensive clinical
trials are just off the charts expensive
you know I mean we're talking about you
know for each patient hundreds of
thousands of dollars per year in costs
we're and these where you need thousands
of patients and these trials can run for
years
so clinical trials are incredibly
expensive and I think yeah you know you
for clinical trials there there's
there's a good regulatory solution so I
was actually out speaking of medics this
past weekend where I unveiled my
strategy which is we have to go back to
decoupling safety and efficacy
particularly for these ultra rare
disorders where we are never gonna have
enough patients to get the kind of
statistical confidence that you're after
in a randomized controlled trial all
we're ever gonna get we're ever gonna
have enough to get as safety data and
once we've got safety data then you say
well over time we can do retrospective
analysis and try to figure out whether
or not it really was effective and in
most cases where the diseases are very
chronic and typically monotonically
decreasing in terms of their at their
phenotype if it has an effect it's
usually pretty obvious you know if you
give the sugar to my son he has tears if
you take it away the tears are gone you
know I don't know how many you know
placebo controlled trials we need to do
to actually prove the FDA of that but
it's it's it's pretty obvious to us that
it's working you know ditto for
something like ACTH if you put them on
the seizures are gone if you take them
off the seizures go away so they're you
know I think ultimately we need to do is
this incorporate a sense of logic the
process so something that is logically
impossible for the disorder happens
after going on the drug then you know it
really boosts the probability that it
actually worked but that's not the logic
is not part of the product part of the
process right now so that's yeah that's
that's you know screening and the basic
science and the regulation really ramp
up the cost absolutely
like rationale for this regulation yeah
yeah so that's that's obviously a
challenge you know so if you go to your
doctor and say well there's a scientific
rationale for trying this drug but then
a payer might say well it show me the
published paper that shows that in 25
patients this actually did something
well we don't even have 25 patients for
the disorder so we're never going to
have that so there's definitely other
conflicts coming like how yeah again how
do you convince payers to pay in the
absence of evidence in literature where
all you have is something plausible in
terms of the underlying mechanism and
for that I think we're gonna ultimately
end up using what I'll call n of one
trials where we figure out how to
actually determine whether or not for a
single patient a drug is actually having
an effect and this is now emerging as a
very serious topic in in the medical
community how do you actually determine
efficacy on a single patient and then
the model shifts to a drug company will
only get paid if the drug actually makes
a difference and if it doesn't then and
then they don't get paid so I think it
also pushes the incentive in the right
direction for the drug companies as well
so that so they don't get paid no matter
what they only get paid if they actually
help the individual patient and then
ultimately I think what we're gonna see
is a tremendous amount of repurposing
once we sort of get through these
obstacles we'll see you know I'm an
enrichment of the mapping between
chemical space and pheenoh space where
we where we know which drugs are making
an impact on on which aspects the every
kind of phenotype and it's yeah I think
very likely algorithms will be the ones
deciding what the most appropriate
medication to take is in the near future
hopefully in our future anyway
yeah I mean oh if you have a known
disease then what you do is you chop off
the front part of the algorithm you just
skip right ahead to the diagnosis part
and it and you probably still want to do
sequencing though because you won't you
probably know what we want to know the
precise mutation because again read
through compounds are getting a lot
better and for about a third of all
genetic disorders at least one of the
alleles should be susceptible to a
read-through therapy so you can think
about attacking you know the mutation
itself for an individual patient and
there's there's other strategies for
attacking mutations as well there's
stuff like exon skipping so if the
mutation occurs in a region of the
protein which is non-essential you can
introduce a complementary RNA sequence
which guy should cause you just skip
over that part of the sequence when you
actually build the protein so there's a
lot of strategies coming online that
could be very patient and bringing
mutation specific that could work very
well work for known diseases and in for
multigenic disorders which is I think is
what most common diseases probably are
then you can certainly apply the same
logic here but but obviously a little
more scaled up and and you know the same
kind of thinking applies to cancer as
well but cancer is also highly
multigenic you have tons of mutations
typically involved in cancer
so in some sense in some sense by the
way I've been pitching in as rare
disease these rare monogenic sirs
they're the easy case for precision
medicine because you have a single non
moving target yeah whereas with cancer
it's just constantly changing all the
time and you might have to compute an
ever more complicated cocktail to get it
under control
has anyone looked at well so in some
sense all disorders have a multigenic
component it's clear that these the two
outliers must have some modifier
mutations so that are suppressing
aspects of the phenotype and we're gonna
try to find those that's what we need to
do so what I'm trying to do right now is
set up a bioinformatics project back at
Utah where we take all the genomes of
all the patients that have been through
the deep phenotyping and try to
correlate them with the phenotype we're
getting out of this NIH study and
there's there's plenty of bio you know
bio traumatic spy planes that can
attempt to answer questions like that
they the key the key thing here is that
you need to get enough genomes so that
you don't have tons of false positives
you really won't know what the actual
modifiers are it is it is but with 13
I'm confident we're gonna get a you know
a list of maybe hundred genes who knows
no way happened actually I've had I've
had other reactions with Pfizer but not
with that group true the treatment might
cost a million dollars but over a
lifetime of treatment for Amelia the
present value of that investment might
look very interesting absolutely yeah
yeah now you raise an interesting point
which is that rare diseases aren't cheap
even if you don't cure them in there
they're really expensive for from any of
the patients and and it by by extension
to the insurance companies - so the
insurance companies may also be
incentivized to invest in developing
some of these treatments because it
could actually make it worth it could it
could be worth their while it could be
profitable to cure a patient instead of
paying for a lifetime of treatment you
know that's if we can bring the the cost
on if we can if we can really scale this
process to the point where that's
reasonable I think over the next decade
that might actually happen there's a lot
hat like CRISPR
yes is a huge breakthrough in terms of
reducing the cost of building model
organisms and then as a result doing
very precise drug screening on them
any other well we're we're gonna have
some some treat out there where you can
ask about some questions and then a
group of us will get together and keep
on talking with him about various ways
of scaling this and if I didn't invite
you to join that group but you would
really like to join that group please
please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
