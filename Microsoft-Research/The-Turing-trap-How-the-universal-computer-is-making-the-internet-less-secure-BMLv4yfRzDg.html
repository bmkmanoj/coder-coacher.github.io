you
hello everyone good afternoon a pleasure
to welcome Raja gross and we'll have
hardwood who will be talking today about
the cheering trip thank you thank you
mama I afternoon everybody can you hear
me all okay great thank you I'll just
start by kind of declaring my my
interest i've been involved in micro
computers and operating systems or my
career so i'm not here to bash them i
worked at digital research which is
microsoft's arch enemy back in the 80s
and 90s so I came up through the kind of
CPM single tasking multitasking
multi-user operating systems worked on
gem the failed attempt to take over the
world of windows and all those things so
I mention this because I'm approaching
this from a somewhat a position of
knowledge about the the reasons why
operating systems and PCs are how they
are so I'm not here to bash them I'm
kind of here to offer an alternative
that perhaps what I'm going to argue is
that perhaps the pc is sometimes
overkill for what's needed that's really
what i'm getting at so if you're hoping
that i was going to have a girl
operating systems you'll be a little bit
disappointed i'm afraid what else would
actually what i will say it so my
colleague um dr. will heart is here as
well what we'll do we'll kind of take
questions at the end if interject if i'm
not making sense and it's a point of
clarity please interject but um if you
can save your question to the end and
then please do so i'm just a little bit
about us um well and i started this
company gosh two years ago now on the
basis that we met her we knew each other
from Citrix we got together and we'll
have this idea that he had a way of
solving the the problem of them
usernames and passwords which were
starting to get a lot of traction in the
media about the thefts of these things
so he proposed a solution which he was
originally going to do as an academic
project and I said hang on I think there
might be a chance to make some money out
of this if we can get it right so sadly
the jury is still out on that we've
started a business but we're not
profitable yet but some that's where we
came from so being a small company the
only way we can compete with you big
guys's we have to file patterns so I
don't wanna get into the arguments about
but they're pretty useful for us as
small companies so we filed patent in
the UK in the US on our technology and
we're currently just entering beta we
built a product brought along the
hardware board here it's real and there
were just entering beige when we hope to
have a product towards the end of this
year which we can actually sell so what
we do we're in the business of offering
impenetrable hardware solutions and I'll
explain why we believe we've made our
solution impenetrable and we're
particularly looking at cyber attacks on
businesses so we're not trying to solve
all theft from the internet but what
we're particularly trying to do is
protect the business from the problem of
data theft because the business is
somebody that you can sue somebody that
you can have a go out so if the business
can get rid of that problem then we'll
consider it to be job done even though
we might inadvertently push that problem
somewhere else now we're initially
focusing on user names and passwords at
rest but we believe that our
architecture is I'll show you is
applicable to other forms of other
referenceable data so biometrics credit
card secure databases that kind of thing
so I'm I won't dwell on this slide but
you you you'll be aware of the problem
here is just some of the the big data
thefts that have hit the headlines the
thing about these ones is that they were
stolen from backing store I the data
center of the business and that's our
focus is the fact that this was stolen
from the business it means that the
business has to do something about it so
we're not overly concerned with data
theft from clients that's a problem that
needs solving we're particularly
focusing on trying to solve the problem
of a theft from the business some pretty
huge ones here ebay was a very
interesting one of course because that
was a social engineering attack they've
obtained the administrative credentials
and let themselves in obtain the
decryption keys took everything very
interesting one that one we would
maintain that our solution would have
prevented that theft okay so um wider
passwords get stolen from backing store
particularly well if we look at an
attempt to steal a million passwords
there are various places you can steal
them I'll go through this quickly
because you'll know all this stuff but I
don't need your disagree
that potentially is if you can't get
access to the encryption keys then
you're looking at years potentially to
steal data in transit it's it's not
worth bothering about there are easier
ways of doing it we would argue
certainly it's worth having a go at
stealing credentials from the client
phishing attacks all sorts of various
methods can be used there but you're
probably looking at days and potentially
you've got to infect a million clients
to ceiling million passwords again there
are easier ways of doing that if you can
manage to penetrate the data center than
great you can hijack the web server you
can memory scrape the credentials as
they go through and then that's
effectively what the target scam was
where they were scraping credit card
details actually fund the terminals but
that was a type of approach they took
their and then if you can get access to
the database well you know even with it
with an eight megabit uplink your kind
of gone in 60 seconds really you can
take our million passwords could be
uploaded in that time so this is partly
why this is a favorite if you can get
into that location you can just steal
vast numbers of credentials in one go so
a quick look at the cost of the problem
because we're focusing on the effects of
for the business some of some of these
figures are quite astonishing I really
didn't honestly believe these when we
first heard them but there's lots of
different sources that confirm this that
we're looking at 160 or dollars per
records stolen when you average this out
and 5.4 million dollars per incident I
saw a report or while back from the
British Chamber of Commerce that said
that most small and medium-sized
businesses that actually have a data
theft have a bridge they simply don't
recover they go bus within 12 months
just the cost of the forensic team and
in the US the course you've got the
whole class action litigation thing to
go through which is not quite as bad as
it is here but if it happens to you then
it's pretty serious so we use halt
hashing salting and encryption these are
all good things we don't suggest you
don't do that but we would argue that
that doesn't prevent the theft even even
the theft of encrypted data can trigger
the the process of having to fess up to
the authorities and it can begin that
really expensive process that goes
associated with remediation
so we believe the best thing to do is to
prevent the theft of it in the first
place not just encrypt it and hope that
nobody can decrypt it so hence to the
Turing trap we see the cause of this
problem is the universal computer
because it can do anything we tend to
use it for everything I mean why not the
economies of scale that you get from the
common solutions to common problems is
great but of course with that also goes
common vulnerabilities across all the
solutions they use it so if we look at
why the universal computer can be hacked
certainly that the features of it it has
the volume and architecture that the pc
wouldn't work if it didn't it needs to
load multiple programs but of course as
you load programs you could load malware
so there's not a lot you can get away
from that problem with that there are
attempts and there's all sorts of things
where you can set code is executing lee
but if you start with something that's
insecure and you make it secure the
malware's just got to make it unsecured
again if you can close the door if a
door can be open to then once you've
closed it it will be opened again and
permissions well if you allow
administrator special access all areas
then again if you have some successful
privilege escalation attack then and
then I always going to find a way to do
that and they're going to obtain the
same privileges so a solution to this
problem needs to prevent even the
administrator from gaining access to the
data and also we believe that the
platform itself is just so huge now like
I say my backgrounds in operating system
I and the reasons why they've bloated I
won't go into all the reasons I have
opinions on to why they have but they
just have but if you don't do you really
need a full-blown operating system on a
PC and a full-blown database just to
compare a coupler password strings you
know that's the question that we're
saying surely this could be put into a
much simpler appliance that just
performs a specific function of
authentication he doesn't need to be
quite so complex because lurking in
there all these exploits and problems
that have been there for years I mean
none you know 15 years ago some of these
exploits are in the code so
our solution that we propose and we
built one so I showed you earlier is um
is dedicated hardware and we calling
this phrase and no read hardware so um
it's an append impenetrable appliance
using hardware protection from an
operating system from an operational
standpoint it's very simple instead of
them going to a database to authenticate
your credentials you just call the
appliance you send it the username and
password and it just replies yes or no
so it can only ever reply with yes or no
or an error code it just basically gives
an 8-bit response you can send lots of
data into it but it'll only ever talk to
you back with a byte of data so we have
a proprietary protocol called snap which
would be used so the good news is the
website itself doesn't really change
visually but you're let's call it your
login dot PHP that goes off and decides
whether you'll let this person in or not
whether it will query the database
that's the place where you'll make your
code change and it will call the
appliance instead and it will simply go
yes or no reply so our protection
strategies here that we've employed so
the first thing is this term no read so
passwords can be stored and verified but
never retrieved now we're confident
about this because the solution was
quite simple we've literally omitted to
implement any logic that allows you to
read the data off so there is no
functional method and a logical method
of reading data off this device we've
created effectively a non-return valve a
data diode that allows data to go in one
direction but only allows eight bits of
data to you about the other way and that
is in force that's not something that we
don't start with an open system and
we've protected it because that could be
undone we've started with a system that
simply cannot not even the administrator
can force this box to give out more than
eight bits of data so that's pretty good
also the fact that this box as i call it
just authenticates passwords and it
doesn't need to load other programs so
we don't need to use a regular
microprocessor what we use our micro
controllers that are Harvard processors
just remind you the Harvard processors
have separate address buses for program
memory and data memory so even if you
manage to inject
code into data memory the process it
doesn't know what to do with it it
simply physically cannot execute it so
we wipe out the malware issue but that's
a biggie actually because if I were
hacking this box I would use malware as
a way of implementing a read interface
even if we didn't put one in but the
fact that you can't inject this thing
with malware gets around that particular
problem and finally well it's not a PC
and it's not an Oso of course at a
stroke all of the thousands of exploits
and vulnerabilities are out there a
wiped clean yes okay people will attack
this hackers will attack this box and
try to find other ones but by having
this smaller attack surface we're making
it much much harder and to give an
example here we're about 40 kilobytes
not not megabytes that's not a spelling
mistake 40 kilobytes of compiled code of
c++ code which we use on these
microcontrollers and most of that code
is actually to do with marshaling data
between the processes it doesn't do much
actual functionality so on so if we
don't let data off this device how the
heck do you back it up all that is a is
an issue so what we do is we we
replicate two redundant appliances so
when a what we call a write command
which is a command to be the Creator
credential or to modify credential to
change a password it effectively gets
sent to two places it gets sent to the
storage device where it's stored and
updated but it also gets mirrored over a
completely separate interface a private
network to mirror devices so that in the
event of a failure of one device of
course you immediately get redundancy
failover load balancing all those
wonderful things kind of come for free
once you go the mirroring route but
primarily we decided to go mirroring
because we thought well as if it's a no
read device it's an every device you
can't get the data off it over over the
network connection to it so quick look
at the architecture so what we have here
is um we've got three microcontrollers
it sir a system of
three calling CPUs they're actually
microcontrollers the difference being
they've got their own memory ramen and
ramen them so we have this notion of the
outside world which is most likely still
inside your data center this is where
the web server talks to the box this is
where these snap commands come in which
set and change credentials and undo
authentication so we've got a separate
processor that is dedicated to taking
that traffic decrypting it and doing
some basic checks on the packets before
forwarding it on to another processor
the main thing here is that we've
separated this out there's no shared
memory on this thing there's no DNA okay
you can't do a buffer overflow attack on
the tcp/ip stack and expect it
infiltrates some other part of memory
can't happen we've got tcp/ip on a chip
it's on another microcontroller which is
also a Harvard processor and we
communicate with that over serial a very
high-speed serial connection so we're in
control how much data we read you can't
push data into the processor that's
quite important and each of these
microcontrollers there's no shared
memory between them they will
communicate with each other over a
high-speed serial so you can't
inadvertently even if you could infect a
Harvard processor in some way you
couldn't cause that problem to spill out
to another processor on the other side
of the picture here we have the private
network and this is a completely
separate interface that we use for
mirroring and config so if you want to
configure the box so when you first
configure this box you'll want to put
your own encryption keys on you'll want
to set the administrator password that
kind of thing that's all done on the
private network can you come use those
commands on the on the outside world
network that's not possible so typically
your store and verify from commands come
in so it'll say create an account that
will come in through the outside world
processor will be decrypted will be sent
across to the central to the CPU to
there and that will get put into the
store and then it will reply back with a
yes I did it or no I couldn't do it that
kind of thing now simultaneously what's
happening is that you if it's a change
request you forward it on to another
mirror and of course there could be
stuff happening on the mirror device
that needs to come back the other way so
this cpu 3 is quite a busy thing that's
sitting there um forwarding and
receiving changes ok so that that's
fundamentally the architecture that that
we employ as far as system integration
goes it it's very straightforward you
just replace the the piece of code where
you would normally go off to your
database all your password file even to
look up the credentials that's the bit
of the changes your lung you'll obtain
the username and password guests from
the user you package it up it's
basically a TCP request you send it
across to the box it's got a secure
wrapper around it obviously you send it
across to the box and it will reply yes
or no but it's very simple integration
first integration that was done was um
we're part of bt bt marshall shims
incubator which is over in Ipswich and
now they have a customer showcase there
and they without a manual and without
anything he'd within a couple of hours
he'd got a an implementation going just
from a description that we we gave him
over the phone and he managed to get it
talking to the box so he genuinely is
very very simple to do this integration
you're not looking you're gone anyway of
we send the password resetting I don't
you know my lousy user forgot my
medicine yeah absolutely yeah so what if
you know your password you can change it
if you forget it we have the notion of
an administrator mode where if you click
on your link to say I've forgotten my
password there is a command that could
be sent to the box to say reset the
password so you can never find out what
the password was but you can force a
temporary password which the user can
then reset so yes there is a way of
doing that reasonably yes once you once
you've once we have reset our users
password it has to be reset the next
time you log in so it goes into a reset
mode weather net the first type before
you can use that password again it has
to be reset something else okay yes you
can do that yeah that's right i mean if
you go right back to the original unix
password file it was done by having salt
doing encryption and checking the
encrypted result right so nobody
actually stores passwords so how is that
you know all that you've done is move
the encryption and test function in two
separate piece of hardware it's not
clear that from a whole system point of
view changed any of the threat analysis
right yep I'm sure hopefully that down
works sorry um who asks a question hi
yeah unix passwords or any system
passwords yes in UNIX you store pass you
in cash or encrypt passwords in command
you compared the Hat the unfortunate
thing is that you can in UNIX or most
other systems you can steal that hash
table now if you still has table then
you can start computing potential
matches to the hash table now as the the
you know so the one-way function that
was originally chosen is now I'm
incredibly weak by the standards of
modern computation right it's not it's
not something fundamental well the
argument here it's actually
straightforward but I'm not disagreeing
with you by the way the sort of the
argument though is straightforward which
amounts to if you're a business and you
have that table stolen that is a data
leak event right the change here is
we're saying know what we're trying to
do is prevent that table from being
stolen so if you're a business and you
have that table stolen depending what
kind of business you are you have to
notify the appropriate authorities and
they will tell you whether or not you
will have to notify your customers
unfortunately a number of people have
actually had the table stone be told
they don't have to notify their
customers and then actually it's leaked
out anyway and they can and their
business has been damaged as a
consequence but so if you believe that
Krypton
fee is a secure enough solution which
actually I do put my hands up I believe
cryptography works but if you're a
business you still have a problem and
what we're trying to do is cool that
problem as a side effect of curing that
problem but I'll stay there because of
somebody asking a question behind you if
this is going to go into a long
discussion can we take it the end let
Roger finish can cite your basic
argument is that the operating system is
weak because of change in modification
and large but what you're now asking us
to supersize we have to trust your
software is secure and we also have to
trust your software is reliable yes
because you're mirroring if you crop one
you crook both and therefore you've
killed all your passwords absolutely so
why should why should we watch it you
trust us and why should we trust you
good question now what we're talking
about here is a very small amount of
code compared to an operating system
therefore we'd be one of two things one
to our customers at the arm to our
customers and people under nondisclosure
we are willing to publish that code
provide it to them food say to as part
if this were an academic project who's
funding cycle is different from the
commercial one we would have started by
taking it by developing this small
amount of code as verified code
unfortunately the nature of commercial
projects is you have to add
demonstrators before you get the money
that you can put into developing and to
doing things like developing verify code
so our intention is that this small
amount of code will in fact be verified
code now if you say you don't trust the
verified code that's another matter all
together in a different discussion we
can have tributes rely on positive no it
doesn't prove it's reliable you can
still get drugs using them and yeah what
we have to yep I mean how do you prove
your operating system is reliable now
I'm asking a question how do you prove
that operates existing mr. alternative
and you're not proving the alternative
is better than the current I currently
have an operating system but you're
giving me
the operating system basically saying
it's more reliable and more secure but
there's no proof it's more reliable more
secure this is Mormon that's all it is
okay I'll agree that it's no proof at
the moment that it is more reliable
there's no proof even at it let's be
fair about this let's be honest today
there's no proof he is as reliable and
should approve such a proof be
forthcoming you would accept it if I can
prove its as reliable as your current
operating system you'd accept it that's
what you're saying isn't it I'm saying
why should I change so you're saying if
I could prove it's more reliable in your
current operating system you'd accept it
now you have to prove it was because
you're mirroring you'd have to prove it
was totally alone because I'm mirroring
I have to be able to prove sorry i think
i'm missing your point here are you
saying it's not possible to produce any
mirroring system that actually is
reliable without you the problem you've
got is the fact is that us if you grew
up the database yeah you've lost all
your accounts because I'm mirroring
changes if I corrupt if I corrupt one I
corrupt the other yes and your solution
sorry i don'ts and I will talk to you
afterwards about this because i have a
little bit confused now because i don't
see how that isn't the same problem you
have with an operating system that if i
correct that if I corrupt the data that
the data is corrupted whether it also
mirroring okay come back to it I think
I'm just going back to my earlier point
the thing we're trying to do really here
is that we are just trying to reassure
the business that the that they can
avoid a data theft event that's the main
if we look at the cost going back to
those costs of having a data theft
that's the absolutely crippling cost of
a business your business is almost
guaranteed to go out of business if you
have one of those events that's actually
the things that we know we've obviously
talked to quite a lot
data center managers and potential
customers of this product and that's the
thing that's keeping them awake at night
and the thought of losing their jobs is
a data theft so yes in a sense it's a
bit like going back 20 years when cars
were stolen they put immobilizers in and
stopped cars being stolen but actually
really what happened was the thieves
just broke into people's houses and
stole the keys so the cars still got
stolen but the car manufacturers could
say yeah but you know they use the key
it wasn't that our car wasn't secure so
we're kind of going down that same road
I suppose what we're trying to do is
that the business can turn around Seoul
at work you know the data wasn't stolen
from me they they stole it from the
client that's actually not my problem
i'm sorry so it doesn't solve the whole
problem of data theft but we're just
trying to we're taking a ruthless
approach to this which is if we're going
to make any money out of this the people
that are likely to pay for the solution
are going to be businesses and the
businesses if they can avoid that
catastrophic incident of a data breach
then they'll be willing to pay money for
it and add job really is to convince
them that it's less likely for that data
to be stolen and things like the bit
that they always pick up on when I do
these pitches is this Harvard
architecture and the no read bit they
look at it and they say well yeah I can
see how that would work and that's kind
of the happier that it's likely to be a
better solution while they've got an
hour how you prove that is a very good
question but some they'll move on here
so I've talked about these snap commands
that these are the this is just an
example of some of the commands that
would come in over the public interface
so we got a very simple ping just to say
hello are you there and then its ASCII
commands it sprinkling playing and then
see to compare so that's your route you
authenticate command is simply compare
the user name with the password does it
match yes or no we've got a right you
can see we've got an update then we've
got a bunch of what we call these admin
type commands which are for housekeeping
this is a going back to the question
about how do you reset the password if
you've forgotten it there's a whole
separate set of commands which come in
over the private interface which you use
to configure the box to set the
encryption keys etc haven't shown those
but these are the typical commands that
the web server would use
talk to the box okay I'll talk a little
bit about Fido here so Fido is this fast
identity online totally Microsoft where
a member Google some of the credit card
companies the couple of stands have been
proposed here so Fido UTF is really a
way of them using existing user names
and passwords but supplementing it with
some kind of physical device and this
will be implemented through kind of web
browser extensions so we think Fido you
to F great idea we don't have a problem
with that because you're still going to
have to store your username and password
somewhere so that doesn't cause that's
the problem in fact this is actually a
particularly good solution because for
me it makes the authentication much more
secure and we can provide the business
with a secure way of storing the
usernames and passwords so so we like
that photo uaf this is an interesting
one this is kind of build as you know
the death of the password well in
reality we don't see that being the case
at all because certainly it makes it
easier for the user they don't have to
use a username and password to
authenticate anymore but you do have
this bootstrap problem that you know you
can't add a device and you can't use a
device to add a device you have an added
yet so you're always going to have to
have a username and password to login
then you go to a registration process
where you add your device and from then
on that's fantastic because you can use
that device to authenticate but on the
occasion where you lose that device you
can have to go in and revoke the old
device at a new one so you've got to
have a way of logging in I know Fido UF
suggest that you have two devices but I
before I did this business I used to run
an online training company in one of the
problems we had was you know support and
i can tell you i would never be put in a
situation where i use a good phone me up
at three o'clock in the morning saying
I've lost my device you know I can't get
into my website you're always going to
have to provide a way of getting in
which means it's going to have to be the
username a password but the username a
password won't be used regularly it'll
just be something that you would use to
access your account to do the
registration revocation and of course
there'll be legacy devices around there
for a while that'll still need to be
used so we think it's a bit disingenuous
to say the passwords disappear with uaf
we believe that the nature
of them changes that they just become a
kind of an account management event as
opposed to something that you use
multiple times a day to get into your
devices so again we would argue when we
go in to see our customers we say Fido
uaf great idea but you're still going to
have to protect those account management
passwords which you aren't used as much
but they still got to be protected and
if they're stolen that triggers the
whole event of disclosure and you're
right back to square one with your
potential 160 m dollar per incident cost
so Fido we're okay with par fighter
actually and then you've got your your
more traditional multi-factor
authentication which is what we refer to
as the kind of more centralized storage
model this is that there's a whole
variety of these solutions out there
some of them literally store the
thumbprint centrally more often they'll
do some kind of template analysis on the
thumb print and then send effectively a
template to the device to and to be
stored so again we it's just another
password it's just not a text one and
also the verification algorithm is
different it's not a simple compare its
it's more complicated but some we see on
our roadmap fine you want to use
biometrics that's great they've got to
be stored somewhere and again you might
argue well what can they do with it with
a thumb print if they steal it well its
data theft data has been stolen from the
business they've got to disclose it so
any data public keys I mean what I'll go
back to fido photo stores you know
public keys what use is a public key if
you haven't got the private key but if a
public key gets stolen there's still an
argument that it's data that's been
stolen from a business it seems really
harsh from the businesses point of view
they will argue strongly but what can
you do with this data they'll say yeah
but you've had a day to bridge so you
have to go through the whole process and
this is really what's really worrying
them and this is the thing that we've
latched on to is that this is one of
those unfair problems from a business
point of view so the business is simply
got to try and stamp out this theft
because if they can't they might
unfairly be liable for having to
disclose the theft
something that you could argue with what
can I do with it so obviously we're
making some quite major claims how to
reprove this well one of the things
we've done this isn't proof as such but
it's um we've got a hacker challenge and
because when we talk to businesses they
say well you know what do you prove
points well we're only just going into
beta now by the end of the summer we
hope to have some businesses that will
have said yeah we've used the system
appears to work it performs well we
haven't you know we believe it's secure
but we decided let's have a hacker
challenge so this is a bit of fun it's a
chance to get a bit of publicity to for
us and every time you know the North
Koreans go out and do something we try
and hijack that and we we offer some
prize of you know 10 million North
Korean currency which it turns out to be
about 750 pounds because of the exchange
rate but it sounds good and against us a
bit of pref covering press coverage we
have to do these things but we've had a
couple of thousand num visitors and a
one and a quarter million hacks so this
is just something that's ongoing I know
you will say this is not serious proof
but it's a proof point of sorts so um
here's a kind of a roadmap on mentioning
this just to say really that even if you
think passwords are kind of history and
they're going to disappear we see that
this there's no read concept this idea
of having hardware limitation to data
that can come off a device we think that
this thing has a legs and that it can be
applied to other things biometrics I've
mentioned Fido credit cards is an
interesting one obviously the credit
card data has to leave at some point to
go to the clearing banks so they know
the transactions occurred but a
variation on on a no read server is a
selective read service so that you can
send data into the device and the
transaction can be reported to the
clearing bank through a completely
separate interface so you can't come
back in from the public interface and
try and pull that data route because the
hardware physically restricts you but
you could have a separate interface that
talks to the clearing bank to send them
the transaction details and then we've
got some ideas about database to protect
the idea of a secure no sequel database
where you can have selective reads and
selectively sending of data and which
when talks with channel for about that
particular
dear they're quite answer than that so
um just a summary so we believe that you
know software on PCs if it's not our
architecture if it's prone to malware
what can you do it's nobody's fault you
can have the most secure application if
you want you can have a very very secure
operating system if you want at the end
of the day the processor is what it is
so there's always going to be ways of
attacking it we believe if you can
actually have no read hardware where the
hardware itself just will not let that
data come back out and with all that if
we can prove that that non-return valve
is functioning then this has got to be
something surely worth looking at and
back to this point that solving the root
cause of the problem the data theft is
the key thing here because if even if
encrypted data is stolen that more often
than not triggers this event where you
have to report and fess up to the
authorities so we think that's a problem
that's worth solving ok thank you so if
there's any more questions one of the
problems for businesses can be unfairly
judged in case of data set but isn't a
set of a single answer yes more one of
the questions the gives you a descent as
well so isn't it the same case what you
you do you mean the fact the tub that
you can learn something about there's
yeah I gonna do a server isn't this
going to the same realm for business I
see the point you're making yes but um
that what what they're concerned about
is the if you can share a tangible piece
of data that's been stolen from storage
is the thing that triggers the event I
think yes or to the point you're making
that that you if you you learn something
about the integrity of that database
simply by asking the question no it's
not that password right now I know
something about that but yes that is a
that's true but what the what we're
talking about here really is that some
data has physically been stolen actual
data that was taken from a user and
stored rather than the leaking of of
data that could reveal the contents
basically the ability to link piece of
later to a particular to a particular
identity so if I can link if you're in
the states if I if I get the social
security number that's a data leak if i
get if i can link it to your identity
big list social security numbers
obviously more useful if i can make it
to your identity it is useful and that's
the general criteria that you actually
gets you is killer link it to an
identity querying the box now this is a
reasonable question you know there are
you know billion possible passwords and
I've just tried one I know it's not that
i know this user is not that password
most organizations will say you don't
have something that's particularly
that's little to an identity fortunately
it is an issue there for a formal proof
yes yes and i will say on the matter of
formal proof the motion of what
constitutes and proof in the concert in
the situation where you're doing with
passwords of get because it's exactly
you cannot think the case you're to it
you you always get some information so
if you take sort of standard models of
things like non-interference then they
don't work because long to fear it says
you get no information testing a pass
where you get some information so you've
got to formulate the proof slightly
differently sorry okay good and in
hardware protection around the password
database is one way of raising a
particular kind of bar against
particular kinds of attacks I think you
need to be careful when you presented
that you don't kind over egg it and it's
a number of ways in which you know I
just get concerned about the way you're
presenting this so one is since the
invention of return oriented programming
hardware architecture does not help you
okay because the attacker does not need
to inject code to take controls machine
that's true so
so all you should be extremely clear
because of the way out of what you said
today gives the impression especially to
a non-technical if you were presenting
this to a business audience rather than
technical audience gives the impression
that holodeck Tedric magically solves
the problem of tacos taking control of
the machine which they do not secondly
in a real environment you have to you
know as you pointed out you have to
replicate these devices in case of
failure the replication has got to be
you distributed for any real serious
customer and that means your private
interface actually has to be on top of a
VLAN provided by the data center
operator including wide area links
provided by some other operator and
that's another whole issue of you know
you've kind of described it yes
obviously again this defense in depth
fair again that's clearly not the
intended network on which attacker
traffic would be but it's clear that
it's not just simply pointing you at
crossover cable between two boxes right
that are on the shelf and then finally
this the whole question of well the
point of having the password is that it
protects something and what you've done
it perhaps is raise the bar around the
the password but it's not clear if you
look at the holes from a whole system
point of view it's not you've made the
system any stronger the summer there's a
piece of code is asking your box
questions and getting answers and either
that link between that component and
your boxes subject to attack or subject
to being spied on or the piece of code
is asking the questions can be tricked
to ask the wrong questions or the actual
piece of code that is asking the
questions can be trip to not ask the
questions and so from a larger whole
system point of view you know we're
protecting if to use your car stealing
analogy you know you're protecting the
bitter end the locket in the car you're
not protecting the whole car okay well
to respond to that last point first and
fun we're talking to business customers
were normally quite clear about this
and I don't think we've been quite clear
about this the objective of what we're
doing is prevention of bulk pass with
theft from backing store but that is the
song we're not making claims beyond that
now because and the reason for doing
that it is because it's a real issue for
businesses today jumping down to your
first thing about return oriented
programming good thing to raise and two
things about that being aware of return
oriented programming as a possibility
you can attempt to minimize the
opportunities for that actually taking
place and part of that is actually
having a minimum code surface and
minimizing the number and let's say
being very careful how you actually
carry out the coding and the way that
you actually use procedure calls in the
languages a way that you're actually
using the stack right and that is
something that we actually have been
concerned about they don't normally talk
about second thing about returning to
programming and just as the fort studies
the last studies i read on this about
how much you need to get universal and
to get a universal machine out of you
how much code ought to be in the system
before you can get a expect to get a
universal machine equivalent and by
returner engine programming is just was
your usually looking around for a system
which is around day ah let's see about a
million lot about a million large
receive antennas enough establish a rock
your sanity one time is enough if your
programming in c is enough in your
runtime for the rob gadget that's the
current safety out all right well i we i
don't think there's an what I'm not
saying that you should solve the rock
problem no no thing I thought when you
present this it's like algebra
architecture raises the bar
yeah it's excellent that it does it's in
the same way that Intel's data execution
prevention a number of other similar
techniques attempt on a more traditional
architecture to likewise raise the
borders in their lab can I shoot not
avoid yeah can I kind of see question
because this is worth following up for
me sure um the standard c runtime is
enough yes are we talking about in
standard c ram the standard c runtime on
a bare metal machine or a standard c
runtime running on top of an OS aaron
machine bear little okay but we can
have a reference no but em again man
behind people's keep you referenced
again where it is filled in my thing i
would say is we've there is no logic on
there which caters for the fact that the
data can come off the way that it went
in so it's not a case of tricking the
box into executing that routine that
that would activate that in lieu of the
administrator doing it there is no you
know no mechanism that we've put in
there to allow that no it will come what
out basically is talking about is this
internal into programming the other
scene is where you basically trick the
stack yes yes so you're using code which
is already the abs are using codes were
there so you're quite right that we
don't actually have that the question is
whether there are nuff fragments that
you can trick the stack so that you can
build up whatever program you like yes i
was attacking this from a whole system
point of view the attack will always go
for the weakest link Oh indeed what
you've done here is you know put a very
detailed protection point protection and
Ryan the password database which is fine
but the attack it just means the
attackers going to look somewhere else
in the overall system oh we accept that
so the depressing thing about sort of
solving any particular problem is it
just means that the problem moves
elsewhere yes it is the squeezing the
balloon and but as long as when we
squeeze that balloon the problem goes
outside the data center preferably where
it goes away from the businesses
liabilities what we're attempting to
achieve here and I'm I mean coming back
to the you know yes you could if you
threw enough processing power that you
can put your attentions on actually
cracking encrypted traffic but there's
just easy ways of doing it so we're just
trying to raise this bar to make it so
much harder that the hackers will just
go somewhere else and that's really what
businesses are trying to do they're
looking at the headlines they're getting
their CEOs saying to them you know I've
just read this hack this morning in in
the register is this going to be a
problem for us and so if we're trying to
we're praying on their anxieties and
trying to say we'll look you do this
it'll be more secure and I think I'm
certainly we have come across some
people will be spoken to businesses that
there are overwhelmed by this and they
just say look if I can't solve the
problem it's not worth it and what that
you could take that approach but we
would then counter arguable that's a bit
defeatist we would say that if you can
make it more secure and you move the
problem somewhere else then you've
improved that I think if you it would be
very difficult to say to your users that
I didn't implement something that would
have made it more secure just because
problems too big to solve I think you
have got that governance issue which the
kind of CEOs and Chairman's kind of
worried about and a lot of the sum of
the inquiries that we've had have come
top down not not bottom up from the
techies looking at this thing yeah
actually this would be useful it has
come from concerned chairman and CEO s
that just reading these stories and
panicking a bit missing all we can help
you there so that that's really what
we're trying to that sounds a bit
merciless but you know how do you make
money out of security it's one of those
things that people expect but don't
really want to spend any money on is I
would like a lot of things but if we can
give some confidence that we've moved
this problem away from the business then
we consider it to be job done if we can
make some money along the way then we'll
be very happy with that so
the crew putas of that board sorry but
the true blood of the board how many
bathrooms can you check per second oh
and the beta board at the moment we're
looking at about a hundred
authentications a second on app on our
beta board this is the beta board that
we have here about 100 verifications
about 150 a second that's per board that
the the ball that we've got at the
moment we before we go to final
production we're going to put faster
we're running just an 80 megahertz
processor sounds like that's nothing but
when all you're doing is shoving a bit
of data and doing a compare that's
actually plenty of processing power we
haven't got to worry about plug-and-play
events or anything like that you know
this is raw processing power we've got
there but we're looking at for 500
megahertz processors we're also the the
access to the data store at the moment
is um because we're a start-up we can't
afford to license the libraries that go
with the sum of the multimedia
interfaces so we're using a single in a
single bit interface to the memory card
but we'll be able to use a parallel
interface which will give us eight times
at a throughput so there's a whole lot
of optimizations that will do to the
board to make it run much faster that we
haven't done to start with because we
just it's a it's a cost thing to be us
but we're very confident you can improve
should also say about data rates when
we've talked to businesses it's
verification authentications checks are
very infrequent so the if one business
we talk to which has 30 million users
it's a retail online retail business in
this country that it's a ticketing firm
and it basically has one authentication
every two seconds when you average it
out the problem is out when talking to
customers and potential customers is
finding out what they've burst rates are
and that's usually they don't have data
and that is a bit of a problem right
rates again tend to be very low but we
don't have burst rate data for right
rates rights tend to be somewhat slower
than read than authentications and so
that is a bit of a problem for us at the
moment then it's actually working with
beta customers at the moment to try and
get data on what rates they actually
were looking at one thing I could just
add going back to this point of them how
secure this thing really is and one of
the ways that we're looking of selling
this and charging for it is fed initial
conversations with insurance companies
so you could effectively sell this as an
insurance cell so it comes down to what
are we willing to guarantee and what's
the probability of there being a theft
from this box versus another system and
what are they when this question comes
up on the proof points the way I
normally challenged it is I say well if
you talk to the if you talk to the guys
that put your database system together
that's running on that the next system
that you've got will they ask them the
question will they guarantee you that
the data can't be stolen and they will
say well of course not they say well we
will offer you a guarantee that the data
can't be stolen over that connection to
it now the reason we would be willing to
give that guarantee is that yes there
are potentially in theory some ways that
you could get the data out of this but
we believe it's so improbable and the
insurance companies we're talking to
share that view that this is pretty
secure all of the normal attempts that
you would normal attacks that you would
present to this box shouldn't work
therefore if I was going to give an
insurance policy on data theft I would
insist that this box was installed yeah
that's what we're trying to do with our
discussions with insurance companies so
so we would literally sell it as a you
buy this thing in and will indemnify you
against one hundred and sixty dollars
per record insurance can't you would
look at the risk of it and say well if
it's in one of these boxes that risk is
massively reduced therefore that so
that's kind of a way of us getting it's
a way of providing a guarantee meaning
because what guarantee actually doesn't
mean one hundred percent a guarantee
means if something goes wrong what do
you do for me you'll compensate me in
some way and we would feel confident
that we could give a degree of guarantee
that a system another system that
doesn't offer this hardware
ocean wouldn't even want to go there
they couldn't begin to offer any
guarantees there because so much of it
is out of their control it's not their
operating system it's not their hardware
so that's an interesting angle that
we're looking at how much we charged
with this oh we're working that out at
the moment as much as we possibly can
which means them well what we have been
doing is we've been talking to business
a preferred method would be to charge
for either the number of authentications
all the number of records stored that
would be the preferred method the
customers that are shown the most
interest in this at the moment of
financial services organizations mostly
because they have the highest reporting
requirements they just have to report
everything that happens around data
theft their preference unfortunately at
the moment is to purchase boxes and so
although you know when you're a startup
you'll take your money where you can so
i have no doubt that the first few sales
that we will get will just be selling
boxes for X thousand pounds of boxes you
know per box it will sell a system that
will come to a price and the alternative
pricing we would prefer would be
effectively to rent them a box or to
charge for use because and also i would
say at the moment most of the customers
we're talking to prefer to have the
boxes in their data centers we would
ideally like to produce a cloud version
of this where you could have
authentication you know ideas a service
i'll see that's going to have a lot more
challenges because of the public
environment that is in York you're open
immediately to DDoS attacks and all the
other things that you don't get behind
the firewall in the data center so we
realize that that's a different type of
product that would ultimately be what we
would like to do because what's he
federated passwords and putting hundred
million passwords all in one place is
quite a big risk and that's the way
we're headed you know with password
Federation it's a big risk to put it all
there if you can um if you can be
confident that those passwords can't be
stolen though from that database that's
got to be a useful thing you know that
would reduce the liability and so the I
mean what is it 1.2 billion passwords in
your foot you know a facebooker trying
to protect their if they felt that they
could enhance the protection it's got to
be worth some money to them well I mean
you can't
as we're at Microsoft you have to
mention a zip and you know the microsoft
business in story other people's
passwords and you know the sort of
whatever the protection actually is
around 20 I around that business at the
moment if and what say it will happen
but if at any point that Microsoft lose
say an encrypted database a part of
usernames and passwords that's storing
for other people that is going to be
significant bad publicity for Microsoft
and possibly impact the azure business I
don't know what the other businesses
like at the moment but it's the kind of
thing that actually becomes an issue
that one's going to think about ebay is
missing one that and within a week or so
i think was within two weeks a very
short period of the going public on the
ebay announcement they issued a revenue
warning to the markets of 200 million
reduction just in the lack of
transaction that's that went on an ebay
following the aftermath of the the
concerns about that so this that i can
kind of see how you get to this 4.6
million average cost it's when you look
at large global corporations that just
have a little bit of do if you're in the
Sony Playstation one which of course was
the first one really that kicked this
off that system is offline for weeks
they believe the final bill is going to
be around two billion dollars for that
data theft just that original attack on
the sony playstation network is it's
mind-boggling amounts of money so this
is where we're sitting in the boardrooms
looking at this they're thinking if they
can reduce their exposure to this
problem that's going to be good enough
they're not overly concerned if it
completely solved it as long as it just
gets it out of their backyard and makes
it someone else's problem i know this i
keep apologizing this sound this sounds
terrible but that's the fact it and if
we can if we can help them help convince
them that it's going to be more secure
doing it this way than them hopefully
will what will make a living out of it
but the jury's out on that at the moment
I'm afraid let's hope
use this for you know this kind of I
cannot read my data I think because I
say that you know stealing credit cards
that's very important but you know you
have to read them somehow so do you have
other uses for this kind of things
rather than just classrooms yep to the
roadmap yes yes so um I think we've got
I can just quickly get back to this yeah
this slide yeah there's another we do
see a whole kind of potential roadmap of
products are based on there's no read
idea and a modification around no no
read so another one is some the idea of
no change so if you have a effectively
think of a syslog server that you can
write data to but it can't be changed
effectively a dynamic cd-rom effectively
you know you can write data to this box
if this in this particular case you
might allow people to read data route
but you could never allow them to modify
it so it would be effectively a no
change server using similar techniques
where you know what data goes in but you
can't allow them to go in in Temple with
the results that was suggested it was
actually a UK bank that suggested that
to us because they're saying that one of
the problems they have during data
thefts is that the kind of hackers are
they're dealing with they come in disarm
the intrusion system so that there's no
logging that's going on or attempt to
steal the data and then put the system
back again you know true kind of mission
impossibles type stuff it sounds sounds
unlikely but that that's the kind of
thing they're telling us so he liked the
idea of a temp proof serve and that's
that's a variation on this the credit
card one is interesting because the data
does need to leave the box but this
notion of having the public interface
where the credit card details would come
in and be stored through through this
non-return valve if you like you you
can't get the credit card details back
out of there but you can then have a
private connection to the clearing bank
using all of your normal clever
encryption to make it less likely that
that transaction that data is going to
be stolen from the back end there but
the public interface coming in you
wouldn't be able to get the credit cards
back out the way they went in so yes it
so we do see variants on this
okay I think we're just about out of
time let's get these Pickers just in
case you want to contact us at all with
any follow-up questions on there are
email details and you can always follow
