you
all right good afternoon so today
bullosa van will tell us about economics
of repeated sales okay thanks you all so
this talk is about a really basic
economic sitting repeated interaction so
the setting is really simple you have a
single seller who is offering a fresh
copy of an item every day to the same
buyer okay so think of fishmonger was
offering fresh fish every day the bios
who enjoys consuming fish and the buyer
has some value which is private only he
knows it for consuming the fish and the
value is the same every day it doesn't
change but initially this values assumed
to be drawn from a publicly known
distribution meaning that the seller
also knows the distribution right once
it is drawn it remains the same every
day yeah and the seller has a cost which
is public and here we normalize it 2-0
okay it doesn't change things in setting
is really simple so this happens for n
days each day the seller comes talks to
the bias towards the rule of the game
the seller can post a price on every day
that's all okay the buyer is basically a
now to take it or leave it if it takes
it pay the price happens where it is
okay so so we call it the fishmongers
problem after our most fear suggested
this name to us okay so let's look at
the most basic wish maccas problem one
day interaction right so you have a
seller and a buyer right the buyers
values private he knows it but for the
seller is drawn from this distribution
now what happens right you have to post
some price clearly the seller post
surprised p the buyer lacks f it only
fits values above the price right you
should do it if and only if so it's the
seller is maximizing the quantity price
times the probability that the value
exceeds the price which for the uniform
distribution is clear that it should be
price of half and he'll similarity
accepted or rejected and get a revenue
of exactly a quarter the buyer doesn't
the hammer yeah okay so what happens if
you have a two-day interaction right
between the send another buyer so again
the value size the value remains the
same for the two days otherwise there is
nothing to do here the value is getting
freshly drawn ability you know the
seller obviously is interested in
collecting as much information as
possible about the buyers value from the
first sale the buyer on the other hand
is very inclined to hide his value
because the seller will exploit it if he
knows what this value right so water
transfer the two days right something
happened on the first day something up
on the second day so what's the revenue
right as the question he asked you the
stock okay so clearly what what's the
problem right what is the buyer afraid
of the buyer is supper afraid of the
fact that the seller will exploit the
knowledge of this value right suppose
the seller can pacify the buyer by
saying that I am NOT going to exploit if
the seller can commit that in all the
future days this is the price and he
reveals it to the first day if he has
the power to commit then one thing that
the seller could do is a following on
the first day he puts a price of a half
and it commits on the first day itself
that regardless of whether you accept or
reject and going to put the price of a
half of the second day also right then
it's clear the revenue for two days is
just two times the revenue for one day
so half the same token the revenue for
nds is just in our for okay I am going
to call this as the meyerson optimal
revenue benchmark ok so the single day
optimal is a very special case of
madison's mechanism which is what is the
single day optimal thing thus we call
this my sorta very much part so if the
seller were able to give this commitment
that i am not going to exploit you the
situation is very clear you have a nice
revenue linearly growing revenue but
realistically the seller is often not
able to commit to this kind of a price
sequence after is very difficult to
resist the temptation of lowering a
price if you think the bias buyer is not
buying or to raise the price if you
think that he is capable of buying
right in any case the buyer is not
willing to believe that the seller will
not succumb to this temptation okay so
what will happen in this case so you
have no commitment for the seller about
future prices so what do you think will
happen right yes how many people think
that the seller extracts the entire
value of the buyer right so he was that
eventually right so he slowly learns
interacts and at some point as a number
of rounds goes to infinity you get
almost entire value who thinks that what
in the Bible you generate the way I can
only say yes or no every round that's it
you can see here go he could do anything
you post any price I can say yes or no
arbitrarily no rules that I should do
something in fact cepted a hired by
search widget or anything what does the
value bars are you what's the role of
ours value in this apparent do anything
no I mean the buyer can do he principle
he can do anything but his he wants to
maximize his utility at the end of the
game which is his value for consuming
the fish over in days minus the price he
paid and the utility is additive over
well there is no loss fish there is no
loss yes but he gains something if he
consumes and pays price lesser than his
value right so do you think that at the
end of this interaction seller will
eventually know everything are that it
does not matter it whether you can
commit or not I will get exactly Martin
octave revenue or that you will get
something even lesser than my ass an
optimal
and so but what is the pile just kind of
maximize the right buyer is trying to
maximize his own happiness which is
which we measured by his utility just
additive over round and in each round
the utility is the value for consuming
the fish minus the price he paid when
you say silicon or carbon to future
price he cannot sign up on tight or
something there's no contact correct but
you said I to move it tell you the price
but today I don't know yes anything
could happen tomorrow
I think solution you can disadvantage
are there given that you're asking this
dancer is probably see ya okay sorry
happy but the proof is very simple and
cute okay suppose there was an
equilibrium right where equilibrium is a
pair of strategies of the seller and the
buyer where each one is mutually best
responding to the other right if you
give me this equilibrium and tell me
that there is an equilibrium where you
can extract more than myosin optimal
revenue right then and you know I can
use it to get a one-round mechanism
where I get more than a quarter and here
is out worse you give me this mechanism
and here is a one-round mechanism the
one round I'll ask the buyer to report
is true value to me they will say that I
will simulate this perfect beige in
equilibrium I will define what an
equilibrium is but for now will simulate
the equilibrium then pick a day at
random and whatever transpired on that
day is basically going to be the result
of today which means if you bought on
that day you better buy it today and pay
the price that felt on that day right
now clearly if you got a revenue more
than n over 4 in the P equilibrium you
give me strictly then in the if a pic a
day uniform the front of you are going
to get a revenue strictly more than a
quarter which is not possible that is
known so that's it but the surprising
fact is not just that you cannot get
more than my turn off till revenue you
get far far lesser than this okay for
most distributions the revenue doesn't
even grow with n okay does it even grow
with the number of days of interaction
in equilibrium we will see what the
equilibrium is but this is known this is
not our result so to get a sense of know
what's going on this let's begin with
two rounds and play and see what happens
so again the seller cannot commit to
future prices so the first day let us
say he puts a price of p1 yeah and the
second day so this is my notation the
subscript is the day and 0 means that
the buyer rejected on the first day and
one means he accepted right game 3 now
what should the buyer to right let's
think of a simple-minded by her for now
right the buyer will reject if is value
smaller than some threshold T and it
will accept if the value is larger than
that so if he rejects right then the
seller if he follows this strategy V is
the buyers value diversity is some
threshold so it doesn't depend on the
price for a given extra no no it will
depend on the price t is a function of
all the prices unity is a function of
the price of the first day and so
there's a whole strategy here right so
this buyer has all the tree in his might
as well as strategy is basically the
price in the first round and what you do
upon rejection acceptance etcetera the
buyer strategy is to say what I will do
the first round are you do all those
things you're analyzing it piece by
piece great your question well its
decision on day one I don't see how in
depend on the prices on page here he
says another no but I mean the point of
an equilibrium is that after having
played this game for a long time
basically the buyer has the tree he can
see the pre basically did not return
somewhere but he can see that is a
lighter strokes okay for playing for a
long time so you're in searching for an
equilibrium you can think that the buyer
knows the seller's randomized strategy
and response to that so so the seller so
in other words if the buyer if given the
seller strategy the buyer could do
something better then you're not gonna
colibri and what is it will remain
virtually anything so equilibrium is
that matter if it's tore the whole game
okay the whole two day so I'm going to
define so I'm going to come to that
actually i'm going to formally define
what the equilibrium is etc but for now
basically it's it just say that just
assume that the buyer can see the entire
strategy the seller right so you can see
this price of course you can see this
price before reacting and let's say that
he can also see these things which i
will say what the game is not about it
so you can see those things right
then we will come up with some threshold
T and then if the value smaller he'll
reject and the value of larger he'll
accept in which was that you known on
day two he basically has to accept or
reject just based on the value on the
price because values greater than the
price he accepts other way she rejects
right this is for day one now if this
were in equilibrium right for instance
one of the conditions that has to be
true is that if the buyer follow the
strategy of rejecting winners value is
smaller than T then the seller should
update is belief about the distribution
to be uniform 0t and which means the
price on this day should be t over to
right you can deduce this and similarly
if you accept if we greater than t you
better update the distribution to
uniform t1 and it is not difficult to
calculate what the optimal prices again
it smacks of half aunty can calculate
right so these are all necessary
conditions for equilibrium not
sufficient but these are necessary now
this is true what can we say from this
alone the one thing that is true is the
buyer whose value is exactly equal to
the threshold should be indifferent
between rejecting and accepting now if
you rejects right he gets to buy just on
day two at a price of tea over to right
so that is this utility t minus T over
to his values tea prices tio2 if he
accepts he gets to buy on both these
days right and his utility is t minus p1
on the first day and the second day he
doesn't get any in today because the
prices you know at least the threshold T
right the sellers knows this information
so this left-hand side utility after
rejecting should be equal to the right
hand side utility so this will give p1
is T over 2 i'm not saying this is the
equilibrium this is one we are guessing
basically great we just the process
guessing and you can write the
expression for revenue purely as a
function of T optimize it it will come
out to be 0 point 6 in other words I am
saying this is a guess that we have come
up with for an equilibrium for two
rounds the price on the first day is
point 3 and the buyer rejects if this
value is smaller than 0 point 6 ok not
point 3 but point 6
and accepts if the value is greater than
point six okay then you have this and
you can calculate the revenue to be 9
over 20 if you remember the myosin
optimal revenue as two times a quarter
which is a half just ten percent smaller
than my it's not over for half yeah I
didn't say why it is in equilibrium yet
but it is something but this still
doesn't look too bad right this is still
only temperatures smaller but things
change dramatically from three rounds
onwards so before going to three rounds
i will now formalize what a perfect
beige in equilibrium is okay so if there
is no commitment then how do you reason
about the game he said that the game's
outcome will be governed with this
perfect base in equilibrium so what is
perfection so perfectness means that the
strategies of the seller and the buyer
are in equilibrium that is are in mutual
best response for every sub game okay so
one round has transpired something has
happened in that round then there is a
new game know you're in a new situation
the belief has changed for this belief
the strategy should again be in
equilibrium that is perfection and
bayesian means that the seller updates
is beliefs consistently according to
buyer strategies right now i'll give you
two objects in hand by our strategy and
seller strategy given the buyer strategy
your belief updates about the
distribution should be consistent with
the buyer strategy and the cellular
strategy itself should be optimal given
his beliefs okay so in other words in
full glory cellular strategies as
follows it should specify the price to
be posted on the first run for two
rounds and specifying this price on the
first round then for every possible
price he could have posted on the first
round he should tell you what is the
price you will post on the second round
if the buyer rejects this price of x
what will the but you know what is the
price of the second round if the buyer
accepts this price of x yeah now let's
think about this clearly a strategy
should specify the price on the first
round the second round rejection
acceptance why is it that we should
specify every know why is it we should
specify the price in the second round
for every possible price on the first
round right so for doing this you have
to put yourself in the shoes of the
verifier right I gave you a pair of
objects called strategies and you or
your goal is to verify that these are
mutual best responses
what all information do you need to do
this so if I tell you that the price on
the first round is p1 you have to see
why can t put puter price is different
from p1 some X right so this three see
this you have to know how the buyer will
react for a price of X for every X right
so then the buyer strategy should tell
you for every possible price X in every
possible history what he'll do right now
this is the strategy of the buyer gave
you better verify that the buyer is best
responding by the strategy which means
if the buyer is saying at the price of X
I will react like this you should ask
him why did you react like this because
then he will tell you I reacted like
this because if ur to pipe seller puts a
price of X in the first round then this
is the price on the second row after
acceptance and rejection then that
better be a part of the seller strategy
okay so that's why in full glory this is
the strategy from this is a backward
induction manner you can verify that
this is a perfect bajan equal from the
last round I will verify that the buyer
strategies are a best response for the
seller strategies sellers Billy beliefs
are consistently updated given by a
strategies and seller strategies or
optimal given pious beliefs okay there
is a circularity here yeah beliefs are
consistent given strategies and
strategies or optimal given beliefs so
you can't compute a perfect beige and
equilibria very fate ok you can only
verify it if I give you something you
can go and verify yes you can verify
here ok so this is what so there will be
is a committed the old fire in the
cellar with y'all right it will be
better off if they commit yes yes they
were they yeah right exactly so if
basically the set buyer is not willing
to believe that the seller will not
succumb to temptation that's it so is it
clear like a more resistance or
something what do you have to go to
right I'm going to talk about existe
there's a big hammer theorem which a set
for every game there always exists at
vbe but the question is the nicety of
the PBE the perfect base in equilibrium
could be horrible but how nice it is
that's basically the starting point of
this work ok ok so this is what a
perfect beige in 2 is 40 right I'm going
to cover yeah that's exactly so so this
is what previous work says right so they
analyzed finite horizon n rounds they
can
just to point distributions right buyers
value is lower high for this they said
that for all except the last few rounds
right the few I mean a constant number
of rounds independent of n the price in
the first initial n minus constant
rounds is the lowest point of the
tribunal here it is l ok now Schmitz
basically generalizes to arbitrary
discrete distributions it let L be the
lowest point to the support of the
distribution then what he showed was
that the PB is guaranteed to exist
according to some big hammer theorem and
it every PBE and archer over that if the
l a-- nation of break the unknown right
and the seller is going to price at low
prices sets of en yes which means he
won't even find out whether you could
have saw the higher price until yeah yes
I don't understand that doesn't seem
like washing yeah but the thing is this
is basically what equilibrium tickets
right if you if you want all the
conditions that are specified in the
previous slide Oh to go through every
tire yes I see only a big and basically
this is generalized not just for two
point distribution for arbitrary
discrete distributions again the seller
will be posting the small price of L for
all X at the last rose this is he said
it means extremely bad deal for the
seller right if this is unnatural and
you do not expect this in practice also
why right so here is one possible
explanation for this ok so we show the
following so we posit that a threshold
equilibrium is what constitutes natural
equilibrium by a threshold equilibrium I
mean what we just saw for the two rounds
case right the buyer rejects if is value
smaller than something and accepts value
is larger than something right a non
threshold equilibrium means that I'll
except for some set of values and then I
reject and then I will accept and things
like this right seems unnatural for
several reasons to us from the buyers
point of view and also from the seller
this would mean that these belief is
basically supported on fragmented
intervals rate if the buyer rejects and
i will say that probably is values
between 0 &amp;amp; 1 5th with some probability
have
one thirds and to thousands of property
have this kind of a belief will happen
if it is not threshold so if we agree
that threshold equilibria are natural
equally and just look at them and we
characterize exactly when the threshold
equilibrium exists okay so we show that
threshold equilibrium exists only for
those distributions for which the two
round game has an equilibrium where the
first round has the price of l by the
way the two round game always has a
threshold alypium it's not just for
uniform 0 l is the low point of the
distribution lowest point in the support
of the distribution arbitrary
distributions but the lowest point in
the support of the distribution is hell
okay if you have an equilibrium for the
two round game where the first round
prize is l only for such precisely for
such distributions is there a PB ii in
threshold strategies okay otherwise a PB
does not exist basically that is the
problem in this game no natural
equilibria exist and this kind of almost
never happens I believe it there are
some distributions you can construct for
which this is true but for instance for
the uniform 01 we just saw and it is
essentially the uniquely shoulder
equilibrium unique equilibrium also the
first one price was point 3 right it's
not 0 0 0 minus generation okay so this
is not quite satisfying so you know you
look at a natural equilibrium this
doesn't exist there's no commitment game
looked at what could happen if you allow
partial commitment right so the seller
says that I will not raise the price
right that much guarantee I can give you
are not exploit but I could lower the
price in the future okay so some sense
decreasing the price is beneficial both
to the buyer of the seller right the
seller is doing it because it is
benefiting even the buyer in any case is
happy to accept a lower price so
basically what we are saying is
liquidation sales are allowed right one
side is fine other side you can't raise
the price if this were the case this
commitment can be given credibly then we
show that threshold equilibria guarantee
to exist unique threshold equilibrium
for most distributions and for the so
for the uniform 01 revenue we can
analytically calculate what the revenue
is it goes from constant
the square root n over 2 in the unique
threshold equilibrium that exists for
uniform 01 okay so you can compute this
for any distribution it is easy to write
a program but analytically it is not
possible to do for every distribution so
I took uniform 01 and you will get this
Levin who as opposed to a constant but
still much lower still much lower than
the myosin obtained great so why would
these fire be more willing to accept
such a commitment than the other
commandment which she said it wouldn't
accept this so
I am taking that as a rule of the game
and the driving what happens so this is
supposed to the room area so the
progress of this seller the seller can
give a coupon to the buyer guarantees
that you can come I'm telling if you buy
today at this price here's a coupon that
allows you to buy at this price every
day for the next a nice but the
commitment that I won't lower the price
is less credible because it's a kind of
promise which you know it's a people who
tend to say well now i have give you a
special deal and and that's no you don't
give you'll see people giving coupons
promising a in a legally binding way
that the most lower the price people do
an ounce pace right so be yourself and
then next day it is even better price
and they're not nobody pursues them
growing the price but for if they
promise certain pressures on the price
they that's a commitment that can be no
more reason to me so let me come with me
i'm not sure exactly dancer question you
ask like pink point i'm also in case i
keep the same price of course that's
what exactly what a myosin thing is
right in this case you are telling me if
i try to do something like that the the
seller will hurt me oh sorry the batter
will hurt me i would not be able to earn
as much up it's all wrong really should
be right here now you're not n equal
because you've learned that this guy is
rejected you have to lower the price
rate the distribution is updated it's a
uniform 01 you have to lower the price
you can't put the same price of a half
half as optimal only for uniformed 01
right let's say two day game so you
can't put a price of a half again you
could lower the price but on this branch
the acceptance branch price will remain
you're bound to put the same price by
the rules of the game
and so because of the movies we think
ability to lower seller retain the
ability to lower the price the buyer
will want to wait inspire that law and
so he will reject the first thing even
if the price is below that so this this
means the price of monotonic not at the
first prices max I mean in this branch
the price remains a constant the
acceptance branch the price remains a
constant first hey is the mass no no
yeah for for instance for a two-day game
the first day price is larger than the
first day price for an end a game right
is that what you mean yes it goes the
reverse if I play a two-day game and
then what the first price is that price
is larger than the price for a thousand
a game say is that what you're asking oh
eh fries the first this commitment
cannot increase the price yes that means
each day is it lost the previous day
doesn't mean that each day's almost the
first time right yeah right mmhmm yeah
yeah but yeah I mean but the thing is
once you accept basically the price
won't change at all I mean I can't raise
the price but I won't lower the price is
no meaning in lowering the price I'd I
know you were avoiding this price very
late we fixed the ranch okay so this is
Gor this proof quickly it say that PN is
the price in the first round of an end a
game okay and TN is the buyers threshold
the first wrong that is if I x values at
least en and rejected which value small
at the end un is the utility of the
buyer with the highest value value
equals 1 what utility he gets right and
RN is the revenue in the enron scheme
okay so let's draw this diagram so you
put a price of PN on the first day and
the buyer accepts two x values at least
the n then the distribution gets updated
but nothing really happens here right
the price has to be pn right you can't
change the price it will say the same
forever okay so if the buyer access in
the first from the point is that the
price and remain fix it at the
MPN and from this you can write what
utility of the bios value one is right
the buyer with value on the highest
value we will buy in all the rounds and
his utility is n times the utility in
one round which is one minus PN right
cui now if you reject right value Sen
Tian then the distribution is uniform
between zero and TN so what do you think
the price should be here so uniform 0tn
is basically just a scaled version of
uniform 01 right so and you are an N
minus 1 round game so the price better
be p time p sub n minus 1 but just
scaled by TN okay so this is the price
on the Enron gay n minus 1 and then this
goes on now given this you can say that
the but we know you write the same
equations before the buyer of the
threshold is indifferent between buying
and rejecting if he buys in the price is
a constant his values n times TN minus
PN if he rejects then is utility now he
is this buyer is basically at the end
point of the support of the distribution
just like one so his utility is just use
of n minus 1 but scaled by TN this is
utility upon rejection there is affinity
one except then you can write the
revenue right so you now have this for
variable recursion and you solve this
you get what r NS ok and the price comes
out to be she said so very small price
to begin with already but the buyers
threshold was very first one okay the
price is extremely tiny but the stingy
buyer still is bargaining and saying no
for some time before he accepts it's not
exactly what he say he's already scared
you it's not it is going to release
through this a bit but he's are already
scaring yourself into putting a very low
price to get a point across he still
goes up as I said yeah exactly lift your
value is at the dome oh yeah you guys
sure Leroy you don't see this from
practices because you don't have a
losses for a seller for not selling well
you see uh okay you say there's no noise
is normalized to some cause I mean you
could take the basement to be something
right like 0
really means just about this cost mm-hmm
okay so that's the summary for two
rounds basically the point is that the
threshold equilibrium is at least
guaranteed to exist we have revived back
the natural equilibrium and it is also
kind of unique for most distributions
and you can compute it for any
distribution but analytically we do it
for uniform 01 but as Mohit pointed out
this is still far from n square root of
n is still much smaller so now go to an
infinite horizon came where the game is
repeated infinitely but to keep
utilities finite we do a time
discounting which means both the seller
and the buyer will discount tomorrow's
utility by a factor 1 minus Delta right
I will explain what Markovian strategies
is in a bit but for now don't worry
about it so time discounting is really
equivalent to saying that the game could
stop in any given down with probability
Delta right so for this we calculate the
PBE revenue for the uniform 01
distribution and this is at least sixty
nine percent of my channel I don't want
to be independent well theme what's
going on sorry what what is the defense
oxidizer be dependent on the history yes
this is independent yes right it's not
just a song I think it's the same is up
okay so for the uniform 01 distribution
you get sixty-nine percent of myosin
optimal revenge okay so what is Madison
optimal you again you get a quarter in
every round but now it's quarter times
this 1 plus 1 minus Delta and so on it
is 1 over 4 Delta so you get a quarter
of you know you get sixty nine percent
of 1 over 4 delta right that is the
optimal benchmark wait so this is
basically the time when the seller is
able to get back on this money in this
model the main point is that the limit
as n goes to in approach is infinity in
the finite horrible game is very
different from the infinite horizontal
now even in the discounted I didn't say
about that but even if you discount the
previous results the two results I
pointed to previous heart and T Rowland
Smith they show even with discounting
you get the same result that for the
first n minus constant rounds you poor
poster price of L and then in the last
few rounds something exciting happens
that's it
okay so you get a constant revenue this
is a consequence of fixed at horizon and
backwards induction but random horizon
is for natural there's no backwards
induction effect here okay so now i will
motivate why we do this Markovian
strategies and what Mark Cohen
strategies is so basically if if the
strategy is where as it was for the
finite horizon basically dependent on
the complete history right what all the
previous prices where and how the
Bywater rejected you will really need
infinite memory to even execute the
strategy right the seller has to
remember the entire history of prices
and except project sequences okay what
went on in the game so that's not
possible so you can't even check if a
given pair of strategies in equilibrium
so if I give you something you can't
even verify that these guys are mutually
best responding in finite time if you
allowed strategies to be arbitrarily
dependent on history so Markovian
strategies are basically those which
depend only on the belief not on history
belief means what your belief is about
the buyers distribution today it doesn't
matter what path you took to come to
this belief about the bias value
distribution right this belief of course
not a fish beneath is dependent on how
the game progress so far right so the
bio I put a price of P he rejected okay
then this mean there is an initial
distribution it's a uniform 0 1 and then
I put a price you rejected then you
accepted then you reject it and so on
ebay i continuously update my beliefs
each time you just use the interval and
11 moved to update the interval 0 so it
is dependent history by the moral
damages right yes so there are several
histories probably which could take you
to the same belief and you shouldn't say
that for this is three I will do
something that Israel to something else
right the belief is given that you say
basically that's all I need for the game
when different yeah so basically every
sub game is identical to the original
game except for the belief and belief is
defined just by these two numbers right
the beginning and the end point of the
interval the point is again this
motivates why a threshold strategies I
mean uniform is for the uniform
distribution it could be anything but
it's some interval right yeah but this
again motivates why threshold strategies
are natural because of the strategies
were not threshold even the belief is
not finite believe will also grow right
because the belief will be is splintered
collection of intervals and fragmented
intervals and it keeps on growing right
but for threshold strategy it's clear
that you always interval with respect to
afford the sequence was of accepted
readings right okay so if you restrict
the seller to Markov in strategies again
the same notation it's AP is the price
in the first round and T is the buyers
threshold values higher than t ill by
otherwise you'll reject he uses utility
utility the bio to the highest value
maybe one an RS at a venue right you
draw this diagram and here again if the
value is less than T you update the
distribution to uniform 0t then we know
that the price should be the same as
before but scaled by TPT but what do you
do here rate value is larger than T then
the distribution is uniform t1 is
different from uniform 01 and earlier we
got out of this issue by saying that the
price cannot be raised therefore I just
take this price and put this price here
but now I cannot do this because i am
not putting any such constraints is the
zero commitment now so how do you find
out what happens the uniform t1
distribution we don't know but there is
only one case or which we know if it
happens that this threshold is at least
a half yeah then for a uniform t1
distribution t greater than half the
optimal is just to put a price of tea in
all roms you can calculate this so i
won't get into that but that you can do
if it is at least a half for the uniform
01 distribution so our again going to be
a guess and verify strategy let us
assume that T is greater than half and
proceed if the buyer accepts in the
first round right and the price remains
fixed at T because T is greater than a
half so he gets a unity of 1 minus P in
the first round and then he gets a 1
minus T in every subsequent around
discounted with the factor 1 minus Delta
so that is that
and the buyer with value T is
indifferent between buying and rejecting
if he buys he gets t minus P in the
future he gets zero if he rejects then
he gets a utility of the highest by the
highest value but scaled with t and then
there is a 1 minus delta scaling factor
then the revenue expression can be
written so you solve this guy since
delta goes to zero you take the
asymptotics you get exactly so this is 0
point 69 69 percent of myosin optimal
revenue benchmark steep p delta goes to
0 and t is approximately this which also
verifies what we assume that tea should
be at least a half so that's basically
the summary for this infinite origin
game will the four main point is that
the finite horizon gamers n approaches
infinity is very different from the
infinite horizon game love the smokiness
optionally yeah because Markovian
basically i don't know what what an
equilibrium means this is i don't know
how to verify yeah so it's not just a
question of analytical tractability
something you I don't know what 10
equilibrium mean I don't have to very
fit so finally so in the infinite
horizon game we saw that even without
any commitments one-sided commitments
you could get a constant fraction at
sixteen percent suppose I allow
one-sided commitment now which means
that I promise not to raise prices so do
you think you can get even more than
sixty nine percent
do you want range in price over the
previous one was that you will not
raising prices in previous ones I was
not raising prices but the price was no
I was raising prices in the first Trump
but here it turns out that you get
exactly the same revenues Marshall so I
was raising prices if you look at this
the price was not P the price was T the
T remains fixed afterwards but after the
first term the price did raise ok but it
turns out that you get exactly the same
revenue even if you allow one-sided
commitment for the infinite horizont I'm
this contract so that's basically the
summary so the finite horizont repeater
sales game is not as nice as it was
thought earlier the shoulder equilibria
don't exist for most distributions and
one-sided commitment s is better you get
something at revenue Utley grows with n
I think the seems like the infrared
horizontal time discounting is a right
model because it gives something that
you would expect in reality so this as I
said is very basic setting of repeated
interaction and you could do more than
this so what happens if there are
multiple buyers multiple sellers seller
has a cost which is not publicly known
again that also is drawn from a
distribution let us say all those things
so how does the game proceed what does
in equilibrium in all these games etc so
what about the motivation I didn't talk
about this so so if people actually do
this so in search ads you set a reserve
price for what the minimum bid has to be
for an ad to be shown and this depends
on how you build in the past wait things
like this and there is behavior based
price discrimination Robbie virus seller
who says there is a private fence on how
the bio review yes because said I'll how
are you so ok you ok and there is
behavior based price discrimination
which firms already do amazon is known
to do this kind of behavior base price
discrimination depending on your history
right
see a loyalty cards and everything which
basically once you swipe it I see your
entire history what happened on this day
and 30 and so on so I could do this and
this is how economists studied this in
hard to do other papers they call it
behavior-based price discrimination so
that's basically all I want to say thank
you yeah so of course at the end you
mentioned it in reality there are many
sellers and many buyers and that's
perhaps a more important reason for why
we don't see their behavior the question
you raised at the beginning now in terms
of the commitment one-sided commitment
your city saying that the commitment
monotone not that the price he never
raised in the first day so what you want
mentioned is you can get a coupon for
the price the first day you can buy it
at that fresh brother forever after then
you might get upset if the price were
lowered and you saw it if you got
equipment that the price didn't change
and the price for lower that you might
get it but that just means the price
being lower than the first day I don't
see how that's related to monos Nissa t
know but the point is it never happens
in equilibrium right there's a
possibility in the game but in
equilibrium once you accept there's no
question of lowering the price range
because the seller is not best
responding if I know that you can afford
this price and I am bound not to
increase the price and better put the
same price in all
so raising the price is not allowed by
the game lowering the price is not good
for me one if you lower the price upon
rejects upon detection yes but if you
buy you doesn't make any sense for me to
lower another feature right because i
have no you tube bye guys you bought now
live by the future as well can send him
not to reject is highest in the earlier
rounds because then you have more to
benefit from the sellers are lowering
your price so but once you said okay i
see you won't buy and then come to a
remorse that later this guy yes toward
right you keep on rejecting and then so
basically the game proceeds like this
comes reject reject reject reject reject
and accept XOX that's what happens in
the numbers i showed you right TN nose
doesn't it depend on over to roast the
gamer yes it yeah big question and girls
again so the rules are that you're not
allowed ok so there was a really does
not remember suggested the ruler or that
the seller always has the option to I
mean you can write more generally can
just give a coupon that says it gives an
upper bound on the price in a certain
day you can give any kind of coupon that
you can tell you they given you a coupon
that says in seven days you can come to
my shop and buyer at and get an idea
it's an option to buy at this price and
we can give any such number of coupons
for any future days so so that so what
is exactly the Enzo plaintiff would be
there was an objection to commitment not
to change the price right your neck but
you said there wasn't an objection to
commitment that the price be monitor
decrease
I mean it's in between not doing
anything at all and giving full
commitment it's something in between and
off the two side of it you could do it
decided won't lower the price or I won't
raise the price seems like it's more
it's different kind of commitments that
are so it's easier to make a commitment
not to increase price because I can just
give you a card promising you know not
to increase the facilis but it's it's
harder and done lesson practice to give
the binding commitment not to the quiz
price
why because you need more like a outside
monitor for that while the buyer is
himself a monitor because he's in so
brief you later the young later decrease
the price then the you know generally
that the buyer is less likely to protest
that you then that's ignoring the rules
of the game the rules of the game were
eyes I decided it's a lipid based on
what I need you made this feminine when
you buy any work because you saying by
rahsaan patterson real well that's
because they aren't having such rules
then when i said the commitment is not
less likely to be then a minutes for the
original game when i said the seller is
Uribe you get it free or something about
the price you get it right you know when
the Senate said I'm not able to come it
just between the two parties are you let
you come to me if you don't buy a give
you a coupon you can always get this
wisely trying to future don't why even
ask maximum price harmonica look every
day you come by give you this coupon for
the current a spice if you buy it of
course then I'll more and keep the same
price if you don't mind you get this
coupon so further if I should be only
will never in increasing it doesn't
answer formatting Green goes right so in
some sense when I said there is an
objection to commitment it's not about
you know objection the objection is that
the buyer won't believe that's the
credibility is the problem not about
whether you get upset or not the buyer
will not believe if I say anything
that's the reason why we studied the no
commitments a rate is probability what
about this capacity hospice the coupons
I mean this illegal will commit my trade
so if I if I tell you that you invite is
at this price tomorrow then I have to
honor it and the equilibrium also turns
out that time so you see a lot of people
giving our coupons which legally bind
them through to an upper bound on the
price and then you see you see sometimes
people saying this is the lowest
processing
don't see people making legally binding
quit it this is an issue market where
there many sellers and buyers it's real
world it's all completely different see
how the bus
firm interactive may be on the same
point of slightly different Noel can you
repeat the one about add options what
was the lake home the surprise was like
this one right so the you are a search
engine and your search engine and you
have to set some reserves on the minimum
bid to be able to qualify for getting
shortly sponsor starts then I can update
this reserves based on how this but
let's say chocolate was a keyword for
which you're building your hair she is
let's say then based on how chocolate
has performed in the past right that of
course includes not just you it includes
other display and what other people did
also but people do do this take into
account how bidding has gone in the past
and chase there is a price it's not
clear how buyers will react knowing that
this is what is going to happen to the
reserve price usually people think of an
isolated very auction and then you
should be truthful that the point get
some is that when in a repeat in setting
even if it's Vicki even the second price
auction you have a motivation not to be
to school and to you can reject prices
that are below your value in order not
to divulge information that will be used
in reserve price in EP which is also no
equilibrium in the robot that's not you
and if there's some situations where I
could you argue Jessica Vinny well you
need some model to reason about radar is
so how will you reason what what happens
tomorrow I not I made you say
another
a month so unless somebody is stupid at
the time right like whatever people are
just circling is that what you say with
this because it's starting boobs already
as effective on even optimizing so so in
such they do so for instance is
optimizing let me tell you so this this
is one of the most famous things why
people change from generalized first
price you know it does not get this is
like I should not receive but there are
many companies who just exactly do this
so GM won't go to google and built arts
all right GM will actually I had another
company who will bring ads for them on
google and that company is just is just
a language engine optimized optimizing
sir earlier so the current rule less
since the sonic okay that's what I
should do and I will not bed in the
morning auto by afternoon I know places
hold off this thing cleaned up it is
okay something degrees have enough
resources yeah okay yes well so for
about one month this happened in the
early 2000s when the norm was to do a
generalized first price auction not a
second price auction as it is currently
run right where I get shown I pay what I
bit right that this was yahoo and over
sure beginning the Google came and
changed so at that point for one month
they documented this there were two
bidders who are basically competing in
the sawtooth behavior right I wit
something and you bit slightly epsilon
more than that bit more than that it was
and they reach some level then it
dropped down to zero i said care and
then once i don't care you realize that
there is no point in beating so high
then you bid for one month they saw the
sort of behavior so bots are bidding
missing was you where it is it here the
bots were reading rose robots forbidding
robust right yeah so the point is if you
don't take incentives into account these
kinds of things can happen did happen
sighs giving an example
what about discretizing effects okay so
I mean the existence or everything is
for every distribution on about discrete
or continuous for for instance this
one-sided commitment game it holds for
every distribution i just calculated
analytically for this where for the
infinite horizon we just blew it for
uniform 01 it's not it there for other
distributions that I given uniform speed
even uniform this creepy
