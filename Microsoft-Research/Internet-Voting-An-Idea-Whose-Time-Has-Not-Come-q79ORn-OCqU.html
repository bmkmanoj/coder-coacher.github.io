hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
anyway it's a true pleasure to welcome
Barbara Simon's to Microsoft barbara was
for many years a researcher at IBM and
almaden and San Jose and also the
president of the Association for
Computing Machinery and she has since
retired to a a small island community
outside of Vancouver the real Vancouver
BC but but yeah I put retired in quotes
because retired seems to be a euphemism
for working harder just on different
things I'm not getting paid and and and
not getting paid exactly so yeah I'm not
sure about that trade-off have to be
careful of that but during her latter
time at IBM and especially more recently
she's been doing a lot of work on
elections including co-authoring a book
that just came out with douglas jones
called broken ballots and i forget what
the sub time will your vote count not
exactly okay so so good I'm not missing
it there and she's got a lot of
experience in the election realm and
mostly things not to do so she's gonna
tell us about them now thanks Josh so
actually we're only on in Canada part
time now where most of the time in San
Francisco oh yeah no that's okay I just
want to make that clear because I didn't
want somebody accusing me of not being
the US residents and talking about us
elections I mean that's actually a
concern so what is internet voting we
had to talk about we have to think about
this because there is currently a big
push for Internet voting and that's one
of the reasons why I wanted to talk
about this topic because a lot of
election officials and non election
officials think that we should be moving
to Internet voting for a whole host of
reasons so one of the things that we
like to
sighs is that there are safe kind of say
things you can do and that includes
posting a blank ballot on a website and
downloading that blank ballot so when
people say we want to facilitate voting
for overseas voters this is what we
recommend what we do not recommend is
sending a voted ballot over the Internet
or voting at a website even just marking
a ballot online and I'm going to talk a
bit more about that later setting a
voter ballot as an email attachment and
the reason that I mentioned this
separately is that there are a number of
election officials who seem to think
that email is not internet voting I've
actually heard of people saying that and
I'm not sure where they think email
comes from but they've they claim we
don't do internet voting we just do
emails phone voting a lot of phones now
are being are used over the internet
although any kind of a phone voting is
is not a good idea and fax voting of any
kind for a whole host of reasons so i'll
put up the street obviously that slide
while they come in yeah we were in the
garage when it happened so I just
reviewed what's safe and what's not safe
and I assume you guys all know that
anyway so electronic voting well there
was a 50-state report which was just
released a couple of weeks ago and I
recommend it to anyone who is interested
in these issues it came out it was
produced by verified voting common cause
and Rutgers law school and one of the
points that makes is that there are 31
states the united states that allow
electronic return of voted ballots
primarily for military and overseas
civilians only New Jersey of those 31
states requires paper ballot as well and
many of the and in many cases with these
remote ballots the paper ballot if it's
downloaded for example if you use a
ballot marking device or even if they
don't if it's mailed in or emailed in
the election officials will remake the
ballots so that they can go into the app
scanners and as you can imagine there
are all kinds of security issues with
that process some states as I say use
electronic ballots software about
marking software and that software which
again would be downloaded from the
internet and creates this problem with
your communicating with the server may
produce a bar code for automatic
remaking which again raises security
issues because of course the voter
cannot verify what's on the barcode
there is a ballot which with the names
so if it's checked then you don't have
to worry about the barcode that's the
safe election officials check it but of
course one of the reasons for having the
barcode is to minimize the amount of
work anyway rebate ballots are not
secure this is just a map which you
probably can't read but trust me the
darker states all have some kind of
internet or electronic remote voting and
this is from you can get this on the
verified voting website so why is it
unsafe well there's a whole host of
reasons we won't have time to go over
all of them today first of all attacks
on the computer managing the election of
the server attacks on the voters
computers denial of service attacks
insider threat and by the way a lot of
people who talk about security I know
that's not true here but when you
mention insider threats threat election
officials sometimes get indignant and
think that we're accusing them of being
criminal which of course we're not but
you have to be aware of the fact that
there are all kinds of insiders in this
process and of course it's impossible to
audit a recount if there's no paper
other issues as I'm sure you know are
fake websites spoofing and fishing or
false flag attacks where you might want
to make an attack look like it comes
from some other country that you want to
get the u.s. upset with you know say
Iran I'm not going to go into those but
you can imagine yes you see we have seen
20 minutes of also the biggest threat
which isn't I have no idea who's
standing behind you was a billy club
pres you idiot or both quran so you're
talking about corrosion and vote buying
and selling that's true for all remote
voting not just internet voting any kind
of remote voting someone could be
standing behind you with a billy club so
i didn't mention that
it's not peculiar to Internet voting
it's true of any remote voting he's
holding a village level you at that
moment well yeah but they don't have you
voting from US consulate in these cases
that's not an option at the moment so I
want to talk about the DC hack so the DC
hack just a wonderful it's one of my
favorite stories the Washington DC board
of elections and ethics decided they
wanted to have internet voting for
military and civilians living abroad for
the midterm election which at that point
of course was upcoming and they actually
went to a good group of people the open
source digital voting foundation which
has very competent programmers working
there this is i should say many levels
above most of the stuff that's produced
for voting as people who are involved in
the field know quite well however
because there were some good computer
scientists working there the computer
scientists demanded that there be a
pilot test conducted before the system
went live so that was agreed and the
test was announced and delayed you know
you can just imagine what it's like when
you're trying to install some software
by its deadline finally it didn't begin
until sep tember 28 2010 was real voting
scheduled to start two weeks later over
the internet so within a few days the
University of Michigan had successfully
completely taken over the system and
they were very thoughtful they left a
calling card which was 15 seconds after
you clicked submit my ballot in the
pilot test the University of Michigan
fight song came on and it's actually
great song I've listened to it many
times it was yeah and it's by the way
that's a website you can still go to
Alex Halderman website and and and and
have this experience yourself now what's
interesting was that the election
officials didn't know for several hours
that their system had been subverted
even though the fight song had been
thoughtfully left behind and the only
way they found out was that one of the
people testing the system sent out an
email posting saying why am i hearing
the Michigan
University Michigan fight song and then
somebody said that's not supposed to
happen so they finally found out but one
of the things that's discouraging or
disturbing about that part is that had
this test voter not sent this email they
might not have found out for several
days and they knew it was a test and
they knew they could be broken into what
happens in a real election I mean you
know this is all of these things are
very disturbing in terms of the
implications for real election quickly
mention people here Alice was here three
weeks ago and I think talk about this is
the faculty something great dogs in the
video is available oh yeah it's really
bored yeah yeah and skewer yeah so three
days later the digital vote by mail was
can't do people all know this and should
i skip through this okay three days
later the digital vote by mail they call
the digital vote by mail instead of
Internet voting because some of us had
managed to give Internet voting a bad
name so it's now digital vote by mail I
use anyway it was cancelled the voters
could still download blank ballots but
they could not return the voted ballots
over the Internet but that's not all on
october fifth Alex announced that his
team had penetrated the system and had
gone live they exploited a shell
injection vulnerability that gave them
complete control over the system they
could change already cast and future
ballots they could reveal the voters
secret ballots they installed their
calling card and there's the link which
you can get later if you want here's an
example of the ballot and as you see
they put writings everywhere to make it
clear that this was a fake belt that
they had succeeded in subverting the
election I don't know if you can see
that very well but that's an example a
sample rigged ballot so and then three
days later there was a DC hearing that
had previously been scheduled where Alex
was called to testify and he said that
since the beginning of the test his team
had control of the network the default
master password for the network had been
unchanged and they got the default from
manual so they didn't have to do a lot
of work they could watch the network
operators configure and testing the
equipment and they actually brought
pictures from the video feed to the
hearing the since this
curity cameras didn't have passwords
they could watch what the operators were
typing including their passwords they
could have reprogrammed the switches to
steal votes in a real election they also
observed a attacks coming from Iran and
China now Alex thinks they were probably
not trying to break into the system but
of course we don't know for sure what we
do know is that these attacks are
ongoing and would be happening in a real
election as well and who knows what the
motivation might be they defended the
network by changing the passwords and
Eddie no so basically they defended the
DC network for the DC people they also
uncovered and this was just
serendipitous I suppose one of the files
used to test the system contained the
937 invitation letters for the people
the real voters who had signed up to
vote together with those voters pins so
had they been black hats instead of
white hats they could have cast ballots
for real voters in the 2010 midterm
election and no one would have known yes
ok earlier he said he's like this cohosh
shell injection whatever man this is a
core thing this is the second exploit
yes so there was a problem with the
original like the source itself had an
exploit and then they also rather take
advantage of these default passwords
what today I've covered in the course of
rummaging around the system right in
fact what what I was told by one of the
people who worked on the system is that
that the voter he's talked about the
vulnerability being introduced by the
election officials I don't know to what
extent that's true but in any case he
was complaining that the election
officials made their task worse harder
but I don't know the details so you know
I don't want to go into that so the
impact is that DC is no longer using a
web-based system for the return of voted
ballots although they still allow email
attachments and fax returns and other
states have not learned from the DC hack
other states are still trying to pursue
internet voting in some cases so I want
to just discuss some of the various
vulnerabilities the first one is the
server vulnerabilities and I want to
look at corporate and government
examples there so just quoting a few
people
who you would think the states might pay
attention to the FBI Director Robert
Miller said there are only two types of
companies those that have been hacked in
those that will be and the then the
former director of the CIA Nationals
nest NSA said the modern bank robber
isn't speeding up to suburban banks with
weapons drawn and notes passed to the
teller he's on the web taking things of
value from you and me so we know that
there have been successful texts on
whole host of corporations Google north
of garment symantec this is all 11
attack but it hit many companies the
attacks appear to be from a trusted
source they exploited a vulnerability in
microsoft explorer and the attack of
gain complete control over the
compromised system including systems
used by software developers to build
code think about the implications that
that would have for voting and the gmail
accounts of chinese human rights workers
and i believe that the assumption is
that this attack came from china
government vulnerabilities again Morris
said the FBI computer network has been
penetrated and attackers of corrupted
data the former director of the National
National Intelligence said in looking at
computer systems of consequence in
government Congress and the department
defense eros gate aerospace companies
with valuable trade secrets we've not
examined one yet that has not been
infected by an advanced persistent
threat so I'm sure you've all heard of
Stuxnet virus malware that was initially
spread via windows it's best they it was
the software was specialized to attack
Siemens industrial software it targeted
the Iranian centrifuges that were used
the centrifuges used for uranium
enrichment in Iran it appears to have
been developed by the US and Israel and
it was very sophisticated there was also
an attack you might not know about in on
Canada where foreign hackers attacked
the Canadian government the finance
department Treasury Board and defense
research and development were broken
into and act highly classified
information was obtained in Canada so
the moral to this story is that election
officials and Internet voting vendors do
not have the resources of the Department
of Defense or Google or
any of the other countries and companies
that have been successfully attacked so
how do election officials expect to
defend themselves how do these internet
vendors expect to defend themselves they
don't have those resources either
Internet voting vendors by the way you
should jump in at any point if you want
to so malware on the voters computers
which again is something I'm sure you
are all aware of just recently NIST mate
issued this statement that malware on
voters personal computers posed a
serious threat that could compromise the
security secrecy or integrity of voters
ballots and the United States currently
lacks infrastructure for secure
electronic voter authentication now what
I'm saying something that you all know
but election officials don't notice and
so it's important that NIST has made
this statement I mean these are the the
reason I quote these officials is
because election officials don't know
what we know so we again have some nice
new malware flame is is interesting it
only collects data but that can be
pretty important and of course the
malware itself is so sophisticated
larger than 20 megabyte I mean 20 times
larger than Stuxnet can take screenshots
of online activity record audio etc etc
you can see what it does it's just an
example of the kinds of things that are
out there and when you think of the
problems that Stuxnet enflame are
addressing they're much harder than a
simple problem of changing your vote
that's much much easier problem and then
of course Zeus is my favorite Zeus the
primary goal of Zeus is to steal money
from online bank accounts but again it
could be easily modified it can mimic
financial statements so that the victim
doesn't know that the money's been
stolen because the financial statements
look the way they're supposed to look
and you basically find out when your
check bounces and we know that over 675
pounds were stolen from about 3,000
customers of some unnamed UK bank that
as of 2009 3.6 million p
season the US had been infected and
there's a new credit card verification
system scam what was new when I made the
slide I guess it's a little old now that
was being used to steal personally
identifiable information and when I was
over in the UK about a year or so ago I
received a copy of this scam from from
the Commerce Bank now I should mention
maybe I do here let me see okay anyway
there's a picture of the scam and it
really looks the way it's supposed I
mean this looks like something coming
from visa or mastercard I don't know how
well you can see it but the point is
that this fold a lot of people and I was
talking about this at at Berkeley
recently UC Berkeley and one of the
people ask me well but then what you do
if you get email from a bank how do you
know it's legitimate and of course the
answer is a bank would never send
something like this out because they
know about the security issues they if
you get something from your bank talent
saying you know we need to know your
password or something it's it's a scam
so basically what what would happen with
Zeus is that the banks would cover the
loss so the reason that most people
don't know about the threat of Zeus and
the money being stolen from online bank
accounts and the reason I'm willing to
do banking online is that I know that if
the money is stolen the bank will cover
it because quietly because the banks
still come out ahead versus the cost of
having to hire more tellers and have
more buildings and so on so they come
out ahead by covering the loss but they
do it quietly because they want people
to continue using online banking so as I
say Zeus attack Charles Schwab and again
they did it with fake linkedin reminders
and so on and they captured a vital
personal information so this can also be
used for identity theft as well as
financial theft and it's being marketed
you can by Zeus from the black market
you can get upgrades you can get
specialized software yet attack it was
it's been on several interesting
websites like when Paul McCartney was
doing a tour of the United States it was
on his website and people who would go
there to his website we get in fact
their computers would get infected the
German looking
the German Wikipedia was infected at one
point and it avoids it detection by
using SSL to communicate with its
handler and the moral of the story is
switching votes on voters computers is a
relatively easy problem configures a bit
older but I really like this one as well
because it's an example of how you can
update the the malware can update itself
what people I'd say well how do you know
for the next election who's going to be
running well you call home for
instructions that's how you know and
again infected machines can can remotely
install malicious software without the
computer owners knowledge once the
computer has been infected and when
interesting story with configures that
in 2009 over 300 imaging machines in
hospitals were found to have configure
on them even though these are not
supposed to be connected to the Internet
and the way it got on there was that the
machines would receive updates from the
manufacturer via the internet and they
got infected now fortunately nothing
happened but you can just imagine the
risks of having Hospital machines being
infected by malware as you can also
worried you have to worry about
backdoors hidden election rigging
software that allows someone later to
insert names and again sometimes back
doors are intentional such as happened
with the sony BMG rootkit which was
distributed in 2005 on millions of music
CDs to gather information about users
surreptitiously it was discontinued
after it was discovered and they've been
lawsuits and the affected CDs have been
recalled but this is an example of an
intentional back door that had not been
known about and something that I mean I
suspect almost everything I'm saying to
hear everybody in this room is obvious
but it's not obvious to election
officials it's not obvious to most
people and I think the reason why is
that people don't understand how
software works and they don't understand
how complicated it can be they don't
don't understand when we say you can't
find all the software bugs why you can't
and one of the arguments I make is that
if it were easy to check this voting
software and be sure it's secure knack
so on then we wouldn't have major
vendors like Microsoft and Apple and you
know lots of other companies sending out
periodic updates many of which are
security fixes that wouldn't be
necessary major companies would produce
perfect software if they could the
problem is they can't because it's too
complicated and again to try to explain
the complexity the only example the best
example I could think of is the US tax
code and for those of you who are
familiar with the US tax code nobody
understands at all and there have been
instances of what you might think of as
malware installed into the US tax code
where some update to the text its
periodically updated and they've been
cases where updates that look perfectly
benign have turned out to benefit a
single company in ways that had not been
anticipated before the update was made
so it was not understood when the update
was made and I think that that well
that's as close as I can come to an
example of malware that a non programmer
might understand but I think one of the
reasons that we have so many problems
with technology and I know this is an
international issue is that the people
who buy the systems the non-techies just
don't have a grasp of what's what sulfur
is like and what these systems are like
and so I think what one of our jobs is
to try to explain it to them in ways
they can understand this major second
bullet ears happens
the second provisions benefited a single
company yes that's the story for that oh
I used to know that it had something to
do with ceiling fans I remember I have
to go back and look it up but but some
company that manufactured ceiling fans
got some special tax break and the way
it was written into the code it wasn't
at all obvious who that it was
benefiting anybody in particular and I
could if you really want to know I could
find it and send you an email with that
information I just have to do a little
research I i I'm really not making that
up but you're right I should have that
my fingertips so again the message over
and over is if the voters computer is
infected with an election rigging virus
or worm it's the virus that will be
voting not the voter and the voter will
never know and again I think another
issue is that the voter thinks will I
type it here and it's on the screen so I
know what's on the screen is what's
being sent out and again they don't
understand that what's that you can have
one thing on the screen and quite
something else going out over the
internet and that's a difficult concept
to get across for some reason at least I
find it difficult so the distributed
denial-of-service attacks is another way
to attack Internet voting and it
prevents people from accessing websites
obviously a good example for non-techies
is when you want to call in a call-in
show usually can't get in because
everyone's calling in and that's a
distributed denial-of-service attack not
intentional but it is the amount of
service and it's typically done with
botnets with it a better consist of
zombies the FBI FBI has said that the
mariposa botnek botnet may have infected
8 million to 12 million computers
internationally it was it stole credit
cards data and online banking passwords
and again many of these much of this
malware has customized versions and
photos could be disenfranchised on
Election Day by selectively
disenfranchising groups where you know
they're going to vote for the party you
don't want to win for example Estonia is
an example of a country that suffered a
massive denial of service attack
it was not done during an election but
it could have been because they're very
wired there the speculation is that it
originated in Russia because of the
Estonian decision to move a Soviet war
memorial and as I say they had earlier
had a national parliamentary election
where people were allowed to vote over
the internet and that could have been
seriously disrupted by a distributed
denial-of-service attack in canada they
were distributed them yes smell where
there is on military computers overseas
i don't know but i would guess that
there's some there i stir so that the
computers the military personnel would
use for voting he's just pcs that are
that people walk up to and work on for a
while well military well I mean
fortunately we don't have widespread
internet voting of the military yet but
for example in 2004 there was a project
called serve which was proposing
precisely that I to allow military
voters to vote over the internet using
their pcs vote from an internet cafe the
only requirement is they had to use
Windows machines and and had to be a
certain level but not very you know it
did requirements were not very strong
except you couldn't use a Mac and I mean
anybody you could vote from anywhere so
yes these things you find on the
internet then it was a home depot that
was important fans from China okay thank
you for getting us there was a camera
and there was a last minute mm-hmm the
provision put into
terror so would you send me that if
that's the one you're thinking yes yes
so the key word with ceiling fans yes
yes home depot test text yes yes so the
New Democrat the NDP in Canada is a
left-wing party which likes to be really
inclusive and so they wanted to let
everybody get involved all the party
members get involved with their
leadership vote and in 2003 they a lot
of people to vote over the internet and
their voting site was shut down for
several hours now we don't know if it
was a distributed denial-of-service
attack or if it was the slammer worm
which was also going around then and
we've never found out the vendor claims
to have patched for the slammer worm but
we don't know there's been no
independent examination nothing and the
NDP bless you know bless them did it
again in 2012 I mean it's like they
didn't learn they had a second
leadership election over the internet
and they suffered a massive denial of
service attack they were so ill-prepared
for this and I really find this kind of
Pauline that they this was going on
during that convention and at the
convention people had to vote on
terminals that were scattered around the
room so people were physically there
couldn't vote during this attack because
there were no paper ballots and again
there's been no I mean they they have
acknowledged that they suffered a
massive denial of service attack they
have acknowledged that but there's been
no report issued at least that I've seen
and I've been watching ya know it's I
think there's a different system let me
see in fact it may have been everyone
council i'm not sure i'd have to go it's
in the book look it up in the book i
think it's in the book oh no may not be
no it's not in the book because this
happened after we were finished writing
i'd have to but i could get that
information for you yes oh this could
gain somebody if there is now service on
I don't
people's voting machine there's
something but if there's sort of a
single server where everyone's voting
how does an Allosaurus talking someone
use that to get the outcome that they
want other than just causing mayhem
which is also bad well yeah I mean uh
but they are you saying that you can do
selective disenfranchisement with photos
machines but not necessarily with the
server is that what you're saying mm-hmm
well yeah I think that's true but of
course there are other ways of
disenfranchising voters service attack
on the server is there is there a way
that they're using that to try to get an
outcome that they want or is it just to
cause problems well in this case um I
don't know what the purpose of was the
denial of service attack was on the NDP
in 2012 my guess is that a lot of people
never got to vote and and it's possible
that that influenced the outcome of the
race how it did I don't know so you know
I don't know what the motivation was
more effective ways of doing though
right well of course they may have done
those two
I I know maybe some I just wanted to
show off I don't know maybe it's someone
who didn't like the NDP I mean that's
certainly possible that some said
another political party in Canada did
this to make the NDP look foolish I mean
I could see that as a motivation but
they don't know that would be nice
though but they don't you know it's like
it didn't there are still throughout
Canada there are towns and provinces are
still talking about having internet
voting this seems to just going over
their heads and one of the things that
happens is that you know I'm telling you
all these things much of which I know I
realize you know but people don't say
they read about Stuxnet and how it
attacked the Iranian subterfuge sector
futures and they don't say well gee that
could happen with Internet voting to
somehow the vendors say what we have is
completely secure trust us it's okay and
they don't put these things together
interesting I'm just trying to think
through why we might still want your net
voting rights let's take the example of
Amazon like I use my credit card at
bicep from amazon visa amazon myself
between the three of us we've decided
this makes sense despite the risks so is
there is there some basis for some way
to think through the internet voting
that's still some reason we might do it
anyway well I i buy things over em
amazon too but it's not the same thing
as voting because when you buy a book is
you say amazon knows who you are it
knows what you're buying you know if
your book arrives or not with your vote
it's supposed to be secret you don't
want the election officials to know how
you're voting you don't know if you vote
arrived correctly and there's no there's
no way to correct if it doesn't get
there with the book you amazon can send
you another book but if your vote is
lost there's nothing you can do so a lot
of people have make this assumption i
can bank over the internet or i can buy
a book from amazon over the internet why
can't I vote over the Internet and the
part they don't put together is that
voting is a harder problem
and one of the main reasons it's a
harder problem is that you have a secret
ballot some people have said well let's
get rid of the secret ballot I
personally think that would be a
disaster for a whole host of reasons
which we can discuss if you want but I
what would be the reason in favor well
election officials think people we've
heard many times this will get young
people to vote you know cuz voting is
dropping off so young people because
they're so you know internet savvy if we
have internet voting they'll all vote we
can get more people voting it'll be
cheaper which isn't necessarily true by
the way and and so these are notions
that people have it or not necessarily
grounded in any kind of realistic
testing and of course it's very
difficult to test anything over the
internet with it with voting elections
because every election is different
different people come out to vote and
just because you get more people voting
in one election and fewer in another
doesn't mean that that's because of
technology or the lack of technology you
just can't compare them they're not the
same but again there are these myths
that are out there and of course they're
encouraged by the vendors but there's
there's no substantial scientific
evidence to my knowledge that supports
them
we let the military push through oh yeah
well there's there's been a big push by
a branch of the military to have
internet voting for military and
civilians living abroad hopefully that
might be changing we hope they've been
pushing internet voting since 2000 and
the surf project that I mentioned was
being pushed by this agency of the
military called M VAP federal voting
assistance program and they just seemed
to be staff bite with people who think
is enough voting is great so that makes
our task harder but that may be changing
insider threat good one so again it's
difficult to discuss this with election
officials but the fact of the matter is
there are many different insiders such
as people who write the software anyone
who has access to the to the the main
software or even to computers we've seen
examples where computers have been
infected by using it felt and had an
example where he showed how to infect
computers using a using well just
using the card that goes into to set up
a ballots and to collect the votes so
basically anyone who has access can
potentially potentially rigged an
election and again as examples of
insiders drum Cara VL lost almost seven
billion dollars in unauthorized
transactions and of course we have CIA
agent Aldrich Ames who was very high
level but who was a traitor and so we
know that there can be insider threats
when money is stolen or books are stolen
or what have you secrets or secrets past
that can be eventually uncovered but how
do you prove an election has been stolen
when there's no documentation yeah good
question it's new for Internet voting
the seems like the same problem with
but anything well the problem of not
being able to prove that an election was
stolen is the case whenever there's no
paper I mean certainly with these
paperless touchscreen machines I agree
well no because if you have a system
that can be audited or we count it if
you have for example well I should let
me put this if you've got corrupt
corrupted election officials I think
it's almost impossible to have a
completely secure election if people are
really corrupted if they're determined
maybe your system would work I don't
know but in general it's impossible if
you've got corrupted insiders one thing
with Internet voting versus other kinds
of voting is that your attack the
attacks can come from anywhere of course
and that's a big difference now that
doesn't necessarily change the insider
threat but in general it seems like just
as bad I mean the people who made the
scantron machines could of whatever
you're right you're right you're right
it is so insider threat is problem with
most voting systems but certainly when
there's nothing that can be audited so
the argument that we are all making is
that we need accountability we know the
computer software can be buggy or might
contain malicious code or host of other
things can happen open source and I
should probably say public source
because you clearly don't want people
changing the software so public source
is is I think a good thing as opposed to
secret software but it's not adequate
because as we all know public source can
also be subverted and of course the
system used in DC was open source or
public source and that was hacked and
again because the votes are secrets
basically in general I can't verify that
my vote was accurately received and
counted over the internet so i just
thought i mentioned estonia because
estonia is a very wired country and its
frequently brought up as an example of
how internet voting works because
they've been doing internet voting there
for quite some time
and the number of people participating
has increased with each election so at
the last election in 2011 twenty four
percent of the votes were cast over the
Internet I was actually invited to
Estonia last year by the mayor of
tahleen who is the head of the centre
party the centre party which was the
second came in second in the 2011
election believes that the election was
rigged they believe that because they
didn't do as well on the internet
portion of the elections they did on the
non internet portion now maybe it was
raped maybe it wasn't raped I mean it
might be the centre party consists of a
lot of Russians who were living in
Estonia or former Russians a lot of
older people there probably less likely
to vote over the internet or they may be
less likely to vote over the internet so
it's quite possible that this
differential can be explained
legitimately or maybe not or maybe it's
some of both maybe there was this
difference and there was some rigging we
don't know and that's the problem is
that we don't know that the centre party
cannot prove that the election was raped
and the party that one cannot prove that
it was not raped because it's impossible
to conduct a post-election recount or
audit to prove that everything was was
done properly furthermore what I learned
when I was there was that the project
manager could update the software with
no oversight and you know so I say let's
bring in outside experts and they said
sure bring in outside experts that's
fine but don't going to have to sign a
nondisclosure agreement before they can
view the code and the outside experts
who were willing to do this we're
unwilling to sign an NDA because they
wanted to be able to speak openly if
they uncovered some problem so there's
been no independent review of the code
but i just want to mention the fact that
this off that the that the manager could
access the software with no oversight is
a glaring security Oh glaring and I'm
not accusing him of anything I mean I
think he's probably a really decent guy
and trying to do the right thing but
this should never be allowed independent
of who it is so in summary ballots must
you must be able to audit and recount
ballot center of the internet are
unreliable there for a recount is
meaningless
so we have to have paper ballots and
mandatory audits where you randomly
select ballots afterwards to be
recounted and again this is just not
directly related internet voting but
what most of us are looking for is what
we call risk limiting audits where by
using statistical methods you can reduce
the number of ballots that have to be
looked at in order to convince yourself
that the election results were correct
we I mean we don't think that you have
to get the precise exact numbers that
everybody got what we really should be
concerned about is that the correct
people were the winners so as opposed to
that they got you know you don't want it
you don't need it down to the least
significant digit or anything like that
you just want to make sure the correct
people one and so again closest of the
election is a factor and you just keep
on with this audit until you are able to
commit yourself that the right people 10
and that's the book so we don't need to
stop there but that's basically it so I
hope those your questions I hope there
are some questions or comments so I've
read the
Oh si which says that they complained
because they considered that it was
inherently manipulable because
it's also said that the end of the
report says by the way they try to bring
it to the Supreme Court of Estonian but
it was thrown out this was cast to light
and they declared they were going to
take it to the European justice maybe
just expand and tell me more about what
the discrete wasn't well actually I
think the initial complaint was brought
by a graduate student in Estonia who's
not a computer society he's a historian
or something yeah and he looked at this
and said while this is insecure um well
I have to say you know he's obviously
done some pros he's messed with
computers you know he knew something
about what he was doing and he wrote a
complaint and again and i believe it was
rejected and they I don't remember I
actually have this written up so I don't
remember the details were that they felt
it was irrelevant or but whatever but at
some point time became an issue and they
said it's past time when you can
complain and they threw out hmm
demonstrators there have been any
forward that maybe I mean I could
actually i can i can i can double check
and tell you i mean i have it i just
don't have it at my fingertips but
basically it was not i think it was not
taken seriously quite frankly and i
think the people running the country
don't want to acknowledge it that could
have been a problem in the election and
again i think this is this is not unique
to estonia I think we see this all over
where election officials don't want
people raising questions about election
outcomes for several reasons first of
all they don't want to be challenged but
also they're afraid that this will make
voters not trust the democracy or the
leadership and it might discourage
people from voting I mean one of the
things that we constantly get told is
because you're raising these issues
people won't go to vote because they
think their votes won't count yes and
and I frankly that's a concern of mine
because I don't want to discourage
people from voting and what I would
generally say is yes we've got these
problems but if you if you want to make
sure your vote won't count don't vote
you know I mean you you have if you want
to have your vote to count you must go
vote so
but that is an issue and and and my
guess is that after all the people
running Estonia the people who won the
election so they don't have a whole lot
of motivation to cast cast out on the
election the election was rated I don't
know because you know i don't speak
estonia and the people i talked to felt
that but they were the leaders plus a
student well I mean the student wasn't
saying he thought it was rigged well he
was saying was that it is fundamentally
insecure and it might have been rigged
but he was not making that accusation it
was the leadership of the party who were
saying that yeah I don't get much
discussion so in the current in the
current boring system we accept some
amount of risk like when I like your
emotion now we have to vote by mail
which is terrible i guess i agree so i
have to believe that the mailman is
enthroned my ballot away cuz he knows
what area of seattle i come from i have
to trust that the scantron machine the
scans it does the right thing i have to
believe that they didn't pre stuff it
with some balance there's a lot of
trusts going along there's sudden my
anything you can check online to see
whether um king county claims you've
received your mouth okay so i cut around
the mailman problem just had one okay
sometimes those riot things so it seems
but with the reason why i still fill for
myself comp relatively confident
partially cuz I'm thought about as much
but it is is because the damage that any
one person can do seems a little bit
more limited and I'm wondering if that's
one of the big differences with Internet
voting is that what one person
organization can do is magnified oh
absolutely well basically with the
introduction of computers that's also
the case once you get computers and if
you can read get malware into that like
the computers that are that are counting
the ballots that magnifies the potential
as well and but by the way I think what
you should be doing is trying to change
the system in Washington state because
it's there are lots of security issues
with foot with just vote by mail
question i was wondering this also
because i thought originally the whole
point of the voting system was to not
allow coercion and as soon as you allow
mailing boats you allow coercion okay so
this seems kind of odd I mean I think
it's terrible that's a problem in
general right and what we were the mail
and it's not just because it's only male
and it's as soon as you let me land at
all course is it from those I mean the
beauty of polling place voting though at
least the way it used to be is you'd go
in and you that you could draw a curtain
now I guess with computers these days
they don't necessarily have curtains
anymore but you know ideally you should
be able to go in someplace draw a
curtain and vote where nobody could see
what you're doing well that was a lever
machines but not everybody had lemon
machine yeah also would require only one
person at a time Oh clothes first unless
except in the case of people with
disabilities they would suck them but
that was issued to us yeah we had an
election where they do classic consider
class building where you go
people claim that election was rigged to
because although no one was coercing you
when the parties was giving you fifty
dollars if you win you win the building
booth you took a picture of your phone
with your phone of your ballot and then
came out there fifty fifty dollars just
a counterexample for that that
particular issue my question in general
is if you lots of things wrong with
electronic voting how do we know it's
not a goodie is fundamentally less safe
and traditional running well it depends
on what you mean by electronic voting so
I mean but there you know to me
electronic voting means as a computer
involved but maybe that's not what you
have in my do mean internet internet why
okay so the question is why is Internet
voting list safe because you it could be
basically you can rig an election anyone
from anywhere it can rig the election in
Mexico if they did what you're saying
somebody had to be there passing out the
money there was the risk of being caught
now maybe things are so corrupt in
Mexico that known worried very much
about that I don't know again it thinks
if the system is fundamentally corrupt
it's really hard to think of verse of an
a kind of voting that would defeat that
can't prevent it I all service we can
tell you
even inside of me with papia but but but
but but the court that but the coercion
or I mean then it was you've got I mean
it's a very hard problem and um so
you're saying the verifiable could
prevent insider attacks if they can't
prevent the insiders from destroying
today exactly not not completing the
election but you can tell whether the
election was completed correctly or not
well I think it depends on what system
you're using now again the system that
you're working on maybe that's true but
in general for most systems you could
for example um lose paper ballots or do
ballot box stuffing I mean there are
there issues that I mean it's a hard
problem to get it right when you've got
inside a corruption it's a very hard
problem so what we're focusing on is
trying to come up with ways of doing
things that such that if everything runs
works right it should be I mean it you
know you have backup it's correct and
minimizing the risks so if you've got
corrupt insiders that's a really hard
problem but in most cases hopefully you
don't but there could still be major
risks if you use the wrong kinds of
technology or if you use technology
wrongly so we're trying to eliminate
unnecessary risks there are some risks
that are very hard to eliminate for any
system does that make sense I'm just
sort of trying to think of a high level
whether it's really I mean some extent
it's it's easier to study risks of
computer systems it's easily replicable
and we can
you can write papers about how these
things can be hacked and we can we can
have 20 slides about terrifying but
hilarious things that have that happened
on previous attempts whereas if I try to
publish a paper about it turns out you
know I had this guy coming to the lab
and he had his and I wanted him to vote
some way and I had the billy club out
and it turns out he changed his vote
when I held in my billy club right
that's where the paper doesn't really
get published right because that's I
don't know it's less it's as much it's
much harder to do that type of research
it so it's harder to do the type of
research on traditional building systems
that it is on electronic so we have sort
of less evidence that that or that type
of voting is is risky well you know in
terms of the example you gave and maybe
that's not being fair to you but in
terms of that example what you're
talking about is trying to impact
individual voters and so that's kind of
like a retail sort of fraud and I think
a big difference is once you introduce
computers into the process you can have
wholesale fraud you can have much even
have much more widespread fraud I mean
we can still people can still be bribed
there's nothing you can do about that
you may have problems with verification
although I agree the cell phones a nice
way to check and that's a problem how do
you prevent that that's something we
talk we actually talked about talking
about it the meeting we didn't the
conference we were just at but you know
you could at least have a law which says
this kind of behavior is illegal if you
catch any evidence that this is going on
you can prosecute someone so there's
some risk and if someone has to be
physically nearby in order to pay the
person off that person is is running the
risk of being arrested whereas you know
if you're off in Romania or who knows
we're rigging American election over the
Internet that's very low risk
the one of the political parties which
has which has large numbers and has a
large amount of resources it could be
there could be lots of adversaries I
mean there certainly as far as the u.s.
election is concerned I imagine I mean I
I certainly could there are many
interested parties right one is clearly
the political parties and when you look
at how much money is being spent in this
upcoming election which is really whore
whore horrifying you know a teeny
fraction of that would be a very
handsome amount of money to paste it to
pay as a bribe to someone and if you if
that someone had access to software that
controls machines or Internet voting you
know anything involving computers that
impact a large number of people that
could change the outcome and quite
frankly it's something I worry about
using the Internet voting will cause
some probability of the beat of the
wrong person winning because there is
undetected fraud not using it will cause
some probability of the wrong person
winning because young people and people
who plan to their homes to go and what
percentage of disenfranchisement and
young people that does it does it
protect about us well it's not clear
that the internet will necessarily
customers what percentage would convince
you that well I don't know how you
quantify it because how do you quantify
stolen elections how do you determine
why I want to compare stolen lunch and
still lunch now I another this long
person will somebody not voting is it
the same thing as stealing an election
they're different now you're saying the
outcome might be the same is that what
you said the person who
Olivia well I know you're getting into
law it is sort of I mean any other
figure personally personally I think the
fact that we don't have universal
suffrage in this country is appalling if
we had universal suffrage the outcomes
of a lot of elections in the past 20 or
30 years would have changed I mean just
the fact and this is not related to my
talk but something I learned about in
writing the book when I did the chapter
on voter registration the Holy the whole
history of fell in disinfectant fragile
ice enfranchisement is shocking I mean
felon disenfranchisement was invented in
the south after the Civil War to keep
the former slaves from voting and it's
still used to keep pretty much the same
population from voting and sometimes
it's blatant and if you look at the
percentage of people who have been
disenfranchised simply by felon
disenfranchisement it's huge compared to
the closest of elections we've had
recently so you're saying the better
solution to the den Internet voting
would be universal suffering and I agree
that that would be a better way to solve
the problem well I think it'd be I mean
it's better in so many ways yeah yeah I
like Australia I assume i'm not saying
look I'm not saying it should be
mandatory because that has you know I
don't know how I feel about that no
Universal is not the same thing as
mandatory right we don't have universal
suffrage in this country right up and I
thought you were talking about one way
you could get rid of the effective of
disenfranchisement of the lack of
Internet voting is managed by making
voting man
I think that there are ways short of
mandatory where you can make it much
easier for people to vote I mean the
fact that it's done on a weekday I mean
they're all kinds of steps that can be
taken to facilitate voting early voting
again their security issues with early
voting you know I don't know why had
eaten we know it's done on a Tuesday
because of history about when this
country is to be farming country and
then you know they didn't want to have
it interfering with the market day and
stuff like that I mean there are things
that are done in the United States today
which are like 17th or 18th century
stuff and one is maybe 19th century the
way we run our elections if you look at
just how the elections are run and the
lack of national standards and
requirements and and the things that
happen from state to state look Holly
the locality it's really shocking and
and and people aren't talking about it
but the but you know our our democracy
is not built on very sound structure
right now because of the way we run
elections so you know I think it's a
whole host of things internet voting you
know there's this move among some people
to try to get the newest and shiniest
and brightest thing to say we've got the
best stuff you know we're really ahead
of the game you know see how advanced we
are in Internet voting is one such
example and yet we know that internet
voting is a terrible idea we've got to
get that message out so that's really
why I talk about it but all these other
issues are really important I mean as a
computer scientist I can't really talk
extensively about voter
disenfranchisement because that's not my
realm and because it's become so highly
politicized what I can talk about is
voter registration databases which is a
technical issue and where people are
again again ignoring the technology I
mean there was can I talk one of the
things that actually David dill who is
the founder of verified voting found out
a couple of weeks ago was that in
Washington State a nice way to
disenfranchise someone is it turns out
you can over the internet and by looking
at the voter registration information
obtaining us enough personally personal
I personally identifying information
about a voter to go to a website and
change that voters address without
the voters knowledge or consent the
state currently does not do one of the
obvious things that we recommended in
our study which was done back in 2006
this is an ACM study to send out a
postcard or something to someone to the
old address when the when the address
has been changed to make sure that there
was no fraud so this does not happen in
Washington state right now hopefully
that's going to change before the
election hopefully but meanwhile you can
do again its retail but you can do
retail fraud by simply having people's
ballot sent to the wrong address and
they won't know because no one is
telling them I mean that's the level of
detail where things get I mean you know
how can they do this you'd say but in
just what may be a more specific answer
to your question is I don't remember if
you were at the yoke of a sudden year
ago but Bob Kerrey just left as the
director of the federal or existence
program he was enormously considering
about the level of participation of
military voters be much lower than
public at large and looking for asking
almost exactly the question that you
asked about well we're not giving the
right results about that how do you
quantify the differences and you he
asked for specific quantification of
risks due to internet voting from major
researchers ron rivest and David Wagner
would both explicitly asked to come talk
about quantifying the risks and they
both came and they they tried very hard
to do as careful analysis as possible
they gave sir back-to-back talks where
independently
they basically said the risk is
unbounded we can't put any upper left on
this yeah those are good talks to yeah
but I mean they're variety of ways in
which one can mess up an election holds
the wholesale and retail and I just gave
you a retail one here but Internet
voting is wholesale final ones people
there others I just had one count you
earlier said why would somebody use it
and I of service attack who promoted in
my room I was thinking that it probably
is possible to turn an election with
about service tag a few time it he had
to be when a particular sector of the
electorate that you don't want to be
absolutely I should have thought of that
okay yeah that's that's a good that's a
good response l the this thing about
Washington database which I could talk
to you or that if you want but keep with
Washington's are relatively blue states
washington- king county is pretty red
states it would be easy to do a
denial-of-service the King County
borders to have a major effect
quarter rolls which are public nope and
say exactly who you are what can't you
live in and all the information you need
to change the businesses and with
computers maybe it could be make more
wholesale done overseas outside of your
jurisdiction to unite one ok so my
difficult question and feel free to to
wait for the cameras are off to answer
if you'd rather but I is this is a
theoretical question because everything
you said about it you're going i agree
with completely but i'm trying to get at
is an absolutely fundamental or is there
any possibility that there's any kind of
widespread network that looks something
like the internet but perhaps completely
to your architect for the century from
now could allow voting that is as secure
as postal voting goes by now other
rumors well obviously it's not such a
hard question to answer because as a
scientist I can't say it's impossible
unless there's an a possibility proof
and I haven't seen one so obviously I
can't say it's impossible and as you say
the standard should be as secure as
remote voting any kind of remote voting
vote-by-mail being the canonical example
I know you know their plight their
attempts being made to do that and maybe
one will succeed I I suspect it's
something that will be needed is similar
to what I believe its Finland is it
that's doing it where they have another
channel for verifying I think it's
Finland it's one of those countries
Norway thank you where they have another
channel for verifying your vote where
you basically can call back on your cell
phone I mean it's because you can't be
sure that what you see on your internet
is crap on your computer is correct so
my guess is if anything does work and by
the way they don't claim to be
completely secure either but at least
they are aware of the issues so I think
I think anything that would work would
require another channel of communication
independent of
channel that you use to communicate your
vote on that just a conjecture I think
there's they may be a theorem there I'd
like to think it might be thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
