hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you so much for coming back on time and
the next one is it's another visually
compounding demo and the presenter is
Randy Johnson go ahead man afternoon I'm
going to apologize i'm getting over a
cold so i'm going to stay far from you
guys and hopefully I don't lose my voice
and so I'm a principal research director
in the education and scholarly
communications team and so half of me
focuses on how do we transform education
and work with the top researchers and
think tanks around the world to think
about things differently with technology
and then the other half of meek
concentrates on how do we grow women in
computing and have more women computer
scientists around the world and so what
I'm pleased is I think krona zoom does
both of those worlds when we talk to you
about it so I'm going to give you a
brief overview of what is Corona zoom
and what are we trying to do here it is
a cloud-based service on as you're with
an html5 front end so it works on any
type of device that supports an html5
browser and then with that I'll also
have a call to action in the end to
hopefully entice all of you to get
involved in the corona zoom project so
with that we all know that there are
vast amounts of libraries collections
digital repositories vast amount of
information on the internet and when we
work with professors and students and
teachers around the world they talk
about the challenges in the endless
hours they spend searching the internet
trying to find good quality information
trying to find all the types of
information they need for their research
investigations and then for students
their frustration is they really don't
understand how do you figure out if
something's good quality or bad quality
what can be sizable and what can't be
sizable would it be great to go into
place and know that everything here is
high quality peer reviewed and supported
by the best researchers from around the
world second we know that there are a
lot of experts around the world who have
fantastic data fantastic information
great powerpoints facts figures
information but if you're not a student
in their course you may not have the
opportunity to ever see that data or
have that opportunity to understand that
information or recreate their research
and this is one of the professor's we've
worked with in the geology department at
UC Berkeley and you don't see but on the
side he has a shovel there to move his
information and he talks about
unfortunately many colleagues are just
like him where they haven't really
gotten on the full bandwagon yet to
really share everything and digitize
everything and make everything available
the next thing we think about is when it
comes to humanities and Sciences more
and more universities are starting to
collaborate more with each other
education in high school is trying to
connect the humanities and Sciences but
still we really learn in silos you know
I think about when I took a course in
East Asian Studies and when I was
learning about the 14th century I
learned about what happened in China but
I didn't learn what happened in Korea
during the 14th century or Vietnam in
the 14th century or at the same time
what was happening in Latin America or
Egypt or what was happening from
particles or health innovations or what
was happening from a scientific
environmental perspective and so one of
the hypothesis we have is that if you
could bring all that great research data
and information and you bring the
humanities with the sciences will we
start asking totally different questions
could we have totally different insights
because if you think about some of the
greatest discoveries it was because
paleontologists archaeologists and
anthropologists
humanity's came together and started
sharing information to make this new
discovery so if there could be a
research tool to help have that happen
could this make things much better and
if we could think about instead of
having to search the information in the
internet and pull it out piece by piece
to look at different RSS feeds in
different podcasts and different videos
and schematics and data and ebooks and
powerpoints would it be great if
everything came to you in a dot and that
in that dot was the information from an
expert who understands what's the best
content in that area that kind of gave
you a guide and still you need to look
in research on your own but there's a
bibliography that kind of leads you to
some of the best periodicals best
websites best places to go for you to do
deeper research and that's the hope of
krona zoom so here we are at corona zoom
and when you get to corona zoom you can
really think about it as the history of
everything we start at 13.7 billion
years ago and then we go all the way to
today and you'll see these bright colors
popping out at you those are called
thresholds and we can think of the
threshold as a significant event during
time where the world got more more
complex there is a discipline called big
history that started about 25 years ago
that tries to bring the history of
everything together and really bridge
the gap between humanities and Sciences
and so they use this concept of
thresholds so we've brought that into
this project and so let's jump to the
very first threshold and this takes us
to the Big Bang and so here in the Big
Bang we have a video from one of the top
historians david christian talking about
the big bang and we can watch that video
here and this is a vimeo video at the
same time we understand the students
like to multitask and they like to go
and see other things so we can look at
the artifacts who are on the side and
this is a gigapixel image that we can
zoom into great detail
of a billionth of a second off that will
pause David in here we also have a big
bang lecture that comes from Khan
Academy lots of different content to
look at from NASA and other places and
then what I was talking about before is
the bibliography and so if I click on
the big blog raphy not only does it give
annotations of where this content is
coming from but then it also takes you
to the best places to get deeper
research and in the future we hope to
have an integration with our Microsoft
academic search so then you can also
search periodicals here too and so if we
jump out of the Big Bang and now you're
looking at all of history 13.7 billion
years ago we're going to jump to
humanity the last 3,000 years of written
human humanity and what you'll see here
is you'll see earth in the solar
system's the last four billion years and
then you can see life and then we go
into and you can't see at all pre human
history and humanity because there are a
nano pixel because they're so small if
you can then understand the scale of
time and so let's jump to humanity where
we'll fly at two billion years per
second to get to the last 3,000 years
and so we're here in humanity and I'll
go into the industrial revolution in
here once again we're trying to now
really bring the different worlds
together so now you see what's happening
from Britain United States Western
Europe Russia and Japan right now we
have a team working on Korea and then
Latin America and then you'll also see
here we'll have scientific discoveries
like the wat steam engine and so trying
to bring the sciences and humanities
together and different geographies and
so if we jump into 1776 and the
Declaration of Independence at the same
time here we also have the Declaration
independence in full so you can read
read the document because many people
haven't read the Declaration of
Independence they know that we were
founded in 1776 but haven't read the
document and so as we jump out of the
Industrial Revolution we can begin to
get other insights and so as i zoom out
and look what else has happened in 1776
a lot of us know that the wat steam
engine was very very critical in the
industrial revolution but how many of us
really knew that what's the wat steam
engine him doing the wrong thing there
and was patented in 1776
you
you shouldn't do a demo when you're sick
let's zoom out one of the other
important things about current assume
that will jump to is the importance of
telling stories so many of us know that
you know the history of what we found is
really from generation and generation to
telling stories but us ourselves stop
telling stories and so one of the things
that we want to help with is at the same
time it's been very interesting for us
to jump around here in chrono zoom and
discover things on our own but sometimes
you want somebody to talk through a
timeline and tell you what is it you're
looking at and why should you look at
the information in there and what order
should you look at the information and
so we've created tours and so in here I
want to show a brief tour from Sicily
who is a student at UC Berkeley and
we've asked her to think about World War
two and what's important that that we
want to share across the world about
World War two and so she talked about
Japanese internment so let me show you
her tour hello my name is Leslie I'm a
third-year psychology student at the
University of California Berkeley this
timeline is part of a project I've been
working on for my big history class let
me take you on a brief tour the
japanese-american internment took place
during World War two in the United
States the story of a married couple
Arthur and Estelle oh she go will be
used to help understand internment and
everything right sir Japanese American
man and Estelle a European American
artist lived in Los Angeles prior to
internment though she didn't have to
Estelle chose to go with her husband to
the camps our story begins after the
United States entered World War two when
President Roosevelt signed executive
order 9066 at any time you can pause the
tour and investigate the artifacts on
the side at your own pace here
she referenced the executive order and
we have the executive order here that
you can read in full and then at any
time you can fast-forward because you're
getting bored and you want to see what
else is there and resume play the
assembly centers were temporary
locations for the japanese-american
stayed before being moved to more
permanent and turn Mike camps Holly one
of the things that's also important is
one of the features professors and
teachers asked us to have was in the
tour to be able to turn narration on and
off because for example there was a
teacher here in the Lake Washington
School District that said the
information you have here is great
because the clothing request form that's
right here is something that we used
here in Seattle and I could really
utilize this information but I want to
tell a Washington story because we have
a very rich history of Japanese
internment and a lot of famous stories
that have happened here but I don't want
to take the time to create a timeline i
love to use this information so now he
can utilize everything that's in here
and play it almost like a powerpoint
presentation and give his own story and
then in the evening he's sent an
assignment to a student's to listen to
Cecily store and then do a comparative
essay about the difference of how we
treated the Japanese in Washington
versus California and what are the
different interpretations from the story
I told you versus the story you heard
from Sicily and because one of the
important things with krona zoom is how
do you deal with interpretations how do
you deal with disputes and dates how do
you deal with disputes and different
views and those are one of the things
that we're working on and what makes
prone ism is exciting is that it's a
full community project and what we mean
by that is University of California at
Berkeley dr. Walter Alvarez this kind of
was his baby invention with him and his
student takes care of all the content
and works with discipline experts around
the world to really make sure that it's
high quality content and highly curated
and then we have a group of students at
Moscow State University who do all the
development that works with our
engineering
Engineers here in Microsoft Research and
then what we're trying to do is work
with the scientific community and also
the information sciences community to
bring in all the data and then to help
us think through how do you look at this
and so you'll see here at the very
bottom we say take our survey and when
you take the survey it asks you what do
you think about this navigation versus
this navigation here are the different
ways we think of interpreting
interpretations and here's how we think
about how do we show a discrepancy in
dates and so then that way we want the
academic community to give us feedback
on how they want to see this information
here and so if we go back to corona zoom
and I'll then jump in and show you a
little bit about a life and the
opportunities for the future and one of
the things that you'll see here why we
opened up the beta early because you'll
see that there's a lot of blank squares
and not a lot of information in there we
did that on purpose because a lot of
people have given feedback in the past
that when you create a tool that is
nearly too perfect and fully populated
that sometimes we don't believe that
you'll really listen to our feedback
sometimes the code is so complex it's
too hard for us to build upon so what
we've done is we've made this available
open sourced it early so that people can
build upon it and that you feel that
your voice is going to be heard and that
will make the kind of suggestions that
you want to make and so if we leave the
tour and let's jump back to earth and
here we'll start beginning to see the
different disciplines and how different
disciplines look at time in different
scales will see a geological time scale
archaeological time scale and then in
here in life is when you then begin to
really bring in biology and paleontology
in the same place and so this is where
dr. Alvarez is very passionate because
he helped
discover the extinction of dinosaurs and
so he's working with fellow
archaeologists and paleontologists to
begin to build out a dinosaur timeline
for folks and so in here we begin first
with his famous lecture and I'll just
give you a little snippet of it the
Berkeley theory was posted in 1980 and
for 10 years people kept saying well
where's the crater and we were we were
embarrassed because you they'd say you
predict a huge impact where's the creek
and so what's exciting about this is
that think about yes there's lots of
lecture videos on YouTube but you know
you need to know exactly what you're
searching for and you need to know who
to search for and what's a good quality
and so what we're trying to do in
chromosome is work with the top research
experts around the world on significant
events through history in the scientific
domains and the humanities domains and
to be able to have their best lectures
up there or start recording their
lectures right now so then that way
students don't have to be students at UC
Berkeley to have this opportunity but
students all over the world can have the
opportunity and then in here dr. Alvarez
with his colleagues has picked the best
fossils the best images the best things
from NASA that they think will help you
understand about the impact and so what
we're really excited about is getting a
lot more partners to work with us work
with Berkeley to really make krona zoom
come to life and so right now a lot of
what you've seen with the tours and with
the timelines is first-party generated
to give you an idea the next stage in
development that we're working with
students and also other universities who
are coming on board to want to work on
this project in an open source
environment will be making a third
partying authoring tool and third party
touring so that anybody can create their
own tour and then come create their own
timelines and we kind of see krona zoom
as in layers so there's this one highly
curated layer where its peer reviewed
and that the top researchers around the
world are saying if this is good quality
or not sending you annotations and
saying what needs to be
modified before that time line gets
populated but then there's a corona zoom
world that anybody can create whatever
timeline they want create any type of
tour because we've had lots of companies
come to us interested that they want to
put the timeline of their company we've
had educators that come and said well
you know I want to create timelines for
my class but I don't want to have high
quality content I want to use
copyrighted materials can you make this
easier for me and then they've also
asked to have kind of a personal canvas
because I want to use karna zoom for my
research and I want to build everything
out but it's all quiet and I don't want
people to know until I'm ready to tell
the world and publish and then we'll
publish on Kronos ooh and so those are
kind of the future that's coming and so
what we wanted to do is show you corona
zoom have you investigated take it back
to your students talk about it give us
feedback take the survey and if you have
content data information that you would
like to test and work with us in corona
zoom I have my card I'd love to work
with you and we'd work closely with you
to make that come alive and we've been
surprised at how many people want to use
Colonel zoom in different ways for
example the World Health Organization is
now working with us to create the world
health innovations timeline and be able
to take I guess there's 150 health
innovations around the world that really
made changes in medicine and what
they're looking at doing is if we can
create exhibits on those bring in the
lectures bring in the publications bring
in how do you look at the challenge and
diagnose the issue and here's how you
solve it that for developing worlds who
don't have access to this information
since this can be on any device and it
works on a phone that they now can
bridge the gap and be able to have good
quality content to help emerging markets
doctors and so we're excited to try and
test that and work with that with them
so with that I have two minutes for
questions before I need to end
you wanted to add the space dimension
you are fundamentally organized a long
time what would be a vision of
navigating the space dimension and time
dimension so like Bing Maps and your
Corona to put together yes we've been
thinking about that and it's great work
that our layer skate team and worldwide
telescope has already done and so we're
looking at working with them later on in
the development to see how do we bring
these worlds together and then also what
does that look like right now in our
first phase of development we haven't
tried to tackle that because it's pretty
difficult but that that is one area that
we're investigating in the future yes
yes so so all the data is it we do
twofold one if it's connected to or
another resource library or in another
location we connect through the URL and
then for those who don't have a place or
repository for their data then it gets
stored in as your and so what everything
has to be is creative commons or they're
willing to if it is private but they're
willing to give it to a creative commons
than we post it so we've had a lot of
for example publishers who have come to
us that want to give us content and want
to use this but we've said specifically
it has to be creative commons and free
to the public and if you're wanting to
charge then that can be added in the
bibliography yes
yep so you can look at it a couple of
phases so this current phase is really
for us to get feedback and are we
heading in the right direction it is
this intuitive enough and so in this
current phase it's more of people to
test it in their classrooms use it in
their current usage but they can't add
any content in it the content is really
first party where you work with us and
Berkeley to get it pulled in and then in
that there is a panel of professors that
are in each of the domain kosmos earth
and life that review the content to make
sure that it's of the right quality in
the next phase of our development that
will kick off in about six months
because we want to make sure we get
enough feedback we will then begin to
create what we're calling a third-party
tool where then anyone could then put in
their content but then it goes through a
review panel and so as you put in your
your pieces and it kind of walks you
through is a very simple way of here's
how to label your content here's how to
put it in here's your description here's
how you want them in the exhibits that
then the panel that's on the review
board will review it say yes this is
great or give you annotations make this
change mix this change before it
launches the other big thing that we're
trying to think through from a computer
science perspective and then also kind
of a look and feel user experience
perspective is there's a lot of content
already out there that is high quality
like we know that things in the library
of congress we all agree is good quality
that you would want automatically in
here content from cern for example we'd
what automatically to come in here and
so we're trying to figure out how do we
automatically pull information and how
should it look like is it is each
information come in as an artifact or is
it an exhibit or how does it look those
are all technical kind of user
interfaces that we're looking in to try
and figure out how to do and so we're
looking at kind of two forms of
automated pull in and then also end user
generated yes
so that she doesn't have to repeat your
questions here uh my understanding is
Bill Gates owns a manuscript of da Vinci
so how how would he go about getting
that added into presumably this
wonderful timeline that's a great
question because Bill Gates just emailed
us and said that he wants to make sure
because it there's also a big history
project that he's sponsoring that we
work closely in collaboration with kind
of in a partnership but they're focused
on high school students only and we want
to look at kind of university also and
then he also has his own personal
collection so right now once again in
phases were in the first party phase
where we can work directly with content
providers to pull stuff in that we
already know our high quality and then
in the next phase of next year we hope
to have a third party tool where people
can more easily put in content
themselves they get reviewed by a review
board and then it publishes and then in
this next phase will also have the the
chrono zoom world layer that if you
don't want it reviewed by the content
board but you just want to use the tool
and populate it and kind of has the
typical social networking stars and
voting and those things we have that and
and we'll let the third party tool be
available for others for instance um I
might want to do my own timeline on I
don't know the life of brian or
something yes exactly thank you so I'm
we gotta move on and and thanks again
reading that that's a wonderful
presentation I'll leave my card here
feel free to take it and if you have
content and you want to work with me
just send me an email</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
