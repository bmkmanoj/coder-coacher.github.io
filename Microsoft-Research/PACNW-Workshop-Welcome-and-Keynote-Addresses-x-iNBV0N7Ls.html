good morning again I'm David Martin the
associate director the applied physics
laboratory at the University of
Washington and share of the nanos board
and this is dr. Jan Newton the nanos
executive director hello I would just
like to welcome you all here and share
David's greetings to you all we are
honored by your presence your a numerous
and diverse crowd and I look forward to
interacting with you more thank you
thanks Jan thank you again folks are
coming today this is a quite important
conference for our region and as you'll
see later on today for for this national
effort on which we're all embarked I see
this as having three principal reasons
why we're here today one to educate and
inform constituency in the Pacific
Northwest about what we're about here
with I use and with nanos to hear from
our users on how we are doing things and
how we can do things better for two
reasons one so we can do things better
and so that people who are not yet in
trained with us can understand how
powerfully important our user base is to
us and third to encourage and enable
those federal state tribal and local
agencies which have missions involving
the oceans who are not yet engaged to do
so with us I need to thank a number of
people I begin with the ocean
observation sea ocean observation
committee and working with them Ralph
Rainier Nicholas Rome and Joshua young
for all their Herculean efforts in
getting this set up and for their role
in leading this workshop also our our
local organizing committee whose members
are listed in the brochure which will be
coming here soon but if I could ask all
the members of the local organizing
committee for this workshop to please
stand for a round of applause
thank you all for that and of course our
sponsors I begin with Microsoft I also
add Siebert electronics so no Dinah
international reed exhibitions and puget
sound partnership and I end my thanks
where I began with the with the
wonderful generosity of microsoft
research for providing this beautiful
venue and all the support that is
entailed with the workshop of this
magnitude and it is my distinct pleasure
in that regard to introduce to all of
you mr. Roffe outland of Microsoft
Research thanks is this am I on on the
mica okay fantastic so welcome Oh first
of all I want to say that and this
workshop is about you so I want to get
to the about you part I'm really very
excited to be here and to be a
participant and learn a lot today and
before I go into my little brief
introduction about Microsoft and
Microsoft Research I'll re-emphasize
where I'll mention that we have sort of
a follow-on event tomorrow which
everybody is welcome to attend we have
some pre-registration for that around 45
50 people and that will be over in
building 99 so that's a different
facility and we'll have sort of an
extended look at some Microsoft
Technology if you're interested in that
part that would be a great way of
getting connected and then we'll have
some following discussions and work from
today's proceedings so very quickly
about me and Microsoft or Microsoft
Research and all this stuff Microsoft
Research is a part of the company that's
sort of charged with looking ahead and
thinking about the future of technology
and I feel very lucky to work in a part
of that that's called microsoft research
connections it's directed by tony hey
and it's about collaboration strong
emphasis on collaboration and on
problems associated with let's say
getting science done and so we've
published a book called the fourth
paradigm which is free online you can
look at that and it's a way of thinking
about problems that have arisen as our
technologies kind of gotten ahead of us
and for example you've probably had
conversations about the data deluge or
we've had conversations about
all the data sets that are out there
there would be nice to have access to
and why can't we figure out how to do
that with computers and make them
discoverable in fact my group my theme
which is directed by Dan Fay over here
is called earth energy environment so
that's kind of our focus and we're
concerned with the full arc of data in
informatics through the research process
and so this workshop kind of represents
a4a for us into a slightly different
space because it's not pure research but
it's actually getting into the
applications and the uses of data in the
generation of data so we're very excited
about that about learning more about
that when I say the data arc I mean
everything from imagining what your
research project would look like or your
application to going out and acquiring
the data to accumulating and collecting
a curating it to making it available to
your users to possibly publishing it to
make it discoverable and reusable and we
try and do to try and do in our
collaborations as we try and make the
solutions that we come up with to
various pieces of this data arc this
informatics arc not only useful for our
collaborator but also replicable so that
other people can take a look at that and
adopt it and a good example of that
would be something that we built called
size scope and that is a one-stop
shopping center it's a data catalog it's
built on a map and you can select a
polygon and a time range in a keyword
and it will tell you whether or not
there's data in that parameter space
that you selected and that's currently
hosted at Berkeley Water Center and once
it's done that and shown you on the map
where the data is available you can
click on one of those I have data icons
and you can tell it to go get the data
now it's going and getting the data from
the US Geological Survey National Water
information system but you don't need to
know that and you can also go get
information on diazinon or other various
you know waterborne toxic chemicals and
it's going in getting that from the EPA
so it's going to different agencies and
getting data and acting as a single
collecting point so the concept there is
can you build a system that allows
somebody to access public data without
having to go to each individual data
portal and have a different kind of
inner route
and figure out the data portal so that's
the kind of thing that we're interested
in now another part of the data arc
that's really important is visualization
particularly as datasets get more
complex so i wanted to show something
that we're working on right now it's
called layer scape and it's powered by
worldwide telescope worldwide telescope
is running up here and it was originally
an astronomy tool now we're kind of
reevaluate towards an earth science
focus and the important thing to say
here is that going into this the idea is
to try and demonstrate a slightly more
complicated than usual data set and some
tools that we're building into this
system to help you visualize that to get
a handle on it and this is really
available is something you can download
install and run play with and learn how
to use and there's more tools built
around it too so I'll talk about that in
a second but I think that's probably
enough initial talking we'll see how
this works huge was to try and
demonstration a live demonstration book
see how it goes
okay so this is showing where we are you
get yet to make this thing work we're
off the coast of California this is a
collaboration with monterey bay aquarium
research institute and this is showing a
drifter the dress with the current goes
south words for about four days so this
is an experiment in november of i think
two years ago and then there's a robotic
submarine called dorado that swims
around it in circles and porpoises it
goes up and down and every time it
passes through the depth of the drifting
package we make a little ripple here on
our visualization to show that there at
the same depth and therefore they ought
to be saying similar stuff they're both
CTV's right but the the drifter is also
grabbing water samples for meta genomic
analysis at MIT i set up all this data
in an Excel spreadsheet and just pushed
it into this application and hit play
well that's the initial visualization
then once I had a handle on the data I
went back and I actually offered this
tour which is series of perspectives and
time stamps and some text and some music
and so forth so that I could show it to
you I think at this point we're going to
go like underneath the data so it's
really a two-stage thought process the
first is how do I get my data in here
and look at it and then once I
understand my data from looking at it
how do I tell a story around
the guys didn't bar I saw this the first
thing they said was it looks like our
data is not quite calibrated because the
color should be a same every time you
see those ripples they should be the
same color if you're close enough
this happens to be salinity I should I
should have mentioned that yeah but they
have a lot of stuff in their data stack
it's dissolved oxygen and a couple of
fluorescence channels and so forth okay
but let's move on is something that's
not geospatial necessarily I'm another
research project it involves mass spec
analysis of water samples let out a
little bit so this is a grad students
decomposition of both mm so Flores
fluorescence results fluorescence
spectra and then mass spec and the point
here is that this is an abstract space
right and this is a decomposition of
data into an abstract set of components
you don't need to have a latitude and
longitude to use the system to visualize
these complicated data sets and the last
thing I threw in here just for fun you
have to sort of see if you can guess
what what this is
any thoughts there's no way in the world
you're going to guess this these are
tweets of Happy New Year on New Year's
Eve so but the nice thing about this is
that the Happy New Year thing came about
because we created a website for content
okay we've created this the set of tools
and you build something and you want to
share it with people well you need
something like YouTube so we've built
this sort of YouTube thing it's a layer
escape website in fact i'll see if i can
stop this okay and i'll see if i can we
drag this over here oh so that's the
layer scape website you can hit play and
see what happens there but the point of
the website is that you can create
content with this system that i'm
showing here and then you can upload it
here and you can make a community and
you can share it with people and then
you can let anybody see it so some
people came along and they made that
happy new year thing because they happen
to mine tweets4 latitudes and longitudes
and they saw our system and they mashed
it up and and off we go so this is kind
of the the thing that we're really
interested in seeing adopted right now
and that's why I'm showing it to you
it's kind of a lot of fun to work on but
before I quit I'll mention a couple of
other Microsoft technologies one of them
is I on earth and that's a not it's part
of Microsoft is that built it it's our
worldwide public sector it's not
microsoft research but I on earth is
about accountability to the broad public
so the European environmental agency
hired Microsoft to build a website that
allows people in the European Union to
go and report on water quality report on
air quality report on noise levels
report it into this website through
their phone and then you can go to this
website and you can see the density of
data and what it's like at your favorite
beach what the historical record of how
dirty that Beach tends to be do I want
to go swimming there okay so I on earth
is something that will talk about
extensively tomorrow with that follow-on
session and I on earth is sort of
emerging with something called data
market and data market ISM is a
microsoft cloud resource for getting
access to data so these are really
really important sort of product level
technologies they're not coming out of
research are coming out of our our
product engine
microsoft and so it's a potentially
really valuable to a community like this
to know about these things and to sort
of be aware of the potential uses so i
think that's it the last thing I'll say
is that when you come to these things
people usually they hand you a thumb
drive with your company on it or
something like that and I noticed some
of you have these epiphytes so I wanted
to point out that rather than give you
yet another thumb drive we were
experimenting with them handing out some
actual really photosynthesizing
creatures there are epiphytes they're
available outside and there's a little
assembly process yet little spray bottle
they don't have any roots you just kind
of keep them on your desk and hit them
with some spray every once in a while
and there's an instruction sheet a
little sticker that you can make the
landing pad their home be and then
there's a I'll fight it sell at the
fight itself and you can choose one and
bring it with you and we love it if you
carry it along and that you can even
read the instructions and go register we
have provided a website and participate
in the upper fide community it's all
about social networking so so with that
I'll just say welcome again we're so
glad that you could come here we hope
this will be great and I'm looking
forward to what comes next so thank you
very much
you have time for questions ladies okay
is a product that you're showing here
slanted towards a decision-maker would
you say for a basic or academic research
community or somewhere in between yeah
so the later escaped of the world wide
telescope is really right now being
built for researchers now my philosophy
is that we have this huge outreach
potential educating as you say
decision-makers and so forth so every
technical decision we make for
researchers I try and make there be a
component in the direction of that
outreach and that public policy space so
we're trying to for example in choosing
names of categories we didn't go for
highly technical category names for how
you would choose what to classify your
content as so that's basically our thing
was we're working with researchers broad
focuses our eventual aim research which
is a subdivision could you just maybe
tell us a little bit about how that how
that what Microsoft Research write the
questions what's microsoft research
research with respect to Microsoft and
we are sort of the guys who get to think
about what is the future of technology
and in a lot of cases invent that future
some of what research does has to do
with sort of prototyping crazy ideas
that could eventually become products
and that's how the Kinect human-shaped
recognition game controller came about
that was originally a microsoft research
project that got kind of incubated
overthrown over the wall into the
product space and it's obviously been
hugely successful for us so that's
wonderful but we also have just pure
theoreticians guys who are working in
graph theory and all kinds of abstract
spaces like that and then as I say we
have this sort of collaboration Aloka
sin our group where we get to go out and
learn from and partner with people
outside the company so we have a lot of
different focuses but microsoft research
in general is sort of the looking ahead
part
company and we're not about turning and
turning a profit which is why we offer
to the tools that we build like this
completely free and there were just
trying to make a contribution yeah Rob
as you got introduced to the ocean
observations community as it were and
looked at the kinds of data that are
being generated I imagine at some point
you said gee I wonder why they don't do
the following why there isn't the
following capability and just curious
what your first reaction was to looking
at the ocean observations data well the
first thing you realize is the ocean is
really big there's not enough of us to
canvass it and so the data is very
sparse right and so what you want to see
and this is not just oceanography is you
want to see the data that gets collected
be available so that you have let's say
data management organizations like Biko
demo at Woods Hole who are trying to
pull together like NSF requirements for
making your data available and people's
requirements for how they like to get it
data and then this idea of a web service
where i can write our computer program
that gets data rather than having to go
to a website and click around all the
time so not just an oceanography but we
see this evolution of data systems and
then of course there's OGC standards
feeding into this so this big process
going along and everybody sees the
direction they're headed the right way
my my opinion but it's just really hard
to do so you know that's that's the
direction that we talk about trying to
help out and push forward a lot data
system data access
alright well I feel I should I should
turn it over to our keynote speaker so
let me halt there the individual that's
going to introduce our keynote speaker
today is one of three federal co-chairs
of the interagency ocean observing
committee which was brought into forest
by a national law in 2009 which
established the requirement for a
regional coastal ocean observation
network for our country he is Bob Melvin
who is he section Lee for the integrated
programs section within the ocean
sciences division of the National
Science Foundation ladies and gentlemen
Bob Hellman
thank you David it's my distinct
pleasure to introduce miss Laura for
gionee the NOAA deputy assistant
administrator for weather service and
the deputy director of the National
Weather Service in this role she is
responsible for the day-to-day civilian
weather operations for the United States
its territories adjacent waters and
ocean areas she previously served as the
assistant administrator for the NOAA
office of program planning and
integration and was responsible for
corporate management to coordinate the
many lines of service for the five
billion dollar agency earlier in her
career as the director of Noah's
National Weather Service Alaska region
she was responsible for all operational
and scientific climatological
meteorological hydrological volcanic ash
and tsunami warning programs for the
state of Alaska and the surrounding
waters I think you will agree with me
that Ms for gionee is extremely well
placed to provide insight on how the
National Weather Service currently uses
observations and the potential for new
capabilities both for operational and
planning purposes please join me in
welcoming miss Virgie Oni for her
keynote address
Oh
technical difficulties are we wired can
you hear me great perfect thanks Bob and
thanks to rob fallen for his visual
presentation I obviously do not have
cool visualizations for you like he does
but we'll work on it we do have some
cool weather for you today I know it's
like this here all the time just like
it's like this in Alaska all the time
and so we can thank we can thank our
meteorologist in charge of the Seattle
forecast office Brad Coleman for
providing this wonderful weather we have
here today so Brad take credit for the
good weather come on now so it's my
pleasure to be here I have there were
several people that twisted my arm a
little bit the first email I had was
some Jack done again wanted me to come
here and speak to you all and then
stanca Willis and then a Jan Newton as
well so they didn't have to twist my arm
very hard at all I've been involved in I
use basically since its inception and I
was a little nervous at first not
understanding what I used was all about
but as soon as Admiral Latin Bakr put
out his annual guidance memorandum
saying that I used was cool and
something that we should really do do
helping us take the pulse of the planet
and so I understood what was going on
next thing I met Molly mccammon and I
was hooked so I was on the AU's the
Alaska ocean observing board and a
everything else is history so thanks to
Molly for encouraging me to go to DC
when that opportunity came forth to I
don't know if she was tired of me or
thought maybe I could help a little bit
more in DC our hosts thank you very much
microsoft research what a beautiful
campus you have here it's a great place
to be and also the co-sponsors again I'd
like to thank the co-sponsors seabird
electronics sona sona darn international
reed exhibitions and of course nanus the
nash northwest association of networked
ocean observing
much easier to say nanus and I use and
then we all joke about the oozing of all
the regional associations right so we
are facing interesting times and we are
increasing our understanding of the
oceans the atmosphere the land all the
time and this has led to excellent
advances in our ability to forecast and
warn the oceanic weather and the
atmospheric weather for you all but we
don't always get things right when i was
in alaska I always had the weather right
though because we hardly had any
verification observations out there so
the weather was always right days like
today though make me think of when I was
in aviation forecaster in Alaska and the
photographer's would call and say here's
the weather i need and i would say well
here's the weather you're going to get
and they would say well here's the
weather i need so we continue to
struggle with ignore exactly what's
going to happen with the weather but
partnerships like you all and through i
use definitely as helped us advance our
ability to forecast the weather two
weeks ago Brad was not being applauded
and clapped for when the when the
Seattle area was hit with the winter
storm in the ice storm snow on Wednesday
and then turning over to ice on Thursday
so the storm actually wasn't a surprise
though we were doing webinars and
briefings over the weekend before the
storm actually hit there was uncertainty
in the amount of ice we were going to
receive and that was really what the
surprise was was the magnitude of the
storm and how long the storm was
actually going to last our forecast
models didn't anticipate again the
magnitude of the ice so the ice is what
really fooled us the private
meteorologists and researchers we did
get back on track quickly using our
real-time observations the profilers our
new coastal radar exciting to have that
coastal radar out there showing us what
was going on and of course the automated
system observing systems we worked with
Puget Sound Energy and that's an
important to work with folks like puget
sound energy to make sure that they're
that their folks who were out trying to
restore the power could do that in a
safe manner as well so they were facing
dangerous high winds as they worked to
restore the power to the thousands of
customers who were out of power it's
always difficult to forecast here just
like in Alaska with the the coastal
terrain and and the mountains back east
they say it's hard to forecast as well
because of all those well they call them
mountains but they're kind of like those
rounded Hills they have back there but
it's definitely a challenge as well
particularly when you have storms coming
off of the ocean the Nor'easters we have
back in the east and so again
pinpointing those temperatures and other
factors whether you'll get ice snow or
wind is really important to have an
understanding of what's going on over
the ocean over the past couple of
decades investments in science
technology strategic partnerships have
enabled us to overcome some of the
obstacles and greatly improve our
forecasting for example I use a net
nanus now have in the water tremendous
amount of information that's fed to our
national data buoy center and Stennis in
fact I was down there visiting them last
year and the amount of data they have
now is unbelievable and has improved
significantly since the indian ocean
tsunami december two thousand four
another great example again is the
installation of the northwest new
coastal radar last fall i saw some of
the advances at brads office yesterday I
went to the weather forecast office and
saw how that was able to show really
where the rain and snow line what was in
the exact position unfortunately that's
the real time data rather than being
able to help us forecast it hours and
days in advance we've come a long way
but we have a long way to go what else
might have helped us with that ice storm
one thing we found almost immediately in
the assessment that Brad in his office
did was our models did not capture the
extent of the precipitation that
over the Pacific Ocean it would help
immensely to improve our atmospheric
observations over the ocean one of our
major challenges is to integrate the
ocean the atmosphere and our coastal
observations at all scales the new
Doppler radar on the coast here provides
advanced technologies and data
collection however the radar can only
see a few hundred miles out and as you
know those storms are often developing
and moving in from thousands of miles
away out at sea integrating these
multiple collection platforms satellites
ocean observing systems coastal buoys
high-frequency radar that would
significantly improve our predictive
capabilities our partnerships have
enabled us to integrate these
capabilities particularly the mutual
benefits of our iOS partnerships and
what that can bring to us in the future
there are strong national and
international needs as well you know
last year we experienced the year of
extremes we were calling it over a
thousand lives were lost so we had 14
individual billion-dollar events related
to weather and those economic losses
totaled 50 billion dollars even though
in the weather enterprise we are
performing well Joplin was really the
catalyst for us in regards to developing
an initiative called our weather ready
nation we did a great job of forecasting
the tornado that impacted the Joplin
area in fact they had 24 minutes of lead
time but still 160 people perished so
why are people still dying if our
forecasts are so good there's strategic
alignment of partners like you all will
be able to better get the information of
these forecasts and warnings to the last
mile how can we communicate the
information appropriately and minimize
the loss of life and property none of us
can approve improve and provide the
weather ready nation initiative alone so
we've got to value our collaboration and
the partnerships the private sector
research and innovation that Rob talked
about investments in new technologies
and research institutions all that add
value to the work that we need to do
again to build this weather ready nation
I know that oceanographers often envied
the meteorologists wealth of
observations but meteorologists
particularly marine meteorologists are
always observation starved we want more
observations and the more we can get the
better our forecasts and warnings will
be we have a couple paths to take one is
to continue doing what we're doing now
doing the same things ironically it is
Groundhog's Day today and so Bill Murray
may have had it right but those of us
that are here in this room we're not
going to accept doing the same things
over and over every day we're going to
choose another path and push forward to
continue to improve despite the
constraints imposed upon us in these
difficult economic times we are all
observation starved but observing
systems are expensive that makes our
partnerships all the more important
we're we're not only leveraging each
other's expertise we're also eliminating
redundancy reducing uncertainty and
ensuring the maximum value for each
system so where are we now our current
capabilities were filled by your
visionary decisions made in the past
strategic partnerships and sophisticated
instrumentation have resulted in our
greater understanding of the
interactions between the oceans and the
atmosphere and I'm so thankful that I'm
talking to such a diverse group of
individuals out here typically I'm
talking to a bunch of meteorologists
sorry Brad but that's really what we've
got to do we've all got to come together
beyond just the meteorology community
and make sure that these partnerships
are leveraged and we're understanding
better the linkages among the land the
atmosphere and the oceans and how these
influence each other I use observations
provide data that enable weather service
to run models and create marine
forecasts advisories and warnings in
some reasons regions of the country all
we have are wave observations the
forecast offices are provided by iOS
overall NOAA national weather service
platforms operated by i use partners and
the Noah's National Ocean service
provides seventy-eight percent of the
data that the national data buoy Center
has so it's pretty amazing the amount of
information we're able to compile and
pull together we in the weather
Enterprise are keenly appreciative of
how knowledge of oceans has improved the
meteorological modeling and forecasting
for example Hurricane Irene our track
forecast was right on the money we have
greater lead time in understanding and
detecting the storm development in fact
the storm actually made landfall near
Morehead City North Carolina on Saturday
on Monday we were trying to get dr.
Hayes on the flight of the p3 that would
penetrate the storm and I actually had
to go on the website the Hurricane
Center website and say um let's see it
looks like the storm might be named
Irene I think you're going to be flying
into Irene on Friday Jack and that was
the storm he flew so that's pretty
amazing that we knew that storm was out
there seven days in advance and pretty
close almost right on track to where it
made landfall now in 1999 I was the
warning coordination meteorologist in
Morehead City that's when hurricane
Dennis Floyd and Irene devastation has
kind of followed me so it's not really
my performance it's just that
devastation has followed me along my
career at any rate Hurricane Floyd in 99
almost took the same path that Irene
took but unfortunately we evacuated
Florida South care Atlanta South
Carolina North Carolina all up the
eastern seaboard we evacuated thankfully
Irene we knew she was going to pretty
much go right into North Carolina so the
number of evacuations was considerably
less based on our ability to forecast
the track again 78 days in advance
another extremely important benefit is
that we are able to avoid those
unnecessary evacuations think about how
information
increase people's safety not only are we
providing more time to prepare for
storms that hit we're avoiding again
those unnecessary evacuations that are
so costly in addition to quickly
developing weather events oceanic
information is also helping us
understand longer range phenomena our
knowledge of El Nino and La Nina events
for example is helping with predictions
and with connecting individual weather
patterns these events that we've seen
here in the northwest are very typical
of a La Nina event that we've been in
for a year now and we are expecting to
continue the IU's community in the
Pacific Northwest have provided
significant help regarding coastal
hazards through the high-frequency radar
network and other observation platforms
these observations in conjunction with
the National Weather Service
meteorological data give us improve
capability to predict the fate and
transport of hazardous spills and
improve the forecast for puget sound for
the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the
Columbia River we still have to build
these already strong partnerships as we
increase our knowledge of systemic
influences we also look at how we can
optimize the mix of the observations
currently I you spring partners together
to enable access to buoy and
meteorological data from academics
commercial and other local providers
this happens partially through federal
dollars but it also leverages a variety
of other funding sources so it's not
just federal dollars this of course
decreases the cost of our work but again
provides that valuable information so we
can have accurate forecasts and warnings
we capitalize on this even further for
instance with the investment in i use
buoys can be supported in strategic
locations of key modelers so I was in
Alaska region the partnership that we
had with Molly mccammon we were able to
move one of the buoys and Prince William
Sound and make it a multi sensor
platform now granted that costs a little
bit and so we can't do that throughout
the entire network but there's some
things to continue to think about I find
fascinating that in the future our model
forecasts may be improved by physical
and chemical ocean out oceanographic
observations brought to us by fleets of
salmon seals sea lions amazing
technological breakthroughs that we had
never thought of before effective work
in our partnerships can also help us
understand and mitigate the impacts of
weather phenomena on coastal ecosystems
and economies so our current need I
think our current need is still this
vision of a weather-ready nation we're
always looking at how we can do better
no matter how well we're doing because
we recognize the impacts that weather
forecasting have on people and our
infrastructure the ice storm caused
power outages canceled flights which I
think sanka was prepared to sleep on the
floor here in Seattle she said business
closures etc people look into the
forecast to make decisions affecting
their safety in their livelihoods we're
excited about our partnership with I use
what it's done and what it can do for
helping us build a weather-ready nation
the end goal is to help people make
better decisions with better information
so again we can save lives and
livelihood The Weather Service part is
to provide accurate information and help
people act on it to make communities
resilient to weather and environmental
impacts being weather ready nation being
a weather-ready nation goes beyond
preparedness for storms and climate
issues a high portion of the u.s.
population as you well know live along
the coast now I think it's 51 percent of
the population live within seventy
seventeen percent of our land it's clear
that we need more information more
observations from oceans in order to
protect lives and livelihood a
weather-ready nation initiative enables
integrated environmental services that
support both healthy communities
ecosystems in the support of Noah's
vision of resilient ecosystems
communities and economies the National
Weather Service and other Noah line
offices are working in partnership with
I use to address weather dependent event
that impact the public the public health
the coastal ecosystem and coastal
commerce harmful algal blooms and
hypoxia threaten aquaculture and
commercial fisheries pathogens threaten
our health recreation and public safety
so as I heard yesterday let's get that
beach closure out the day that we need
the beach closure not the day after we
need the beach closure these hazards
combined with other ecosystem stressors
such as climate change ocean
acidification threaten our lives and
livelihood I use partnerships contribute
critical infrastructure and observing
capabilities that address these issues
on the local regional national and even
international scales and I use coastal
observing model test bed is under
development with the aim to accelerate
the transition of Science and Technology
in the coastal hazard prediction life
health property and the environment can
be better protected against storm surge
harmful algal blooms and hypoxia as the
test bed helps us put knowledge into
operational services last week I was in
New Orleans at the American
Meteorological Society I mean so that's
like our weather geek convention of the
year it is really cool but i prefer the
diverse community i have here today but
seriously new orleans is still
recovering not only from Katrina but
also now from the deepwater horizon Gulf
oil spill during Deepwater Horizon
cleanup made very clear the cross
influences of whether water and the
influences on people and the ecosystems
in fact the Coast Guard said that
weather drove their operations the first
thing they needed to know was what the
weather was so they could then determine
what operations they took throughout the
day to incorporate the rest of your
expertise the situation had made major
impacts on ecosystems affecting commerce
tourism and help the cleanup required
great efforts from a large number of
partners workers capping the leak needed
weather forecasts for lightning storms
hurricanes and even severe heat I use
provided the high
frequency radar to track the movement of
oil on surface currents industries
product innovations such as the
underwater gliders that we saw in the
demonstration provided data to track the
movement of the oil through the water
column all this information was vital to
effective decision-making during the
spill the National Weather Service is
eager to continue this partnership we
also need our system partners so I'm
looking forward to this workshop to
provide key information that will help
get us closer to the vision of a
weather-ready nation a weather-ready
nation requires regionally scaled
collaborations and observations data
delivery and product development the
needs don't stop at the regional or
national levels as I mentioned we
recognize the need for more data in the
atmospheric observations over the oceans
our national center for environmental
prediction which is where the IU's test
bed will be they are performing global
ocean and atmospheric modeling and
real-time data dissemination that
enables I use research and regional and
local modeling efforts we continue to
establish international partnerships as
well for remotely sensed ocean data the
better our global observations the
better the benefits throughout the world
again taking that pulse of our planet so
in closing the IU's partnership has
provided us with extremely valuable data
maintaining the system and pushing
improvements forward are important our
collaboration is strong our partnerships
include those with I use and the
industry giving us observations and TKE
together creating effectiveness in
meeting our regional stakeholder needs
most of the IU's regional associations
which I know there are 11 work with the
National Weather Service forecast
offices these collaborations provide
data and model output for our forecasts
the delivery of bowie data through the
national data by center and the joint
development of products and services i
use is a strong partner and we're
pleased to kick off this workshop and
explore how it and regionally nanus can
strengthen and optimize our efforts i'm
excited about this
workshop and what it can accomplish to
push our air already strong
collaboration and introduce new facets
I'm looking forward to finding new ways
we can collaborate to collaboratively
build a weather-ready nation and we need
you to help us thanks again for allowing
me this opportunity to speak with you
this morning and I look forward to
building a weather-ready nation thank
you I don't think I've ever gotten a
whistle before what is that is
impressive very impressive so Laura you
know this is the first time I've ever
met you and I just want to say that I
can't think of a better lead off keynote
speech for what you just delivered I
want to thank you personally and and to
me one of the things that you stress so
well was the complex interaction between
ocean and atmosphere to appear a
scientist you get that but but I don't
think that our world really understands
that the other thing you stress so well
is the importance of partnerships
working together and that's what this
whole workshop is about so your words
are perfect and the third thing that I
love that you pointed out is that it is
Groundhog's Day and so let's think about
how we want to go forward so so I just
wanted to offer my thanks and now open
it to the fourth floor we have plenty of
time for questions for for Laura so pox
a pox itani Phil did see his shadow
granted that's not incorporated into our
in so forecast but it does mean that
we'll have six more weeks of winter and
so I take Phil and uh what is that the
Farmers Almanac I grew up on a five
generation farm in Missouri and so I
incorporate all that information into my
weather forecast on a daily basis yes
sir
I was the Whistler this is the strongest
statement that I've heard from the
weather service and extremely valuable
for the ocean observing community and I
just wanted to thank you for that
leadership from the weather service
we've needed to hear that for a couple
of decades this is extraordinary and I
know many of the audience recognize that
I also realized many in the audience are
just learning how important that
statement is so thank you for that state
thank you and I still have to go back to
Admiral Lawton Bakr giving us that
leadership in that annual guidance
memorandum six years ago or so and also
the relationship that I had with Molly
mccammon in Alaska and and Molly
encouraging me to continue my career
beyond Alaska I was an Alaskan forever
and Molly encouraged me to move to DC so
we won't go down that path right now but
it is I really understand I mean what is
it fourth grade fifth grade we learn
about the water cycle so it all has to
come together from where we say the
ridge to the reefs or the you know the
summit to the see what have you it all
has to be combined and one of the things
thankfully I did go to work outside of
weather service for for ppi at NOAA the
strategic planning office and so it
helped me better understand the other
line offices within NOAA and many other
agencies EPA do I and how we all need to
come together NSF and work on these
these tough issues of combining the
oceans the atmosphere and our land-based
observation networks also I did steal
from PPI the the coastal person who was
working on fishery things and I brought
her over to the weather service with me
to try to help get beyond the weather
service and their stovepipe thinking
just about land and atmosphere and pull
in the ocean components as well so thank
you there's a question
which is it earthy atmospheric community
in your forecast you don't have scatter
over winds on the ocean I don't have
percentages for you but excitingly
enough I think we're working with India
on ocean scat is that what it's called
Sanka Oh scat or something like that so
I'm pretty sure we soon will have what's
that it wants a better Africa oh well
coming from Alaska yes that does mean
something different if it's if it's warm
or hard or what have you but it is an
important component so particularly the
focus on the loss of quick scat was
always in regards to our hurricane
forecast thankfully we do have
additional monitoring systems and so we
didn't see a degradation in our track or
intensity forecast related to quick scat
I think it's more in the polar regions
though where we weren't able to see some
of those hurricane-force winds in our
maritime forecasts but again were
continued to see advances in our our
satellites and other observation
mechanisms to allow us to move forward
so coming from Alaska when that
situation was going on it wasn't just
about the Hurricanes it was about our
fishing fleet in the North Atlantic and
the North Pacific
No
smack them around right we just have to
there are so many things often times the
warning coordination meteorologist and
the sooz get really focused on the the
folks that they have relationships and
the interactions that they've worked
with over over the years and so you know
there's only so much time in one day and
so we need to be more proactive and
expand our partnerships that we have
beyond just the again beyond just the
meteorological and the emergency
management community during these
extreme weather events it's been
difficult to focus on anything than just
really surviving and getting past the
next storm but I will continue to push
this and through our social media and
everything else I know they were taking
pictures out at the forecast office
yesterday we all have Facebook pages and
seeing that senior leadership is
involved in a workshop like this alone
will help you know with the message of I
use is important and we need to get
further involved in these in these type
of partnerships so I appreciate your
comment any other questions all right
well thank you again Loras thank you
the unpredictability of weather is a
good segue to our to our next situation
here we had planned for two keynote
speakers this morning senator Kevin
rancor from the state of Washington was
to join us and because of state
legislature demands and Olympia last
night sessions going very late that was
not possible but we have dr. John Stein
here the director of the NOAA Northwest
fishery science center who is going to
introduce senator rancor and who we have
asked to say a few words on just to give
you a sense a little bit for some of
rancors efforts but also to tell us
about regional Noah so John please join
us thanks thanks Jen so first I do want
to thank Laura for her keynote address
that was quite good so thank you Rick
for calling her out and for your
certainly for your leadership at the
weather service known Laura for a while
and she's a good friend and a good
leader and and she does know she does
put that one Noah hat on which I think
we all need and i think is important and
I think Laura was spot on and saying
that collaborations and partnerships are
the key to doing better and achieving a
weather-ready nation and in fact I think
for all of Noah's missions and
responsibilities so putting out one my
other hats on as the lead for Noah's
regional collaboration team in the west
which is trying to work across the no
Alliant offices I just want to point out
that the NOAA team here in Seattle and
with its partners along the west coast
does work from another way snowcaps to
white caps and in trying to better
understand the linkages between
atmosphere and the ocean how they affect
our weather and climate as Laura so
aptly pointed out and then how both
affect our coastal environment
and the living learning resources that
are also important to our local
economies so better observations improve
and improved understanding I think
glass-half-full will clearly lead to
improve forecasts projections and on
several fronts as we work together
collaboratively as Jan did note senator
Rick rancor has been busy doing the
business of the state of Washington and
couldn't be here today but I do want to
make just a few remarks about Senator
rancor and why he was invited to give a
keynote address it's just basic
background senator anchor as a
represents the 40th legislative district
here in the state of Washington which is
north of here he is also not only a
strong and unwavering champion of Noah
and the work that we do with our
partners he has a long history of
promoting strong partnerships and
collaborations at local and regional
levels including the work with nanos and
I appreciate also being able to serve
nanos on its executive board and helping
in building those collaborations many of
you also may know that Senator anchor
has for many years a lot of experience
in community development and in public
policy in both the private and the
public sectors in addition to his
responsibilities as a Washington state
senator he is also a senior fellow for
the ocean foundation and serves as a
senior advisor to the joint ocean
commission initiative senator anchor has
developed and advanced coastal and ocean
policy community development strategies
and conservation initiatives extensively
on the west coast but also beyond in
both Mexico and Indonesia Indonesia so
in my current capacity of also worked
closely with Senator rancor as part of
his leadership role on the National
Ocean Council's governance Coordinating
Committee which is helping with
implementation of the president's
National Ocean policy senator rancor has
advanced key climate change legislation
coastal and ocean policy and energy and
transportation legislation in Washington
a Senate he serves as vice chair of
Natural Resources ocean and Recreation
Committee vice chair of the agriculture
and rural economic development committee
and a member of the environment water
and energy and transportation committees
so I think all these are important areas
to the topic that we talked about today
so I will close with this I've heard him
state a number of times that there is no
need to trade the environment for jobs
and that the two are inextricably linked
what is good for the environment is good
for job development growth and I believe
many of it as many of us do that he is
absolutely right in this regard and I
think with that Jen I think it's a good
place to stop and get on with the
workshop so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
