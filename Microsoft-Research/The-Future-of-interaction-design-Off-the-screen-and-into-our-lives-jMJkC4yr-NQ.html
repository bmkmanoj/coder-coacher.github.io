you
thank you everybody for coming I'm glad
to see a lot of people i don't know and
some people i do know this is a talk I
gave I'm um I'm Melissa quintanilla I'm
a designer he refused labs this is a
pocket I was invited to give it a higher
state university department of design
I'm a graduate there they vitae me back
as a guest lecturer to give this
presentation the presentation is related
to the subject of my thesis that I work
there and in just an evolution it's a
personal area of research of mine and
just an evolution of what I've been
asking since 2005 so back in 2005 when I
got to Ohio State everybody pretty much
had one of these and that's how they
interacted with technology that was it
the computer that people use a few
people had one of these so it wasn't
that common that people had laptop
computers back then it was mostly the
that's big screen the mouse and the
keyboard paradigm but there are also
stuff like that the hug shirt I'm not
sure if you've seen this this is a shirt
that allows people to hug each other
remotely so we were these are two ends
of the spectrum this is 2005 this pre
iphone we had a very limited way of
interacting with technology in which we
can just click we can type we can see we
couldn't really talk to our computers
back then nowaday we can talk we can
hear talks back to us so there's a
little bit more of the human senses
involved in how we interact with
computers but back then you could click
you could type you could see and you
could also hug so there was like this is
huge there's a huge gap in there so I
came to Ohio State to get my MFA degree
asking what is next after the keyboard
screen and miles paradigm there were a
lot of sensor technologies already out a
ton of a ton of different sensors like
way of sensing movement presents and you
know pressure and all kinds of stuff and
meanwhile we're still interacting with
the computers by clicking typing and
looking today we still see that this
question is being asked
what is the next paradigm is it is it
glasses is this something I where is it
is it a watch what is it so the thought
today is about interaction design and
but it's really about humans because
interaction design doesn't exist without
humans in the conversation if you create
an interactive product and nobody
interacted with it it's the same
question if a tree falls in the forest
nobody nobody hears so did it fulfill
its promise if nobody interacted with it
and we designed for humans and this talk
was made to be given to design students
at Ohio State but when I say we I'm not
just referring to designers I'm
referring to all of us because we work
at Microsoft and release products that
people use and we designed for for those
people so let's talk about how humans
interact with the world versus they how
they interact with technology you guys
know that Hot or Not game so we're going
to have a hotter nut moment now sorry if
I disappointed so if I show you this
coffee cup let's say it's a physical
coffee cups right here in this room and
I ask guys is it hot or not probably if
you have the physical cup with you the
first thing you're going to do is maybe
touch the cup to see if it's hard
without even looking at it without even
thinking about it imagine if you lived
in a world where the only way you could
tell that if this was hot and I was by
examining how much steam was coming out
of it which is you know this image
that's the only way you can tell if this
is hot or not is whether there is steam
coming out of the cup it sounds like a
very limited world I don't want to live
there I can touch things I can feel
things but we actually live there
technologically in our ways we interact
with technology currently vision is a
sense that dominates our interactions
with technology and focusing so narrowly
on vision is hampering our ability to
innovate effectively vision is great I'm
not saying that vision is bad it's
amazing that we can see things but just
focusing on vision
language as a way of interacting you has
been has been very limiting so let's
look how we how we got there just a
brief history moment here we started in
industrial revolution user interface
design has deep roots in industrial
revolution machines were created to
modify and act on physical matter and it
was operated by a person a human so they
were really designed to relate to and
interact with the human body and and
human body meaning it's it's what it's
capable of and what its limitations are
so I'm a human I have a foot I can use a
pedal and at the same time it may be I
can crank something with my hand and the
human body was the thing that was
interacting with those machines and I
can feel my whole body was involved it
was not only my mind it was probably
more my body than my mind like then so
it was all about the body when it
started and then came the information
revolution where the user interface user
interface progress to include these
machines a stored and processed
information and then out of a sudden we
were easy minimal bodily effort to
interact with these with these machines
I click here some typing over there I
walk around to another machine i click I
type I'm no longer one with a machine
i'm just very minimal body effort
everything went up to our minds and we
we lost that intrinsic ability to relate
to these machines via embodied cognition
and i'll come back to embody cognition
because that's the theme of the of the
talk today but embodied cognition is the
fact that your body knows if your
cognition is on not just your mind it's
also your body so we went from body and
it went all up to our heads it was all
in our minds we were thinking while
interacting in our body body physical
actions were minimized and then came
there ubiquitous computing revolution
which was starting to happen when i
joined ohio state and that's when I
started asking what is it what is the
next paradigm we went from one computer
huge computer the computer was a room
many users
could use it they had to be specialized
users we went to the PC area and we
fulfilled Bill Gates's vision of one
computer never desk and everything and
it became personal it's my personal
computer it's one user for a computer
now we are in the state that we have
many computers per user I can have the
wearable device I can have something
under my skin I can have something that
I put on my year I can have glasses I
have multiple devices all these screens
around me so we went from but we're
still using mostly our minds to interact
with these with these machines so i went
from body to mine one computer many
users to one user many computers so when
you think of future interactions with
technology people still think of this
even though this came out in 2002 i'm
going to ask everybody to play along
with me here for a second and if you're
eating is fine if you don't participate
in this but please hold your hands out
as if you are interacting with a
minority report type interface because
people see this and they go like this is
great this is how we should be
interacting with computers the point I
want to make and you we are going to get
to this and i'll tell you once you put
your hands down it's very exhausting
unless you're Tom Cruise and you're
being paid to work out your biceps to do
this type of activity and this is your
job you're probably not going to be
holding your hands up to interact if
this is the main way you interact with
it with a screen with inexperienced it's
going to get tiring after a while so
I'll just give you a few a few examples
Total Recall another vision of the
future of how we're going to be
interacting with technology you're not
have this phone implanted in your hand
but you still need to hold the hand up
to your ear in order to talk it's not
natural for me to come and say hey Reena
I need something from you so it's not
it's not natural and we know many of you
probably have walked around talking on
your phone for a few minutes you have to
switch your hands it's great for the
movies movies is
whicli visual medium it's not so great
for humans so they're doing this because
in the movies it's so much cooler for me
to hold my hand up with this projection
on my hand and just come and talk to
somebody that I can have access to in
real life it gets really tiring you for
people to hold their arms out for
instance this car UI which was I used to
work on the automotive team people need
a place to rest their hands like
floating your arms is face I see the
lots of you already gave up but with for
the ones that are still there with me so
you need a place to rest your arms and
users you know you're the bouncing car
and your arms are tired you need a way
to target what you're trying to access
their I don't know if you noticed but
the the hazard lights are right here
they're really sensitive so I lost count
of the number of times I saw ford cars
that their hazards on and people had no
idea because that's exactly what they
rest their hands so it wasn't very human
thought of like how do people are hard
when i use this thing they need a place
to rest their hands can put your hands
down now so the point i want to share me
i think so we'll try that again then it
would make you a holder for like an hour
with glowy hands
it did open a bunch of doors for the
gestural interfaces so there's there's
been pros to minority report but it is
for the movies the movies it's great to
have Tom Cruise movie stuff in the air
and but in reality I'm not designing
eight hours a day like this so this has
been sitting our populace for ideas of
what our future interactions with
technology are going to be envisioned
such as this have inspired vision such
as this I'm not sure if you're familiar
with cornea they made of glass it's this
video a vision video from 2011 in reach
every pretty much every glass surface
has projections on it and I can interact
with it but I'm still looking tapi
looking tapi maybe I can speak to it I
can hear back and this have synced you
lied to this google glass so if i can
project on any surface what if i can
project on my own personal surface and
it's right in front of me and I have the
screen but it's still very focused on
the visual it's still very focused on
the visual sense of this is the only way
I can take in information we've added
language we've vetted added the ability
to talk to it hasn't been very natural
to now but it's still pretty limited I
can I can see things I can talk to it
and I have limited touch I can tap
things I don't get a lot of feel from
the touch you know we have multitouch
nowadays it's been getting progressively
better but there's been this disturbing
reliance on visual and language based
interactions with screams if you look at
all of our interactions with technology
and language is one of our less skills
to develop when we're first four
Inhumans language is one of the last
things at first you're interacting with
the world with your body we are touching
things you're moving around and there's
been this limitation of I say the design
world here but it's really the tech
world or the human in tech world has had
this a huge limitation of this ongoing
separation between the physical and the
mental
buzzword is newly natural user
interaction everybody talks about it but
then it begs the question of what do we
really mean by natural now there's a lot
of things that people say oh this is
natural and I said what is it really
natural and I like to just rephrase that
and call it human it is about it is for
a human being whatever is natural it's
what's natural for a human being and in
the human interface is not just based on
vision and in language when I'm going
through the world I am sensing things in
multiple ways I'm not just talking or
see and we need to embrace this new
practice and inhuman lead design which
is actually very in line with the design
expose theme of next year just
coincidentally so let's talk about
embodied all right let's talk about
embodied cognition this is a picture of
where people feel emotions so here's a
neutral person there's a little bit of
blue there but it's mostly there they're
pretty neutral contrast that to where
people feel happiness it doesn't really
happen on only on your heart or on your
head it happens throughout your whole
body pretty much happiness happens from
tip of your head everywhere to your your
pinky toes if you look a shame you can
see that the high energies are on
people's cheek so when their shame
there's a lot of energy here but it just
it just goes throughout the whole body
as well and pride is that this Buffy of
the chest and raise your head and it's
like that's where the energy is but the
energy just goes through your whole body
these are just a set of emotions that
people feel and where did they register
so the point here is that we don't we
don't think with just our minds we think
with our entire bodies and the concept
of embodied cognition is that our motor
seat our motor system influences our
cognition the same way that our mind
influences our body actions so for
instance you might might think you're
angry but maybe you're
not and that's going to cause a bunch of
body act body states and also physical
actions and physical actions might cause
mind different ideas in your mind so I
body cognition is this idea that we
think with our entire bodies and I will
go through some some examples of that as
humans we know more than we can create a
symbolic account of meaning we know more
than we can that we can put in words
when you're riding a bike you're at the
same time steering pedaling balancing
navigating but it's hard to it's hard to
explain to somebody if you want to tell
somebody in words how to ride a bike you
probably say well you just pedal front
and back and try not to fall and it just
it's hard to explain because it's a body
thing like your body knows we eventually
we all say oh it's like riding a bike
you never forget because you have the
memory in your body I got this picture
of the hula hoop because that's a
personal story that happened to me I
used to be a good hula hooper when I was
about 12 maybe really really young and
it didn't pick up pick up a hula hoop
for 25 years and then one day I was
somewhere and I had this opportunity and
I friends like come on let's do it in my
mind you know our minds are always
trying to dominate and speak louder my
mind was like you don't know how to hula
hoop any more than 25 years I said I
don't know it my friend said please try
it now say I don't know it so I try and
fell a sexy I don't know it try it again
fell I tried a third time and that thing
just stayed up and up and up and up was
like I know how to do it so my body
totally tricked my mind and I like to
bring this example because biking we
learn when we were so young that we
don't remember what it is should not
know how to ride a bike and I thought I
didn't know how to do this but my body
surprised my mind meaning that it had
that information stored there somewhere
and I I didn't even know it was there
but it was and with the graphical user
interfaces we winnow today for the first
thing that happened is that the physical
performance of work has how much
nized meaning that the same body actions
that I use to edit photographs is the
same body reactions i use to communicate
with friends and family is the same body
reactions i used to write a paper there
are pros and cons the pros are that i
can i can use the same knowledge that my
body has across many applications the
con is that it's limited use of my body
so i'm not going to have the hula hoop
moment of i just know how to do this
because I've done this in the past and I
have this stored with me not just in my
mind but also in my body this
weird-looking picture it's something I
think it's from a book by tom I go it's
the it's just stuck in my mind I saw
that back in 2005 when I was starting at
Ohio State and it's the graphical user
interfaces mental model of the user
because I have this one finger because I
can click a mouse i have one eye as i
can see without a lot of depth and i
have years because i can hear we didn't
used to have mouths but it's just a very
limited view of a human like when you
draw human that's not how you draw but
if a computer will draw human maybe
that's how it will draw it so let's look
at some some ways that people think and
process the world with their bodies so
we're going to look at five different
ways activity meaning of physical
activity performance which is about
expert performance space physical space
visibility and tangibility so physical
activity how many of you think better
when you walk around and i really think
hard about a problem you start you see
people walking around so they can think
better and you see actors walking around
when they're memorizing lines they don't
memorize our line sitting down when i
was practicing this presentation I was
moving around just couldn't couldn't
think so well sitting down and without
gesturing for instance when kids learn
math they are taught to use their hands
because it's a little bit easier or when
you write something down it's easier to
remember what you wrote down because
you're activating more centers in your
brain when you write something down I'm
personally a writedown type of person I
never look sometimes I never look at it
but just effective writing something
down helps me process
and kids are a great example about how
people learn through doing because the
kid their minds their bodies are there
their presence there interacting with
the world and our cognitive structuring
requires both physical and mental
activity and when we start with the
physical as kids and we learn about the
world by interacting with it by
exploring it in the role of gesture
gesture is seen as most people think of
gesture as having a purely communicative
fashion so I'm gesturing so that I can
make my point to you guys but there's
been a lot of studies that say that
gesture has a bath city to lighten the
cognitive load for the speaker that even
children that were born blind they
gesture and you see people on their on
their cars and there is nobody in the
car they're probably with their headset
and there you know gesture your people
on their phones and gesturing just helps
people communicate and think and express
themselves so there's been a study done
that was comparing interactions on Barry
microphone use from corded phones to
handheld mobile phones to the earpiece
headset and they found that people had
they were more expressive and more
creative and were revealing more
personal information when they had the
last constraining microphone use so
meaning the fact that a microphone and
the speaker was here made them be able
to move around and they were expressing
more and disclosing more personal
information and be more creative so the
the lesson learned from here is that the
objects that have a less constraining
interaction styles for instance not
having your hand stuck in the keyboard
are likely to help people think and
communicate and thinking through
prototyping that's something that we do
a lot you know in design schools and we
do a lot here at Microsoft and you know
my Microsoft you can do a here we can do
a paper prototype or can be a Power
Point click through it can be a fresh
code that we're just
beta and we're testing with people and
we can do 3d models of things you can do
you know mood boards and physical
mock-ups and it's just a way of its
instead of working instead of talking
something through you're working it
through instead of just thinking you
through so you build something and that
artifact that you build becomes the
embodiment of the design ideas that
sometimes our hardship are just
explained in words we see that every day
as designers that we talk about a bunch
of ideas loss we draw it and we show a
picture then we have a lot more
conversation so just these embodiments
of ideas is a way to just come to a
conclusion by working it through a
rather than just thinking it through and
the computers imposes mediated activity
so with the computer as i said i can
click i can type i can see but there's
not there's not a lot much more than I
can that I can do so let's talk about
performance this skilled activity so
starting with a quote by our own bill
Buxton that he says that when operated
would compare to other operated human
operator machinery such as the
automobile the computer systems we use
today make this very poor use of our
motor and sensory systems and he makes
this funny point that the average the
controls on the average user showers
probably better human engineered than
the computers where we spend so much
more time I like he says human
engineered because it's engineered for a
human so it makes that point of like the
human led design
and there isn't it there's an account
for we can forget the body's ability for
skillful performance so there's some
artifacts that we use as an extension of
ourselves so you're not acting on it
you're acting through it I bring this
example because this is a this is an
interface for DJ's that keeps with the
physical aspect of the turntables in the
mixer but you can put your digital music
through it so you're not in the screen
is off to the side but you can still
leverage that body memory that you have
from years and years in the works
instead of clicking in the innocent
screen also the Express expressiveness
of the human hand is not very explored
in these computer systems there's their
whole professions like surgeons and
sculptors and musicians that rely a lot
on their hands for the work and you know
in computer systems I like to ask the
question would you would you trust a
doctor to perform till the surgery on
you're using a mouse and a keyboard just
leave it that so that the capabilities
of a human head they're not very
explored so I cleave I can click and
type versus feel and use all the other
senses I have in my hands it's very
different and our bodies are capable of
motor motor memory it's our ability to
sense store and recall our muscular
effort or physical activity to build
skill so that's how you know how to
improvise in the piano that's how you
know how to ride your bike that's how
you know how to swim you just know how
to do those things and it seems very
obvious for us as humans to say oh I
just know how to ride a bike but you're
there's so much thereof so much memory
that's just stored in your body from
years and years of practice that can be
can be leveraged and even 25 years later
your body still has that memory within
it and these are not being explored in
the computer systems we use today one of
the most successful commercial uses
today of the effect of your motor memory
or the the control
the game controllers the fact that you
don't have to look at it and you just
know how to use it and with time you get
more practice with with where things are
and how to use it so you're leveraging
the body centric experiential cognition
any computer interfaces your reflective
reasoning it's too slow so when your for
instance there's a lot of daily
activities that require these rapid body
responses for instance when you're
playing a sport or when you're driving
your car that's probably why younger
drivers getting more accident than more
experienced drivers because they're just
more used to quickly getting out of a
situation who vs if you had a computer
interface with front of you would take
more time first you have to remember
where is that thing under the menu and
how do I get there and then you can take
your action so let's think of space we
humans we use space to think if I can
lay things out in front of me I can sort
them I can see connections that I
wouldn't be able to see if I was just
jumping through tabs when I was working
in this particular presentation I did
one of these things because I had slides
and the slides you can see one at a time
and you can't really see where things
connect and I wanted to see what are the
clusters that i have and i had to put
things out in space look at them and
then you have a lot of cements and
spatial semantics systems that you can
use to present that back I could do I
could have done I did a deck I could
have done an infographic I could have
done a timeline I could have put them in
buckets there are different ways you can
express information but as a human to
think I had to put everything out in
front of me and humans use space also to
store information the car is a good
example because I can I can actually
interact with my car without my car even
be here I can be like oh I can honk my
horn I can turn all my siblings my
signal I can turn on my wiper I can turn
up my volume I can use my clutch so I
know where everything is because when
you're driving a car you're visually
impaired and you're partially
cognitively impaired
word because your eyes are supposed to
be on the road your minds are supposed
to be on drive and so that's why the
spatial your idea of space inside a car
so important and also the tactile
feedback which we'll get to it's also
important in the car and human is a they
memorized by associating physical
locations treatments with mental
concepts so there's this technique
called the memory palace technique
you're familiar with it yeah so I wasn't
always in familiar with it but
apparently there is a there such a thing
as a memory championship and there's
this guy called Dominic O'Brien has been
a world memory champion a times and he
uses the memory palace technique to
memorize 50 some decks of cards which is
20 hundred cards after seeing them just
once so it's amazing what the human is
capable of when we start connecting
space with mind and body so the way the
memory palace technique works you have
to pick a place that you know really
well so it could be your workplace or
your home a place that you can mentally
walk through that place and you can
recognize some landmarks so I walk I so
I come home there's a door I look to the
right there's a picture and they even
say that you should think of a place and
have a way in which is your scan to play
so always from left to right and the
more pieces of this place that you can
remember you always associate one thing
you want to remember to that space so
let's say I'm trying to remember my
grocery list which is a pretty simple
example but I look at my door and I
think bacon I open my door I look to the
right if he eggs I look to my window I
think milk and then if you do that
enough times then you can build up your
memory to more of the usual seven items
that humans can remember without
associations and they monitor the
computer monitor that we use gives you
this flattened sense of space it becomes
a memory game speaking of memory of
where is that under the menu what is the
key command you don't use a software for
a while you forget it's not like riding
a bike you can just pick it
up again I haven't used flash in years I
I don't even want to pick it up again
because I can't remember where things
are and it's just it's very mind you
have to be going in the back of your
mind to remember how to where things are
there's been this a disturbing trend in
automobiles that it becomes a giant
smartphone on wheels out of a sudden you
have that you are bringing that Flint
that sense of flattened space to the car
which you're you're not supposed to be
looking you're not supposed to be
thinking where is that in the main where
do I turn up my my my temperature and
where do i do that and I know some
things are right there but you still
have to look and you have to think about
where they are which is not ideal for
the car oh definitely i'm not saying
that this is all bad because you can
still see a big map and you know it's
there you're not have to be looking down
to the little screen on your phone but
if you're trying to create an action
like enter an address and type things
and that's not ideal so there's always a
there's those a middle ground I'm not
saying that screens are bad visions bad
but i think that there's been a lot of
reliance on slowly that and not other
things other senses so visibility so
this is about how much of watching
somebody perform an activity helps
people learn about that activity so we
as humans we model other people's
activities there's been a study done on
human performance on help desk on a
particular help desk company and the
most experienced person sat next to the
novice person and it turned out that the
novice person became the second most
experienced person in a little bit of
time because he was sitting right next
to the expert guy and he could hear how
he was answering the calls he could hear
what he was saying to the the customers
and he picked that up just by listening
and watching so we humans we model other
people's behaviors as a way to learn
if we look at our graphical user
interfaces there is this invisibility of
work practice the practice of an expert
and the practice of novice it looks the
same I don't look at some amazing
designer working the computer and like
he's great you know you can't really can
tell or i can just peripheral ii watch
as a way to learn i have to you know
look look at the screen see what's going
on there so there's no mechanism to be
aware of the practice of experts because
it all looks the same and one of the
rarely considered aspects of interaction
design is in the way in which it enables
this peripheral participation it is
personal as you know as I said earlier
with the PCs it becomes really person
was not so much about this shared
experience and I can't really learn by
watching somebody there are interfaces
of course and bridge the physical into
digital such as the reactable which was
this musical table top surface than by a
university in Barcelona Spain it was
performed by Icelandic singer Bjork even
she was the first one to take this on
stage and and perform it and even and
the audience could see even more like
what she was doing because there was a
big projection camera on top of this of
this surface so in the idea of
co-located studios is also a way to a
way to be more open about critiques of
work in progress and having these
artifacts that are always there and
since people are working on the same
room you know we're seeing a lot more of
that happening here Microsoft the open
spaces putting down wall so just it
enables this participation this
peripheral participation and there's
also the great aspect of the visibility
of a creative performance even though we
know that studio recordings are way
higher quality than a live performance
people still pack concerts to go see a
band perform live because they want to
be if they want to be co-author
is of that experience they want that
back and forth they want to see being
done right in front of them versus if
you go to a electronic music concert
sometimes you see a person on a t-shirt
behind a screen and then there's the
audience becomes disengaged sometimes
and they become dubious Terry they start
asking themselves are they mixing live
or are they checking their email you
guys hear old enough to remember Milli
Vanilli I did not tell that joke at a
high state because they were just so
young right there like they're not going
to know even who Milli Vanilli was but
it was such a riot that those guys were
lip-synching and people were just so
angry at them and they lost her Grammy
was a huge deal that they weren't doing
that they live but now with the
electronic music we have and this is a
personal passion of mine is how do you
get the musician from behind the screen
and showing what they're doing and
bringing their audience in as a as
participants so tangible a we've been
touching glass a lot all the surfaces we
interact with our mostly glass in glass
you know you don't either in the glass
that we use for our devices is not even
it doesn't even have the properties of
glass that you can warm up and things
like that it's just cold glass and touch
really impacts our cognition and the
impression of the of the world around us
there's going to study done for the 2011
journal of science that they they were
testing people buying cars and they were
putting some like half the people in a
very stiff uncomfortable seat and have
people in the very comfortable seat with
nice materials and everything and they
found that the people on the stiff seats
they were holding holding off for as
little as two percent versus the people
in the comfortable seat or like that
it's fine you know it just puts them in
a different space just the fact that
they were touching those materials
versus being in a cold uncomfortable
seat affected how they were perceiving
the world around them so it's another
opportunity as we think of interfaces we
can design if everything were touching
is glass people are going to end up
being cranky after
while verses that if we can have these
different physical tactile experience
they're going to triggers people
unconscious thoughts emotions and
behaviors the car is a great example of
a tactile interface because I can feel
this just by the way the steering wheel
feels in my hand I can feel the surface
of the road I can feel the torque I can
feel I can feel all kinds of I can feel
even on my my petals I can feel the
surface of the road is rough and I can
if my ABS system kicks in i can feel the
my brakes kind of telling you to back
off there's a lot of cues that we take
in with our body that doesn't have to
necessarily be through the visual the
thing about putting a huge screen there
is that then the only way you can take
things in is through the visual and you
have you have to take advantage of your
body especially now in a driving
situation this is an example for my own
car i have the honda fit and i actually
didn't even notice until i started you
know thinking of this line of research
of the attention to detail they have on
the physicality of the buttons for
instance the button on the very end has
around it around an edge there is a
groove between each of the buttons so i
can feel as i passed my hand through it
some buttons are concave others are
comebacks I look at it once i look at it
maybe twice and then i just know how to
use it that's because I can feel it if
whether if it was all if it was all
glass then I wouldn't be I wouldn't be
having that that feel when I was
presenting this at Ohio State I asked
all the students to close their eyes and
find keys in their bags which is pretty
easy and then ask them to close their
eyes get their smartphone go to Facebook
and post I am cool they really tried for
actually quite a while just fun to watch
they're great Rainer just make the point
that there's no you don't get the
physicality they you can just do with a
look at you have to look
so we looked at five different types of
physical thinking physical activity
expert performance physical space
visibility of practice and tangibility
and we think as we've been talking about
we think humans think with our whole
body so it follows that interfaces we
create should follow this shift in
thinking so the question is how can we
improve how humans interact with
technology by embracing embodied
cognition embracing the fact that our
body helps our cognition the same way
that are our mind influences our body so
it's 11 system and we know that the more
we engage the body the more humans think
if I'm trying to memorize something by
sitting down with my my hands crossed
it's going to be way harder than if I'm
moving around if I'm thinking of in this
inner space and if we can amplify
through technology if we can have these
tools that blend body and mind and get
them to work together and seamlessly
just going to offer endless
possibilities and as designers and I
call everybody here everybody might have
a Microsoft employee in my view as a
designer we need to make technology
elevate what it is to be human and not
makes used to be that we had to learn
how to speak to the machine and now I
think the technology in the sensor the
sensor technologies to the point that we
can make technology than elevate our
essence of being human and to the to the
point about natural user interfaces
watch how people do things in the world
and then use the emerging technologies
to enable those more interactions and I
just list a few there just to give a few
example but there's so many more types
of technologies they can allow these
natural interactions and think beyond
the screen even though a lot of what we
do here is screen I want us to be
thinking what is beyond what is beyond
the screen the screen will always be
there I'm not saying screen is bad
pixels are bad heresy and that's
any of that it's great we will need
displays displays will always be there
but it are the displays that end all be
all or what is beyond the scores in what
is making a system with the screen it
works together so we are the point here
is that we're trying to engage more of
the human senses as we as you see the
way we interact with our screen is very
limited from a human perspective so how
can we engage more senses and thus help
people think communicate and express
themselves better and these emerging
technologies have the ability to reunite
mind and body you should be all about
the body we went up to our minds we
haven't really gotten down to
integrating everything again as a as a
human human is capable of so now we are
it's the post GUI area it's the saiva
cutest computing we've eliminated the
interface as we know it there's a lot of
talk about the invisible interface and
all these devices a lot of them don't
have necessarily have a screen and
that's why I went to a higher state in
2005 saying I'm starting to see some of
those and I said this is it's going to
be huge front for designers and for
people in technology because this the
graphical user interface when you came
out in 81 I believe there's a lot of
conventions that were created icons and
the desktop and folders and things like
that so what are the new conventions
that are going to come with this new set
of devices how do I know that this chair
is not sensing my my presence right now
and if it is digitally activated how do
i how do I talk to it like I come to it
is it going to light up do I poke it
wiser non on button or something so
there's just a lot of different ways you
interact with it do I say okay chair you
know there's just these new conventions
that are starting to show up this is an
interesting space for us as us all as
designers to be thinking about this is
actually stolen from bill Buxton stalk
by the way he gave this amazing talk
I think last year designing for
ubiquitous computing and he had this
slide and these are two points that he
makes on his talk is that it's it became
the baseline that the products should
work and have a great great flow at
first it would be just like it works
it's amazing i can say hello world and
he shows up over there and it's amazing
that it works then the iphone came out
and then you had these fluid experiences
and now it has to work and it has to
flow but now that you have this this
plethora of devices that are all
interconnected it's not just about
introducing a new device or a new
service it's about the whatever you
introduce reduces the complexity and
increases the value of everything else
and things work together as a system so
the good example is the phone and the
car you know the card car with ford sync
and the phone with bluetooth enabled you
can go from interacting with your phone
which is mostly visual uses the Metro
design language and use touch and you
can you can swipe and you can talk to it
and it goes from that visual interface
to when you're you go into your car the
car becomes the interface and you're no
longer looking at the screen but you can
enter the car speaking on your phone the
car picks it up and knows you're there
knows the phone has been previously
paired you put your phone away you go
drive you're still talking but you're
not interacting with the phone but
you're still going through that scenario
when you come to your destination let's
say you're still talking you park your
car you turn it off you pick up your
phone the phone is aware that the car
was turned off so it just works as a
system instead of being a phone and a
car and you have to do something for
them to work to that it was thought of
as a system that goes from one to the
next and back to back to one so my
challenge that I gave to the students
and that I give to everyone is to not be
constrained by our current interaction
conventions it is changing is it about
to change and I think it's up to us to
create the next paradigm in embracing
embodied cognition the fact that we we
don't think with just reminds we're way
more than what's what's up
our bodies are capable of a lot of
sensing and expressing so what is the
next paradigm once we start seeing body
in mind as one when we start looking at
users as humans I don't even like the
word user experience design because
users sounds really cold so user 1 user
2 and when we do is the beliefs that is
like participate one and it sounds
pretty cold and it's about the human and
what we're capable of as he as human
beings and what are our bodies are
capable of thank you i have a blog where
i blog about these interfaces that are
beyond what we're would traditionally
seen there's twitter and i wanted to i
want to open for questions I have my
references here at the end of this talk
I'm referencing a cup of the couple of
the connecting series that it's actually
done by Microsoft to the Windows Phone
people the talk by blue Buxton designing
for a victory is computing that was
given here tech fest there's this paper
that the whole bodies matter from
Stanford that came out a long to quite a
long time ago has it been referenced in
referenced and has a lot of these these
thoughts in there Jody medic who used to
work here has left also has a lot of
this miss thinking thank you any
questions
so I guess the great benefit the
touchscreen seemed to bring this that it
was totally generalized right you could
render anything you want as long as it
was visual it always change and update
and get a new feature introduced it so
how do you sort of reconcile that been
employed screen rings with the fact that
we make a physical object I mean a car
it's fine it's everything's set in stone
we're never going to need to do anything
other than temperature volume whatever
but how do you sort of like have these
more tactile experiences but maintains
our modularity that's a great question
and there's actually a lot of papers
that are questioning the tangible user
interface is saying that they're very
limited because they are tangible I
think it's a matter of creating these
systems that bridge the physical and the
digital because the digital has this
capacity of the modular you can add to
it and the physical is limited its
physical but it so they're pros and cons
to both I don't think it's the answer is
being a ball being just just digital or
going all the way to the physical it's
about finding that the middle ground
like how do you add digital capabilities
to physical objects or how do we bring
more physical aspects to our digital
experiences
I don't I don't think there's one yet I
don't know if there will be I think it's
our job to figure that out I don't know
if that would be 11 generalized one you
have thoughts would love to know this
that's the top of mind for me too
one thing that occurred to me was
mainly sedentary work because the work
product and process was
was consuming and creating something
purely
sort of wondering
our computers aren't that way more
he
you're actually calling for generalizing
the kinds of you beyond
mm-hmm
people use that they're called
information workers what they're working
with is intrinsically non-tangible
a purchase order is pretty
but the question is more yes that's true
but nonetheless how can you about that
interface and and two bodies you know
concepts that have some where
for you i am sending
yeah to your point I think it's about
finding it's not about forcing something
because I think right now we're we're
kind of forced into the screen
interaction so it's like I can I could
take a marble somewhere and drop it and
that's that's a way of in putting stuff
into the system versus clicking an icon
I think it's a matter of experience at
experimenting with what is that what is
that line and what are the things that
are some things are good for some things
other things are good for some other
things not sure if I answered your
question at all okay I thought it was an
observation
I don't know I actually don't know it
seemed like that was my guess was that
heat was like a heat map but i'm not
sure if they were measuring some other
electrical signals or anything like that
everybody gets intrigued by that picture
yeah yes I'm treating ya it was more
just to say that people don't process
things just in their minds or people say
oh I love you with my all my heart but
it's like it's really with all your body
you know sure if maybe we should change
that phrase but there's this idea that
people process thought which is their
minds and you know sometimes you think
of something gives you goose bumps or I
gives you stomach aches and you know
just that the hell you think and it
creates something physical and then
something physical creates the thoughts
that was the point of that that image
your what your Chi wow I want to work
with you that sounds very futuristic
