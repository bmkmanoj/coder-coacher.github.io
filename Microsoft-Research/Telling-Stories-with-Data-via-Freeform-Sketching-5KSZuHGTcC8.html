and more natural ways of accessing
information that help people effectively
explore and present their data so sketch
insight is a data enabled digital canvas
that allows you to create interactive
data charts through these simple
interactive sketches you draw the air
shape here and then the system
recognized the shape and replaced it
with the chart here and you could draw a
circle for a pie chart or rotated a
shape for the map now to specify the x
and y axis you start writing the field
name and then the system looks up the
data behind it and suggest the field
that contains the name so here for
x-axis and population for the y axis and
for the pie chart I'm gonna specify the
group to the ear and show the population
and again the system automatically
completes the chart for me and fold the
chart with the x and y axis the default
is the scatter plot but I could switch
to other charts by drawing say the bar
shape or the bar chart and the line
shape for the line chart and this chart
on a canvas are tightly covered so I
could filter some item by touching the
wedge of the pie chart here and it
automatically updates other parts of the
chart now I'm going to switch it to the
presentation mode to show you how to
present an more engaging story so I'm
going to draw a tiny Petri shape here
and then draw the axis that will specify
the size and the location of the chart
here the system completes the chart by
synthesizing from the exempt rikon I
provided and also look up the database
behind it and to compare the energy
consumption across different parts of
the world
I can invoke the map and again unselect
some of the parts that I'm not
interested and here now I'm showing the
energy consumption and population for
North America and Asia and Oceania so in
this demo I showed you how to support
seamless experience from in-depth data
exploration to more engaging data
presentation
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
