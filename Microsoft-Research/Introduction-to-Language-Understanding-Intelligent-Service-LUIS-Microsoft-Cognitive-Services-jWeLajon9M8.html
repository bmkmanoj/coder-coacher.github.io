introductory session to Lewis basics
my name is all Mercer or and I'm a
software engineer working at Microsoft
advanced technology labs in Cairo and
today we'll be talking about Microsoft's
language understanding intelligent
service Louis Louis is a service
provided by Microsoft cognitive services
formerly known as Project Oxford and
they are a set of intelligent services
with the vision of democratizing machine
learning so what does democratization
mean in this context exactly well in
order to explain that let's go back in
time a few years when building your own
custom machine alert models would
require assistance of data scientists
who would then spend hours days and
maybe sometimes years in order to build
and customize machine learned models for
specific domains now with the
introduction of Louis and Microsoft
cognitive services you no longer need to
be a data scientist and or in order to
create your own machine learn
Louis leverages the wealth of Microsoft
machine learning technology to enable
you to add conversational intelligence
to your application and build your own
language understanding model specific to
any domain Luz offers a set of language
understanding the tools to help you to
do that such as intent and entity
detection multi-turn dialogue support
action fulfillment and many more with
lucid friendly UI you can use those
tools to create IOT experiences virtual
assistants chat BOTS or any intelligent
service on any device and today I'll be
showing you how to create that yourself
so let's get started
by visiting WWII and signing into our
live account now let's say I have a
personal assistant on my device and I
wanted to understand travel-related
phrases such as book me a flight back to
Cairo or book me a flight to San
Francisco in the 30s and March so we'll
start by creating a new application and
we'll call it travel agent as you can
see Lu supports English Chinese French
Spanish and Italian we'll go ahead and
use English in this applique
now before we start building our
application let's explain two important
concepts in Lewis intense and entities
and intent is the intention behind
issuing a certain query or what we call
in lewis and utterance so for example in
our travel application a user might say
book me a flight to Seattle in which
case there is an intention to book a
flight one of the key problems in
human-computer interactions is the
ability of the computer to understand
what a person wants in a given utterance
and to find the pieces of information
that are relevant to their intent which
we call entities so to clarify in our
previous example book me a flight to
Seattle that missing piece of
information to our intent is the
destination of the flight which in this
case is Seattle so therefore Seattle is
our entity so before we build our
application it is advisable to think
about all the intents and entities that
we will be needing inside the
application so in this example app will
have two intense booked flight and get
weather and as for the entities will
have date time and location so we'll
start by creating the intents in our
application the list of intents
available in our application can be
found on the top left corner all
applications come with one predefined
intent none create a new intent book
flight and add an utterance book me a
flight to Seattle
you'll find that the example utterance
that we entered is now in the labeling
box and automatically labeled as a book
flight as we mentioned before one of the
arguments of this intent is the location
of our flight which in this case Seattle
so we'll go ahead and create an entity
to detect our flight locations in our
case locations can be of two types
source locations and destination
locations so instead of creating two
different entities for both of them we
exploit the fact that they have much in
common and we'll leverage a cool feature
we have Louis called hierarchical
entities hierarchical entities allow us
to add an is a relationship to our
entities so in our example we'll create
two entities called to location and from
location which are both children to the
same parent entity location now we can
label Seattle as a two location type
entity by highlighting the string that
represents our entity we'll go ahead and
submit this utterance now travelers
using our example application might be
interested about the weather forecast of
their destinations so we want our
application to be able to detect
inquiries about weather as well so we'll
create another intent and we'll call
that get weather once again we'll create
an example utterance that will be
labeled as the gate weather intent so
let's say what is the weather like in
Cairo
once again we'll go ahead and label
Cairo as location and we'll submit our
utterance now the more utterances we add
to our application the more accurate its
predictions for intent and entities
become so let's go ahead and add a few
more examples so let's say book a flight
from Paris to London and we'll label the
utterance as book flight and the
entities Paris from location and London
to location and also submit that
utterance let's go ahead and add another
audience for the get weather intent
how's the weather in London and we'll
label London as the location and the
intent as get weather
now let's add another utterance for
booking a flight the 30th of March now
since we're creating a traveling
application it's natural to have
utterances that specify the date or time
for booking flights this is also another
argument for the booked flight intent so
naturally it must be an entity so for
example book a flight to Seattle on the
30th of March we would like to label
30th of March as an entity with day time
now we could define a new entity here
and teach it to recognize dates and
times in this context but luckily for us
lewis offers a set of pre-built
entities for commonly used terms such as
date time numbers temperatures ordinals
dimensions and more so go ahead and
enable the date time rebuild entity now
rerunning this utterance will find that
louis now picks up 32 March as a date
time entity which is good and will go
ahead and pick get booked flight as the
intent for this utterance and Seattle as
the two location now periodically our
model is automatically built we can also
click on the train button down here any
time to manually rebuild it and what
building does is that loose generalizes
the examples you have labeled and
develops code to recognize intents and
entities to predict similar utterances
in the future now there is a model
present and we can investigate its
performance so now we can enter an
utterance like I want a flight to
Redmond next week now this is an
utterance that our application hasn't
seen before but with submission we'll
find that our application the text
Redmond as the two location entity and
next week as a date time and booked
flight as the intent which is good so we
can see that this is classified
correctly so we'll go ahead and submit
and these pre labels or predictions
accelerate our work so you can go ahead
and click Submit without having to
manually label every utterance ourselves
the final step we need to do is to
publish our application to prepare our
custom language model for public use via
HTTP
point so let's go ahead and test the
output of application after publishing
let's say I'm going to enter an
utterance I need to book a flight to
Paris now as you can see here this is
the JSON response with the
highest-scoring intent at the top and
the entity is detected in the audience
listed so let's go ahead and try another
example so for example let's try the
query what's the weather like in Redmond
and once again we'll find that the
highest-scoring intent is at the top and
the entity's detected are here listed
Redmond to location the nice thing about
Lois is that all this supposedly user
traffic those utterances are being
logged and all of them are available for
improving the model so let's go ahead
and see how you can do that we can
interact with the unlabeled utterances
that arrived on our HTTP endpoint via
this adjust tab we can ask Lois to
suggest other answers for us to label
that are most likely to improve the
model and we choose which model we'd
like to work with here so in this case
I'm going to choose the book flight
intent so these are the utterances that
lose things I should label first to make
maximum improvement to that intent now
this utterance is already classified
correctly so I can go ahead and submit
it now I can retrain this model and now
we have the benefit of those additional
labels let's show you another way of
making improvements in Lois consider
this utterance book me a flight to San
Diego so here Lewis picks out the word
San as the two location but not San
Diego the phrase which it should have
picked up so we could fix this and we
label it and add some utterances like it
in order to Train Lois to detect
two-word locations another thing we can
do is that we can add a phrase list
feature a phrase list feature is a
collection of words or phrases
that Louis should view as a class that
in some context can be used
interchangeably so here we'll create a
feature called city names and we'll add
Cairo Seattle
Redmond Paris San Diego
London and we'll go ahead and save that
now the model has been retrained and
rerunning this utterance shows us that
now loose picks out San Diego as the two
location which it should and that's
because we told it that these words or
phrases are features and should be used
as interchangeable so in other domains
those features could be names of
products restaurants people and so on so
we'll go ahead and submit that utterance
so that's it for our demo to summarize
we create an application defined in
tents and entities use pre-built
entities to our convenience we also
added a few items to train our
application and finally we deployed our
application to an HTTP endpoint and as
utterances came in we use them to
improve our model via the suggest tab
