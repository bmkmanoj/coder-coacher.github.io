hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
so what we've got next is a video a la
vita vain Ian obvious was not able to
make it here in person but we actually
kind of it scrambles the last minute and
I found a video production small video
production company in the bay area that
could that could film avi we filmed him
Wednesday morning got the files up here
which was a bit of a challenge because
they're pretty enormous and then we're
editing it most of yesterday the nice
thing about that is that he's the one
speaker I know how long exactly how long
it's going to take because I had a hand
in editing him down so i can tell you to
a second how long this video's going to
be actually it's not not doing this
because we have the video of Nathan
after lunch and kind of similar
situation with Nathan soavi Tavania niz
currently managing director at elevation
partners which is a private equity firm
previously he was chief software
technology officer at Apple was an
executive at Apple for a number of years
where he led the development of Mac OS
10 and iOS and he was the first graduate
student on the mock project at Carnegie
Mellon so I was going to tell us about
the evolution of mock from CMU to next
and then Apple so let us see if we can
get this to work um it's just great that
everybody's pulling together and doing
all this for you and I'm through in
short of this but we missed the
beginning of it I get lots of requests
to talk and do it that's weird all right
stress happy birthday red
congratulations um it's just great that
everybody is pulling together and doing
all this for you and I'm thrilled to be
part of this I get lots of requests to
talk and do other things publicly and or
semi publicly and I almost always say no
but this one was pretty easy to say yes
to I don't really wish I could have been
there to see you and everybody else in
person hopefully this will suffice okay
so I'm going to talk about Mach of
course
and everybody probably thinks that my
first interactions with Rick go back to
Carnegie Mellon when I arrived there to
work on the mock project that's mostly
true but we can actually back up before
that and Rick and I were let's say
kindred spirits because I did my
undergraduate degree at University of
Rochester and Rick got his PhD in
computer science from there and one of
the things that attracted me to
Rochester was that they had a bunch of
Xerox Altos and Rick was one of the guys
that did a lot of work on those you may
I'm sure he's told everybody that he
helped to write the trek game on that
and that was one of the things that
inspired me to get involved in the Altos
and write microcode and you know just
get involved and write a bunch of games
myself that led me was one of the big
reasons why I went to Carnegie Mellon
you know Carnegie Mellon had this
reputation while there's a reputation of
being very practical in its research at
least in areas i wanted to do there was
that history with Rick being at
Rochester than going to Carnegie Mellon
when I got accepted i visited had a
great time and ultimately decided to go
there so when I got to Carnegie Mellon
you know what I had to do is figure out
what to work on and the big thing at the
time that that Rick was very involved in
was the accent project and for those of
you that were there at the time accent
was this operating system it was running
on the perc computer it was a some sets
of commercial system this company was
selling it a lot of people working on
the project a very exciting project but
as a new student it frankly didn't
excite me and I can't say exactly why
but i think it related to the fact that
it was fairly mature and i want to do
something a little bit newer a little
bit different something i could leave
more of my own mark on the good news was
there was a new project that was about
to be started that I think Rick and
maybe some others are just kinda
getting starting to look at DARPA wanted
to fund some work on some high-end
computing projects related to
multiprocessing and Rick mentioned this
to me and somehow i became i think the
first person to work on the project that
became the mach project still learned a
lot and watched people with an accent
but this was something i viewed i could
kind of go off and be the sort of leader
on not leader in the sense of the person
leading the whole thing but the first
person to work on it and the first
person to really have a mark on it you
know technically speaking we wanted to
build a lot of new technology we wanted
to leverage off things that have been
learned from accent but you know we
really had what we wanted to build new
things going even beyond what accident
had done we really wanted to make sure
that what we did would be practical and
would be used by others and I think that
was may be inspired by accent being a
commercial system we wanted to we wanted
to keep that we liked that we liked the
notion that other people could use what
we were working on so our target was
again high-end multiprocessing digital
was going digital was building hardware
that would support the project they were
building this computer called the vax
784 again for those of you who are
around at that time you probably
remember that the vac 780 was a fairly
popular guess they called it a mini
computer back then maybe a little bit
bigger than a mini computer and the 784
was going to be this big thing that was
going to be 47 80s interconnected by a
shared memory system and so one of the
challenges of this project other than
getting funding which we were able to
get from DARPA was there was no hardware
for it and multiprocessing was a very
new thing so we had to start prototyping
on something else before the 784 could
show up and one of the things that
digital had built that was very exciting
to us was the micro vax this was a
workstation class machine similar to
what son was doing at the time but for
us it was important because it had the
vax instruction set so all of our work
would be useful for the 784 when we
eventually got that now one of the
things that I did was I'm pretty sure it
was the first summer after i joined
carnegie mellon was I took one of these
micro boxes with me to Maine on Sebago
Lake that's that's where I spent every
summer pretty much my life prior to that
and it was basically a summer job
Carnegie Mellon gave me a small stipend
to work on this and so here I was at
this lake in our cabin on Sebago Lake
the summer writing code first code for
the mock operating system it was very
scary because in those days having one
computer in a place like that was really
rare normally as you guys know when we
debug operating systems we have two or
three or four computers or virtual
machines or whatever we had none of that
technology that I checked one computer
so I had to make sure that whenever I
tried to boot a new OS it would boot ok
because if it didn't I would be totally
stuck for the whole summer so I was very
cautious about what I did and
incrementally improve the system we were
running bsd on the micro vax at the time
and got it basically you know running
our new kernel with the normal bsd
system the new kernel fundamentally had
threads in it so so that summer was
spent getting threads working went back
in the fall and started working on more
things brought out the virtual memory
system which was inspired by accents
although I think a new twist was that it
was made to be portable to run a
multiple machines with multiple
architectures and then we integrated in
the IPC system which was largely lifted
from accent I think I think of him some
of the code was and Rick may have been
the person to actually do that work
himself so we had you know over some
pretty short period of time built a
largely BSD compatible operating system
with lots of new guts inside the colonel
it was a thread system which was new to
bsd it was a new revamped virtual memory
system with new functionality and new
portability like you never been done
before in bsd and of course the the IPC
inter-process communication system that
had come from accent so as we were doing
this research we did like most faculty
and grad students did was we published
our work and we wrote a couple papers
and we've presented one of those papers
at a youth next conference and something
that we didn't know at the time was a
next computer had sent a bunch of their
software engineers to this conference to
just learn the next folks that were at
this conference really liked what they
heard when we presented our paper and so
they got wind of the fact that Rick and
I were going to make a trip out to
California and we were I pretty sure
going to some kind of Berkeley
conference to talk about bsd unix and
they asked us to stop by and visit with
them in their office in think it was a
palo alto at the time yes Palo Alto
before we would actually up to Berkeley
so I remember we flew in it was actually
first trip over to California we flew in
to San Francisco we went straight I
think straight from the airport or
straight from the hotel from the airport
to next on Deer Creek Road in Palo Alto
we were there to meet Steve Jobs and so
it was late in the day was in the
evening we go up we're sitting waiting
for Steve and Steve comes out and he's
all bouncy and excited and says glad you
guys are here he proceeded to take us to
dinner and we were joined at dinner by a
bunch of his senior software people and
then he dropped this important news on
us which is they had seen our
presentation they love that we were
doing and they wanted to use our work so
we were both thrilled and scared because
one of our goals was to get people to
use our work but we didn't realize it
might be used
this big away and in this visible away
so we're pretty excited about that we
went off to our Berkeley conference and
I decided it was actually time to finish
up my PhD those of you in the audience
who spent time in the grad department at
Carnegie Mellon at the time knew that a
lot of us took a long time to finish our
PhDs I think this motivation allowed me
to finish really quickly in comparison
so I finished that and then proceeded to
go get a job obviously interview that
next they had a big leg up because they
were using what we were working on what
I was working on specifically Microsoft
wanted to hire me I remember
interviewing at Microsoft seeing a bunch
of people i remember it was it was
interesting it was interesting to see
the differences between sitting down
anything with Steve Jobs and with Bill
Gates both obviously brilliant bill
wanted to know how mark actually work
and we could talk about that Steve was
much more abstract and more excited
about products in general one of the
things I detected about Microsoft was
that there were definitely some
competing factions there were people
working on pride das at the time there
was an OS to contingent I remember
meeting with Nathan Myhrvold and I can't
quite remember what he was advocating at
the time but they were definitely some
different things going on I think Dave
Cutler had joined and was working on
some of the early NT stuff you know got
got obviously recruited by the suns and
the apples but it was clear that next
was the right place to go so i went
there and and i was very pleasantly
surprised if you will that they had
already done a lot of work to integrate
mock into their product and they were
very quick to adopt those things that
were unique to mock into their product
itself so for example they were very
quick to adopt threads as a way to
manage the DSP that was on that really
next computer quick to use the IPC
system to hook in the object basis the
objective-c the object the objective-c
runtime language into an inner process
actually in a machine
in a machine situation worked really
well really quickly so lots of things
were adopted over time one of the things
that was interesting in terms of very
helpful to next about knock was we had
made mock way more portable than even
bsd was BS day was sort of portable the
mock was more portable and this was
important because you know next started
on the 68000 processor but that was
starting around a gas and we had we had
looked at we had worked on ports for the
x86 architecture in fact we've done a
whole product on that and for our own
hardware we were looking at Motorola's
evolution of the 68 k which would have
been the 88 k which i don't know if they
ever shipped it but it had inverted page
tables like other other computers which
we were able to very easily take
advantage of because of the way mock was
designed we ported the system to pa-risc
reported this on spark and it was all
very easy to do very natural as a small
company with a small engineering group
that was mostly focused on adding value
above the colonel the porting level
reporting layer made it very easy for us
to support all these all these different
types of hardware in the fall of 96 we
got wind of the fact that Apple was
looking for a new operating system and
they had been talking to be about be us
and we said oh my god why would they buy
be be doesn't even doesn't even really
work yet it's not done we've got
something that's far superior and so we
got ourselves into the bake-off if you
will for for getting our stuff acquired
and I'll never forget this day that
Steve and I in December of of 96 went to
do a demo for Apple's executive team
basically showing we could do on the
next computer fully enabled by all that
work we had done on moc we were showing
demos of multiple QuickTime movies
productivity apps scientific apps all
running together at the same time it was
it was amazing what we could do remember
this
back you know over 15 years ago almost
16 17 years ago and they were just wowed
so we won that bake-off we were acquired
by Apple in 97 I went over Stephen over
our team went over the net result of
that as we all now know was Mac OS 10
which took a long time to bring out in a
long time to be successful but it was
and part of the key there was we did
something that some of the Apple
engineers thought we couldn't do which
was make it run on alpha products now
why would they ever think we couldn't do
that there is a common misconception in
the world that the mac world back then
was simpler than the PC world which on
them we could already support pcs
because we had done that work but in
fact the macworld was more complicated
than the PC world in the PC world there
were standards like vga which could
control any video there were no such
standards in the macworld there were
multiple Mac teams that were doing their
own products and they will literally
take the good old Mac OS source code and
just beat it into submission and make it
work for their new product they would
add new features and they would all go
off in different directions and it would
be hard to support with a new product
but we pulled it off and we did a good
job and people started liking it we
started adding features like the
performance for portables like you know
great great auto configuration of
networks we added things to improve
battery performance really fast
sleep-wake which i think is still
unmatched today and so we started we
made the product so that it could really
go from laptop eventually up to servers
and for servers it was important because
we had multiprocessing it just fell in
naturally all that work we had done
earlier on multiprocessing was finally
paying off for for these server machines
so we had built the scalable system and
it worked well we're starting to do well
with our computers and we had this huge
hit called the ipod and so the ipod was
evolving over time largely with this the
simple embedded software stack in it
and as time went on we realized my god
we could do a little bit more of the
ipod use a touchscreen put a cellular
radio in it and now it's a phone and we
knew the phone market could be huge and
what we did was we pulled out all this
technology we had built before for this
tablet work and we said we can use all
this too along with some other things we
had develop in Mac OS so the big
question now was what is a software
we're going to run on this and clearly
this was going to be an ARM processor
base product it was going to have a
small memory footprint compared to our
computers and you know from my
perspective obviously we would try to
get mac OS 10 into this small device
because they got all the functionality
we would ever need for a really high
function phone but there were others in
the company who thought it was going to
be too complicated it wasn't running on
arm and there was this other thing
called Linux which we could just using
there was an evenness version siiii
Linux that could be used and very
quickly be brought up and we just take
all this other software we built on top
and running on it that didn't make a lot
of sense to me I knew is going to be
hard to do I knew is going to have
different features in different places
and different codes and be multiple
teams and so we tasked our team to just
do a bring up quickly and proof of
concept that it could be made small it
could be made fast and it could run on
arm and they did it and it worked out
great then that result now is we have OS
10 which is the desktop version of Mac
OS 10 running on moc and we have iOS
which is the mobile version of what used
to be OS 10 also running on mock and and
the underlying technologies are allowed
you this largely the same they diverged
a bit as you go up into the higher
layers of software so so what we've done
in this you know I mean it it's amazing
when you think about it we've gone from
this mock system we built back in the
start in the mid 80s with
an initial goal of running on high-end
multiprocessors we started writing the
code for micromax's took it up to the
high end multiprocessors poured it to
remember sequent multiprocessors encore
machines very high-end stuff and now
it's all the way down into your pocket
in the form of an iphone or an ipod
touch or even the ipad so we've taken
this this technology and we've scaled it
from highest you can imagine told us you
can imagine and it's just incredible
what we've been able to do so you know I
don't think we're at a billion devices
yet but we're going to be at a billion
devices pretty soon I don't know that
any of us back then in the mid-80s
assumed we'd get this technology out
there quite this much but we did I know
I was thinking and as I sitting in front
of that micro vax maybe this can someday
be in consumer devices it was hard to
imagine what a consumer device powered
by a computer would be back then but
something just told me that it could be
out there and we did it and I think
what's really cool about that is you
know I know many of you in the audience
at least from the attendee list had a
part in that the code that we wrote is
still in there amazingly some of this
been redone of course but a lot of it is
still in there and that's something that
that we can all be proud of and I think
it's really interesting when you think
about how Mauch has impacted everything
that Apple has done you know many of the
things that you guys are now doing at
Microsoft is clearly had a huge impact
on the computing world I mean we are
those of us as a group largely have
shaped our technology world today and
that's something to be proud of so with
that let me conclude once again Rick
happy birthday it's just great I wish I
could be there to share all these other
presentations and see all the people
that I've missed and haven't seen for a
very long time I was hoping that could
be there for only to meet up with
everybody I am down here in sunny
Silicon Valley it's almost always sunny
here I know many of you make it
here for business next time you're in
the area look me up again happy birthday
Rick bye bye all right i hope the
editing there wasn't too heavy-handed
you could probably tell a few of the
places where i shorten his remarks
slightly so let's say your computer has
already set up here David so let's
switch over to it let's hope the sleep
works as well as the sleep at that avi
was describing all right so David black
is a distinguished engineer at emc he's
been involved with standards work in the
ITF for many years as a graduate student
on the mug project David contributed in
a lot of different areas for example
David worked on multiprocessor support
threading and I oh and some of the work
he'll talk about now stems from those
interests okay so it's a pleasure and
pleasure and an honor to be here when
rich was organizing this talking about
what to do and he said hey you ought to
give a talk on ice skating I said okay
yeah I can do that I wrigley give one
hour tutorials and I scuzzy to an
audience of people who are moving
storage which said well no wait me
there's a couple couple things you
should understand here your audience is
not familiar stories need some
background I know by the way you have 15
minutes okay so I'm going to talk about
ice guys eternity scuzzy and we'll get
down the end of this but in case part of
the punch line here is that Rick made my
career as a systems person possible and
i'll explain that explain that down at
the end so i have a great great deal to
thank him for and this is one of the
things I'm proudest having worked on so
in order to explain why scuzzy is I need
first tell you what the problem solved
so we're going to do a real fast history
of storage storage networking abridged
this is like the show in London the
complete works of William Shakespeare
bridge which a couple of actors managed
to go through the entire like the entire
opus of whim Shakespeare's works in
about two hours in the theater including
a famous scene where they do all of the
all of the world he plays bypassed the
football back and forth so real fast in
the beginning there was rate we dunt
array of independent disks the i was
using inexpensive unreliable because
drives were unreliable at that time
so the basic idea behind raid is you do
day reliability by multiple rights are
the mirror the data you've got two
copies or you perry protected so there's
a parity check some somewhere else that
you can use to reconstruct and where the
drives fails that's great what happens
when the power fails well let's have a
look this is a mirrored system I got two
copies of data so when I do it right I
send down two copies and lo and behold I
now have two copies of green data I can
read it back I've got them fine one of
the drives fails no problem so far so
good let's try this again here we go we
do the we do the right poops I've got a
green I've got a green copy the data
I've got a splat this is bad because
weeds now pick one of those two drives
and I get green data or I get blue data
oh by the way it's not a turistic is
you've no idea how the io scheduler is
going to pick is going to pick the drive
this is usually called data corruption
in the storage industry we really really
don't like this I'm going to fix it
there's two ways to fix it you can you
soft wearing your hardware I got a bunch
of really bright computer scientist and
especially with Alfred in the room we
I'm sure we cope with half a dozen ways
to use transactions and database
technology and logging or journaling to
fix it but there are times when there is
just no substitute for sand this is one
of them the winning solution is Hardware
battery the fastest way to deal with
power failure is to make sure it can't
happen or rather control when it happens
so that you can do an orderly shutdown
and the red splat can't happen because
the power is still there oh by the way
battery gets you a write-back cache
massive win think about a database your
log your log your log force rights which
govern your transaction rate now we r
memory speeding SATA disk speed very
very very nice this is one of the
caricature insights behind storage
arrays not going to be the whole slide
this is a quick summary of the
technology they make largely discs out
of physical disks you take the whole
notion of of the business describe used
to and you virtualizes you get logical
disk images that have these availability
properties these protection properties
you add all kinds of the sense of swords
functionality to them replication
concatenation snapshots etc
and a great deal of high reliability
systems engineering resulting systems
massively scale I can almost walk into
the room with that swell one under my
arm it's a little bit big my shoulders
little at large shoulders bothering me
this large one down at the bottom is
more than ten cabinets I think it fits
on this stage but I wouldn't want to try
it because I'll probably go right right
through the floor here we've actually
put these things through raised floors
when the customers didn't believe the
floor loading specs we gave them oh by
the way it's all the batteries in the in
the bottom of those that cause all the
weight they scale up to well over 2,000
drives were into petabytes of
independent bytes of capacity hi
reliable systems a lot of your data if
you travel for example is probably
sitting on systems of this class okay so
that's a brief history storage arrays I
got to talk about networking all right
stories networks real fast on one slide
that large array down at the bottom
holds far more storage than a single
server can really use so you really want
to have mobile service talking to one
array then you think about how you want
to scale up and go you facilitate you
discover you won't have multiple arrays
oh by the way I got a little bit of here
a little bit there can i use that piece
in that piece and the same server net is
you want em to end connectivity you want
to raise that can provide storage mobile
servers you want service new circle
raise gee that sounds like a network and
sure enough it is the key to a compare
is san storage area network the initial
San technology is fiber channel in order
to run with these systems here we're
talking open systems either the various
the the various UNIX is and windows
we're using an interface called called
scuzzy small computer systems interface
the small by the way is a running joke
this is probably the most scalable IO
interface in the whole industry it's
used when things range from thumb drives
up to that massive storage array I
showed the previous slide and that
brings us to 1999 where our story
actually starts so set the wayback
machine for 1999 and I actually pulled
the contents of this slide out of amc's
archives this is a state of network
switch technology in 1999 so emc this
point is leaving the industry this is
the biggest baddest fibre channel switch
you can buy at this point in time
fibre channel is give it a second
technology we've got this Cavett sighs
director that's that's a refrigerator
sighs cabinet three two ports 1 gigabit
26 gigs of peak bandwidth redundant
power no single point of failure hot
repairman's this is an enterprise-class
heavy duty switch box you can bet your
your mission-critical iodine on it
meanwhile over in the ethernet world
cisco has been busy we've gotten through
the 6000 series we now have the catalyst
6500 nine this is becoming the dominant
network switch on data center floors
56kg ports if he's a gig of peak
bandwidth redundant power gee these
things look familiar one of that one's
bigger and faster there's one slight
problem scuzzy doesn't run over tcp/ip
that thing can do storage this one can't
how hard a problem can that be I spent
the next three years of my life
discovering just how hard a problem that
would be I scuzzy is what filled the gap
here it does scuzzy storage over TCP IP
networks we uses existing IP
infrastructure and skills like those
like those catalyst switches better
interrupted track records I scuzzy has
had a stunning interop really track
record some very very well and securing
a better an IP network to pay attention
to what you're doing so needing a little
bit about discuss about scuzzy this is a
client server interface but it's not
client-server the way you use for your
used to a fairly low power client doing
massive server discuss the other way
around it's really master slave the
client is the server running a
full-blown operating system the server
is a disk drive very very tiny thing use
this used to be done in done in front in
in in hardware the small amount of
firmware target be disk drives so
there's no admin interface very very
tight very very tight resource controls
schedule architecture contains two
layers and this is by an example of the
narrow point of the hourglass that
Saatchi was talking about this morning
at the top where the scuzzy command sets
do I owe functionality same scuzzy
command sets are used with all
transporters those two three of them
there this is where the innovation
happens thin provisioning turns up in
the command set we then have an
interface down disguisey transport the
figures out how to hold
commands and data over whatever you want
to hold over three examples of fibre
channel I scuzzy SAS the narrow
interface enables the functional
innovation to coexist with very rapid
hardware innovation fibre channel
particular seems double in speed about
every two to three years and it's only
that now a scuzzy interface between
these two layers that makes that
possible so here's what schedule looks
like as a as a protocol graph you have
the architecture easiest implementation
is over parallel study and scuzzy and
sassy Oh Ted scuzzy directly over over
cables fiber challengers have been
wanted protocol technology you have an
addition to being run scuzzy it runs
mainframe storage and it runs IP that
all runs over a common stack over fibre
channel fibers and switches I schedules
appear to this it runs a it's a third
transport runs the scuzzy Arctic
commands directly over tcp/ip a little
bit terminology this is usually called
direct attached storage because gentle
you have a cable from point A to point B
as hell is attached this is a fibre
channel sander storage area network
because there's generally switches
involved here and I scuzzy is often
referred to as IP Sam so one more there
we go so I scuzzy provides block storage
over tcp/ip it does this by mapping
scuzzy functionality to the tcp/ip
protocol it's analogous as you saw on
the previous diagram skies over fibre
channel now it's a network protocol if I
if I turn this around and drew you a six
or seven layer internet protocol stack
diagram you'd see that I scuzzy is
sitting up at layer 5 it's a peer to
http NFS ftp telnet everything else runs
over tcp I sched runs over TCP also code
coexist nicely works with existing
existing equipment this is what the
whole what what a nice cozy point during
looks like over here we have servers
with standard interface cards the ice
cuz the initiators side where server is
trying to access storage usually runs
the software stack there are
accelerators of there in Hardware there
they're a minority deployments straight
IP network anything that speaks I
p you use in here i don't recommend the
ietf april fools RFC that ran a that ran
IP / carrier pigeon however and over
here I got eyes adapters storage rays of
any size these are mix sometimes their
their software sometimes you have
hardware accelerators one wheel fast
slide and what does I scuzzy look like
on the wire you take the data you wrap
it in I scuzzy this takes this this
takes care of the scuzzy functionality
so the notion ishy ater target read and
write are captured in the eye scuzzy
layer we wrap that in TCP for reliable
data transport and delivery or this also
has dimas this is the layer which I
scuzzy coexists with other network
protocols wrap that an IP for routing
capabilities so we can get the package
through the networked where we're trying
to get them to over whatever running and
finally Ethernet is the most common
network technology which I scuzzy once
we need ethernet header and a CRC okay I
think that takes care of of the story of
what I scuzzy is now I take the rest of
the story so I schedules design and
standardize the internet Engineering
Task Force I'm one of a number of people
who designed it i'm also want people who
led the standardization in the IP
stories working group was a working
group chair the initial standard was RFC
3720 we completed this in 2003 yes from
1999 when I got started on this it took
us four years to get this done work the
details out and get the standard
completed finally published 2004 and ice
because you took off from there 2003
microsoft made absolutely positively
sure that they had a standards-compliant
implementation and windows I scotty's
initiators released 2006 of vmware esxi
egg initiator released and the market
has grown since then last year in 2011
over 3 billion dollars in storage
equipment was sold that support that
that's for it I scuzzy so this really is
a story about inventing the future it's
it's been a real fun ride so I'm going
to show you a VMware example of one of
the reasons why I scuzzy is is is
compelling growing this is a marketing
slider just had to come to ready to put
a Vemma marking slide up to
to prove to prove that it could be done
but like most marketing slides it's
incomplete this is versus machine live
migration I've got a full operating
system image application on the machine
on the left hand on left hand side and
it moves live migration to the right
hand side keeps running network except
etcetera except the pictures incomplete
like most marketing slides they left out
the storage this is the rest of the
picture there's enormous amounts of
storage and the trick to making that
work slick slickly is not to move the
storage and so shared storage name is VM
to move without moving its data most
deployments of live via migration you
shared storage precisely to avoid moving
the data I scuzzy is a common way to add
shared storage the network vm the VMware
I scuzzy initiator was one of the killer
application killer applications for 44 I
scuzzy and said the other one of course
was that that earlier windows initiator
which is what we really really got
everything started ok so I have a few
more thing to say here I'm still working
on nice cozy in the IETF the next
variation isolated specification is
approaching completion consolidate
several existing documents make some
minor updates are all backwards
compatible and coming back to the whole
point about about an arrow pointing out
of the hourglass it's remarkable how
little needs to be added because the
scuzzy interface between the command
sent and the transport is so narrow and
so stable and I'm a coffin others knew I
scuzzy RFC as my pleasure dedicate that
co-authorship to rick Ratched in
recognition of all that he did to make
my career possible so congratulations
Rick
and now I get now I get to explain what
Rick put up with make my career possible
Rick knows this story most of us you
don't do note you know me a systems
person I came into CMU as a hot as a
hotshot theoretician I mean I had I
didn't just have a batch of you through
math mathematics I had a master's me in
30 mathematics from the proudest pieces
pieces of paper I position that time was
the letter from the math department
chair at Penn which was a solid place
really good for your math program saying
you have PhD pass the qualifying exams
would you like to stay the answer's no I
want to go to computer science and
somehow working with Rick I learned in
North filesystems came in as a
theoretician came out as a heavy-duty
systems builder something that I'm just
very very grateful for worked out really
really well and one final note here in
the festschrift when it comes out you'll
see not only dedication I've also put a
document in there that is a security
protocol design document turns out while
I was working on I scuzzy head design
new authentication protocol turned out
not to be needed was picked up by fibre
channel of all things as a standard
syndication fibre channel but the design
rationale document is never published
that will now appear in the festschrift
as an archived copy of the original
design rationale for this protocol which
is called da chap diffie-hellman
challenge handshake authentication
protocol and so with that thank you very
very much and congratulations Rick all
right thanks David so let's see this I
get my cup here
keep running in glad everything to ward
off here I can alright so well mike is
connecting his laptop let me introduce
him so Mike Jones is a senior program
manager at Microsoft working in the
standards and policy team of Microsoft
server and tools business I hope I got
that right right Mike I get pulled out
of head tracks I think Mike joined
Microsoft Research in 1992 from Carnegie
Mellon where he was a graduate student
working with Rick on the accent and mock
projects and yeah just grab one of those
make sure it's on smell on we connect
this down
hello Rick so I'm going to as many of
the speakers have done sort of inner
leave some personal history with some
technology history and hopefully this
will be either amusing or useful or a
little bit of both so as David did I'm
going to talk a little bit about
technology but it's more about the
process of how you decide what to work
on and how you make an impact so I'm
working currently on a set of standards
for digital identity called open ID
connect as part of the open identity
work then I'll talk about that but first
let's talk about how we got there so I
have this long and checkered history
with Rick like I think Jonathan and some
of the other people I'd finished my
undergrad and I started thinking about
okay what do I want to do to work and I
interviewed with deck and I interviewed
with a lot of people but there was this
young research professor at CMU who
needed somebody to work on file systems
and our PC systems and I thought well
that sounds more interesting than
working on deck net and so the rest is
sort of history i worked for Rick as a
research staff member for three years
out of that came my first publication
which was joint with Rick which is the
matchmaker paper which was one of the
very early RBC papers that was my
contribution to the fest fish but one
day Rick walks into my office says have
you ever thought about going to grad
school I answered him truthfully I said
no he said well maybe you should think
about that he left I thought okay I'll
probably have a different career in a
better career which was this point if I
do that so I applied a number of places
CMU took me and I stayed and over the
next seven years I worked on a number of
research projects including the
primarily mock with rick is the
recurring advisor throughout as well as
working with al and eric cooper and a
number of other people my thesis was
about in some sense this recurring theme
that we keep hearing about which is this
narrow interface that you can use for
abstraction my particular take was if
you could extract abstract the unix
system call interface and build
implementations of it using a
lightweight toolkit then you could take
what might have been a all tricks binary
and run it on a mock system that even
though the system calls might be
slightly different you could rearrange
the file system you could rearrange a
lot of things virtualization has its
places but along the way as avi was
talking about and others we had this
multi-threaded effectively UNIX system
in her face but we didn't have libraries
for it that were used standard
interfaces that were thread safe Eric
Cooper had built the sea threads library
but it seemed like the industry was
going to build multiprocessor UNIX
systems and there needed to be standards
work done so that programs written for
those would work across them as part of
his technology transfer mission Rick
sort of sponsored me as an ambassador to
go out and work on that and you know
later on I in the process of that that
finished I graduated and
did go work for microsoft research for a
bunch of time but Rick continued to
sponsor that work so that happened in
places like the UNIX International
Working Group the open software
foundation both of which were competing
heavily with each other at the time as
well as there was the standards effort
called POSIX which developed standard
UNIX interfaces that we know of today
but they didn't have a threat interface
and I got thrown in sort of head first
to work on that it turned out it was
something that I enjoyed and something
that I was reasonably effective at it's
this interesting combination of doing
technical work where you have to be rock
solid as well as relationship work where
you have to be able to convince people
to do things and so in some sense the
nature of standards work is pretty
interesting like most things it involves
to be successful you have to solve an
important problem you have to keep it
simple or nobody will do it and you have
to build consensus that among the many
ways you could do something there's a
particular way that people can agree on
in some sense it's very much like trying
to do technology transfer as a
researcher for people to adopt it they
have to believe in what you're doing
they have to believe it's solving a
problem they actually have and it's very
highly leveraged work as David was
talking about but at the same time you
have no authority you're working with
people from many different parts of the
industry with different agendas and the
trick is finding an intersection that's
simple enough and meaningful enough that
you can all make progress together
so a little introduction of the area i'm
working in right now there's this notion
in digital identity called federation
where the idea is that you can use an
account you may have from one place at
another place that's willing to accept
it so it first really started showing up
in the corporate world where for
instance is a Microsoft employee I can
not only use my Microsoft blog in
Microsoft properties I can go to ADT and
look at my w2 and Microsoft is asserting
that I am Who I am and eligible to look
at that I can go to the company store I
can place orders with dell computer all
without creating an account at Dell or
creating a separate account i'm just
using the federated identity that
Microsoft is issuing for me but
Federation's are typically closed
systems between pre-configured parties
so the open ID idea is a lot like
Federation but in an open system where
you can take identities that you have or
control and use them at places that may
be unintuitive where they have a tight
coupling so I might be able to use
assertions that I can make about myself
or that the account issuer can make
about me in other places and one of the
other fringe benefits of this both in
terms of computer security and usability
is in you know you're all faced with
this if you're technologists you meet
people you haven't met before and they
say what do you do and you have to
decide at what level to try to explain
what you do and you know way too often
if we do it wrong you just get blank
stares and they find reasons to go talk
to somebody else but I can be at a party
and I can say well how many usernames
and passwords do you have are you
comfortable with that is it easy for you
to manage or do you consider it kind of
a problem and nearly everybody who uses
the Internet well at that point give me
a custom rant about why it's hard and
what they do to manage it way ever half
of them just use the same password
everywhere and I I can't tell you you
know colleagues at Google have
quantified for me and Microsoft as well
what the cost of account recovery is
because if your password at a low value
unscrupulous site is compromised then
you can login to live or you can log
into gmail and you can log into any
place else that the attackers may
realize that you might have used this
user name and password before so this is
one of the areas that there's it's
highly leveraged to solve this problem
any standards effort if it's going to be
successful is a collaboration among
parties that you know may be fierce
competitors in many aspects of their
business but they share a common
interest in solving the problem so in
the particular work I'm doing right now
these are some of the players that I'm
working with very closely so some of you
may have heard of open ID it hasn't
swept the world by storm but there are
places that you're using it probably
without knowing it so for instance you
can use AOL or yahoo accounts at Google
properties you don't have to log in with
your google ID you can also use a live
ID although it's using a the microsoft
proprietary protocol at this point
there's lots of other examples ranging
from sort of mid value to low value
where this work started with
authenticated blog comments i have a
blog at this URL self issued info and
you know if ed is blogging and i want to
could comment on his blog if he supports
up an ID I could use that URL to say
that I is that person I'm saying this
about what ed wrote about you know the
washington state budget process or what
have you but this at the same time
there's limitations of the existing
protocol in particular identifiers in
the first protocol are all urls where
most normal human beings don't think
that they're a URL it's it's a stretch
to get them to think that they're an
email address but at least if you ask
them what their email addresses some of
them know it the other limitation in the
current protocol is it was only designed
to work for web-based apps where you
have a browser and redirect but you know
as we know all the world is not the web
you've got devices like this you've got
devices like this that run many
applications some of which need identity
and you'd like a unified treatment of
that and so some of the work i'm
currently doing is developing with
partners a new protocol called open ID
connect that is usable on anything from
web to smart client devices keeping it
simple again it's one of the recurring
themes but it really matters microsoft
and IBM and others took a run at
identity through web services over the
last decade building on top of XML
building on top of soap and building up
this protocol stack that you know would
solve the problem but it wasn't simple
enough that a standard web developer
faced with the choice how do i do
identity says we'll all you know
implement ws-federation now they have a
library already laying around that does
username and password aware this you
know web services stuff seemed hard and
so they didn't do it so we're very much
building this work on the philosophy
keep simple things simple but if you
need the heart
stuff they should be possible but again
go back to the first principle keep the
simple stuff simple you don't you
shouldn't have to have everything to do
one thing this is sort of the structural
diagram and I'm not going to walk
through all the pieces and bore you but
the main takeaway from this is that much
like the old UNIX philosophy it's small
pieces that do one thing well that are
all bundled together so for instance
while there's a set of protocols up
there which are the open ID the identity
functionality there's also a signature
protocol an encryption representation
the public key representation the
discovery representation as well as this
authorization protocol called Roth that
some of you may be aware of all the
stuff in the bottom is happening in the
ITF which is where you know I've come
back across mr. David black as of late
going to ITF meetings around the world
the stuff above the line is happening in
the open ID foundation so I will talk
about one aspect of the underpinnings of
this work all of its based on this
notion of claims which your statements
made by one party about a subject so
earlier I was saying for instance
Microsoft might be able to assert my
employee ID or my social security number
or my named ADT authorizing them to show
me my employment record stuff my pay
stub and the like the government in
theory could assert my citizenship or
the state might be able to assert my
registered address or driver's license
status self issued assertions which is
sort of the the pun in my blog title are
actually really important where I'm
asserting things about me and you're
willing to trust those
at the level of trust that you need to
move ahead and they're all
cryptographically signed so that you as
a relying party will know who made the
statement so I'm going to rewind history
where did it first run into claims even
though the word wasn't used and I didn't
know it Butler's in the back of the room
smiling as he should be I remember being
at SOS p in asilomar and hearing this
mind-bending paper with a vocabulary
about statements being made and others
speaking for others and I thought wow
this seems really important I wonder
whether this can be made to practically
work and they talked about things like
secure boot being enabled and you know
we as a company we're still figuring out
whether this can be made to practically
work but there we are good ideas have
consequences and this is one of these
cases where this notion of authoritative
statements made by one party about
another really matters so I'll close by
giving my personal thanks to Rick as one
of the others you've had a significant
positive impact on my career including
that day you walked in and said have you
ever thought about going to grad school
and I said no so thank you for having
big visions for working for simplicity
for believing that things are possible
for leading by example and most all most
of all for investing in the people the
room here is your legacy
but thanks a lot Mike Joe you're up and
you don't have slides good so Joe brera
is a software developer at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator slack where he works
on the Lynn a coherent light source I
don't really know what that means
three-mile-long later it sounds sounds
scary Joe is a graduate student on the
mock project and then he joined MSR as
one of the very first systems
researchers at MSR
is the switching the top of it off there
you go on oh I think I got it ok so in
undergrad I was you know math major and
really interesting programming language
semantics and so forth but my good
friend brian's ill he was messing around
with unix we just had unix on a 750 a
few 750 s and i got really sort of
hooked into the whole kernel hacking
thing I just seemed lecture the Marine
Corps the particle physics of computer
science you know so I was like I was
hooked you know the elite so I heard
rumors that bsd 44 was actually not
going to be berkeley about CMU that see
me was the new center of operating
system world and you know sure enough it
was Neil saw papers you know when I went
to MIT and CMU trying figure I were to
go to grad school and I was just you
know hooked so you know I serve
envisioned again sort of the marine kind
of hardcore that you know whoever's
leading this group it's going to be a
you know complete hard-ass you know um
and so I meet Rick and he's like you
know laid-back happy optimistic nothing
ever bothers him you know you know i
would meet Dave Cutler later on
but you know Rick Rick was a puzzle you
know and so I learned a lot of things
that have been immensely I mean again
like many of other people he has
completely shaped my career in my way of
doing things one of the first lessons I
learned okay when first things I worked
on was um network shared memory now
Kylie had done this at Princeton but he
said you know marks should do this so
why don't you write up something does
network shared memory newsers based and
I was like okay what are the absolute
hardest parts of this problem well let's
see page sizes and scheduling so I'm
going to sit down for a month and just
work out the optimal scheduling policy
and how to do multiple page sizes and
you know I was making this as
complicated as possible and you know and
I accidentally wrote some code that also
worked but you know oh and then I
remember very clearly you know sitting
in Rick's office and Sandra's there and
he said well you know I did these
measurements I made these changes and
I'm like wait a moment this is my code
this is my project okay why you know and
I learned at this point you know you
need to just do it and he can't just sit
still and get poor you know analysis by
paralysis you have to do the project you
have to address the important points you
have to get it out there it took forever
for me to like actually publish this
thing so people could use it um but that
was a wake-up call and I think it was
just you know I owe both Rick and Sandro
for you know you have to get it out
there get people using it and the things
you think are important are probably not
important at all you know the second
lesson well it's not really a lesson
just more rum something I learned which
is how to take a huge impossible to
understand block of massive code and get
it to all work and in this case it was
integrating AFS and NFS in tamaak now
the previous student that was working on
it god I wish I could remember well it's
probably better if I don't remember his
name but he basically served ran away
screaming
from this project I think he changed
advisors or fields or both after this so
I you know I take this stuff and it's
sort of kind of works and I'm like how
can I do this I don't understand
anything code so it go into Rick's
office and say where's the part that
does this and he would sit down go grip
grep Emacs emacs grip grip oh it's it's
here I realized pretty much everything I
was asking Rick he didn't know either
right um but he showed me how to figure
it out and this skill of being able to
take a massive Cody don't understand um
you know I would plied over and over and
over again as I've gone to different
startups and you know you've learning
heft you know right now it's slack I'm
dealing with this huge blob of C++
written by physicists with no comments I
spent the first two months getting all
the seg faults out but you know it's
it's you have to have confidence to just
mechanically this does that this does
bath and break it down you can
understand it because as Rick says it's
just code you know the final thing is
really the you know don't be afraid to
change how it done and don't be afraid
to change the architecture I did a
weight at IBM we had this architecture
for consolidating multiple discovery
servers that discovered stuff about
computers bringing all the data into one
centralized server there was sort of
more of a reporting server and the
architecture was completely broken
because it was when you did the copy of
the data you basically could not use the
reporting server because the stuff is
being is was inconsistent during a copy
and turns out that once you had enough
nodes you spend all of your time copying
known time is the data consistent so I'm
like why don't we simply stream the data
live and people are like well that's why
we have this architecture you can't do
that log the databases will be
overloaded
and I'm like so you know he could not
sell this free powerpoint i could not
the only way to sell this is i just sat
down in my spare time and did it okay so
you know within a couple months i had a
prototype of this thing and they're like
wow and eventually got buy-in i was able
to complete the complete architecture of
our Federation within a year and in
released seven point two point one point
one we architected this thing and but
you know it was not people are like why
isn't is eight but the point is if you
want to sell an idea you have to
prototype it and to be able to prototype
it you need to be able to understand
huge amounts of code and how to
transform it and all of these skills I
owe to Rick and we're sort of time so
I'm just going to leave it like that so
thank you Rick so much all right thanks
Joe let me get this thing you said
alright so i'm actually up next and so
i'm going to introduce myself wrote a
little blurb about myself here just so I
don't forget anything so rich Draves is
a principal researcher and research
manager at MSR Redmond he joined
Microsoft in 1992 from Carnegie Mellon
where he was a graduate student on the
mock project and so I titled my talk 25
years of rick Ratched and that was
because I was thinking about and I
realized i've been working with Rick for
about that long you know depending on
how exactly how you count when we
started you know I could be anywhere
from like 24 to 26 years so really a
long time more than half my life so I
wanted to go back and and just relate
some anecdotes from those old days and
talk a little bit about you know perhaps
how you influenced me so as an undergrad
I actually studied math and didn't
really start looking at computer science
until that was a senior but I realized
pretty quickly that I wanted to switch
to computer science for graduate school
and in fact not just computer science
but I wanted to get into doing systems
research it just seemed like so much fun
to actually be building things that
really worked and so I applied to grad
schools and CMU just seemed to be a
great fit because you know faculty like
we know Rick was there and sasha was
there and eric cooper was there just a
bunch a bunch of people who are really
building things and i have this vague
recollection I may be making this up I'd
Regulus vague recollection that that
some faculty mem you fapping or like
called me to help you know convince me
to come to Carnegie Mellon I think that
may have been you Rick when I got the
Carnegie Mellon my first adviser was
actually Alfred Spector and we were
started working I started with Alfred on
the chem lab project which was this
distributed transaction processing
system that built on top of mock and
those a little bit dangerous because you
have you know one research project
trying to
use this other research project which
was still a course in the middle of
evolving and so I started working on the
lower layers of the Camelot system and
as a consequence I was interacting a lot
with the Mach guys and so I particularly
remember mostly interfacing with Mike
Young and I think that may have been
because her office were both in the
eighth floor and so he was just an easy
person to go to i also just remember avi
is being kind of this intimidating
figure you know he was like the senior
student and so it's a little bit
intimidated by the idea of going to task
obvious question but Mike was kind of
you know for a friendly teddy bear kind
of person so I would go go talk to Mike
all the time and so I was interacting
with Mike a lot and at some point you
know after a year to Mike finally
suggested that I should just switch to
working on the mock project and I felt
kind of like what Joe was describing
about the elite like I felt yes I wasn't
invited to join the elite and so and so
of course how could I turn that
invitation so I switched advisors and I
started working with Rick I didn't
realize until until many years later
actually told some after I was really
here Microsoft for some time and it
started interacting with interns and
talking two interns about you know their
graduate school experiences that finally
realized how unusual our environment was
at Carnegie Mellon you know Carnegie
Mellon the computer science department
supported all of its grad students
without regard for their research
interests or their advisors funding
situation you know you could be a
student there and just work on whatever
you wanted with you know which never
faculty member you wanted to and so you
never had to worry about funding and
that was that's pretty unusual now and
another unusual thing was about Rick
Rick in particular Rick was a very
hands-off as an advisor you know Rick's
really seemed to dislike formal meetings
I think this is probably still true of
him but I don't recall ever having any
regularly scheduled one-on-one meetings
with Rick I don't remember that we even
had like regularly scheduled project
meetings of any kind you know
we would go out for lunch that's a good
point we would I guess we'd go I guess
our project meetings if we're really
just these you know would walk over to
oakland for lunch or something but yeah
so there were no regularly scheduled
meetings with Rick but instead you know
Rick would just drop by your office and
you know you would you might sort of
look up and all of a sudden you'd
realize he was peering over your
shoulder trying to figure out what you
were doing and if you saw a lot of Rick
you know it could mean one of a couple
things it could mean that you are
working on the you know whatever a hot
topic of the moment had his attention
and that was a good thing although it
men he was bugging all the time another
possibility was it just men he was like
worried about you you know your maybe
maybe things weren't going so well and
he was worried about you and trying to
get you back on track if you weren't
seeing Rick but that could I could also
mean a couple one of two things it could
mean that you were just doing just fine
and there was no problem at all or it
could mean that you know you were doing
so badly here just written you off and
you hurt you weren't worth you know
wasting time anymore so now I have to
say my own work here as a manager now at
Microsoft Research like I don't take
this to the extreme that Rick did you
know i have to say i do have regularly
scheduled one-on-ones with people but I
do i do try to avoid the overhead of
meetings and try to have fewer meetings
and maybe other people would especially
try to avoid micromanaging people I
think it's something I learned from Rick
this idea of you know kind of getting
people started in the right direction
but then letting them run with run with
their ideas or run with their projects
is really important and so I really
tried to avoid micromanaging so another
thing that another experience that I
remember from working with Rick then was
was you know Rick's coding so you know
the course the grad students were doing
a lot of work but Rick would also code
to on the under project and what I
remember about that was a trick was
really great at you know if there was
something he was trying to convince you
know convince us all that we should do
and we recall kind of like not picking
up on it we're not doing it Rick would
just dump in and start coding hit
himself and so he was kind of fearless
in that way
and that was that was great but the
downside was that you would end up with
Rick's code in the kernel and so you
know other students here you know I
think they'll probably vouch for me that
you didn't really want Rick's code the
colonel so what we'd have to the net
result though was that you know Rick
would go in and do kind of prototype
something and it would it would work
with his office will enough for him to
check it in you know I think maybe
that's part of that Ratched reality
distortion field that we talked about
before but really you know really you
know after you saw this code you have
this in resistible urge to go in there
and rewrite it the right way and that
was important to the overall stability
of the system so you might assume to
eventually you know Rick in 1991 Rick
left Carnegie Mellon to join microsoft
research and you might assume that he
immediately turned around and started
recruiting me to join him and that's
actually not the case at all so you know
I was I was actually pretty content as a
graduate student and I could have easily
stayed at CMU much longer actually
wasn't really close to the finishing my
thesis living on this graduate students
type and didn't seem to bother me maybe
because Pittsburgh was cheaper or maybe
it was because I had this hurts
fellowship and so I had a more generous
stipend but for whatever reason I wasn't
really in a hurry to leave it was
actually on this another CMU faculty
member HD cook who I give the credit to
for getting me to Microsoft and that was
because HT the same time that Rick left
for Microsoft HT left Carnegie Mellon
for Harvard and I guess he was on a
mission to try to revitalize computer
science research there and so HT knew
that I had done my undergrad work at
Harvard and thought that I would be
sympathetic to the place and so he
really twisted my arm very hard to apply
for a junior faculty position there and
which I did but I thought well if I'm
going to apply for this job I really
have to consider some other options and
so I sent my resume off to Microsoft and
to next and you know a few other places
you know avi agon to next it and in fact
I had done a summer internship
a couple couple summers previously and
didn't really see myself as an academic
so although this Harvard opportunity was
intriguing you know I quickly narrow my
options down to Microsoft and next so in
the end although i didn't really know
too much about Microsoft and I was
actually I was kind of be honest I was a
little dubious at the time but that a
idea this company would really support
you know a research lab long term in the
end I decided to accept the Microsoft
offer and that was really you know in
the end I remember this very clearly you
know in the end my decision-making came
down to just thinking that if if Rick
decided to join Microsoft then you know
and I figured I'd always seen him make
smart decisions and so I figured if Rick
was doing it it was going to be a good
thing for me to to go to Microsoft and
so that's what I decide to do so funny
thing though happen again after after I
communicated this decision to the folks
at next I remember hanging out with my
housemates you know we had this little
rental house on Neville Street I think
near CMU kind of a dive and so one of
them answers the phone you know it's in
the evening and it turns out they hand
me the phone have this very amused
expression on their face they hand me
the phone and it turns out it was
actually steve jobs on the line and i
had never talked him before I seen him
steams seen Steven the distance and when
I was it next but I hadn't actually
talked with him and so Steve proceeded
to harangue me for a good half an hour
was not a short phone call he harangue
me about how is making this big mistake
and I really needed to reconsider enjoy
next and so I was polite to Steve but my
mind was made up he didn't really budge
me at all so let's see let me let me try
to shorten this a little bit so well
let's see let me jump to some
interesting stuff here so let's meet
script to where I'm ow it now at
Microsoft and my wife Martha joined me
at Microsoft so I've been dating this
girl Martha and she actually worked at
trans ark was one of the first employees
that worked for Alfred and you know
after like a year so I was able to
persuade her to
to leave trans r can come to Seattle and
if actually start working at Microsoft
and there was actually a period of time
where Martha and I were both reporting
to Rick and anything goes because Rick
was wearing two hats he was running
microsoft research but he was also had
took on this extra duty of running this
I TV project interactive TV project that
you know Bill referred to when he was
talking about Tiger that what I get was
part of it and and Martha was on the ITV
project and so we both reported to Rick
and so there was in fact one annual
personnel reviewer Rick reviewed both of
us and if I recall correctly you gave
Martha better marks and myself so I
thought that was I was kind of
distressing I don't know how I know
Jennifer and Christian managed to
somehow I don't know how they do it
because they've been doing it for years
but the other thing we're using thing
about these those old days those
personnel reviews that I remember from
when I was reporting to us that you were
always very brief and concise and you're
in the personnel reviews I still
remember one of those personal reviews
that consistent in its entirety your
remarks consisted of four words you are
doing fine so I went that was in the
period of time actually where I was
actually still trying to finish my
thesis so you might recall it I'd gone
to Microsoft before I finished my thesis
and immediately got sucked into working
on all these interesting projects at
Microsoft and you know was having
trouble finding time to finish my thesis
and you know in the end I didn't finish
did finish it that wasn't until nineteen
ninety-four like two years after I
started at Microsoft and I'll we'd
always have in my you know you'd have
these annual goals and now at having my
goals you know I was going to work in my
thesis and finish my thesis and then I
wouldn't actually do any of that
anything any of that and so and then in
the personnel review I would always give
myself a very low great because I hadn't
really made progress and what I thought
was the most important thing so I'll
give myself this low rating and then and
then then the Rick would set you are
doing fine and and give me a fine rating
and the funny thing was it i think these
may have been some example of reverse
psychology was that he never pushed me
to finish at all I mean it was not not
one so I recall Rick ever said gosh you
should go finish your thesis you
in the end he left it to me to define
the motivation to do it and you know
this also relates to the concept of
rationed time that we heard about before
because I remember you know Rick you
know talking about writing theses and he
would he would always make the claim
that he could write a thesis a PhD
thesis in two weeks you know you just
had to sit down and do it and what's
interesting about that was it you know
if you recall the definition of ration
time from from John's presentation if
you'd if you double the number and
switch to the next bigger unit that's
two weeks turns into four months when he
actually sat down and finally started
writing my thesis that's actually about
what it took it was about four months so
it really it really does work out so but
i don't reckon i don't recommend that
whenever i talk to students now I always
tell them you know finish your thesis
before you leave school it's much much
easier that way so I'm going to finish
up now and that will let us get to lunch
we're ten minutes behind schedule so
let's resume love lunch lunch should be
outside there should be enough food for
everybody we'll come back here at one
o'clock well the first thing we'll have
is a video from Nathan Myhrvold and
while you're at lunch this would be a
good chance for the speakers to go sign
that speaker release form because
that'll give the people who aren't able
to come here in person a chance to watch
the recording so thank you
