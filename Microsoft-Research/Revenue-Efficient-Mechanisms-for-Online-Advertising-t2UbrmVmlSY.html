you
well working to everybody and a big
welcome to reza and reza was an intern
with us and as at University of Maryland
and it's a great pleasure having talked
to so rather over to you thank you very
much mr. for introduction and thanks
everybody for attending I'm very happy
to be here again so today I'm going to
talk about your venue efficient
mechanisms for online advertising so
first I just want to quickly show the
difference between algorithms and
mechanisms for the people who might not
be very familiar with the mechanisms so
algorithms usually assume that inputs
are not intentionally manipulated so
they they can how know is they can have
missing data but they are not from an
intelligent guy who changed them
according to his benefit but mechanisms
in the other hand they assume that the
inputs are from selfish agents and the
hell benefits so they might
intentionally change the data they might
change their values that they are going
to represent the algorithm or they might
hide it so in in summary we can say that
a mechanism is an incentive aware
algorithm okay so let's see an example
suppose we have a precious item and
there are some people who wants the item
and we want to select who which well use
the item the most so here you see a
robot which excuse the value and you can
see a poor girl which just honest and
again just tell you the value that he
want that he put on the item and we have
a Scrooge McDuck so
happens is that all the people here they
give their value to the algorithm and
then algorithm finds the maximum value
and says that okay this is the winner
and we're going to give the item to the
winner and then as you can see there is
a problem here Scrooge as sees that it's
just the maximum value he changes value
to infinity so that you make sure that
he gets the bat so there is a problem
here because of the incentives of the
people involved so what we can do we can
change the algorithm to mechanism which
takes the I takes into account the the
possible incentives so what it does it
finds the maximum value is still but it
incurred a payment on the raveners and
if if you handle the payment if the
mechanism handle the payment if they're
in a nice way then it will remove the
incentive to lies so if if it is a good
mechanism then there will be no
incentive to lie because if you know if
you would lie you might be charged and
you don't want that happen so huge will
change his bid to the to his actual
value okay so this is mechanism um yeah
um opening something I don't really care
whether the bidders are lying I just
want to maximize my game from the
auction yes sure what why are you trying
to incentivize true speaking yes yes so
that is that is like another objective
for but for this example I was my aim
was to just find the maximum value but
that that is good I'm going to actually
touch that yes yes here I want to just
maximize the social welfare I'm I'm
let's say government and I find to I
want to find for example that the people
who needs a certain service like ma the
most right so this is one example what
your example is actually what I'm going
to talk a lot so what I'm going to talk
about is a is about online advertising
sure most of you know so this is a big
web page and I search hotel and there
are some ads which is shown here it's
sponsored links mom so now so the the
other the other case is for a news
website if if you see for example a BBC
website you can see banner as ever as
advertiser or you can see some videos
even as an advertisement so essentially
online advertising is happening lots of
publishers websites it's even have been
in the mobile computing and it's
actually very targeted for example if
they see that my location has changed
the Cambridge and they find that ok I
might look for hotel so they target me
too for this website for example to find
a hotel or a car or something else they
they can't see my location my previous
searches so they can for example
suggests me this this insurance and they
can give no case you can just call it
right away or they can see the history
of my application that i have installed
and suggest me some application so
advertisement has been a mobile
computing as well it's also in xbox Xbox
is also a very good example here because
an Xbox you can have multiple dimension
for example and they can target very
well for example they see that what
series that I have been watching they
know what music I have been listening
and they know what games i have been
playing they don't they even know
probably like my family or if if there
are kids like what held what kids have
been watching and they can't target very
well DD advertisement so it's a has
progress a lot and there are lots of
work that has been done in online
advertising and of course it's a very
important market so first of all
of course this is the source of revenue
for many web scientific data web-centric
publishers they like there are lots of
company who solely rely on the
advertisement venue it's also very
important for the advertisers it's a
main method for attracting new customers
and it's also can be really useful to
users to find their they looking item
very fast and the desi new product ok so
to just see you to just show you like
how important it is this is the total
revenue of in online advertising market
for each quarter as you can see for
example 4 2014 4 1 quarter these two 12
billion dollar so in 2014 there are 48
billion dollars are in this market which
makes it very important and shows how
how how so essentially the value that is
in the market shows that it's actually
putting extracting lots of value to the
to the people with advertisers and to
the publishers and then personally I
like one other impact that that online
advertising has been it's the same it
has improved innovation there are lots
of as as you might have noticed develops
at web web logs for example there are
lots that that gain revenue from this
online advertising there are like some
for example YouTube channel that like
like artists starts and put his works on
that channel and gain when you forum
online advertising or there are young
singers who just starts and just gain
when you with this online advertising so
it has it has actually like a progress
lot and help people a lot so so now
let's take a look what our make at what
our mechanism taking the role in this
online advertising market so as you see
there is a key calm
opponent in online advertising which is
the mechanism which selects and prices
the ads okay and it's a it's a very
challenging task because there are of
course selfish advertisers and users
involved so it has to be a mechanism and
it has to optimize simultaneously de
click yield or relevance to the users it
has to optimize revenue has to optimize
social welfare the sum of the benefits
of advertisers and publishers and
because we have a limited number of
slots has to be very precise on doing
this optimization and note that the
slots might be very valuable I heard
that for some special medicine search or
for some special like lawsuits this this
adds can be very very valuable and
people bid a lot for them and it's very
diverse so taking two icon d for example
i mentioned that advertising happens in
mobile computing and xbox it is very
targeted they're all like multiple
dimensions that you can take a look in
order to target the ads and so on so
forth so it's a quite challenging task
so let's take take a look at the
mechanism which selects and assigns the
the ads into in the traditional
advertising so this is one page and we
have added slot of three text ads okay
what has been usually what has been used
so far is generalized second price
mechanism which does the following it
sorts according to the bits yes and then
whoever how the largest bit will be
shown first and then the the city the
second one will be shown in the second
slot and the third one in the third
gets loud and so if if this ad gets
clicked by a user then he has to pay the
bid of the second one and then if this
ad gets clicked then he has to pay the
amount of the third ad okay so this is
generalized second price auction so
let's let's see what happens so note
that first it's not actually the bit
which is shorting the the ads it's a
rank a score but for the purpose of talk
I'm going to just consider the bit as
the as the value which for which we sort
the ads in these slots and it is without
loss of generality because if the the
ranks core function is injective then we
can do it without loss of generality so
I'm going to assume that there is no a
defect like probability of good clicked
or bad click it's just a bit that is
there and how slot effects which is the
probability of odd being clicked if it
is shown on that slab so the slot effect
of the first start is 0 point nine then
it's point eight and then it's point six
so yeah there are fixed numbers for the
purpose of there that's actually
anything is it say what if you measure
the number of clicks on the first and
the second of the third is it really do
you get stable numbers like this oh so
it's just out of the experiment for a
certain query I guess so soap for a
certain query you you check the history
and see like what is the probability of
given query yeah yeah oh but for
completing you query he's like oh yeah
you might not know that that is like one
other challenge facts are a the standard
assumption is that they are a the
standard assumption is that they are
somewhat start taking the reading
dependent on on the on the query and
this
you can mostly on specific a and B yes
they are in quite stable door not you
change the page then they change but
they are oh come on Sarah thank you yeah
so yeah so just just for the sake of
simplicity we assume that these are
quite stationary and there is no a
defect it's just if your ad is shown in
the first slot the probability of
getting leads point 9 okay because you
are not taking into account the
relevance of the actual adword the while
you sort of while basically assigning
the slots it might be the case that
somebody bids really high but they're
sort of awkward is so irrelevant do the
actual query that it never gets so
afflict but still sort of is put very
high and of course then of course this
would not happen in practice because
normally they will be click-through
rates which are not apply to the beds to
sort of get this effect but so I see
that you are working in a simple sort of
universe but wouldn't some of those
effects the click-through rate effects
sort of distort your analysis later on
yeah so I told that that what actually
happens is the rankest core and ranking
score is like a function which is which
whose parameter is the probability of
quickly can bad click off that ad and if
that function is injective then you can
get the reverse of that and then assume
that that is the bit so it's so for the
simple case of let's say we have a
defect and you can just multiply that
with the value and get the value and
then think of that that value times that
relevance as the pit so it's without
loss of generality we don't lose
anything just assuming this it just
needs a like a reverse function after
that everything is works works generally
yeah but that's
with actual observation that they are
slight sort of for a difference
because there are two pieces of secret
information in the system one is how the
search engine actually assigns the score
right and the other is what is the value
that my competitors have were bidding in
the process right and in many cases now
in the in the case where basically fit
through was not taken into account and
you were just signing sort of slots on
the basis of beds then I will only need
to know a sort of the information about
my competitors to game the system while
in other case where click-through rate
is being multiplied and you are getting
ass for ya then you would need to also
know information up from the search
engine right how the search engine is
actually what what are the internal
click-through rates that does or the
relevance rates that the search engine
has been dating for each yeah that is
that is correct but I mean usually when
people like consider this dis dis
options they assume that they don't they
do they know like what is the actual bit
so in order to be like in a Nash
equilibrium and everywhere so the usual
assumption is that they know all of this
but yes you all right it might be the
case that that that they know the bit
but they don't know the actual values in
the search engine but usually they
assume that they if they are energy
clear they know exactly what others are
doing now any other questions good so
yeah so this is generalized second price
auction and this is not affect any
question about general GSP everybody
knows okay good so let's let's see an
example suppose there are disputes 10 20
30 and 40 and then of course it's sorts
according to the to the bids and then we
can compute the GSP payment I always
went when I talk payment in this in this
lecture I mean expected payment because
that is actually what advertisers and
Bing see so here in this
is with probability point six this ad
gets clicked so and he pays 10 so it's
whitney point six times ten and we'd
probably point and this ad gets clicked
and he pays 20 so the expected payment
would be point any time strain this is
the GSP payment now I want to quickly
show that it might the incentive to lie
for the for the advertisers so consider
the same example we have this bit and we
want to see if this is the actual value
for the 40 guy then I want we want to
calculate what is the optimum bid for
him so if he bids 0 then he gets he does
not get into the ad at the slots and his
prophet and payment is 0 if it beats 12
he go about this 10 guy and he pays
point 6 times 10 which is six and then
his profit is 18 which is 14 times point
6-6 which is 18 and then if he bids 22
then he go to the second slot and his
prophet gets to 16 then if he beats the
actual 14 his profit is 9 now you can
see that there is the incentive to
decrease the value in the GSP ouch for
this 40 guys so it's just pretty high
right yes yes oh yes you know they in
fact they just add up to more than one
so this is assuming that everybody with
probability 1 clicks on ball and what
advertisement that yeah that is that is
there that is unlikely that happens but
it's just for example i wanted to show
yeah it's just small that's not the
point is booked Reza was speaking about
earlier that you can just if you had if
you do this Scott effects and actually
had another factor applied on top of all
all of them so saying take everything
and saying that the probability of
actually clicking on anything engagement
point 01 I say and
not but then it's oh let's go without
loss of technology i think scales the
reason apology that just well as it is
these already yes okay that's what i
said yeah but so the purpose is just to
show that there is actually some
incentive that might cause you to
decrease your bed in GSP now now now
that you you have the disincentives what
happens actually that the bidders goes
into the Nash equilibrium which is the
set of bits so that nobody has the
incentive to lie okay so this is the
concept of Nash equilibrium in a
nutshell and then we know that the
equilibria properties of GSP is well
studied actually there are multiple
equilibria for the GSP and these are
well studied by a dilemma and very young
so in modern advertising it's so deep
depict in the traditional advertising
they usually call it position auction
where you had some positions and you
want to assign ads but in modern
advertising you can see that it's not
that you have three slots to put the ads
you how main line via sidebar and your
heart you can you can how for example
answer is instead of ads so on so forth
so it's it's changing and I want to
argue that GSP does not work well in
modern advertising so the first season
is this problem of sight or main line
you can see that the bids are for
example advertisers who are assigned to
the sideline is not implying a
meaningful price rule on the main line
ads so it's not like the position action
which you can you can employ those rules
also it is not well defined across
templates this is actually a work done
by people here your arm is not here
Sofia and Ian and Peter and David
kurkova which shows that essentially you
cannot generalize well when you have
different templates for example to see
an example consider image and text case
where you how the ad
you can either put an image ad or some
text ads so what happens is that here
you can either put this image ad or put
these three texts at takes ads and you
can calculate like which one you prefer
then if the text ads know that they are
in this auction this trainee guy might
change his bid to 26 because it doesn't
change his payment he has to still pay
this 10 but it will incur more charge in
the people about him and then make sure
that Davion against the image ad so this
is another problem I just wanted to show
the other problem that I think it's the
most important one is that now that bids
are tailored for GSP they cannot be used
in the different services eventually we
want to unite all the bits so that we
can use all the our ad inventory across
different services for example we might
want to use them in msn in mobile and
Xbox and so on and so forth but if they
are in Taylor to attend in GSP auction
then you cannot use that it's also as I
mentioned that the Jesus because GSP has
multiple equilibria the amount of
revenue you you get is dependent on the
user strategy so you are not sure like
either you're getting good you venue or
it might decrease because it's just all
dependent on how people or how users
strategize over bidding and then so why
people usually use GSP because it gives
more revenue essentially if you use a
truthful action like vcg because usually
it gives more the venue but want what I
want to argue is this prevailing
equivalence theorem which says that if
two mechanisms are giving the same
allocation then if the if the bidders
are playing optimally they have to give
the same revenue as well so in theory
you should not get more revenue from GSP
than vcg but this is
rikki clarke blue option which is a
truthful mechanism that maximize the
total value of people who have been
assigned so it's the same as GSP but the
payment is in such a way that the best
strategy for everybody is to just tell
the true valuation I'm going to be more
precise on that but but I just want to
make the point that people use GSP
because they expect more revenue that is
correct but I want to argue that this
actually hurts small businesses because
by this revenue equivalence theorem it
says that if if people had played
optimally then they should not give more
revenue to you if you are getting more
revenue it means that people how not
optimize their bit so it means that they
they probably small businesses that are
not doing that okay so just be does not
work so we need to go to another
mechanism now I want to argue that that
has to be a truthful mechanism so the
first reason is that you can use the
same strategy everywhere you can just
tell your true valuation and it works
everywhere so it will solve the problem
of sidebar vs main line because again
you have the true evaluation and you can
just use your truthful mechanism to
assign the bits there and it's also
which is very important you can use the
add poles everywhere for any service you
have or xbox for msn for any service it
also removed the computational load from
advertisers now they are they should not
be worried about computing the optimal
bit and it makes your market very
transparent and if the market is
transpired you can better understand the
market because you know the actual
valuation so you can have meaningful
reserve price and and eventually you
might increase your revenue by having
those razor prices so now I'm going to
yes
like this lead to reduction in revenue
the short term yes it will I'm going to
show some experiments that show that it
is actually 13 Center to actually use
them it depends on the and the company I
in my opinion it should not do that but
you have some evidence that the better
understanding of the market will lead to
greater revenue in the longer term all
this data I guess a qualitative argument
yeah I i believe so but you I don't know
how to experiment that you know it's
it's a hard task but usually if you if
you are having a good social welfare
large social welfare it means that you
are going to get more revenue large
social welfare means that if you have a
transaction like if you if you showing a
web page and you are showing some ads
and and that transaction has a large
value it means that the society are
gaining more and they tend to attend to
your auction more and then in long-term
you get more event but it's it's hard to
measure really especially in long-term
right because we can generalize GSP
there's no way there's no way for us to
take just being do you know innovate or
explore new types of ads or new title
template so ever if you move to it
truthful mechanism you could so there is
another game of revenue coming from just
ability to do that that's a very good
point essentially it's not possible you
know like GSP because GSP is just for
that traditional advertising but that's
very good so so now i think i'm quite
slow so i'm going to show the outline of
my talk so first i want to show you how
we can make this transition from the GSP
mechanism to trust are truthful
Mackenzie this is joint work with your
arm Sofia Ian and peter then I'm going
to talk about okay when we trans
sent to truthful mechanism there are
still lots of problem especially in
modern setting I'm going to touch the
venue monotonicity and the venue
efficiency in this modern setting if
time lalo then i'm going to talk about
my future plans so so for the people who
are who might not be very familiar for
truthful mechanism I'm going to quickly
introduce like what is true swing
mechanism so that you don't think it's
it's a very fancy thing it's a work that
has been done word quite a lot of time
start with Vickery then Clark grew and
end up at marys and h1 so think of a
mechanism that he's assigning some items
to some bidders and then the bidder
comes and he optimize his bid and then
cupid b12 the mechanism and then the
other bidders come and they also
optimize their bit and give to the
mechanism and then mechanism selects
with that item I one is going to to the
bitter one the payment p1i to to be
there too with payment p to so and so
forth so this is the mechanism which
might not be truthful can easily be
transferred to a truthful mechanism but
just saying that okay I as a mechanism
take your true valuation and I myself
will optimize your bid you should not
worry about optimizing your bed I will
do that for you myself so you can easily
transform it to a truthful mechanism and
that's actually the idea behind like
most of truthful mechanisms and it's
known as a revelation principle so it's
just to keep in mind like what is
truthful mechanism its case that okay we
do the optimization the advertiser
should not worry about that okay you
start off by saying the advertisers
might lie if they have an incentive to
so yeah something that you know their
true values is kind of a funny starting
point so the thing is that i will
promise them to optimize for their true
value okay so if they lie it means that
I am optimizing for some other value
which is not the true valuation of that
guy and he it might hurt him no matter
if he tells the higher amount or lower
amount because I'm just optimizing for
another value then it might hurt him
suppose you have a function profit of V
then I'm optimizing that function for v
okay so if you tell lie I'm I'm
optimizing for other value it is not
your true value so it will hurt you just
trust me I'm gonna do the best thing for
you yeah I'm not for example gonna say
oh you're from google I'm never going to
display it if you love it's no no if you
do that your mechanism is not too useful
you have to have a this promise that you
like you honestly optimize if you don't
do that then it is not trust for optimal
level optimal means that okay if you fix
all the values okay and then from each
advertisers point of view this is the
best bit that you can put in the system
so that it maximizes your profit I just
think of this black box he tells me the
values any output so now yes so think of
inside ya tink of GSP make like GSP
mechanism so what happens is that ok I
get some values and then I want to
assign the adds to the slots right so
you give me the values okay I know the
values of the others and I'm going to
find the best slot for you so that you
gain the highest profit according to
that value so what would be your best
bit in the GSP so that you get the best
slot so I'm going to do that for you
like what so so this you can also think
of this way what you have been like what
you had done if it was your choice to
give a bit you will maximize according
to some algorithm right and then I just
include that algorithm in the mechanism
that makes it to some fixed mechanism
yes yes you have to assume that fixed
McCann's yeah so it's it's not fancy I
choose for mechanism so let's go back to
the transition so we have a current
inventory of bits Taylor to attend the
GSP mechanism and we want to make the
transition to a truthful mechanism and
of course we want to encourage
advertisers to change bits to the two
evaluations so we will sort the the
transition at a certain time we say that
okay at this time you're transitioning
to it useful mechanism and from now on
it's better to change your bid to the
true valuation and then when advertisers
adapted a new system then we treat her
as a truthful bidder so we optimized
hell profit that might change his
position and payment but we optimized
again at this point is important so from
this point you have to see that okay all
advertisers have incentive to change
because we're just optimizing their
profit so it means that if the
transition happens it is in their best
interest so that they come as soon as
possible and up update their bids to the
true valuation ok that's just direct
result of that the optimization we make
for their value okay so of course there
are difficulties involved at advertisers
maybe not adapt fast it might be the
case that during the transition you have
some GSP builds some true valuation that
from the advertisers who are adapted and
the second issue is that do they
actually updated true valuation do they
trust us do they know that true
valuation their own true evaluation they
might not know they might try and trial
and error and the third issue is that
how much revenue we might lose during
the transition so let's see the problem
statement so the problem statement yes
list of programs also that advertiser
may have different kind of target
functions so it may not be that they
want to optimize for profit but they
that they have some bizarre internal
optimization criterion so that they say
I'm just interested in my number of
impressions yeah that is correct so um
let's say that's a good point that Dane
they might have so interesting on that
yeah so it is possible them that you may
have to rule may be able to reformulate
their so there's a very specific any any
any profit function yeah well yeah when
you only know any profit function
optimized no no it but it just means
that they did their value is different
or under under some simple assumptions
on the profit function if it's simple
enough if it's if it's completely wacky
I know I like a hundred impressions but
I don't like 101 impressions that I'm
sure we can't find a switch but i think
under very simple assumptions on the
profit function it just means that the
true value is different yeah that's that
so essentially it's it's very good so
it's essentially like what i told in
there in the beginning as well so if you
have if you have a function which
represents your profit then you as far
as it is injective it's one to one then
you can change it in a way so that the
value which optimizes for the for the
log-linear quasi-linear profit actually
represents that profit function that you
are looking for so it just needs the
transition but I agree that like inside
the inside the our mechanism we assume
that the value is just aimed for two to
optimize the profit which is click to
rate times the value minus the payment
but it is without loss of generality so
we have a mixed set of n bidders so this
is the problem statement so we
mixed set of n bidders some of them are
adapted so they have the true valuation
in the system and some of them are GSP
bidders that the ad they are advertisers
who have not updated their bits and we
have positions in the X 1 to K with
position one having the highest click to
rate or a slot effect position I so so
this desired ed positions and then we
want to give a mechanism that assigns
the physicians to the advertisers so
note that in this mixed setting we
cannot just sort them by their bids this
is usually what happens in truthful
mechanism design that you give the
allocation and then the payments are
will be uniquely identified but this is
not the case for this the question
because we have a mixed nature of
advertisers and then note that what is
the implication of a GSP odd so if you
are a truthful bidder or adapted user
and a GSP guy is below you then know
that it is implying some payment
constraint on you right so if the GSP
guy is below you then it means that it's
implying some payment consonant okay so
this has been dis dis inspired our world
to give a payment framework which is the
following so we ask the designer to give
a function P I for each position I which
is a function of the ads that are
assigned below you so if we know that
the ad assigned to position VN is is a
truthful ad or adapted ad with value
beyond VN so now his value is equal to
his bit and then there is some GSP be it
with BP and minus 1 all the way to value
to the to the bidder who is assigned to
position I plus 1 then the designer how
to give us the function which tells the
payment of position I so what we need
from the designer is to just give us
these payment functions for example a
simple one is that okay if GSP guys
below you you have to pay at least his
his bit okay
then we know that it can also be
generalized to more than like to type of
bidders it can for example include first
prize Peters the advertisers while
contract and they pics first amount so
this payment frame of works for them so
the advertisers have to give us these
payment functions so of course it cannot
give any payment function it has to have
two properties the first property is
exact marginal increase of the payment
meaning that if the advertiser who is
assigned to position I has value V then
the marginal increase of the payment for
the next position has to be exactly V so
this is the first property exact
marginal increase and then the minimum
marginal increase oh so yeah so huh why
is it obvious that you should have that
property so if if so it's it's a little
technical but not that much so if it is
more than V then it makes incentive for
people to lie if it is more than V and
your value is something a little bit
more than me then you have to you have
incentive to paid less than V and go
below him if it is more than V if it is
less than V then you have to incentive
and go about it so it's if it's a little
technical but that's fine so its
technical other than obvious thank you
yeah that's quick I should not write is
there obvious here or I told up you so
yeah I should not say that and the
second property is that the minimum
marginal increase which says that after
you pass a truthful or adapted users
with value V the marginal increase from
now on has to be at least it cannot go
to go down to less than V okay so if the
if the payments satisfy this then we can
show that any mechanism obtained from
our framework is truthful for the
adapted bidders so they how they don't
have any incentive to light their best
interest is to tell the true valuation
and then we show that
these two mechanisms that these two
consonants are not actually limiting the
the the hand of the advertisers to
design a mechanism very much by showing
that this this framework is actually can
implement any mechanism which is
interview free or which or whose payment
is dependent only the people below you
this is disorder to torrent which are
technical I'm not going to talk but yeah
so the first the exact match are
increasingly give mean that given the
truthful bidder and if I know the price
of the truthful bidder I automatically
know the price of the guy by above it
yes that's his color increase actually
encodes the this optimization that we do
in for the bitter in order to maximize
their profit so I said yeah exactly your
exact marginal increase criterion
encodes that we are doing the
maximization or like the optimization on
behalf of the advertiser in a way for
these as this is how I understand this
criteria so the marginal increase of
payment means the price for the next
click that I can potentially buy if that
click is more costly than my value I'm
going to lose so I better not do that
yeah if my next click is cheaper than my
value I'll make at least a nonzero
additional profit so it's better for me
to increase my bid yeah so it's um it's
so it's in its interplay of to
advertisers so it means that if I am
bidding V then no one else other than me
has the incentive to go over me or below
me if he has a more value than me it's
better for him to go up if he has less
value he is better for him to go down
it's like interplay of two people if it
is not the case then if you fix your
value the other guys might change
the moment I complete emotional increase
all of the other players come come in
yeah all the other players will be will
be like put in the entire position
they're quite okay so these are the
properties of payment framework so we
especially designed a hybrid mechanism
from our plane wall which is the
following so first remember the Nash
equilibrium is an equilibrium where
nobody has incentive to change and then
suppose that advertisers has optimized
their bid flawlessly so more formally
they play a symmetric Nash equilibrium
with minimum revenue so this is the best
the best bit that they can put so we
essentially invert this dysfunction
which takes the value and put the sne
bit and put this as a payment function
and get the hybrid mechanism so if
Peters if Peters had played this minimum
symmetric Nash equilibrium in the GSP
then if you use the hybrid mechanism in
order to make the transition then you
will not see any change in the
allocation you will not see any change
in the payment and any change in the
revenue so the transition will happen
without any notice but if you just
switch to the VCG right away it doesn't
it can hal arbitrary bad given you okay
so this is a hybrid mechanism in theory
and in practice we implemented the
following mechanisms we implement in the
hybrid mechanism the GSP mechanism the
VCG with bits which vcg is the mechanism
which assigns the debates according to
their assigned the advertisers according
to bid again but instead of the the GSP
payment it computer at the truthful
payment okay
players play minimum Nash equilibrium
then we get the same revenue at GSD yeah
or if we do if we switch directly to BCG
then we get we can get arbitrary bad
ready yeah over if all the ads are being
true if we give you in you're in the
habit if all the ads are truthful you
basically running BCG no so in hybrid
mechanism so I mean that people had
played flawlessly meaning that they get
the value and they bid they're symmetric
Nash equilibria so the inbuilt is less
than their value a metric nashik of room
under the GSP yeah and right you're
saying if I took this symmetric Nash
equilibrium and now I applied it on vcg
take these bids that were optimized for
this is for GSP and apply them in BCG
then I would lose my all right that's
yang in the hybrid mechanism you then
need to define if you take all their if
you take all the players hell and the
players optimize their beds for GSP and
then you take them and you place them
within the hybrid mechanism then you'd
also need to specify which one of them
are we considered truthful or not you
can consider all of them please truthful
which means that we basically even under
the hybrid mechanism on the VCG yeah so
in hybrid mechanism t the assumption is
the following you will start with the
current bit so now nobody is adapted so
I think of all of them is GSP so the
property of the hybrid mechanism is that
it will the same as GSP as far as no one
has update as soon as the first one
updates we will think of that as a
truthful bidder and from now on you
optimize his payment and function and
then it GSP then optimized for GSP
auction and then you place them within
the hybrid mechanism all of them are
like all of the ads or non truthful yeah
then you gain you lose not yes it's the
same as GSP yes yeah so when start then
yeah okay good so we implemented these
four mechanisms and then we analyze the
new social welfare and click yield of
tea and the assumptions that advertisers
directly update to the true evaluation
or they are cautious and they do trial
and offer full trial or for their
valuation and and some other assumptions
so I especially want to show the revenue
analyzed for you because the social
welfare was essentially the same and the
Killik yield was we didn't have any
noticeable differences so in the venue
so this is the number of updates this is
the first update second update all the
way to 12 update this is the VCG if you
just play with CG and this is our
mechanism the hybrid mechanism which is
essentially saving and the yellow one is
the GSP and the green one is the
actually receive it so I think I forgot
to mention that the values are here from
the works of Peter and pin that so I
said that if the values are taking from
that symmetric Nash equilibrium they
invert of symmetric Nash equilibrium
nope nothing changed but that is too
good to be true right so we take this
more realistic values which essentially
says that if if I know the slot effects
and the distribution of the bits for
other people what would be my best bit
in the GSP and then revert that you take
the value so it's an estimate of the
value so this grey curve here shows that
vc g value after everybody have update
so the hybrid mechanism start with GSP
so note that if it is 0 then the hybrid
on the GSP is the same and then are the
first update it does that and go all the
way take it be elaborate more on this
graph right so you use that
use real data watch as the bids as they
are and some estimation of the
value-based and Peter and because work
from 12 11 and then you have your four
different mechanisms yes then what do
you play so here so it's actually ranked
as course so it's not bid anymore so we
take this like the inverse of blankets
course and then we run over like 37,000
different actions that are from the big
data actual data we run these four
mechanisms what we do we randomly
shuffle the players and say that okay
these are the order which are going to
update their bids okay in this like
37,000 different options switch from the
current bid to the estimated value yeah
directly to the estimated value and then
these are the average venue in
percentage for GSP for the VCG with
value for the for the hybrid mechanism
and for the VCG with bits just there's
no changes right it's the current
revenue and everyone stays with it that
is our benchmark which is like the
highest remain you could get with dash V
is if everyone immediately played there
as the value you estimate that they have
classes okay hybrid is everyone starts
with the current bit and then gradually
should shift one and this would you be
is the same thing but you apply the VCG
mechanism private okay good yeah thank
you it's I team now much more clear yeah
I think I have to wrap up so this is the
cautious bidders so it's essentially now
they don't directly update you dare to
evaluate they try to they do trial in a
row if they see the losing the profit
they tend to update a bit more they
don't update
true valuation they increase David so
this shows how these four mechanism do
and the conclusion of the transition
part is that the payment from work in
theory only requires payment
interpretation current is truthfulness
can implement rich class of truthful
mechanisms and yes any simulator with
the sne bid assumptions nothing change
and it encouraged videos to to adapt
then the payment from working in
practice we don't know the true
valuations certainly we don't know the
behaviors but there's the loss of five
ten percent intent to anyone's I guess
I'm not going to touch the the problems
of truth mechanism in which are settings
so i might just quickly go them a sake
of time so so i just want to quickly
mention my enthusiasm about the
microsoft so first i have background in
tech optimization problem parallel
algorithms incentive ever algorithms
machine learning and I guess Microsoft
presents in in these lots of areas like
this top software's all these areas will
lead to lots of interesting question
that I am very interested to work on for
example to just give an example it's i
want to see like a study and Xbox
pricing model you know that there are
like spectrums of model at the very left
you can see search engines which you
don't get paid by service at all and
your revenue comes from just advertising
or games model which you give away your
game for free and then hope that people
buy some premium bundles and uganda
venue by that and the other respect end
of the spectrum is the hardware model
which you can all your revenue by just
giving your service for example if
you're if you are a mobile pretty
sir and you your cost is 300 you sell
your mobile phone with 400 and you gain
100 when you so this is for to end and
we know that the Xbox pricing is
somewhere in between but i am not aware
of like any study which shows that this
is the best model for pricing xbox for
example is it has to be go nearer to the
search engine model which encourage
people to buy more and then xbox can can
improve his presence in for example
music movies and games and so on so
forth so it will improve his its
appearance in the market and can get
more revenue by by the by the second
source of revenues like advertising or
like buying in demotic in the mark so
thank you very much for listening any
questions are ya Donnie how assuming
that a user knows their value function
is reasonable i'm imagining running my
website i get some clicks and i can
maybe measure what percentage of them
lead to sales and i can measure the
prophet of that but there's a lot of
uncertainty i have about what the actual
value is and so is there any sort of
space for having uncertain values from
the advertisers in this setup so you
mean like that the advertisers do not do
know their value and then what they
should do learn my value as I'm getting
clicks right so I don't know how likely
this somebody will buy a product coming
to my page yeah i think that is exactly
what actually happens in practice that
you increase your bid and then you
monitor like how how much you're you're
safe for example has gone up and then
you see how much you're paying to be
today to the publisher website and then
you see okay is it good for you or not
but honestly I'm not sure very like I'm
not completely sure if the users can
actually
see that like what is the actual
percentage of the visitors who will lead
to the sale or something so they might
know this it's not very hard to see like
what is the percentage but from the
search engine point of view I think you
can measure like how how long the users
have been in the in the website and for
some special website you cannot you can
also measure if the transaction has
happened or no so they will send like a
JavaScript side let you know I just
started running this I've gotten five
clicks one person bought and so I could
say okay you know twenty percent of
people are going to buy but I would be
happier if I said I have some belief
about the probability that people are
going to buy which is some probability
distribution and so is there a way for
me to express my value as a probability
distribution yes so for example if you
know that that like five percent of your
visitors are buying and then you know
how much you are paying to the search
engine then you can calculate your value
right what the true percentage of people
will buy us oh oh I thought that you
know about that i'm estimating it from a
very small sample size 130 about it yeah
that uncertainty is always there so this
is the actual thing that you have to do
you have to calculate that percentage
that people will buy and then according
to that you can't calculate your idea
but I guess you can make it more precise
over the time if you have more history
but always there is uncertainty right or
you can for example target better to
make it less uncertainty for example say
okay just show my ads to people in this
city or other methods yeah but it's it's
a good question i guess there are some
studies on that that what would be like
to the optimization criteria for the
users in the literature
okay thanks very much thanks RZA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
