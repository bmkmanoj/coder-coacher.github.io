gonna start off not with the slides oh
my bad and just talk a little bit about
kind of our history with bots so we
started with promoted chats system about
three years ago and the the take on that
was we checked out these official
accounts so we're like Oh brands one
presence on messaging so we created this
presence we're a brand would go to a
website put in some strings responses
and we launched it so we had really
simple simple BOTS launched and we know
there was definitely a attraction to to
the idea and brands you'll gravitate
towards it so we launched it got some
good exposure but then usage sucked
because of us you know there was no
dialogue and about two years ago Ted our
CEO took the initiative and said we
gotta do something a little more
powerful and we created a platform first
use internally and which we launched
early April and the the idea there was
you know Ted wanted to just double down
and said that promote chats as just you
know broadcast messages to users it just
wasn't going to cut it and we needed to
kind of innovate have innovation happen
elsewhere so that's why he built the he
started the buck platform initiative and
our approach there has been um for us
particular has been entertainment box
because teenagers are a main audience
and I can't wait for the the session the
afternoon I think the reason why a lot
of developers here today and nice today
are asking like why art wise like
Microsoft here and slack and kick and
now Facebook like why are they all here
shouldn't they be like in there you know
trenches and competing against each
other the main reason i think is because
the reason we're all here we're all
looking for killer experiences and we
don't we don't want to
have the environment built with just
these broadcasting box that nobody likes
and so that's the reason I'm here and
that's the reason why I think a lot of
you are here and yeah alright so why
kick there's probably not a lot of you
unless you're thirteen to twenty three
years old that use kik but the if you
have a nephew or niece they probably do
you use kik so some of our aggregate
stats are you know we're really teenager
focus so seventy percent of our user
base is thirteen to twenty three year
olds so if you're you know if you're
bought I bought you're applying to make
is within that demographic you know
please talk to me and my partner Sergio
and we'd be happy to help you out so
what makes teenagers different than the
rest of us when they use messaging the
main thing is there they just very
chatty so 65 messages on average per day
and they spend a lot of time on their
phones we ran an internal survey with
our users and forty-two percent of them
said they want a direct conversation
with their brands and we're definitely
seeing that in our engagement and
retention numbers what's really worked
well is when a brand or a movie studio
creates a character that users can
resonate and feel like they're having a
conversation with
so just like all the other positive
reasons people talk about box this
morning same thing with the kick
ecosystem so in case anyone hasn't tried
to pulling a pot and kick it it's pretty
much the same process you know send and
receive API probably one thing that we
have like slack has is a we do have a
curated pot shop so would you what you
would do is you would create the BOK
test it and then you would submit it for
approval in the bot shop and eat for
testing internal testing there is no
approvals but you want on the bot shop
it goes through a editorial process and
will increase your discoverability by by
having it approved these are some of the
best practices we've had since building
this for about a year internally and if
a couple months externally the authentic
make it easy so we try to for for the AI
BOTS which we don't have a lot of most
of our BOTS we try to tell our
developers as the best practice to shell
buttons and suggested responses even
though it feels on it may sound like
it's ivr like but it's um it's not
because the the experience was kind of
talking to a bot and having a
pre-populated canned response it feels
conversational in the in the
context of gesture responses that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
