hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
next up we have UCLA University of
California in Los Angeles the digital
media program right yes seconds away I'm
very excited just alone but by the
meantime I have a friend Jay and so here
between hi thank you good afternoon I'm
raffica Nadal I coming from UCLA design
media arts department I am a media
artist designer and researcher and for
more than five years I am trying to
understand the relationship between the
physical and virtual spaces by using 3d
video mapping techniques mostly try to
create performances for public spaces
especially in my recent studies I have a
chance to also create some installations
that are responsive to the audience the
reason why the one of the biggest
reasons why i am here is a dream that i
saw last year around those days it was a
very that one's not working it was a
very shiny dream there is a building in
los angeles a friend curious beautiful
design for Los Angeles livonia Orchestra
and the idea was in that dream I was
just seeing very shiny and beautiful
images on that surfaces and from that
moment why not create a performance that
is literally using a data that is coming
from a 75 orchestra members and by using
16 channel now it's getting the research
part now try to get this information by
using 16 channels sound and then try to
visualize this information by using
space itself and in order to do that the
space is perfectly acoustically aligned
and engineering wise with sound
engineers and also additionally with
Gustavo Dudamel who is the musical
director of the Los answer are managed
by his collaboration his movements will
be
wrecked and it will be a kind of second
edition the idea of putting a story how
he is connecting with the filler moni
what is the hidden language between his
movements and end their responses of
course there was a couple of challenges
how to use these motions of course and
to do that I can I could use some 3d
tracking motions motions emotion talking
points and literally very cyborg moment
but instead of that why not using a
connect that is upcoming again and try
to get this nice movement but with this
great demo video and it's pretty
possible and I believe that with the
help of friends and collaborators this
information can be literally very
important for the upcoming 21st
century's performance stages and try to
understand these beautiful behaviors and
create a narrative and the space is
already perfect for tracking and
depending on the first sight research he
is already perfectly aligned in a space
and 3d scanning of the building will be
make it available to use lots of
projectors on top of the building 613
barcode 26k very high limit projectors
will be pointing through the building's
facade and also from two different point
of views which is luckily perfectly
covering the building's surface
additionally the 3d scanning techniques
at 3d scanning technique will allow me
to create much precise visuals and
coming the information from the vvv a
custom-made software will be tracking
the sound and also the motions and make
a hit with real-time performance engine
and from my previous years it was a it
was already working and and and
hopefully I would like to make it much
better with the greatest support from
the collaborators and friendsand so it's
a pretty a little bit understanding the
pipeline and I would like to show you a
very short a proposal that has a has got
a winning of the proposal for the Music
Center the project is accepted and it
will be ready to go on next next year
2014 May and 2014 September
I would like to share a small part of
video and can be closed lights that's
demoted thank you so much
yeah count higher discount
and I would like to just make a small
prototype with my friend Jay here
first very very first port type the idea
missed version 0.01 little early but I
know that you already seen lots of
beautiful examples of interacting but
yeah
thank you so much and hi there and
really curious about the last big piece
you just showed where the lines and the
movement of the body you seemed to
really work well together really for
this I'm curious as to with the
animation you've shown yeah how how
somebody how you'll get that quality of
Eurasian through the motion of a person
and whether you'd be better off actually
just simply animating you there yeah I
think this is a there's a one year
experience that is upcoming right now so
the idea is first like like a literally
creating a cinematic experience so I
will be creating mood boards so each
mood board will be exactly rehearsal the
whole stages will be there and hopefully
I from previous researchers previous
experiments I can eat with that with
that tool it's pretty possible to almost
create very realistic and almost like it
pre-rendered world of visuals it's
spread organic to connect the motions to
the to the idea of animating so it's
ready my excuse me I really like the
ambition of the project I think it's
fantastic to move out into the city and
to start to interact with on that scale
and also at that level of organization
involving so many other partners and
players and so on so what we were seeing
in the animation that's reflect on the
outside of the building is reflecting
their conductors movements on the inside
yes so people walking by are going to
see basically a kind of a silent but
beautiful visual movement across the
surface yes and maybe I forgot to
mention yeah the idea is also putting
sound outside the building so for one
night only the building's function will
be literally inverted so it sounds great
in the inside will be careful from the
outside and the moon inside the building
will be visible from
site so that particular night the street
will be closed and hopefully people will
be enjoying the performance from
different angles so they will be hearing
and seeing what is arbitrarily happening
in the inside of your link ok then I
don't have a question because I think
often with these kinds of visualization
projects when the experience is kind of
divorced from the source of data there
might be an intellectual enjoyment
understanding what's triggering it but
from a kind of experiential side it
could just be a beautiful visual
treatment but it's interesting that you
can go well beyond that and looking at
this more complex and interplay so i
wanted to get an autumn national i'm
going to request an audience comment the
bank is in the audience so I thought
it'd be great maybe for you two to say
something he does some similar you guys
yes I know sorry yeah thankfully great
project really enjoyed the presentation
I hope we get a chance to talk some a
little bit more afterwards I think I'm
so I I have a couple questions but one
is have you thought of a lot of the
visuals that you are displaying our
abstract and form which naturally lend
themselves to kind of be adopted to the
Frank Gehry building and kind of in this
kind of magical expression but have you
thought of any yeah this is kind of what
I wanted to see things that are actually
a little bit more figurative yeah and
because that's really difficult too
often adapt especially different
viewpoints you are one showing one
viewpoint so I wanted to get your
feeling for how does this multiple
viewpoint and and figurative
descriptions how do you how do you plan
to merge that yeah I think this is one
of the biggest challenges of having gave
one point of view for the for the
projecting but I think in this case the
material will be helpful because it's a
shiny and little bit glossy material and
for for my first test it was working
extremely positively
even the hot spot is coming from
different perspective that the people
who are trying to experience the visual
have been seeing not only one point of
on the image that is coming to the
projector data but it was also like a
couple of shiny moments that is not only
one trompe l'oeil a moment it may be
helpful for the up for the public space
experience and and for the organic
movements I was trying to simulate the
nature some movements that are happening
in the cloud such as using Houdini and
some procedural animations that are
pretty possible to connect with with the
FFT analysis and connect them ok story
with that thank you this is great I just
hope to get invited to the opening thank
you and just one more question from Don
who was a dud liaison to you like uh to
be put on the spot that's great uh first
of all is so exciting to go to UCLA the
work that all the students did was
amazing and this one you know is
stunning and I can't wait to see it
either so how how do you get people
excited about this vision when you're
trying to deal with the community and
pull this off in the video that I share
with you was the like perfect starting
point to to show of the idea so they
were not real time visuals but they were
just hypothetically try to highlight
that is it possible to activate this
face by data and can we do that moment
and hopefully people love the idea and
one year of researches upcoming all
right one more question it's kind of a
comment I don't know if you've been down
to the seattle art museum we have a new
giant LED panel on both sides of the
corner and it's by an artist named Doug
Aiken and all of the imagery and things
that are all triggered based on
environmental factors the traffic
walking people walking by and all kinds
of climate everything so you might take
a look at that it's gotten a huge
reception downtown thank you
alright well thank you so much that was
very inspiring thank you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
