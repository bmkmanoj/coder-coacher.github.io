thought I'd talk about box for fun
rather than box for enterprise or
utility and so you know to give a little
bit of context our team is spent you
know almost the last decade coming out
of social gaming and so our background
has been in interactive story based
games we build top games on facebook on
iOS on Android and over the source of
that we had to learn how to deliver
interactive worlds that could live for
you know three years four years five
years six with an infrastructure that
could support creatives artists
designers writers working on those
titles pushing content three times a
week right and the strength of the games
we made was entirely based on how
compelling the storylines were and how
memorable the characters were so about
nine months ago we started working on
sequel and our challenge for sequel was
how do we take everything we know which
is around building memorable stories
building compelling characters and kind
of using that for this new medium
because we do believe this is a new
medium to connect to consumers for stuff
that they care about that is what they
are already doing in messaging apps and
on messaging platforms they're talking
to their families they're talking to
their friends and there's certainly a
space there in a room there to have
perfect context about what they want and
connect them to utilities or other
things that are going to make their
lives better but but the space that we
wanted to explore was a space to connect
them to characters and two stories and
to the content that they cared about and
so to do that we built sequel and our
desire for sequel was taking the lessons
we knew from our own titles and
implementing them that into this
platform and that was to build great
creative content you have
to actually give the creatives direct
access to the content right they need to
be able to see the impact of their
creative decisions whether they're
writers or designers or artists or UX
designers or anyone else and then you'll
be able to iterate that and see what
their what the impact
their choices are that's right and then
you have to support that with analytics
and visibility I get to do that also
without obviously giving up power right
so with sequel the goal has been can we
actually keep making something that's
approachable but keep building more
power into it the ability to have
complex conversational branching the
ability to have natural language the
ability to use variables the ability to
integrate web services all without
giving up that creative visibility
because with that creative visibility we
want to support people building personas
not BOTS right like that's what we
really care about bots are not what
people want to connect with right it's
got a very techy unapproachable sort of
Silicon Valley sort of label on it my
mom does not know what a bot is like it
literally took me ages to try and convey
to her what we were trying to do it
again she was like oh so you're building
fake pee right I'm like well yes ideally
right another way to think about it is
that we really want to build artificial
personalities not artificial
intelligence right because that's what
creates do all the time right you're
trying to work within the constraints of
what you have control over to give
people an amazing experience right and
so we are focused on building these
personas that can actually connect to
people right now how do they connect to
people well with humor right you can
create beats that actually give people a
chuckle that make them laugh and you do
that with in this medium you do that
with everything you have available you
use gifts you use images use emoji you
use cadence right just even the cadence
of how you say things and the delays
that you insert create these beats and
achieving comedic timing in this medium
is just as much of an art as it would be
in standup similarly you can create
drama right so we have a particular
bought that was built where you're
interacting with a homicide detective
who's investigating a murder right and
there's moments of drama he discovers a
dead body he interviews a witness he's
giving you you know photos of her crimes
there's stuff that not only is dramatic
as it unfolds it's also dramatic as
people wait for it because again delays
are part of the experience right you
don't get everything right away people
tell you or in this case the detective
tells you that they've gone away to do
something and while they're away the
theater of the mind is working on what
is going to happen when they get back to
you the same way that it would if you
had a real friend who happened to be a
homicide detective investigating a
murder you know text messaging you crime
scene photos right not many of us have
access to that but that is a story that
can be told in this medium in a way that
can't really be told on any other and
then finally romance so I'm not saying
that we're going to build BOTS like
they're going to fall in love with but
we have built bots that tell the story
from the vantage point of someone who's
either watching a romance develop or
making choices as a romance develops and
you can have at least a chuckle right it
gives you something that you know that
really can connect to people right but
what is consistent using bots for all
these purposes is that the bots have to
have personas they have to have agency
right they have an agenda of their own
they're not just there to reflect back
to you what you put into it they're
independent entities right so and
designing that obviously takes
systematic planning and execution on a
very detailed level making it justice
complex to build a simple user
experience here as it would be in a
movie or any other media right like this
takes real work up and so I thought I
would also sort of start going through
some of the kinds of creative content
that we're seeing as both we and others
use our platform to build some of these
bots for entertainment and media one is
sort of your basic chatter bot right and
this is a bot to chat with a personality
right and it can be an inane personality
it can be an annoying personality it can
be an inspiring personality like Justin
Bieber right but the job of the chatter
bought is to reflect back to you what
you put into it right so if all the bot
types there's a lot of charm that comes
in this from unexpected responses and we
actually see users you know doing the
screenshots posting them when something
funny or unexpected or silly happens to
them but it's for me at least it's a
curio value like it gives you a sense of
moments that are fun but it doesn't
sustain interest over the long term
until the bot itself has agency as well
right where it's not just reflecting
what you're putting into it oh but is
what it has that's when you know we you
can start building narratives so
narratives are what we are terming
forward progression interactive
narratives with characters right so
you're not going to fail you're not
going to get to do over it's an ongoing
interaction with a character or series
of characters that unfolds over time and
you make choices that shape the
narrative that you may not be able to
come back from but the story of these
characters unfolds the same way that the
stories of your friends unfold if you
were to go look back on the last year of
chat history that you have with them in
your favorite messaging platform right
and that's distinct from what we're
calling games because with games we
explicitly want to model do-overs right
so games are where you can make bad
choices suffer the consequences and then
have a chance to reset and try again
right and so with games you're obviously
giving up some of the immersion that
goes with really connecting with a
character where you're like okay this is
it it's a continuous narrative but
you're able to make the choices even
more meaningful right up but actually
killing a rail bot after you know
working so hard to connect you
emotionally to them just feels really
rude vs. actually giving people the
ability
now to suffer the consequences of
choices they've made and then letting
them rewind and try again up and then
beyond that there's also not just
storytelling but also interacting with
you know generic you know media in
creative ways as well right so there's
news which there's been a lot of news
bots right argument would be that a new
spot is not inherently as interesting or
as appropriate to this medium as an
Anderson Cooper bot right because I
don't really empathize or resonate with
CNN when CNN sends me stuff but if
enderson Cooper started sending me stuff
Ivy really freaking excited right and
and I really get into it right and
similarly if Anderson Cooper starts
sending me not just his way of the world
but allowed me to interact with
entertaining content that shows that I'm
an Anderson Cooper super fan groupie
that would be pretty exciting too and
now when I can do that in a context
where I can share that with my family
and friends once we have good hooks to
share things with family and friends on
the various messaging platforms that
becomes more and more interesting and
more and more relevant right and so both
quizzes and polls are sort of content
types that are well suited to be you
know delivered in this medium and that
take you know things that people are
inherently interested in and allow them
to interact with that content and make
it you know more meaningful and relevant
in this form and then finally we're also
now experimenting with bring the same
approach to web services so this is a
experimental bought we built chef Molly
flower ball and to build it we you know
initially called it the Pawnee chef
because she's just really into puns and
it's basically a young lee api
integration young lee is a recipe search
company right and we basically are
making it really easy to integrate with
any web api and build a conversation
utilizing that web api through the same
creative interface
that we've developed for storytelling
and from media and for content right and
you're not going to go to chef Molly
when you have two minutes you know to
make dinner and you need to find a
recipe right like that's not the purpose
obviously because she's highly
inefficient and she keeps making these
highly cheesy puns as she's giving you
recipe ideas for what to have for dinner
right but when you are looking for a
moment on the subway or you're looking
to you know just think about what's for
dinner but you want any want to get some
funny ideas she'll give you a laugh as
she does something for you right and I'm
not sure that the world is necessarily
ready at scale for a punny chef but I
think that we could all think about how
to deliver mundane services with grace
with charm with humor and that's
something that I think this medium is
really well-suited for in addition to
you know potentially programming the
university nor every move before we even
know it and delivering the absolutely
appropriate thing at the right time
right so those are all the sort of
prepared remarks i had but i think i
have a few minutes for questions if
people want to have questions or have a
comment
so it's actually i mean it's its rail
like we have this homicide detective
case and it was a bot that was part of
the facebook platform launched and we
literally get at least three to five
emails a week from people who are you
know emailing our helpline reporting
crimes right there like hey there's this
lady on my block she's not very nice i
think she sells drugs right and so we
emailed her back and say this is not the
real police please dial 911 and report
it and on the one hand it's like what
like how these people not get it like
before the story starts like welcome to
a story right like this is a bond like
we've got it all up in capital letters
and you know trying to make it clear but
when people just get into it they're
just not familiar with this concept that
all of a sudden in a space that has been
populated by real conversations with
real people there could be artificial
personalities right and so you know
we're doing our best to obviously make
that clear when people first start an
experience like initially we were
earning on the side of making it super
seamless and immersive we're like hey
nothing we're going to do is going to
take people out of the presumption this
is a real personality so we've actually
now taking a step back and we before we
engage with a detective we are making it
really clear that hey this is a
simulated experience not real you can
type stop to have the book to stop the
police from talking to you at any time
right because you also who are like why
is the police station to me why are you
after me what have I done so we've tried
to make that clear but I also think that
it's a little bit of consumer
familiarity with this notion as well and
better merchandising frankly within the
messenger context to where people start
to understand you know the distinction
between real conversations and simulated
conversations
sure
kind of really interesting
don't know whether
you
we go and
r
there's two ways to think about it what
is that is actually a facsimile of
right and there I mean one of the things
I'm trying to think about it's okay what
is the relative value of a bot to do
that rather than Twitter right because
one thing I would take a step back on as
a room is and reflect on is that every
platform that's emerged over the last
sort of 10 years the killer app has
emerged because it exploited something
about that platform that was just not
possible anywhere else right just
replicating things that exist in other
ways and doing it here just isn't going
to work it is going to give us that
killer breakthrough people are like aha
I get what this is for right but one is
the simulation of the personality itself
the other is actually finding
acknowledging that it's not the real
personality but being an effective
mediator for them right I think that
what bought conversations can enable
that Twitter doesn't is at least the
fantasy that it's a one-to-one
communication right because we're
Twitter yes you might get noticed and
responded to directly when you're dming
someone but by and large everyone knows
it's a it's very much a performance
right and there's something much more
intimate about the same sets of
interactions when they're taking place
in your personal messaging inbox
relative to when they're taking place on
Twitter and so again it's early days so
who knows but our thesis is that there's
actually something distinct that you can
do in an emotional connection with
another person that through a bot that
you can't necessarily do on Twitter I
think I have time for one more talk a
little bit about you guys are built
there's sort of two platform pieces
verzino here right estate developers
rules hung seen maybe designer schools
in your demo there's variables creation
you talk a little bit about if there is
a handoff between the designer to the
developer you're actually aiming to
scale the designer yeah sure sure so the
question is there's two types of tools
that seem to be taking shape one our
developer tools are explicitly directed
to developers others are designer tools
yet in our tool we have things like
variables and if then branching and web
services how do we see it up sampling um
at least philosophically the way we've
approached it is that when you first
come on to the platform and you start
using it to or author a conversation we
need to get you up and running inside of
five minutes and get that aha moment
where you can author something
meaningful play it in the simulator and
then ideally publish it to a messaging
platform right now from that point on we
are putting in the additional modules we
need to build truly deep experiences to
enable things like complex branching etc
but it's from the perspective of hey I'm
still someone who learned how to do this
and there's a progressive you know
layering that's taking place as I'm
learning the tools I'm unfolding and
unpacking power features right and at
some point I might start talking to a
developer so that my stuff can fit in
with them right so for example in
integrating a web service we have an
anode where you can just plug it you
know call a webservice and integrate in
the various JSON that's coming back in
two variables right and if you're a tech
savvy non engineer you could probably do
it but you might be talking to an
engineer to help you do it you might
even be talking to an educator to build
that web service but ultimately once
that's done and it comes time to really
designing the experience we don't want
you to have to keep going back to that
engineer to iterate right so I think
iteration has to be engineering
independent even if there are some
dependencies
that's at least philosophically how
we're approaching it I think I'm out of
time sadly but thanks everyone I'll be
around obviously</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
