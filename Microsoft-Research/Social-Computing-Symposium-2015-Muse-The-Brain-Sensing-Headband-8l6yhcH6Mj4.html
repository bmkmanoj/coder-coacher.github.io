you
without further ado please welcome up a
hardware entrepreneur I first met her a
couple of years ago at CES and since
then she's released an awesome product
that like i said i use 4.8 times a week
a aerial gardner so my name is Arielle
garten i'm the CEO ventura and i make a
product it's the brain sensing headband
so we all you can track your sleep so
you can track your sleeps multiples
every time you sleep you can drag your
steps but until now it's been very
difficult to track what goes on in your
mind you'd go to a hospital and sit with
a whole bunch of sensors coming off of
your head in a clinical grade EG you'd
have at least a hundred wires connected
to a device in the other room and
somebody else would be looking at your
data we wanted to change all that so
this is muse the brain sensing headband
it's a sleek little brain reader with
two sensors on the forehead and two
behind the ears tracks your brain
activity in real time and sends it to
your smartphone or your tablet slim
sleek easy to wear revolution revolution
eise's being able to brain anywhere time
so I started working a research lab in
the early 2000s with dr. Steve Mann some
of you may know Steve as the inventor of
the wearable computer and at that point
we're doing things like making concerts
we're 48 people at a time could affect
the outcome of musicians synthesized
instruments by changing brain state so
you'd have teams in the audience each
one of them changing their brain state
in order to change the music that came
out we went on to do many many musical
explorations about how you make music
with your mind and what you discover in
the process of doing so we then wanted
to show that your brain could affect
physical objects this is the levitating
chair we made it in probably 2008 as you
would sit in the chair and relax it
would detect an increase in your alpha
brain state
and the chair would rise to the ceiling
thanks also to a handy dandy winch
inside that ceiling we then wanted to
demonstrate that you could change really
really really big things with your mind
that your brain could have a massive
impact on the world around you so we're
approached by the Ontario government to
do a large installation at the Vancouver
2010 Winter Olympics their visitors to
Ontario house in Vancouver can control
the lights on the Canadian Parliament
Buildings Niagara Falls at the CN tower
with their minds from across the country
over the 17 days olympics 7,000 people
got to interact in real time with these
icons on the other side of the world
literally extending parts of themselves
to reach out to downtown toronto and
show all of the participants there what
was on their mind from there we really
excited about all the things you could
build this is our thought controlled
beer tap
so we got really excited that you could
literally thought control anything in
the world we may thought-controlled
toasters thought-controlled slot car
machines and of course our famous
thought-controlled beer tap and anybody
who's in our office during our Christmas
parties more than welcome to come on
over and pour yourself a beer with your
mind so then we started to realize okay
you've got this interaction where you're
interacting with the device and the
device knows what's on your mind that's
pretty amazing the device can respond to
you then we recognize that something
more interesting could happen that if
the device knows what's on your mind it
can start to make assumptions and
guesses for you and you could be in
relationship with the device this is an
example of responsive technology that we
created it's a 3d environment where the
elements of the environment respond to
you the sounds the lights everything
around it responds to your brain state
this is our responsive room where the
elements in the physical room the
lighting of the music respond to brain
state so as you read the light skip
writer as you relax the music dims as
you fall asleep the blinds closed so
here we had a responsive loop between
the user and the technology we rich knew
something about you then represented
data which then affected your state then
informed the computational system again
about you we then recognize that if
you're in a situation where you had a
human and a computer in the loop and the
computer knew something about you the
important thing that happened was that
you could know something about you that
this technology and its highest form was
fundamentally important in helping you
understand what was going on in your own
mind and using that information to learn
about yourself to make decisions and to
change the way that you interacted in
your daily life we recognized that most
of the problems in the world don't exist
out there they exist up in here when you
look at lack of sleeps sixty eight
billion dollars a year is lost due to
lack of sleep that's a mental problem
you look at self-esteem eighty-five
percent of the world says low
self-esteem that's a mental problem abd
one in nine kids is diagnosed with a DD
they say the two billion people
worldwide suffer from brain based health
and productivity challenges
and as we learn to manage and understand
what goes on up here we can change what
goes on out here so we created an
application muse calm that helps you
understand what goes on in your mind in
a very very fundamentally simple way and
help you improve it so this is what it
looks like the metaphor that we use is
your mind is like the wind it's a
focused attention training tool that
trains your state of focused attention
so when your state of focused attention
in the sky is clear and calm just like
this and you hear just very very calm
noises and as you start to become
distracted think ruminate when your mind
goes elsewhere the sky becomes cloudy
and the winds pick up so use the device
to get simple real-time feedback on your
brain state to know when you're in a
state of focused attention and when your
mind is wandering and as you build
States a focused attention to really
important things happen one you learn to
focus better you learn to avoid all the
distractions and your environments the
lights the sounds the stuff that's out
there and to you learn to avoid your
internal distractions you can give
thoughts or negative feelings
ruminations the stuff that comes up
inside that can cause us to go down
those negative spirals whereas before we
may not have a mechanism as to how to
take your brain off there here you learn
that you don't need to follow those
whimsies of thought that you can put
your brain on what's important to you
and manage your internal state more
effectively so we now have tens of
thousands of people musing across the
world uses actually available in canada
in best buy there is a clinical grade
EEG and best buy today on the u.s. you
can buy it on amazon com we're now
moving into an international
distribution and we have people really
making fundamental change in their life
from simple things like improving their
attention and their productivity at work
to improving their sleep to improving
their a TD in their anxiety to just
understanding when they're focused and
when they're not I heard a really lovely
story the other day from a woman who is
in the park with her kid and after using
news for a little while she recognized
that although she was in the park with
her kid most of the time her mind was
just wondering she was thinking about
her grocery list she was thinking about
what she was going to do tomorrow
and she wasn't focused on the kid that
was in front of her so as you start to
notice these subtle interactions in your
mind when you're on task and when you're
off you can make some pretty major
shifts in your life so we have over 50
research labs currently using Muse Mayo
Clinic's doing a study with it on cancer
care patients using it to decrease
stress harvard's doing a study on sleep
and anxiety baycrest in canada is
looking at blood pressure effect and
cognitive processes there is 47 others
there's also an open st case there are
lots of institutions making games with
it lots of potential for I'm gaming with
kids with ADHD that's a really common
use case but I'm actually here to talk
to you about the consequences of this
technology this is the point where we're
going to shut down the camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
