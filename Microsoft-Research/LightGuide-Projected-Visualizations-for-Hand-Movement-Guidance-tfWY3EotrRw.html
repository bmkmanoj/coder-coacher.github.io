movements that require a specific form
of technique such as an exercise or
playing an instrument we use resources
such as visual diagrams or
do-it-yourself videos to communicate
concepts like posture movement and speed
of motion
however without incremental and
real-time feedback such as those we
receive from an instructor interpreting
and following a set of movements can be
a challenge in this video we introduce
light guide a system that explores a new
approach to gesture guidance where we
project visual hints in the form of
digital light directly on a user's body
our novel interaction techniques are
focused on guiding a user's hand freely
in midair the visual hints are designed
to incorporate both feedback and
feed-forward cues to help guide users
through a range of movements the cues
provide users with co-located
instruction for the movement along with
the body part that is moving on the
desired path to showcase the
capabilities of our system we developed
a series of visual hints here we show
the follow spot visual hint as the user
follows the white circle the 1d arrow
provides depth feedback to the user
which points away from the user to
signal moving up and points the arrow
towards the user to signal moving down
the size of the arrow dictates the
distance to the target depth position
here we show the hue cue which utilizes
negative and positive spatial coloring
to indicate direction in the horizontal
XY plane the feed-forward component is
conveyed in the positive coloring shown
in blue and negative coloring for
feedback shown in red the user relies on
the same 1d arrow for depth feedback in
the middle of the hand here we show a 3d
pathway where users are given a small
segment of what's next in the movement
ahead the 3d path lip denotes
feed-forward by showing users to path
ahead and blue while the red dot
provides users with feedback to the
relative position projected on the
movement path here we show a simple 3d
arrow which specifies a direct mapping
to visualize direction the 3d arrow
allows users to see direction for all
three XY and z dimensions in a single
metaphor our proof of concept
implementation consists of a single
depth camera and projector to display
the visual hint the prototype first
identifies the user's arm by determining
continuous regions along the depth image
we use a distance transform on the depth
image to find Maximus associated with
the center of the
and armed to extract the hand the system
traces along the continuous regions of
the depth image and assumes a constant
hand likes from the extent of the arm
the associated Maxima from distance
transform is assumed to be the center
position of the hand our system allows
us to use pre-recorded or system
generated 3d paths and can replay a
visual hint so that it follows a
movement automatically in space at any
speed
in addition users can also use a
self-guided approach where the system
relies on the user to direct themselves
through the movement to evaluate the
performance of our visual hints we
conducted a user study in which
participants tried her hints on a
variety of paths such as a diagonal line
back and forth a square
Circle
and
aniline plus a curve to ensure that we
adequately tested a variety of depth
levels we vary the paths at zero 45 and
90 degrees similarly to the circle shown
here we compared our visual hints to an
animated video comprised of a 3d model
of a hand that follows ideal system
generated path importantly the animated
video allowed us to control the speed
and timing the replay movements our
results suggest that participants can
perform movements more accurately in
both scale and shape nearly 85% more
accurately than when guided by video
alone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
