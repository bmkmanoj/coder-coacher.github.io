good morning good morning welcome to
marketing bench and thank you for being
here and we're gonna have a really fun
day today I think because I planned it
but I actually think it will be one so I
hope that you think those do and you're
going to learn some stuff and meet some
people so these are I am Laura Lando and
I run the marketing bench program so
you've seen emails from me sometimes I
remember to put them out under marketing
bench sometimes I don't so that's why
sometimes you see them from me I was
still learning the email system kind of
thing so you all are part of Microsoft
leader bench and that is how you have
been qualified for marketing bench
marketing is currently the only
profession that has an additional bench
experience that layers on top of the
leader bench experience some of yours
finance has it and this year they do not
so this is special so don't rub it into
your other you know bench people that
you know but it really is a compliment
to your leader bench experience the
leader bench experience is your primary
way to build your leadership skills
build your company wide network we're
marketing we think there's a couple of
unique things um to do anything in
marketing it's a super collaborative as
you know isn't even a never been able to
do anything in marketing by yourself no
I haven't and also it's very distributed
so you're going to have people all over
the company so and it's important to
have that network that's very broad so
that's one of the reasons we put this
marketing bench layer on top of the
leader bench so you did you all go to
spam super weakness fall yeah yeah good
okay the goal with two primary goals for
today we're going to you need some
career resources to help you think about
your career and marketing help you think
about how to present yourself how best
to get out of that your career here at
Microsoft em and then networking and
this is I will be a broken record on
this
but networking is a big big piece of
today and so I've asked you to sit with
people you don't know so you can get to
know them and I would recommend and
throughout the day you try and have
those interactions as well and this is
one of the things that people say when
they come out of the marketing bench
either this course this day or the
caliga marketing they said wow I built
such a great network that's awesome i
know people and all these groups now and
it just helps me i'm with my career
we're going to start with networking
yeah the other thing I wanted to tell
you about networking is last year they
did a study of our general manager our
marketing general manager population and
look at what made them successful versus
what when people were not successful
what inhibitors were and network popped
on both those lists having a strong
network was a success critical success
factor and it also was when they found
that people failed it's because they
didn't create that network so that's why
we are pounding with there's two main
kinds of networks you think about your
LinkedIn how many people have a hundred
connections on LinkedIn 200 300 400 500
lots right um I really look at those is
more of your community you probably am I
sure amazing don't have a personal
relationship with all 500 or 400 of
those people but they are people you can
reach out to and that's awful also
through office talk or if you're using
the internal tools and had to give a
plug for all this time but what we want
to do today is really build your power
network your power network is someone
that you can pick up the phone they're
going to actually answer it or they're
going to answer your email right away
just reach out to them it could be a
mentor is also party apparel network
managers people used to work with all of
those people are it's a deeper network
and more than just an acquaintance so
your goal today wait you think your goal
is today how many people should
me today war I want you to meet
everybody that's a great to the
overachiever over here in the corner um
but I want you to just really make sure
you walk away with four people that you
feel like yeah I really got to know this
person I know something about them and I
have a connection and I would recommend
in your packet there is a list of the
people who are registered most people
are here we've got a few that would be
stragglers but I would encourage you to
take notes on that you know if you see
people with a certain job role or group
that you want to get to know Mark them
on there and look for them find them and
introduce yourself so now that the goal
is clear I will be asking you at the end
of the day if you accomplish this goal
so it is a SMART goal we all are very
familiar with us so to facilitate this
we're going to spend some time at going
around we're going to introduce
ourselves and I'm going to be very
specific about how I want this done this
is to make it easy for everyone I have a
challenge that I often will mumble my
name because I say it often and people
will say Orlando I'll say I'm Laurel and
oh you'll see Orlando like I have one
name like Madonna but so so what we're
going to do is I will start and we're
going to go around the room you're going
to stand up and you're going to hold
your card in front of you so people can
visually see it as well as hear it and
say these things so you may be wondering
about random and sometimes they say I
want to hear an embarrassing thing or
the funniest thing or whatever it can be
anything anything random that that you
want to say so it can be anything okay
