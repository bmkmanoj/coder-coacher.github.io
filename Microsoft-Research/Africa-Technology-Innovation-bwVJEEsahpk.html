we're gonna have mark Tyga who flew in
all the way from Kenya and he arrived on
time in time this morning and mark and I
actually met at one who had a conference
up in the Scandinavian and Sweden and it
was amazing because we were both on the
same panel and it was just African China
so I was like are we on the people of
color panel like did the sweets just do
this to us and I think I think they did
but I think we expanded their minds and
showed them what people color do around
the world ah but the really exciting
thing by remember what marks panel was
about was that he made a really good
point about African I'm user habits with
mobile browsers was that one of the
mobile phones that eighty percent right
of them are using mobile browsers apps
that are built in mobile browsers so not
using native built apps and I think
that's introduces a really interesting
conversation for the kind of things that
we program so that was a really
intriguing and interesting insight so I
thought it'd be great to have mark
actually coming because he works with I
hub and he works he's actually one of
the people who popularized azhar
evangelizes about silicon savannah and
he's doing some really interesting
consulting with or private companies and
public companies out and trying to
understand connecting users back to
social services around the state also so
really exciting stuff really want to
hear a story and also you should ask
them about the time that we all ended up
naked in a spa with swedes after
conference which we think maybe I'm SDS
can actually explore doing that next
time because we really bonded you know
it brought us together too good and what
we're going to do is actually since
we're running out of time we're just
going to go straight to questions I'm
opening up to the audience for mark 45
minutes after his and then we'll do the
same for panthi and then we'll do
questions for everybody else all right
thanks so yeah fresh off a plane and
just before I start I'd just like to
issue thanks once again to lily and
Liz and and just to Trisha yourself and
everybody who helped the State
Department and the US Embassy Nairobi do
things I never thought possible to get
me here so so thank you and it's great
to be in a an honor and a privilege to
bring Nairobi to you in person so when
you think about Kenya a couple of things
could come to mind well beautiful
safaris you could think of the economic
capital of East Africa you could think
about the world's best runners all right
but don't ask me to sprint around the
block and you could think of one person
in particular you might be familiar with
him by now he happens to be your
president barack obama yeah he does have
kenyan lineage but but all of that
didn't matter as much in 2007 in 2008
really just the end of 2007-2008 when we
had a contested election the last
election we had and that led to some
unrest and a disputed result and it
tainted Kenya's previously peaceful
history of over half century really and
things boiled over round ethnicity and
who we are Kenya's a very rich country
to got over forty two tribes and that
really spun against us for the political
gain at this time but all of that led to
our country becoming a lot stronger a
lot closer and us getting invested in
making sure that never happened again
and most importantly it jolted one
person in particular a whistleblower who
uncovered just two years before the
country's largest political corruption
scandal a gentleman by the name of John
gazonga and his you know as big burly
guy with you know round glasses and a
journalist and very very good speaker
and he were in exile in london after
uncovering you know six hundred million
dollars that had you know disappeared
and gone to a fake company he came back
to nairobi to kenya set up again and was
determined to create an intervention
night that will make sure that in March
of this year just two months from now
mar 4 2013 would we have another
election we wouldn't go back to what we
saw in 2007 and 2008 and so amidst that
and amidst the scoping and years worth
of work getting funding getting partners
in meeting across all of these different
sectors public and private him and his
entire organization of some of the
smartest people around all determined to
show Kenyans that leadership is present
around them we don't have to resort to
the political class they got bogged down
they got out of touch with the end user
with the person that they were hoping to
have the impact on and that's when our
paths collided and and and one of the
project directors asked for me to meet
with them and just to sit down and for
me and you are sitting down with
incredibly smart people they had a
network of almost 10,000 of the best and
well-connected young people in the
country sitting all across the map but
in the midst of moving this huge beast
forward and getting all of these
approvals something had gone amiss along
the way in terms of the vision and so
sitting down with something that may be
familiar to all of you some of you may
be a practice this for years maybe
decades in a familiar with the thinking
behind design thinking or user centered
design but walking through with this
group just empathy exercises and
creating specifically personas
completely changed the game for for this
particular group that I said they had
the data they had the insights from
across the country but what came out of
just specifically the personas exercise
was a revelation to them it was coming
up and going back to it all starts and
to give you an analogy of what the
political landscape is like in Kennedy's
think of a diocese and think of you know
a gentleman politician of some kind
standing on top with you know a sound
system able to pass more concept and
just speaking to a crowd of people right
and and what we were trying to change at
that point before was the message that
came out and changed the message but
reaping everything constant and the
shift that came out of this little
session of empathy and personas was that
it's not about changing the message from
the top of the poop
for example but it's about starting with
the user and why they showed up to this
field in the first place and that led to
a pretty big shift in the focus and in
the vision and specifically in the
clarity of having a Kenyan in mind from
every single point of the campaign and
the action that took place as a result
was just at the launch just when teaser
billboards were going all over the city
around own go see which is the just so
healing for leadership and it's the name
of the campaign which is also in a
television showing a number of other
things across media just when the poster
I mean the bill post began show
politicians threatened actually raised
it as a point of order in Parliament
itself saying we don't understand what
this is and these guys are trying to
intervene in in Kenyan selecting their
own leadership but they felt threatened
and that's because it spoke directly to
the heart of what Kenyans were facing at
that time doctors at the time we had one
particular bilbo that that talked about
the parallels between doctors and
politicians who amongst the work the
world's best paid Kenyans are and what
that led to was even the doctors going
on strike and subsequently getting much
better packages things and kind of the
the point of the action for me that came
out of this was that I am more familiar
with the stories the intricacy of
storytelling but here you had people
with an incredible data and when they
step back towards stories and look back
at the insights that they had it led to
a much clearer and more focused action
that I hope come much both will pay for
itself if it hasn't already thank you
can you give us a 30 second story of
what one of the personas so we can
understand sure an example so so one of
them is called Volta vo ta which is kind
of a nickname I didn't agree with the
name because I thought it's like a
little too obvious but like how much
everybody backed that name almost
shocked me because I was like isn't this
a bit of i almost said it but i let the
group kind of discussed amongst
themselves and he's a 23 year old young
man he's not gainfully employed and so
what he does is he sits at what's called
think of it just as as a small little
kiosk a small little store
in a peri-urban area so it's closer to
the rural areas and all he does every
day is a go through the newspapers you
might get on public transport and help
move passengers into that but his
political views and the media that he's
exposed to it is primarily you know
English Premier League football and the
news that follows these games puts him
in a position as an influencer at a
local level amongst people under 30 that
distinguishes him in almost every
particular instance you find him and we
went out for subsequently with a bunch
of assumptions to prove and disprove
them and it really solidified I think a
lot of what we had and helped to change
