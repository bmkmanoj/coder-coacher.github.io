hi it's my pleasure to introduce the ink
I he's a graduate student at MIT Kostas
daskalakis as his advisor he had some
really great work on multi-dimensional
mechanism design that's very seminal in
at least another algorithmic game theory
community and he's done some internships
at Google with Aaron yak metha and MSR
redmond and MSR Asia he's from a gain
University originally and he'll talk to
us today about mechanism design thanks
can go it's great to be here today
thanks for inviting me today I want to
talk about mechanism design specifically
on a new algorithmic framework so I want
to divide my top into four parts start I
want to give you an overview of the view
of mechanism design then I want to focus
on my own work on how to optimize
revenue and mounted dimensional setting
don't want to talk about some of my
related work and now where's Mick
pricing and then the end I want to
briefly overview some of my other work
so let me start with giving you an
overview of the view of mechanism design
I want to show you what is the mechanism
design and what is an auction so what is
mechanism design so this is probably all
story everyone knows that so a mom wants
to divide a cake up evenly a monitor to
kids but she does not know who likes
what so will usually happen is like both
of the kids thing the other guy gets a
better slice one my thing the other one
has more chocolate honor the other thing
so while Maya doesn't have a strawberry
on it ok so probably after a while every
mom learns the following solution to
this problem she'll like just one kid
cut the cake and let the other pic ok so
in this case both the kids will be happy
and she does not need to know who likes
what
so this is just a very simple
application of mechanism design so I
want to think of mechanism design as the
engineering part of game theory or
economics so it's actually quite
different from most part of game theory
economics where they usually start with
an existing game or some economic system
then they try to analyze the game like
what will happen if people are actually
playing the game try to predict the
outcome or to take the outcome and try
to explain why this happened okay well
mechanism design is the complete
opposite so usually you start with some
desired goal then you want to design
some game that if people are playing it
you can actually see the desired outcome
arise from it okay so it sounds quite
similar to algorithm design but the main
difference or the difficulty here is the
designer is usually ignoring its
ignoring of the players private
information for example in the
cake-cutting example the mother does not
know who likes what so if ever in this
complicated environment it goes are
achievable how ok that's a mechanism
design you probably also heard about
auctions when people are talking about
mechanism design I want to think of
auctions as any mechanism where you're
allowed to use money ok it's very large
part of mechanism design there are also
other scenarios where using money is
undesirable for example you want to
election or fair division ok but for
this talk I want to focus on just
auction and want to use the word auction
and mechanism interchangeably so
thursday auction is also playing very
important role in our lives so so in
many countries the government's actually
use options to lk spectrums they sell
licenses using auctions for for
transmitting signals now in the
electromagnetic spectrum so turns out
using auction actually helps the
government to allocate the band's to the
companies who valued them the most and
also creates a lot of revenue for the
government
also auction is very common in daily
lives probably everyone has used one of
these websites so you can buy anything
or sell anything on ebay and there are
this traveling websites you can bit on
your hotels and flight tickets okay yep
best buy and I'm trying to figure out
how to price the gadgets in my stores
that mechanism design yes just actually
talk about something about this pricing
okay so uh another example this is
probably one you will see in any talk
about auction so it's called swans the
search also the adoption so what
happened here is the advertisers want to
display some ads to the users who are
using pin or Google so what p no google
usually do is I run an auction among
these advertisers then they decide whose
ad will be displayed and in what
position okay so hopefully I've
convinced you uh oxygen is very
important so from now on I want to
formally Allen eyes auctions so let me
start with the definition so you have
one auctioneer you have bidders i'll
label them 1 through m you have items
out label the one through n okay so
bidders they have evaluation on items or
set subsets of items these are these
valuations or a private information only
the bitter himself knows it not the
other bidder not the auctioneer and this
information is usually encoded as
bitters type so through the talk i'll
use little TI to denote bitter ice type
and capital T I to be the set of
possible types for bitter I ok so I also
want to make to sender assumptions on
this information the first is better ice
type is simple from some known
distribution independently if I know I
mean it's no to every bitter as well a
structure near i also want to assume
bidders valuation is additive meaning
for a set of items your value for this
set is simply the sum of the value for
each item in it
okay so for now I can just assume like
feather eyes type is the n-dimensional
vector where v IJ is his value for the J
side okay that's for the bidders ah how
about the auctioneer so the auctioneer
needs to decide how to allocate the
items to bidders but there are
potentially some constraints on what
allocations are actually allowed I'll
soon give you examples on what these
constraints might look like but for now
just think of it as generous s system
okay and I'll use F to the node SSJ
system so that's a setup how do you
actually run an auction so the
auctioneer first needs to design the
auction he needs to specify an
allocation rule and pricing roof just
think of them as two functions that map
the big vector into an allocation and
prices for everyone okay once you have
specified the auction you commits to it
you cannot change anymore and you
announce it so the bidders will fit and
you collect the bits then apply the two
functions to the bids then you will get
an allocation and prices for everyone so
that's where the auctioneer ah but
bidder should take her own type the
description of the auction and the
distribution of our other bidders type
and shoe tries to optimize her own
utility which is the expected value
minus expected price by playing around
her bid okay this is strike tip your
setting so it's not necessarily true
that she will bid your true value if she
think it's better you might bid half of
her value or square root of their value
okay so for the auctioneer his goal will
be first he wants to guarantee the
auction is designed in a way that the
bidders will actually be truthfully this
is was a lobster dollar loss of
generality and then the auctioneer might
have some go in his mind he wants to
optimize sometimes might be welfare
that's just the sum of every bitters
value you can think of as happiness of
the whole society or might be his own
happiness which is the revenue okay so
let me give you some example on the
constraints on the allocations the first
one is very simp
also imagine i'm selling paintings so
one thing I definitely don't want to do
is keep one eye one painting to more
than one better okay and so in this
example the feasible allocations are
those you don't give any item more out
more than once okay so this a relative
simple case I can have a slightly more
complicated constraint so imagine i'm
selling houses so again i don't want to
keep one house to more than one bidder
but I also don't want some bitter wind
up having more than one how's it in the
end ok so in this case only matchings
are allowed ok or I might have this
crazy idea of selling doctor
appointments using auctions ok so items
are slots with doctors in the hospital
so I don't want to keep one slot to more
than one bidder but I'm i also want like
I don't want any bitter to see the same
doctor more than once or give him
overlapping slots ok so you can think of
this as a 3d matching constraint ok so
I've shown you what the constraints
might look like I also want to give you
some backgrounds on how to optimize
welfare or revenue in auction okay so
start with welfare so turns out we
understand how to optimize welfare
really well victory Clark and grow if
they show the so-called BCG auction
optimizes welfare in any setting so I
want to think of their result as a
reduction that reduces a mechanism
design problem to an algorithm design
problem and that's the perspective I
want to take for this talk ok they
reduced a mechanism design problem
that's finding an auction that maximize
welfare to an algorithm design problem
that that's just finding an a location
that maximizes welfare so more
specifically the algorithm design
problem is define an allocation f that
maximize the sum of everyone's value ok
so they show if this underlying
algorithm design problem is a tractable
for feasibility constraint f so it's
running the auction ok
recently a sequence work I've shown that
this reduction can all combination so
for welfare really understand problem
wasn't so probably really well so have a
revenue so for revenue understand much
less the most favored is out is due to
Myerson he showed that if you have a
single item for sale then a simple
auction can actually maximizes revenue
this is through a beautiful result and
Mars actually want a Nobel Prize for it
so let's look at what my reasons auction
actually looks like okay so if n bidders
the bidders will bit then the auctioneer
take the bidders bit then transform them
into virtue of it so the transformation
here is a deterministic function and
depends on bitters distribution then the
auctioneer just finds the bidder who has
the highest virtue of it not real bitch
is the virtue of it and allocate the
item to him okay so this is equivalent
as finding a location that maximizes
virtual welfare okay so that's my RSS
auction so arguably ebay is running some
special cases of meyerson's auction
every day again i want to think of
meyerson's result as a reduction it
reduces a mechanism design problem a
problem you have truthfulness incentives
to and then just a purely hours and
design problem the margin reduced a
problem of finding a revenue optimum
auction to just computing a welfare
optimal location so let me remind you
what just happened in meyerson's
auctions so bidders report the types
these types are transformed into virtual
types by the auctioneer then the
auctioneer finds the allocation that
maximizes the virtual fair okay and the
transformation is deterministic and
depending mrs actually give an explicit
formula for it for people who know it's
a virtual valued function so if there's
a single item for sale we know how to
optimize revenue for natural questions
okay for welfare we under we know how to
solve for Alberta settings for here you
only know how to do for single item how
about like I want to sell many items
together so for the second part of my
talk I want to focus on this problem so
no surprise this problem actually
becomes one of the central problem in
mathematical economics so it's called a
multi-dimensional mechanism design
problem so the problem States following
even if you have many items and you have
many bidders can use do you have
efficiently computable and revenue
optima auction and hopefully the option
will be something simple if you have
very complication like the bidders might
not understand what to do in this
auction so they might not participate at
all okay this is some trivial
complicated auction I don't know it can
be a very long laundry list say if the
profiles this I do they're like perfect
style I do that like it can be output by
some program so you just see this long
as the bidders will not believe you like
Pinterest was the best thing maybe or
they don't know how to add something
like this exists you can come up with
something like that but yeah there's
some trivial thing where you think and
identity like with extension long yeah
explore exponential long description
auction okay so from now I want to use
the acronym for this problem mt mt p so
the settings come out of dimensional is
for this following simple reason so if
you have many items to specify bitters
type you need many numbers well when you
have one item one number is enough okay
so let me take one step back and try to
understand why this problem is not
trivial okay I've told you meyerson's
auction optimize revenue and their
single item okay one natural thing you
might want to try is okay why not just
run wires as auction on the item's
independently okay so it turns out this
is not a very good idea so the first
problem with this approach was like okay
this might violate feasibly constraint
if you're selling houses if I run this
auction it's likely someone will end up
with more than one house okay
so for even in some very simple setting
while running this auction gives you a
feasible allocation the revenue it
collects can actually be far away from
the optimal ok I want to show you a very
simple example the example is really
simple you have one bidder you have n
items the bidders valuation for the
items is just wrong I ID from uniforms
or distribution so if you want to run
meyerson's auction on every item
independently what you would do is set
price one half on every item ok then
it's probably one half the bitter will
buy that item right so you collect
revenue one quarter from every item so
in expectation where you get is n over 4
so let me propose another auction okay
so I make the following take your leave
a choice to the bitter so i say i give
you 2 square bundle if you're willing to
pay me 1 minus epsilon times n over to
think of epsilon is a tiny tiny constant
ok so notice that the bidders expected
value for described bundles and over 2
and it's easy to see with probably
almost won his value is higher than the
price I gave him so basically I'm
guaranteed to sell this item was
probably that the grandfather was
probably one so reven is roughly n over
2 ok so shows Martha's auction on every
item independently is at least factor 2
away from the alcohol and in fact this
gap can be much larger when the items
are independent this pair gap can
actually be as bad as log in and if the
items are correlated this gap can
actually be unbounded ok so hopefully
I've convinced you this problems don't
review also want to give you some ovary
of previous result cellphone the column
excite a large body of work has been
devoted to this problem but progress has
been sporadic from the computer science
side constant factor approximation czar
known for some settings for some of the
special settings even exact solutions or
no but all these settings are quite
limited and
techniques are at all in fact all these
results only apply to special cases of
the NBA MVP problem ok so I'm showing
you a long list of papers the real
message I want to convey is actually uh
ok so let me use the examples I
described earlier to show what this
previous results can actually do ok so
an example of selling paintings so we
understand the problem pretty well we
know how to solve it optimally an
example of selling houses we don't know
how to solve it optimally but many
constant factor approximation zorno ok
but if you want to sell doctor
appointments we don't know how to start
optimally we don't know how to give any
reasonable approximation and not even
mentioning if the feasibility constraint
is just something general we know
absolutely nothing ok so what I'm going
to do next I want to give you a general
framework which can solve all these
problems all together ok so our result
states that we can generalize meyerson's
theorem to solve the MDM DP problem for
arbitrary feasibility constraint f ok so
Aras Aras to expects first I want to
compute the optimal auction so what we
show is we can reduce this mechanism
design problem to an algorithm design
problem again ok we can reduce the
problem of finding the revenue optimal
shin to algorithm design problem that's
just finding the welfare optimal
allocation the same problem like what
BCG users and Myers I use it ok so once
you have found the optimal auction as I
said the oxygen can feast you can scoop
you something very complicated it might
just give you a long laundry list on
what to do on every type profile but
what we show is the allocation rule of
this auction is something quite simple
the allocation rule itself can actually
be reduced to a welfare yeah the same
algorithm design problem that's just
finding the optimal over welfare optimal
location so what it looks like city
following
so bidders will submit their types the
auctioneer take the types and transform
them into virtual types then finds the
allocation that maximizes virtual
welfare so this is very similar to
meyerson's result the only difference is
in meyerson's result the transformation
is some deterministic function and given
by explicit formula in our case the
transformation is randomized and
computer file an LP and it's known that
randomness is necessary if you want to
solve empty MVP there are examples
showing randomized algorithm eyes
mechanism is strictly better than the
domestic ones so you you do need
randomness ok so for our results work
what we really need is just a black box
access to some algorithm a that finds an
optimal welfare optimal allocation for
feasibility constraint out ok if I have
this black box or sex to this algorithm
a I can solve the problem ok that means
I don't even need to know what F is ok
as long as half a I'm done ok so one
question you might ask is well good if
you can solve this algorithm design
problem exactly you can design the
optimal optimal auction or sometimes
just solving this a algorithm design
problem might be impossible it's NP hard
so can you say anything in this case so
happen Oh
okay so we show is if you have any
approximation algorithm to this
algorithm design problem so our
reduction still works and preserves the
approximation factor okay so the main
technical barrier from extending the
exact solution to this approximate
solution is that here we need to
optimize some objective / possibly not
comics or not even connected region okay
so by understanding the nuts and both of
the ellipse or algorithm we managed to
do that ok so again you don't need to
know so what you really need to have is
black box assessed to this approximation
algorithm for feasibility constraint
it's really the same hell okay alpha
minus epsilon for arbitrary small epson
we go on okay and again you don't need
to know what eff this only black box
access to this algorithm okay so let me
actually keep the proof so in a very
high level sense what I want to do is
want to use an LP to find the optimal
option okay so I want my variables to
describe an option so I need variables
to be allocation probabilities and
prices okay then I want to make sure my
auction is the true Spock shin so I want
to write a true spoke truthfulness candy
constraint it's just if you're reporting
your true type you're maximizing your
totally okay and i also want to
guarantee my auction is feasible meaning
for every type profile the oxygen will
choose an allocation that is in that
okay and the objective is the expected
revenue so let me just propose something
really obvious okay so I want to
describe the auction in this following
away so for every type profile I give
you a distribution over feasible
locations okay and I say if the report
that profile is this our simple one
allocation from the distribution I gave
ok that's the description of the auction
so in this case first one is very easy
to check you can compute fitters utility
based on his true type and what he
reports ok and feasibility is also
tribute to track you just you just look
at every type profile and see if the
distribution is really a distribution ok
that's it so the only issue is this
approach is ok the number of variables
simply too large it depends on F and
also depends on the total number of high
profile which is exponential in our
input ok so i can i use this and hope to
stop the LP efficiently so let me
propose something slightly more
complicated ok so now for every type
profile I don't give you a whole
distribution ok I only give you some
marginal probability for every better I
I tell you the marginal probability you
will get item J under this type profile
ok that's it so again truthfulness is
still easy to check using this you can
still compute bidders utility or now
visible he actually becomes a problem ok
you need I only give you the marginals
you need to see whether under the
high-profile there is really a
distribution that matches all the
modules ok it's unclear how you can
solve this but also the number of
variables is large is better than the
previous one it does not depend on the
size of F but it's still exponential in
the input so none of these two is going
to help because like number of variables
too large if I want to solve the outfit
efficiently there's just no way I can do
it ok what I really want is something
here I really want a succinct
description of the auction where have
small number of variables that can hope
to stop the LP it's probably too
optimistic to hope something here my
work ok because you have 16 description
you already compress a lot of
information about the auction then
checking physically could actually be
very hard so so
probably something here is what we are
looking for let me actually propose
something that's light lies there so
what I want to use is this call entering
allocation rule or reduced form so what
I want you to think of it as promises
the auctioneer make to the bidders so I
promise you if you're a bitter I and
your type is TI a gift item J to you was
probably this much in expectation over
every bitters type and the randomness of
the auction okay that's the promise I
want to make I also makes similar
promises about the prices I want to
charge you if your type is I sorry if
you're better i 0 type is TI i'll charge
you this much again in expectation of
everybody bidders type and the
randomness of the auction okay so turns
out if you use reduced form it's
actually something here the first a
number of variables is much smaller this
polynomial in the total number of bitter
types not high profile which is
polynomial in our input which is very
good so although this is very succinct
description I can still compute fitters
utility based on for your report and
what your true type is ok it's your
analysis ok well the only issue is
feasibility ok if you think about it
basically you take the probabilities
that given to you in the second case
then you marginalize it over other
bidders type you will get a reduced form
ok so basically you start with the
distribution under every type profile
you marginalize over items that you go
from one to two then you marginalize
over other bidders type you go two to
three you get a reduced form so check
visibility you need to understand what
whether you can basically be
marginalized to reduce form to get a
distribution under every type of fun ok
so it's really clear how we can solve it
so in fact even when there's only a
single item check and feasibility is
quite hard recently there are two papers
essentially just trying to solve this
problem checking physically for a single
item ok
but like we're still want to solve it I
want to show you how to solve it soon so
this is the LP i really want to use ok
to find your op you are ugly optimal
auction so the variables are the reduced
form ok so i have truthfulness so
probably hard to see but I can use the
reduced form to write a linear
constraint for that ok so I the only
thing it's unclear is visibly
constrained ok and a wishful thinking is
maybe I can design some separation
Oracle that checks visibility
efficiently if I can have a separation
Oracle for a feasibility I can just
solve this LP and find a ravening
optimal action ok that's it ok so let me
show you how to check physically so i'll
just start with how to check physically
for a single item ok so for starters I
want to give you this really really
simple example so you have one item you
have two bidders the bidders
distribution is uniform enter type set
theta one has type a and B bitter too
has type CMD okay so question is the
following feasible array is the colorful
and reduce one feasible so for bitter
one I make the following promises if
your type is a I guarantee you get the
item always if your type of speed you
get the item which probably you point to
ok etc so any guess whether this reduced
form is feasible ok let's see so I want
to start with a right I know if a shows
up I need to give the item to him always
right so it's profiles AC or profiles ad
I need to keep the item to a always so
in this case a is saturated so now let
me look at profile B and C so I claim
the scene
should get it always in this case why
because seniors get it was probably
point five and he shows up with a was
probably 15 right and that case is never
getting it they always get it so she has
to get the item or for all the rest of
the time so when BC shows up she needs
to get the item always now type C
satiated so the only profile I haven't
considered is B&amp;amp;B okay so it turns out
he needs to get it item was probably
point for and Dean's to get it was
probably point eight and there's no way
it's as if I'm both ok so this reduced
form is infeasible but this is really a
really simple case i'm so lucky they're
having pie as1 which gives me a very
natural star right and also the setting
is simple i have two bidders i have
uniform distribution or you have i well
if I have many bidders and complicated
distribution it's not even clear whether
there is a systematical way to check
visibility not even mentioning checking
efficiently ok so what I want to do max
is show you a very natural necessary
condition or checking the physically
okay so for every bitter now just pick
subset of your types ok call it si ok I
claim for any choices of the subsets the
following uh Nicole you should hold ok
so the left-hand side is the probability
there is some bitter I whose type is in
Si and he gets the item ok that's a
left-hand side the right hand side is
just the probability there is some
bitter I whose type is ness I I don't
care where the item goes just your type
is in si ok so clearly the left hand
side should be smaller than you I hand
side it doesn't matter like the choices
of the subsets ok this is very natural
necessary condition
but the surprising thing is turns out
this thing is also sufficient so if this
inequality holds for any choices of the
subsets the reduced form is feasible
okay so if you encode this problem as a
never flow problem using some type of
max-flow min-cut theorem you can show
this result so that means ah if you have
complicated distribution or many bidders
there is still at least a systematical
way to check physically okay but if you
want to enumerate all the possible
choice of the subsets to check
visibility its exponential time right so
you need to enumerate like a large set
of possible conditions so after a lot of
sweat with madden casas we actually show
we can check this voyage efficiently in
time almost linear in just the sum of
bitter types not high profile okay so
that's what i want to show you for a
single item feasibility so but what
really do you want to do is check
physically for many items right so one
thing i want to emphasize is that this
is not just a harder problem of this a
harder version of the same problem it's
actually quite different problem so you
have many items so the never flow
formulation somehow doesn't make much
sense you probably want to do like muggy
comolli flow which gets way Messier and
also i have this complicated visibility
constraint half arbitrary complicated
okay so how can we check this bully for
many items okay so we try to extend the
combinatorial approach we use for single
item to this case but doesn't quite work
and unlikely will work what we really
use is a drill metric approach so you
want to say so will we but what we do is
we think of the reduced forms is
actually a high dimensional vector
reduce one is just a function map the
types to probabilities okay you can
think of as high dimensional vector so
let me call a set of feasible reduced
form FFT this is just a high-dimensional
object the first claim I want to make is
FF D is actually a convex polytope okay
the proof is quite easy I don't want to
sell with my time here if you want to
hear details I can tell you're offline
so now I know the feasible region is
convex polytope and you want to get a
separation Oracle for a convex polytope
there's a classical way of doing it
using by using this way versus out the
equivalence of separation optimization
by Groucho low versus schreiber okay
what the results place is if you have a
polytope and you can optimize on any
direction that you there is a generic
way you can turn this optimization
algorithm into a separation Oracle okay
so if you want to use this approach
really question you want as this can we
actually optimize on our pollito okay in
any direction all the answer is like
almost so we show this interesting
characterization basically states that
if you have direction you want optimized
interaction w there's some way I can
reinterpret this direction as virtual
values for the bidders okay then if you
use an allocation rule that always
maximizes your virtual welfare the
corresponding reduced form will be the
furthest corner on Direction W okay so
through problems now is like can you
compute these corners if you can by just
using gel as a result you get a
separation org you to music again about
that form in which you're given the
feasibility constraints or do you only
have you're only given a black boxes
yeah yeah optimize welfare forgiven yes
so I only assuming I have a black box
access to this algorithm that computes
optimized breath okay i don't i'm not
singer okay so are we done here well not
really so it turns out if you want to
actually compute these corners
officially you need to do some sampling
but this will give you some additive
error epsilon and to get an error epson
all you actually to spend time
polynomial in 1 over epsilon
but unfortunately for jos result to work
they actually quite absolute to be
exponentially small otherwise their
results not giving you anything
meaningful okay so using joey's result i
can get a separation or go but which has
running tie exponential which is not
useful so what we really need is some
jealous type of result but it has to be
robust to edit avera so by using some
novel techniques we managed to do that
what we show is some analog of the GRS
result i want you to think of it as the
mechanism design version of equivalence
optimization and separation so the
results is appalling so if you're given
an algorithm that maximize welfare for
feasibility constraint f then there is a
generic way I can turn this algorithm
into a separation article for FFP okay
and an approximate separation or so
using this result I can actually get a
separation Oracle for a for checking the
feasibility so I can use it to solve the
LP and then the end result will get is
FP r us for the NBA MVP problem okay so
that completes our proof okay so so
oxygen is a very general general thing
but in real life actually see more
simpler form of selling items okay
probably like pricing is one for most
common one so I want to assure some my
result in the pricing problem so
consider this a very fundamental pricing
problem you have one seller he wants to
get a cell phone for himself okay it's
clear that what he wants what he will
buy is the one that maximizes circulars
the value of minus the price ok so the
seller knows the buyers values are drawn
independently from some known
distribution you want to the end so what
if the seller wants to do is actually
come up with a set of prices that will
maximize his revenue okay so I want to
make this a technical assumption that
the eyes and monitor has read
tribution so that is the definition but
what I really want to tell you is mhr is
very commonly used in economics and
contains couch on exponential uniform
distribution so it's kind of brought
class so for this problem before our
result only constant factor
approximation czar no sorry single prior
no I have many fire know about yes only
a single buyer any single buyer yes so
if you assume the buyers iid it's the
same if they're none ID buyers so we
showed there actually a pee test for
this problem and this is probably the
first pitas for a Mountie dimensional
setting before they all everything is
just constant Proclamation so I want to
share an interesting probability theorem
we show in this work so we showed that
if there are n independent mhr random
variables ok they're not necessary the
same then there exists an anchoring
point such that first the probability of
the max being above this anchoring point
is an absolute constant well that's not
surprising such point always exist the
surprising part is if you should offer
for a constant factor 1 over epsilon
times log of 1 over epsilon the
contribution from this high values to
the expectation is actually tiny ok so I
want to compare it with Markov's
inequality which has some somewhat
similar flavor so Markov's inequality
says if you sure have a constant factor
of your expectation the probability of
things something above the threshold is
tiny but does not say anything about the
contribution to expectation only sister
probably ok in my it might be the case
the contribution to expectations is
actually very large ok but here we're
not only saying the probability of this
high value is spa we are also saying the
contributions tiny ok so another thing
I'll mention is there is actually a
whole area call extreme value theory
they study the max or mean behavior of a
bunch of random variable
but usually what they started is iid
distributions okay here we can deal with
non-id distribution okay so here's how
this hour rizal has many applications so
you can actually get a constant factor
approximation to this pricing problem
immediately yes okay on the prowl so in
the middle at the bottom and bound is
not related to be digest eps no beta
Omega 1 right oh yes that's the absolute
constant it's uh and that concept I
didn't show up in your bound on the
right no and beta so it if I rescale the
distribution it should somehow nada ah
yes but like you also risk ill-paid RI
so this thing also changes but if I
escape it should not to use my intuition
if I just rescale the x-axis yes a
probability should not order oh it's an
expect expect a expectation not the
probably yeah yeah yeah is there some
intuition even an IAD case why this is
so in the ID case is actually if you're
mhr distribution the max is also a
mature so mhm are you know it's very
like concentrated so you can get this
kind of thing yeah yeah you mind it is
independent but the max of non-id m hrs
not mhr so you cannot just use this
thing but that's probably giving you
some intuition why this animal charge
the ones like you or terrorists not
heavier than exponential so okay so okay
I want to talk about some applications
this result so one thing you can do is
you basically price everything I beta so
you know Wisconsin probably you will
sell the item and you know that you
cannot get better than pay that much
right like high values they're only
epsilon beta so so this gives you a
constant factor of the pricing problem
immediately okay
if you want to use if you're going to
use this affair and more careful you can
actually design pts for this problem
originally we found the application of
this theorem for a some mounted better
setting factor for summation is just to
sell everything at the same price video
yes it's a very simple option I mean the
constant might not be very well well
good but it's constant so for auction
setting we found out how to use this to
improve the runtime bine an exponential
factor for certain setting okay so let
me also talk about some my other work
the first one to show you is this lemax
theorem like we generalize meme a
theorem to multi played games so a
mechanism design so you can design a
game first sometimes the game is just
given to you for example in poker or
rock paper scissors in this case you
still want to understand what will
happen right so so poker and rock paper
scissor is just a special case of the
two players your sub game and we know in
two players do some game if people are
playing mean Mac strategy that forms
equilibrium and you can actually compute
these strategies using a linear program
right so owe me Mac strategy is to one
that minimize your maximum loss okay so
that somehow shows two players there
were some days very nice class right you
know understands what really happened in
the end and if that robin almond a very
famous game theories another Nobel re he
actually say that probably two players
you assume game is the only case you can
make sharp and unique prediction on the
players behavior okay and some recent
TCS result actually provided support for
this claim so we know if we have two
player game but the whole game is
nonzero sum is be very complete to find
a Nash equilibrium or you if you throw
in one more player if there's three
player even the game is there some it's
stupid vehicle okay so is there any hope
you can generalize this me max veeram
too many multi-plate game okay
so if you want to generalize first thing
you want to rule out is a three-way
interaction if you have three wind
direction if during games there are some
it's going to be pretty complete so we
want to just focus on pairwise
interaction so there is a broad class of
game called poly matrix game so players
are nodes on a graph ok every edge is
just game between the two endpoints so
now you only have pairwise interaction a
player's payoff is just a some of the
players from all adjacent edges okay so
for example player for player you he's
payoff is this okay it's called poly
matrix because every player has many
payoff matrix instead of in the other
case you only have one okay why are you
can only choose why right no no you use
one strategy and play against all your
neighbors genealogy yes one strategy in
all the games okay or unfortunately just
for this simple game it's PPID complete
to find a Nash equilibrium like this we
can see to play a game if you put
noisier than zero sum game he really
let's be very complete right but I want
to throw in this one extra condition I
want to assume the whole game the global
get the whole game is zero sum the sum
of every player's payoff always thump up
20 okay that's the Assumption I want to
make so this is the game actually first
study by Bracken enough walking's in the
70s they gave an algorithm finding a
nash equilibrium but it's not necessary
polynomial time one so what we show is
for this game we can actually compute a
Nash equilibria efficiently in
polynomial time and the cell of Nash
equilibrium is comics and interestingly
if you run no regret learning algorithms
on the notes empiric the empirical
behavior will actually converge to a
Nash equilibrium efficiently okay so
that basically inherits all nice
properties of two players of some games
okay and arguably this is the broadest
class you can hope for pauses for
results if you are throw away this
pairwise endure
action assumption you're running a few
beta completeness you throw it a
zero-sum you also run into a few bidding
okay so the last work I want to talk
about is something like that I do in
online matching so in the beginning to
show you this our auction example
mechanism design is trying to understand
economic part of this problem there's
another branch of research trying to
understand the online nature of this
problem click online matching so in all
I'm matching the model is following you
have a bipartite graph you have offline
sigh you and you have the online ciebie
the online sign knows arrive one by one
and one snow arrives they are incident
address or review once the note arrives
you need to make a decision whether you
want to match it to someone or just want
to let it go okay and all decisions are
irrevocable okay that's just a model so
on are matching is usually using our
allocations okay ah but usually so in
there is a difference between theory and
practice in theory all I matching
usually just try to maximize the
cardinality of the matching so just one
objective in practice there actually
sometimes more than one objective you
want to optimize revenue well for our I
many things and sometimes these
constraint this objectives are
conflicting you want to somehow balance
them okay so last summer during my
internship at Google we come up with
this new model so now every Edge has a
color so think of this case like orange
edges or the ones gives you good revenue
and green ones gives you good welfare
okay and what you want to do is you want
to find matching there's somehow balance
these two objectives so the objects you
want to do is we want to maximize that
the cardinality of the mint color
matches okay I want to maximize but I
still want the balance okay so we show
some interesting result but one one
thing one property about this problem
I'll ensure was you is that using greedy
algorithm it's actually quite bad
in this case so we call this skip thing
so skip means if the know comes and
there is available knows you can match
do you decide not to match you just let
it go that's what we call skipping so in
the argent original problem skipping is
definitely bad okay so you should always
match for in this case what we show is
if you used to mimic this mystic
algorithm and you don't do skipping so
this gives you absolutely nothing okay
if you're allowed to use randomized
algorithm and you don't do skipping it's
still not very good it's a most you can
do one half so if you want to beat one
half you need to do skipping in a clever
way and we managed to show a randomized
algorithm the actually can beat this
point 5 1 half area and we come quite
close to the possible optimal so let's
wrap up so first I show you a reduction
from the magnums of the design problem
that's maximizing revenue to an
algorithm design problem that's just
finding a location to maximize profit ok
so this is kind of general framework so
interesting future directions to see if
there are other mechanism design problem
you can also reduce to algorithm to that
problem so Brenda Nico has some work on
showing hardness of doing this reduction
and then I also talked about some other
work and algorithmic pricing I show you
this interesting extreme value theorem I
also show you how to generalize me max
theorem to work in multiplayer zero-sum
game and the end I talked about some of
my result in online matching and that's
all thank you for attention
yep alright ask you about the
multiplayer me back here actually tell
me that is there actually I mean max
theorem there or is it just a
computability so we call him a max
theorem is because it also can be
derived directly from the strong duality
it's kind of similar to the two players
yourself so that's why we call it but
it's not as how you're playing on me max
