economy of the United States if we don't
have more computer science majors we're
in big trouble and if half of our
population the female half is not going
to major in computer science we're in
big trouble if we don't have women
participating in creating the solutions
to technical problems I can promise you
that the technical solutions will not be
as good we need to have diverse teams to
create the world's greatest innovations
we need to build the talent pipeline and
to do that requires us to excite young
women in middle school in high school to
the future of computer science
it's really important to have a strong
foundation at an earlier age with
computer science related tools like
simple programming or even things
disguised as gains giving them
experiences to hands-on play with
technology and computer science to give
them passion it's that initial spark
that really keeps them engaged in the
field inspiring them to pursue careers
in science technology another key
ingredient to help keep girls in the
computer science track is to help them
be aware of opportunities with great
organizations like the Anita Borg
Institute and the National Center for
Women in Technology and see what does a
lot of work in Washington DC because
we're working very hard to make sure
that policymakers understand the
importance of girls and women's
participation in computing we're
mobilizing all kinds of ways in 20 years
we're going to see what women invent
when they invent technology because
right now we really don't know what
women would invent if they're at the
technical design table we have an
executive team is really ready to take
the Anita Borg Institute to the next
level our signature program is the Grace
Hopper celebration of women in computing
this year we have 3,600 people
descending on Baltimore Maryland 1500 of
these are students and for them it's
often the first time they've come to a
conference it can be life-changing
grace hopper is the most exciting event
ever pretty much because being in a
computer science department that's so
vibrant as the one of brown's is great
but there just aren't enough women in my
like 125 lecture there's like four girls
and you're here and this this all the
girls who have that feeling in one place
it's just so inspiring to see how many
girls have the same interests as me you
walk around knowing that every single
girl here has something amazing that
they've done it's really amazing how
many technologies are out there and how
many women from all nationalities are in
these fields I've been very fortunate to
have a lot of mentors throughout my
career and it's those mentors who have
helped shape me and I hope with that
knowledge I can be a good mentor to
other women that I work with on a daily
basis right now at Microsoft Research
i'm working with rain Johnson I think
it's really important that women early
in their careers just entering computer
science in college or even in high
school have a female mentor I get to see
how someone very similar to me someone
with the same energy with the same
passions how they live their life and it
lets me know what my future could be
like and having reign as a mentor lets
me see that I can be successful exactly
as the person I am
I've gone to Haiti twice now through an
organization that I partner with that
stars aligned we were able to start
teaching introductory computer science
and programming skills to a group of
young women who serve as mentors in
three of the schools in rural northern
Haiti you can bring in food and
solutions that will last a short term or
you can bring in solutions that enable
the people to really take control their
destiny one of the things that was
really important when i met katie is her
passion to make a difference in the
world we know one reason that we're
losing a lot of young women in computer
science is the lack of awareness that
computer science really does change the
world young women today want to make an
impact and that's why we also partner
with net hope neca women's tech connect
is a global community of practice and an
a professional online mentoring program
to support women in developing world to
get into technology we put them through
a training in technology that's relevant
for their particular community for their
particular country and then place them
in internships in nonprofits in those
local areas so they they can get actual
real-world experience and ninety percent
of the time those internships turn into
jobs computer science is a very creative
field it's a field where you do a lot of
problem solving and collaboration and
it's a field that is changing the world
it's helping make innovations in health
care in the environment all around us
young women need to know that computer
science is about people whether that
person is your end user of a product or
someone who you're teaching or someone
who you're inspiring to really pick up
the reins become the next great
technologist
computer science is about people not the
technology we will bridge the gap bridge
the gap bridge the gap to future
innovation together to future innovation
together together together through
diversity through diversity through
diversity and creativity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
