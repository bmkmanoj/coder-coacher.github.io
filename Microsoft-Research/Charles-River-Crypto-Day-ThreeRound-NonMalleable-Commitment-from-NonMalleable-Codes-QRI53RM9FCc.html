you
tell us about no malleable stop no
matter what commitments codes really
good work actually it's a combination of
receiving support think also gets the
award for the best trust that mirror
yeah thanks Thank You Vinod okay yeah so
I'm going to tell I'm going to talk to
you guys about three round not malleable
commitment from non malleable codes this
is based on some joint works with the
bull golem can't Pandey and Sunnah park
so we'll start with a commitment scheme
it's like a very simple to party
protocol between a committer C and a
receiver are and in the commit phase the
the committer is going to send a string
Z that's a commitment to his like secret
message m and then in the decommit phase
he opens it and the property of security
properties that you want are binding
which says that sort of no matter what
string he sent in the commit phase
there's exactly one way to open it and
hiding which says that sort of until he
does decide to open it just the strings
e reveals no information to the receiver
about what's inside about the message
and there are different ways to
formalize these exactly what I've sort
of written down is non-interactive
perfectly binding commitment and you can
build it from one way permutations non
malleability is a security notion that
goes back to deliver to work in our 1991
and this is like an extra security
property you could ask and it concerns
the setting where the adversary like
he's a man in the middle he sits inside
two different executions of the protocol
so on the Left he's going to play as the
receiver he's going to receive a
commitment to a message m and on the
right he's going to have to produce he's
going to play as the committer he's
going to produce a commitment to a
related message or to a message I'm
tilde and we said that he wins if he's
able to generate a commitment to a
related message so like for example if M
tilde equals M plus 1 then he's going to
win you know if this is an auction he's
going to win no matter what see bids and
so that's like not good and I'll also
say that non malleability isn't
something that you'd expect to follow
from just the hiding of the crib min
scheme because the adversary doesn't
have to know what he's doing in order to
perform this attack
like he doesn't have to know what he's
actually committing to necessarily in
order to still like ma the commitment so
okay to formally define not malleability
like the intuition we want to keep in
mind is that it's sort of infeasible for
the man in the middle to produce a
commitment on the right M tilde which
depends on the commitment on the left
all right and to formalize this notion
you're going to use I mean we use the
real an ideal paradigm the real world is
exactly this this picture and ideal
world I like it looks similar it's
pretty much similar except that there's
no left execution there's no left
protocol instead there's just a
simulator who always committed 20 okay
and we say that the protocol is not
malleable if the man in the middle can't
tell which world he lives in given his
view and the value he's committing to ok
and so I'll like just point out surely
this captures the intuition we want
right because if the men in the middle
can't distinguish M tilde in the real
world from M tilde an ideal world then
certainly M tilde in the real world
can't depend on em right because in the
ideal world there is no M there's just 0
okay so since 1991 like numerous
applications for an honorable commitment
have been found you know most notably to
secure computation in fact in some
settings like the only way we know how
to get constant around multi-party
computation is via constant around not
malleable commitment and sort of any
sort of composable two-party computation
you could you could imagine would have
to sort of be non well it would have to
have some sort of non malleability so
these are like two prominent
applications of Nam al equipment and
numerous others have been also
discovered since 91 so I mentioned sort
of secure auctions also you can using
non malleable commitment get a lot of
other non malleable primitives like zero
knowledge or coin flipping and then like
other applications also have been found
I list them here ok so before I move on
I want to like motivate a little bit
further the definition of
non-availability and I want to do so by
arguing that it's really just that like
analog of semantic security but against
this active sort of adversarial channel
ok and if you think about it semantic
security
considers the setting where the you know
see wants to send a message to our and
the adversary is the channel and he's
going to eavesdrop on what they're
sending okay so this is sort of like a
semi honest man in the middle who's just
going to receive a like you know
commitment to encryption or whatever and
is just going to forward it and we want
the man in the middle can't sort of know
what what is on the channel all right
and and non malleability is sort of the
same idea except now the adversary like
the channel is hostile and he can
actually change the message or you know
overwrite the message or just like not
send the message and so you're sort of
like at least de loved or Cano or they
were sort of asking what kind of
security can we hope to achieve in this
like much more hostile model okay and so
from this point of view you know you can
ask also the question like why did it
take so long so semantic security was in
82 and like 10 years later only 10 years
later that's like very natural
generalization came up yeah eventually
the committee will open right and you
could you could make the definition
weaker SP by asking the matter if it
would also yeah so actually there there
are numerous like different variants of
this definition so it's mostly motivated
by their applications so they'll give a
different definition and show that it
also applies to non out to npc and so
what you're talking about is called non
malleable not malleability with respect
to decommitment where the man in the
middle is allowed to you know he doesn't
have to know what he's committing to but
he has to be able to open it if given
the opening on the left so here it's
even stronger we're saying we're not
even requiring him at all to open it he
sort of gets this like oracle decryption
or whatever query that betters gonna
tell him what he commits to okay yeah
yeah in fact usually it will be
interactive I'll say more about like how
many rounds and stuff but yeah so the
ordinary commitments that we were using
before just the like perfectly binding
not attractive those are not attractive
but yeah not malleable will require some
interaction um okay so sort of back to
this question why did it take so long
like why did what had to happen in
between semantic security and non
malleability and the answer
is um just look I'm asking why did it
take so long to define the malleability
or two yeah like you know why did it not
appear until later and I think the
answer is that just the crypto in the
early eighties wasn't really equipped to
handle proving on malleability they
didn't have the machinery involved it
really took like the development of zero
knowledge proofs of knowledge and on
attractive zero knowledge in order to
construct the scheme that you could
prove was not malleable and this sort of
in 1991 to loved workin or came up with
a really nice idea that you know how do
you prove non malleability well you
force em to demonstrate knowledge of
what he's committing to okay so if you
look at this picture sort of the idea is
that if men in the middle knows M tilde
then it can't depend on em right because
that's just hiding it so if he knows I'm
tilde then um the hiding of the
commitment scheme says that it can't
depend on M which is computationally
hidden from him ok and so dou loved
workin or say that if you want to prove
not malleability you have to give an
extractor that will extract M tilde okay
so so sort of for this reason all of the
non malleability my malleable
commitments games in the literature they
look like this they're really just fancy
extractable commitment schemes you know
they you know they're like more
complicated versions and you can throw
some stuff in but really it's like sort
of a commitment at the beginning and
then a bunch of query answer query
answer and sort of you have to show that
you can extract from the right okay but
there's like a cat so normal normal
extractable commitment you just sort of
rewind you ask another query you get
another answer and then you're like okay
now you know we had we we know what he
was committing to we've extracted okay
here it's different because there are
two protocols and so before he's going
to give you an answer he's going to ask
a query of his own and you don't know
how to answer it okay because you don't
have knowledge of em right we're trying
to argue that the man in the middle
knows what he's committing to
independently of what's on the left
right so if our extractor is you know
Eric's tractor has to be able to extract
M tilde without using knowledge of em
okay that's like really important to not
a liability so you have to do in order
to build nan malleable commitment is you
have to build
an extractable commitment that's able to
sort of extract even though you're
answering with this like bogus query or
you're answering this query on the left
with this bogus response okay that makes
sense so again to prove not malleability
we need to extract and moreover we need
to extract from the right without using
knowledge on the left okay that's like
the entire problem in a nutshell and
sort of i'll show you probably work in a
minute but all the prior work on non
malibu equipment is really like more and
more efficient solutions to this problem
okay and efficient in one way i'm
talking ground complexity so maybe it's
not like immediately obvious but you
know hopefully you could imagine at
least that this problem gets easier to
solve if you have more and more rounds
with which to like ask a question and
get an answer yeah yes i'll say in a sec
yeah there's a lower bound um yeah i
mean you've just a low I'm syntactic
apartment yeah copy wait W yeah okay
okay so yeah um okay so yeah it goes
back to the GN it's sort of like not
something I want to talk about too long
much but that main idea is that so
ordinary non malleability says the men
in the middle can either copy he can act
as a channel or he can do anything else
and if he does anything else then he
can't get something dependent so sort of
his behavior dichotomize 'as into like
either he's copying and so it's just
like you can't like that's not in the
valid attack or he's doing anything else
and then it's like you can defend
against it and there are ways to sort of
you know you have this notion of like
identities and stuff and that comes out
of this idea so usually an identity is
maybe like a verification key for a
signature and so you're you're going to
in addition to committing with your own
identity you're going to sign and so now
either he has to copy exactly Jorge has
to like forge a signature so usually you
build in the identity of the committee
using this sort of I don't know using
some additional stuff but but yeah it's
like I would say just let's not worry
about the copying man in the middle
because I mean he's semi honest anyway
and that's like semantic security so
okay okay so prior work is like more and
more efficient in terms of rounds
solutions to this problem so
oh here's the prior work 1991 to lab to
work on our amazing paper define that
malleable commitment along with like a
lot of other stuff and they give a
protocol for it for a lot with
logarithmically many rounds yeah um so
yeah it's just like you have more
flexibility so a lot of these schemes
they play games with like the scheduling
of the rounds like corresponds to this
identity and so you can like you know as
long as the identities are different
there will be two rounds on the right
that sort of our yes that was the does
deliver that was ddn's idea like later
they sort of these the the identity
corresponds to like the challenge space
in like various parallel execution so
but so basically you can parallel eyes
this idea but you just have to be a
little more crafty so but still like the
number of rounds is like really
important because you really need I mean
sort of the premises like if well I'll
get to this later I mean it's really
like there's no like overarching answer
to question it's just like in literature
when you sit down and try to prove
something like it helps to have more
rounds by some magic right he's the
second and the third line of the left
you want anyone yeah the second with a
third liner yeah then you wouldn't have
to rewind you would have to do anything
on the left you just be able to extract
so that's one idea to do it but that
requires a lot of rounds if you want to
do like more you know concise you can
sort of paralyzed stuff and this is this
idea of like making the challenge space
where this query comes from much much
larger than the challenge space where
the set query comes from because then
the point is like this answer can't
possibly give them enough information to
give this answer that's like another
idea yeah so that's like the two slot
trick then you can paralyze it again if
you wanted yeah yeah lots of ideas and
these like things and I'll tell you
about them in the power work so indeed
en yeah this was the like
logarithmically many rounds they're
doing the scheduling trick using
identity then about ten years later
barrack and then again pass frozen rose
n give a constant round I'm our
commitment using collision miss and hash
and non black box simulation this is
like rocks idea and this was the two
slot check the longshore and then again
a few years later rachel lynn and rafael
pass and also biblical we all give
constant around
equipment from what my functions um no
so so no there's some prior work that I
think maybe Rachel and Rafaella says I'm
not positive but vittles is not neither
of them is and then yeah so there's a
follow-up work with like go I'll say in
a sec that gets the use MPC in the head
instead of sort of the zero knowledge
thing to get to get black box um you
know a few years ago r-fl pass gives a
lower bound he shows that actually three
rounds are required you can't have non
attractive or even to round on malleable
commitment so no it's like you can't
have a black box reduction to a
falsifiable assumption yeah yeah you
can't base the non malleability yeah
yeah so that yeah so random Oracle or
CRS you have non attractive solution so
it's fine okay so yeah this is plain
model so um then a few years ago in this
work with the pool and alone was then
and marguerite evolved we show had to
get for round not malleable commitment
from what my function and this is like
paralyzing everything as much as you can
and you have to do a bunch of work i'll
talk a bit about this because this will
really be our starting point for the 311
it's like a very well sited area lots of
really nice results so yeah it's like
like a rich history here okay so now i
want to talk about the foreground scheme
to sort of give an idea of how these
schemes work what you have to prove what
you have to like into it and then we'll
go from there to try it like see if we
can shave off you know go to three
rounds okay so this is not the scheme
this is like sort of the main sub
component of the foreground scheme from
grv and the committee has a message m
it's a field element that he wants to
commit to so he chooses like a random
other field element and he commits to
them both he sends comin to em and
commitment s and then the query is just
a field a line a random field element
okay and he responds with this like
random no sorry with this linear sort of
evaluation this linear form it's a
equals like the random value committed
to x alpha plus the message and then he
proves ins your knowledge that he
answered correctly
M is the message s is random oh just
some random this young ok so again this
is like I'll show you in a minute just
to give an idea of sort of what types of
tax attacks show up in the metal chrome
vent anat actually i'll show you right
now so there's an attack on this
protocol this is not none malleable but
it's sort of like the main sub component
of this scheme i'll show you how to
we'll talk about it so here's an attack
very easy attack so um yeah yeah so it's
certainly a commitment it's hiding by
the like zero knowledge yeah so if you
want you can paralyze this you can use
the fact that zero knowledge sometimes
the theorem doesn't have to be known to
the last message and you can put it all
into four rounds um yeah so yeah you can
paralyze this if you want okay so so an
attack the men that will receive some
come into em come him to s and he malls
he you know this underlying commitment
scheme is malleable so he on the right
produces commitment n plus 1 and he just
copies over Kemet ass ok now he's asked
for a query alpha tilde so he like
copies it and he gets a response a and
then like what does he do what's the
what's the answer yeah ok and amala
journals proof no problem it's all
everything's malleable and now he's done
it he's done this attack that we said in
the first slide where like he's good
he's gotten an attack to am sorry i
could have been to am on the left and
he's produced on the right equipment to
n plus 1 yeah yeah you're right you're
right thanks uh yeah there and i was
proofing offshore still malas even
though you don't know just a plus yeah
it has no non malleable guarantees so
like why not I mean unless you want to
assume it's a not malleable like it's
not necessarily so easy for him to do
that but you can't rule it out unless
you have some time malleable guarantees
on the chair knowledge like a commitment
of knowledge would not be it will
necessarily be non malleable but zero
knowledge proof of knowledge is not
necessary um I mean I'm not sure that
that uh that extraction is going to help
you because if you you know you're
really just extracting from yourself and
your wine you ask my query
can ask you a query you answer you need
to sort of somehow get around that okay
so so okay again this is like the main
building block of the scheme so sort of
its I don't want to go too into it
because it's not the point of this talk
buts prevent this attack what we do is
we sort of run and parallel executions
of this mini component and we vary the
challenge space sizes in order to
prevent this sort of direct attack so
what I mean by that sort of like instead
of drawing alpha tilde from randomly
from the field you draw randomly from a
subset proper subset of the field and
now the idea is that if the like size of
the subset you're allowed to use here is
much larger than the allowed sides
you're allowed to use here he's not
gonna be able to like do this sort of
copying type attack where he takes your
query engine copies it over um yeah it's
not a subgroup there are these like
fixed known subsets if you want you can
do subgroup but I don't think it helps
and then yeah you so those are fixed
those are like public and then yeah he
just draws randomly from that subset and
the idea is that because using these
identities you can sort of very the
sizes in such a way so that they're
going to be places on the right where
the challenge space is much bigger than
on the left okay so why am I telling you
this I'm sort of getting to one main
idea sort of what you've done here is
you've just blown up your protocol like
now it's much more complicated and now
there are like maybe many more types of
mauling that the adversary could do okay
so just because we've prevented this
like direct attack doesn't necessarily
mean it's not malleable ok and so
actually most of the work in grv goes
into proving this sort of independence
lemma which says that if you set up your
sort of parallel executions properly
then there's no other like behavior the
man in the middle can do except to try
to do this direct attack okay and this
is sort of independents lemma will
mention maybe at the end like it will
come up later it's sort of used in some
other ways in these three rounds schemes
yeah in each one yeah tease that there
exists a repetition with the right hand
side subset is larger yeah and so then
the point becomes like okay so maybe
there's one on the right that's larger
but maybe he is going to use like half
of that subset for this one and the
other half for this other thing and then
you sure you can't do that that's sort
of uh I don't know like yeah that's most
of the work that's this independence
Lama basically okay so now I want to
talk so there are like two sides of this
non valuable commitment coin there's
like the intuition where you have to
think about like whether your scheme is
like has these attacks you know whether
there's like an actual explicit attack
on your scheme and then you also have to
like once you decide there isn't one
once you pass the simba check you have
to actually prove you have to build an
extractor okay you have to actually
prove that your thing is malleable by
constructing an extractor okay so I want
to show you the extractor here because
sort of the extraction ideas also will
be there an hour 3 on scheme so okay so
how do you extract so maybe is the thing
you'd come up with if you thought for a
little bit the extractor is going to
rewind ask another query alpha tilde
Prime okay and then there's going to be
a query alpha prime on the left which is
going to answer just randomly okay he
doesn't know em but no problem he just
sends a random answer and the man in the
middle can't tell because that would
break hiding so you send a random answer
and you get a response a tilde Prime on
the right ok now you sort of have two
points and two unknowns you can sort of
solve the system and recover M tilde you
can extract the problem is that you have
no guarantee that a tilde prime is
correct are you have a zero knowledge
proof which proves a tilt is correct you
have no guarantees they told the prime
is correct okay so you might extract the
wrong value so no problem this is like
this idea is used a lot in this
extraction type of protocols you just do
it again right you ask another query get
another query respond with random now
you have like an over constraint system
you have three equations two unknowns
you check if it's consistent and if it
is you deem that it's correct okay so
you have this sort of consistency check
which namely is are the three points
that I have consistent with the same two
unknowns are they colinear
uh not exactly this collinearity idea
was pretty like new and stuff but yeah
the same re rewinding to rewind news
yeah like you have to build a check-in
somehow sometimes you usually what you
would do is add more rounds and so you
have some other thing that comes later
to verify with and that's sort of like
easier but you don't act so yeah I guess
one of the main ideas was you don't
actually have to do that you can use
collinearity beber winding twice and
checking that's fine and you have to
prove that this thing like actually
works but it does it's no problem okay
and then this extractor is going to work
with non-negligible non-negligible
probability so you can amplify it many
times if you want high probability and
this is the extractor yeah possible so
that's the independence limit so show
sort of this independence limit that
there's nothing he can do except like
mall them directly that yeah you really
need to that's an independence lemma so
it's okay good question so how does the
proof go so the extractor is just sort
of the starting point now you have to
show that this extractor works and so
the what you do is you like say ok
suppose it doesn't work then that means
that there's going to be sort of a man
in the middle who isn't answering on the
right correctly even like when you're
given randomness alright but he's he is
answering on the right correctly when
you're giving him correct answers so he
can sort of tell and so you have to use
such a man in the middle to break hiding
and you really have to get in there and
sort of argue like look at the waves he
can actually mall he can actually like
what are the ways that this query can
depend on this query or this set of
queries on this set of queries and so
that like just all over the place you're
using the fact that these queries are
like alternately large and small and
side yeah like different reduction to
hiding or whether what happened to
defeat ok so you're asking what happens
if he's never going to answer correctly
on the right he's only answer
incorrectly on the right if you're
giving him correct answers on the left
you give him random he gives you abandon
so yeah you have to you have to use such
a man-in-the-middle to break hiding and
you have to go through a bunch of
different types of cases so you look ok
so I don't like this is getting into the
geography paper not really what I'm
talking about but yeah you have to like
study the different ways these
challenges can depend or sorry these
challenges can depend on
these challenges and then you argued
that sort of anyway he wants to do it to
like line up these challenges with these
challenges he's not going to be able to
because like the challenge space sizes
over here are two different for him to
use over here and so then you sort of
you get to the point where he's just
breaking hiding like he was just
answering you correctly if you give them
correct and then correctly if you give
them incorrect and you can just break
hiding this is just something to prove I
mean though the consistency test is you
need to consistently test somewhere in
your extractor and so what previous
protocols did is they had more rounds
and you just compared with like a later
round yeah this is so you said repeat
something in parallel in time this is
one instance of one instance yeah I see
but the extractor you're going to do it
all at once so you just do it all at
once NC yeah um ok so i want to i want
to bring our attention here to a
question ok because this is really
getting to like what's stopping us we're
just getting three rounds so what's the
what's the role of zero knowledge here
yeah yeah under one we function what no
under any okay so it says if you have a
protocol who's like non malleability you
can think of that it's like a reduction
from an adversary breaks my malleability
to an assumption if you have like such a
setup and the reduction is black box
then it's not a hard assumption you can
just break the assumption under any fuss
fun any falsifiable sumption yeah ok sir
yeah you do your result is under one-way
functions one way permutations cuz we
need not attractive commitment yeah
maybe even actually 1121 or my function
surfing I don't know whatever if suffice
if you're willing to reality rely on you
know cause resistant or even lwe so
what's known I mean how much is the
lower bound would apply for any false
Bible assumption there's like four
messages it easy
I see so so all these so we're sort of
doing the like generic constructions
here so if you want to start from a
criminal scheme which you can build from
moment from like lwe then you can get
this like we're not we're not going
through well w/e i'm not sure that
there's any benefit was it an easier
question okay you know all these
construction on Mellie welcome yeah very
complex you really yeah yeah all this
thing that I'm just asking it's all this
complicated thing is it to get like this
whole grail of one-way function or like
under all w/e or something or is it
three easy I see no so um I don't know
that you're gonna be able to do much
better like from dd8 for example you can
do some of this stuff that's like a
little bit faster using these like sewer
type of protocols but I don't think that
you could get three rounds even like at
the end of the day you have to extract
right and so you have to be able to
prove that when you answer with
randomness here he's going to answer
with mandamus here and I think so if
there wasn't really a way to do that
before without using zero knowledge like
if you're not using zero knowledge
wisdom from any holds five blossoms yeah
yeah from that before oh yeah except for
like yeah in the plane model like crst
could do it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
that's true the first yeah yeah protocol
interpreter cleats black box reduction
covered by ruffles a little boundaries
no so his black pot his reduction it's
okay there's like two like one is the
proof of security which uses that non
black locks the proof of that sorry nan
black box use of yeah so i'm not sure
that his would be covered by the
Backhouse thing if you want to use the
crypto primitive in the non black box
way that won't help you but if you wanna
use the adversary in on black box way I
think that might get around us yeah so
you think there could still be a drill
on volleyball come to wherever you are
noble yeah you use the adversary yes
yeah yeah yeah but if they ever say
computes like one-way function that's
you can't then you can't even use the
episode then when you be using the 1i
function on
fine that's another way to I mean dumb
not black books and everything yet and
if you want to do it if you wonder if
you want to do it it's uh I'm not sure
this intuition sound because I haven't
really thought about that direction too
much but it seems to me like really it's
an issue of extraction so a lot of these
sort of other problems that may be our
heart like I don't know extractable zero
knowledge and under four rounds or
something you might need to look at
those and show how you can like extract
even though you don't have something to
rewind and then use so it's like it
seems like that that's sort of the issue
that you need to get around okay um okay
so question what's the role of zero
knowledge here so how important is zero
knowledge right you need four rounds for
like zero knowledge most of the time if
you want to have a black box proof of
security so if you want to get through
your number will commitment you can't
use your own knowledge okay so how
important is zero knowledge here so in
particular so what does your knowledge
doing here it's just proving correctness
of a tilde and that's like allowing your
extraction to succeed but my question is
like how important is that um so what so
maybe you have some you have an
extractor that will sometimes extract
the wrong value is that really like is
there an explicit attack on this scheme
if you remove the zero knowledge so like
this scheme okay so i want to show you
an attack this was sort of the starting
point for 3 10 ml equipment and there's
like an explicit very easy attack and i
think it represents a lot of the
struggle for three round metal
commitment okay different attack myself
before so wasn't them a middle two he
receives equipment to em come into s and
he produces on the right equipment M
tilde and he copies the commitment to em
over to where the Quintessa told it
should be okay and then he's asked a
query on the right and he just ignores
the left and he answers with five times
alpha tilde plus M tilde okay so what
has he done he's basically just guessed
that M equals five and at em equals five
he's produced a valid commitment to M
tilde if M equals not five then he's
bought okay and so this attack is like
pretty explicit it's not something that
you want right especially if like the
message space is gonna be small this
would be like really bad and it's also
like no amount of this parallel petition
is going to like ever prevent this
yeah yeah okay and this attack so it's
sort of more general like you can like
phrase it this way it's real simple but
it's actually a general sort of attack
it's going to be possible anytime the
men in the Middle's message is specified
fully specified after the first round
right because you don't have to just
copy over the message you can like any
sort of function you want to compute
inside the commitment you can't rule out
unless you're assuming that malleability
so if the if the commitment is defined
even information theoretically in the
first message then he can just like
compute it and then put it inside the
commitment and guess that that
commitment equals like I've and the same
attack okay okay so like what's the
point so the point is that zero
knowledge rules this out these are
called selective bot attacks and these
are the attacks the hardest ones to stop
and three around not Mel equipment and
just sort of to like underscore the role
of zero knowledge zero knowledge
completely rules out this attack because
it makes sort of the condition of
whether or not the man in the middle is
committing to bots or committing to
valid efficiently verifiable efficiently
testable okay so in particular whether
he is committing to buy or not it can't
depend on em right because I'll break
hiding because you can just verify as
proof and if it's like if this spot or
not bought depends on this message then
you're going to break hiding okay and so
as a result these attacks are completely
not addressed in the non novel command
literature because you're always having
more than four rounds so you always have
zero knowledge so it's no problem you
don't have to deal with these attacks
nice properties right yeah i think if
you have 310 knowledge then you could
just use your knowledge and sort of the
fun so people like three round normal
commitment cause it's like a concrete
thing for me sort of the fun part of
this like project is doing it without
zero knowledge because like i don't know
if your knowledge is often the most
computationally expensive and whatever
and like it's not clear that you need it
but it's like pretty useful so getting
through three getting non-viable
equipment at all without zero knowledge
is like um this is sort of the first
time
okay so yeah the point if you have more
than four rounds just use zero knowledge
which is why no one considered it before
it but if you want three rounds you have
to do it you have to deal with these
attacks because you don't have your
knowledge at least you don't have like
the sort of black box zero knowledge
that we're all used to okay so if the
rest of this talk I'm gonna talk about
how to get around this problem three run
FML equipment we're going to use no
malleable codes sort of not in place of
but like I guess instead of or whatever
zero knowledge yeah because sort of
black box just means like you're proving
stuff about these crypto gadgets in the
zero knowledge and if you don't have
your knowledge than yeah it's black box
which means more efficient I suppose
okay not malleable codes really nice
really recent primitives from a paper in
2010 with some Basquiat chicken wicks um
what are they so uh you know numerous
ways well I've heard different people
defined of different ways i like to
think about them i guess as just
generalizations of error correcting
codes and but sort of you have to look
at our correcting codes in the right way
so what do I mean so anytime you have a
code and you have some sort of tampering
that you're trying to defend against you
can consider the tampering experiment
namely we're like you take your message
this is going to be specified by a
message and the tampering function
you're going to take your message you're
going to encode it to see you're going
to tamper it to see tilde which is this
f of c and then you decode it to em
tilde and then you out put them tilde
okay and sort of like you can think of
like different types of codes as just
being like different requirements on the
output of this distribution and if you
want to talk about error correcting
codes then the tampering functions
you're worried about like the code words
are just like I guess vectors and the
tampering that you're worried about is
when you can sort of arbitrarily change
a small fraction of the code words are
the symbols in our correction codes
you're requiring that M tilde equals M
like you're actually correcting the
errors okay nan malleable codes are sort
of it's like a trade-off they're saying
okay we're willing to not exactly
correct errors but we want to be able to
deal with much more like hostile types
of tampering okay so they look at the
same tampering experiment and their
intuitive requirement is just that
either F is copying in which case you
have until the equals n so like it have
does nothing or if F does like really
simple things that don't change anything
then
and until equals in or otherwise M tilde
is independent of them sort of classic
non-valuables style okay so to formally
define this you say that a code is
epsilon not malleable against a
particular tampering distribution if
sort of for all messages and functions
from that family the the tamper
distribution which is that sort of
distribution and experiment on the top
is simulated all so what i mean by
simulated well I mean it's simulated
without the knowledge of the message so
there exists a distribution s that it
depends only on the function and its
distribution on M or same okay so
there's going to output like M tilde or
it's going to help put same in the case
when the function is not doing anything
okay you want there to exist a
distribution such that for all M the
statistical difference with distance
between the tamper distribution and the
sort of induced simulated distribution
is less than epsilon where the induced
simulated distribution is just draw em
tilde from the simulated distribution
and if it's same output m okay so it
looks a little nasty but it's really
intuitive I think and it makes a lot of
sense it's saying okay either you're
copying or you're doing something
independent okay so if you're copying
then your your your simulated
distribution is going to output same
okay so if you're copying this like
induced distribution is just going to
take the same and put it to em that
means you're copying this M okay or
otherwise if you're not outputting same
then it was sort of simulate able
without knowledge of the message so it
doesn't depend on your message
yeah exactly for every message
distribution what is it for every
function at oh yeah yeah so the
simulator is going to depend on the
function so it's a new distribution for
each one and the point is that it
simulates all of these tampering
distributions like for every app the
whole family of tampering distributions
as M various okay anyway so there you
know lots of work on malleable codes
many in particular many different sort
of families of temper functions have
been considered in this work we're going
to use the split state not malleable
codes and this is the one where the
tampering function are split state
functions namely sort of you encode your
message m into two states l and r and
then you can temper those two states
with functions F and G you can temper
them however you want as long as f and g
act independently on the states ok and
this is like a strong sort of uh oops
sorry type of nonmetal code lots of
recent work really exciting recent work
has been done on this particular model
of tampering functions and yeah so you
know and these proofs are difficult so
using them as sort of like using a big
hammer so um you know it's not it you
know if you want to like big result you
might have to use a big hammer somewhere
this is sort of a big hammer that we're
using I think yeah yeah it's definitely
like information theoretic these are not
crypto yeah ok um ok so in particular
we're going to use the split state not
malleable code of agarwal torjussen love
it from a couple years ago and so I want
to spend the slide talking about it for
a little bit so the code is sort of
splits it's like two different
components there's the main component
which is really just the inner product
so if you want to encode a field element
em you pick like two vectors whose inner
product is M and that's L&amp;amp;R that's your
code word and so then if you want a
decode it's just in a product ok so this
is not not malleable I don't want to say
that this is not malleable in particular
you can Mull it pretty easily with some
linear functions f ng however it has
like pretty strong non malleable
properties and this is what they show
they show basically that sort of if you
want them all this code with
Angie an FNG aren't linear then you're
not going to get then you're just gonna
get random it just gonna be independent
of your message essentially okay so
basically the inner product code sort of
reduces to the case when F and G are
linear functions and then the so the
second component is this a fine evasive
component which protects against linear
F and G and I'm not gonna talk about the
second component the reason we're using
this code is because it's sort of so
simple it's just the inner product I
mean it's not simple to analyze but it's
just the inner product it's really sort
of like I guess I'm minimal to like the
various manipulations and strengthening
that we needed so it's not clear that
this hour like work needs to use this
ADL code it might work it could probably
be made to work on sort of the more we
sent more complicated ones but i'm not
sure we haven't looked at it and yeah
might just be better to wait till like
someone figures out like a you know
someone improves all these more
complicated ones with like a less
complicated one and then to use that
yeah yeah yeahs can protect against
split state it's a non valuable split
state code so it can protect against any
to any like tampering function f ng that
acts independently on the states no no
all information theoretic yeah ok so ok
we've done all the like building now I'm
going to show you a five round nine mile
equipment using malleable codes is going
to like I think get to the point of
maybe half of the idea is required to do
three round and then i'll show you
theorem yeah movement in the actual
implementation yeah yeah yeahs in
particular like previous nominal will
come in really needed to like amplify
they'd had many different parallel
things and they had to amplify sort of
they had to prove you know many
different parallel executions are the
same thing and we don't need that so
this vibrant scheme although it's
actually not not malleable I'll tell you
why it's sort of a cheat but I'm just
yeah we'll deal with all the issues but
this this scheme you wouldn't want to
implement and like used for MPC because
in particular they're scheduling issues
if the men in the middle chooses to
schedule the messages differently
than just the synchronizing one where he
plays left right right left left right
then you'll be in trouble with the
schemes this is the malian synchronizing
adversaries it's not my malleable
against like non synchronizing ok so the
sort of the high-level plan we're going
to do we're going to do this protocol
which is not malleable against
synchronizing we're going to shorten it
to three rounds still malleable again
synchronizing and then we'll give you a
full not malleable kinda team three
rounds okay so let Hank deck vs would
state nonmetal code will actually need
some more properties from it but we'll
see what those are if they arise sort of
naturally so I won't tell you now what
they are ok and the scheme yeah we will
construct what we need by building on
this ADL code the scheme um looks like
this it's you know the committer has a
message m he wants to commit to it he
draws he encodes it he gets L&amp;amp;R he
realizes l as a field element just like
you know embedding it in some field and
then he draws another random element to
that field and he commits to them both
ok and then there's like this query
there's this response ok then there's
this acknowledgement message that I
received your response yeah yeah l is a
vector / zp so we're just going to
realize that whole vector space has
another inside some other field um we
acknowledge the receipt of this response
and then we send our okay and um just
sort of whenever you see act messages in
like a commitment protocol they're
cheating in this way this this act is
explicitly to make sure that the men in
the middle has to send his response I
tilde before he receives are on the left
and so in particular like he can break
this with scheduling if he wants to
schedule the left to come before he can
break this thing okay so this is like a
cheat but still yeah so okay the tags
are used because your message m here is
actually your commitment concatenated
with your ident but you don't need to go
to tags at all you just have an identity
which was like a verification here yeah
yeah then this L
yeah so we're just taking this string or
vector or whatever and we're just like
realizing it by embedding it into some
field not algebraic at all it's just
viewing it as a field element and then
we like secret share it we draw another
element of the field then we released
one polynomial evaluation like one layer
all yours yeah so okay good okay so how
do we prove that there's not malleable
so um okay so yeah yeahs is because you
can take your your iphone query that
you've got and you can forward it that's
one attack yeah that's one attack but
you can assume that the I for queries
that you allow independent the first
message so you can't just forward Aleph
I it's not though the person I mean wait
wait wait so you want to do this like um
you want to make it non-interactive by
having the query alpha depend on the
first message and put them all in
parallel even even at a month at those
it's going to be interactive but I'm not
going to allow you not every answer is
admissible and in depth so after that
I'd miss won't depend on the first
message um but the first message here is
a commitment so right yeah so that is a
lot of times what you do actually well
yeah so another way to generate these
identities is just a hash of the first
message if your message is defined there
then that's your identity but um I'm not
sure I understand your problem your
question so I guess I'm trying to like
it but I might think it doesn't it get
around all your so so the the problem
with what you're trying to do I think is
that if you restrict the challenge space
then you run into soundness issues where
the man in the middle can just abort you
can like choose a commitment and a board
if the challenge space would be like not
to his liking and so you're not you're
not there's not enough flexibility for
the honest receiver and so you might run
into like sort of attacks like that um
yeah but I'm not exactly sure what
you're proposing so i'm not sure like
had it yeah
okay so this is the scheme it's not
malleable so what's our plan how we
prove this right we have yeah frisking
did you don't know the German in the
Christmas oh I don't know if it's the
first such scheme I think it might not
be I think sort of its equivalent if you
want to just commit to some randomness
and then use that randomness come into
your message at the end it's probably
fine but but yeah notice that our
message is not defined in the first
message in particular because of that
attack where you can guess um okay so I
claim that this is not synchronizing
sorry any synchronizing then in the
middle who miles the commitment scheme
can be used to break the not malleable
malleability of the code okay so what's
our plan how are we going to prove it so
called previously we had to extract we
have to extract from the right without
using any knowledge of em on the left
okay and such an extractor was really a
reduction to hiding because what we're
saying is like if we can extract the man
in the Middle's message then he can't
distinguish the real in ideal world
without breaking right because if he's
given a view from either the real world
where he's got a commitment to M ideal
world words got to come in 20 he can
just extract his message and then use
the non malleability of distinguisher to
break hiding yeah very low strong yeah
in particular right so this sort of
selective like looking ahead of it the
Selective bot attack idea where he's
gonna like answer incorrectly sometimes
based on some other stuff that we're not
sure how to like analyze not gonna apply
here cuz if he answers incorrectly he's
just committing to buy independent of
what the messages on what yeah slowly
why this selected what you showed us
earlier that the water yeah so like
let's say right he wants to commit I
mean he has a decision here it does he
send the right answer or the wrong
answer so let's say he sends the wrong
answer it's not like that's fine but
it's not going to depend on what your
equipment is here because it hasn't even
been defined yet listen yeah the message
your commitment message your M I took it
out put the M that you've encoded with
this out
till the in a different way to depend on
the are so that when our our our
determines em the l2 and r2 the wait I
don't understand I agree that he cannot
he cannot do whatever you say other
images stop at that point yeah yeah yeah
yeah but uh maybe maybe he's carefully
he selected what he's doing the slack
little boy and he should chose out with
an art older somehow he can wait to
implement I'll do that ok so I think not
because here's what you can argue this
is sort of hot getting up the argument
um you say okay suppose like like we're
looking at what's the chance that the
men of the middle answers correctly here
and we say okay suppose it's small
suppose he doesn't answer correctly then
like he's not mauling you because he's
just always putting two BOTS sort of you
play let me let me move on I'll sort of
maybe it'll become a little bit more
clear um but yeah I want to talk high
level of how we're going to prove it and
then i'll show you how how we're going
to prove it and then maybe we'll become
clear at that point so okay um recall
previously you had to extract on the
right without using information your
knowledge of the left em on the left
okay here we're doing a different plan
right we're using a non malleable codes
so what we're going to do is we're going
to build 2x tractors and F and the G
okay and then sort of we're going to
have to argue that these f and this G
together are going to extract L tilde
and our tilde which determines this
message okay in the benefit of doing
this is that f is allowed to use L right
on the left and g is allowed to use our
you're just not allowed to use them both
okay so that's the benefit of using I
Melville codes you get to break your
extractor into half sort of and you use
half of the extractor which has half of
the information from the left and the
other half of the extractor has the
other half of information from the left
and as long as sort of you can keep
everything straight it's going to be
you're going to you're going to
basically be able to reduce the men in
the middle who malls to tampering
functions that break your code yeah
from the a buzzer is closed chapter from
the extract you're tampering functions
are the extractor basically and they're
gonna run the man in the middle as like
a sub protocol so the F&amp;amp;G here actually
would fit on the air flow theory though
yeah yeah they're gonna run the
adversary okay so how do we define up in
G sorry how do you define F and G well
they're extractors right they have to
sort of get some transcript and then
rewind and extract so they're going to
get this first bit of the transcript ok
and then so then f is going to rewind
he's gonna send another query he's going
to answer his query on the left and then
he's gonna get another query on the
right notice he's actually able now to
answer on the left because he knows l
and he knows this like first query the
blue alpha a so using like so here I say
it here sort of using the point he gets
as input in his blue transcript and his
knowledge of L he's able to actually
answer correctly and so you don't have
to go through this whole like exhausting
work of arguing that even if you answer
incorrectly on the left he was still
gonna answer correctly on the right
because you can just answer correctly on
the left using a lil correctly vixen s
at random love no so he receives he the
f receives as input sort of has
randomness this tau and then he just
goes back and instead of sending this
message he sends green alpha tilde Prime
and he runs the men in the middle to
receive an alpha prime he answers he
went in the middle to receive this and
now he sort of has two points two
unknowns he extracts all tilde I didn't
write that but it's there um yeah yeah
I'm sure the depressor jeez yeah but so
here's their writing something that
actually depends on up yeah exactly so G
exactly G is actually gonna get as input
this transcript which actually has a
commitment to a Lynette even if also has
a yeah yeah that's true I was allowed to
have epsilon to have also that's maybe a
little bit more like non-offensive where
can we find it that's dual f creates
this commitment wait ah ok because she
isn't allowed to get that commitment
you have to force F and G to extract
from the same transcript you can't like
have F extract from this one and do you
extract from this one and then hope to
argue that like somehow you got lucky
and they're like going to put together
to be the actual men in the Middle's
commitment right we want to use the men
in the middle who models this commitment
scheme to argue that f ng are going to
actually mall this code you can't do
that unless they're extracting from the
same transcript yeah commitments to l or
just some focus 0 know so now right now
it's equipment to l and 2s and it's also
this message so it's the whole first
line and it has actually L inside of it
and what we're getting ready to do right
is because F and G both are just going
to receive this tau from the outside
what we're getting ready to do is we're
going to say okay number one if it
receives this honest towel like in this
way it's going to actually mall your
code not a contradiction because it's
not split state but them's gonna begin
distinguishable from actual split state
and so therefore it must still mall okay
okay so so G is really easy right it
just sends or receives our tilt it goes
sort of further down and extract from
the second half okay and yeah you're
saying I know alpha a day thank you go
cute okay good because I know I'll yeah
dude this correction yeah okay so so I
guess the point is right that okay so
this is how you define F and G you have
to now prove non a liability and they're
going to be three different steps and
they're like sort of the same three
steps will use them again and we have
time I'm clear um okay that's the claim
and these are the three steps okay the
first step is you have to argue that um
that if the men in the middle malls then
these f ng are going to extract
correctly okay and this is getting too
what Jack was saying where if he's
mulling I claim if he's mulling he has
to be answering a tilde correctly
because if he's not if you just get a
transcript towel that has a bogus a
tilde here then because your message
hasn't even been defined it's going to
be a commitment to bot no matter what
message you later decide to commit to
I mean that a tilde is actually equal to
alpha tilde s tilde plus L tilde right
that's what we were proving into your
knowledge before so that's sort of the
the main difficulty is like arguing that
even though we're not proving in zero
knowledge that's correct we're not
worried about this situation where it's
like incorrect okay and that's just
because like the whole the message
hasn't even been defined yet okay so
step one argue that f ng are extracting
correctly okay and so yeah so I'm sort
of claiming here that if the man in the
middle is mulling then he's answering
correctly at least with some
non-negligible probability because
otherwise he's just with high
probability committing to bot
independent of the message yeah ah okay
yeah so what you can argue ah because
okay so what you what you actually show
is that like the so if he's answering a
tilde correctly then it's really
unlikely that he's like you know that it
was like really lucky and that he's
every other query he's answering
incorrectly so you use this like
bayesian argument to say that if he's
answering a tilde correctly then with
also with non-negative probability he'll
answer a tilde prime correctly so this
is with non nigel probability this is
not like I'm not claiming that he's
always doing this yeah can I think of
this is I mean it's interesting only if
the adversity gives non-negligible
probability to correctly tilde otherwise
otherwise it's bar independent of your
message he's not morning well otherwise
he can't open um no but he's he's
committing to bond yeah he can't open
but he so this is a perfectly binding
commitment scheme the commitment is
going to be bought if he answered
incorrectly so like what would he be
committing to
what is he committing to what's its
commitment so it's either like L told
decoded L tilden are tilde or it's just
pot if the answer drunk great so he
can't open not only can he not open if
he does open he's gonna get bought like
we don't need him to open my clip my
with him what a misunderstanding is the
guy on the right yeah when he receives a
incorrect a tilde and a prime tilde yeah
he doesn't already know that it's but
yeah but it doesn't matter sort of all
we need is that with non-negligible
probability it's not bad he got kirkuk
rank at this point detected its but it's
just right in the future it's you'll
never be able to open it yeah thing
other than but exactly and so the point
is that like the probability we're
talking about non-negligible is over tau
so it's over the functions with non
malleable codes you only need to show
there exists one function we're sort of
showing that oh there's actually a
non-negligible fraction of functions
that it's gonna do okay so um step two
is you have to use an M who's Molly so f
ng extracts correctly meaning they
actually extract his message you now
have to use the men in the middle who's
mulling to argue that F and G are
mulling and this is like not so easy but
you can do it I'll talk about it on the
next slide and then the last part is
this hybrid argument to get from this
non split state F and G which mall your
code indistinguishable indistinguishably
to this f prime n G prime which are
split state and then still by the hiding
will still mall your code and this uses
just the hiding the fact that like L is
computationally hidden in town yeah you
still need to check the F&amp;amp;G are
completely independent right non trivial
to argue because sort of G follow
sequentially from Earth um well I'm
defining G in this way wait I don't
understand what do you mean you to get
to argue to use normal normal ability of
the code you need to make sure the fng
occasion dependently yeah so okay so
that gets into bullet number two we're
not actually reducing it to the non
malleability to like normal non
malleability we need something like
alternate type of nominal ability which
we build on top of this eighth
thing and it's exactly this issue that
you're talking about so a slightly
they'd have to be they already partially
we find any substance yeah okay so this
is trying to prove my malleability going
from a men in the middle kamals to a
like temporary functions with mom okay
the hope we would hope that sort of an M
who is mulling right that implies
there's this distinguisher that we can
distinguish this real world and thus
ideal world we would hope that this
would just immediately give us like a
distinguisher d prime which would
distinguish tampering distribution with
n from the tamarack institution with
that Prime okay that's what we would
hope it doesn't quite work in particular
it's just like when you sort of unwrap
everything from what this like men in
the middle who's mauling gives you it
just doesn't give you the tampering
distribution it's not what you get so
what we have to do is define this sort
of alternative it's called conditional
augmented tampering distribution and
this is building on top of augmented to
anchoring distribution which was defined
in another work to sort of show that
like this is it's just a different
tampering distribution so it's a
different definition of non malleable
code okay and so I'm going to write down
the tampering distribution but I don't
want to talk too much about it just
because it's a little technical and
that's maybe not so interesting but I'm
happy well anyway okay so it this
tampering distribution is going to be
specified by a message m a function and
also a left state okay and the way this
works is first you draw are so you draw
a you're sort of given this left state
and you draw an encoding are from that's
going to encode your message m given
this left state that you already picked
that was sort of drawn along with the
functions and this will tech is what
you're talking about you need so L
because it was sort of it's it's not
it's included in this tau it's actually
chosen at the same time as your defining
your functions normal non malleability L
is chosen honestly here for us it's
always the same L that's being chosen
and a fresh RS drawn because because L
is chosen at the same time that the
functions are defined okay so yeah you
uh you you encode and then you tamper
and then you decode a new output okay
but you also output you're you're you're
right state okay so okay note the
differences to differences one is that
you're outputting actually the right
state and not just the message M tilde
and this is because the men in the
middle
gets to see our arse like perfectly open
to him in as part of the view right so
the man in the middle and then the
distinguisher is going to be able to
make his decision not just based on M
tilde but also based on our the other
difference is that L is fixed once and
profits what I was saying okay so this
is like a different notion of non
malleable code yeah and again that's
because L is chosen it's specified in
town so it's chosen along with fng it's
not drawn naturally sort of freshly in
each execution of the temporal
distribution okay and so that's the
conditional augments a tamper
distribution the definition you say it's
conditional augmented not malleable if
sort of for all of the stuff that you're
given namely message tampering function
and this left state this sort of new
tampering distribution up here is going
to be simulated all okay and we have to
sort of statistical distance isn't the
notion that we want anymore we have to
use like no distinguisher can tell like
with high probability over L so L is
chosen sort of independently from this
distinguisher and we want these to not
do not be the same so anyway I guess the
point is that sort of we need this
alternate notion of non malleable codes
because it's really just sort of what
comes from a non malleable commit or who
walls okay and then you can build these
pretty using just sort of existing
statistical arguments from this ADL code
because it's so simple it's really just
the inner product and so in particular
the Augmented part which is the
outputting of our along with the message
that was already started in this recent
work at TCC and then this conditional on
top of it is sort of new to our work but
it's it's sort of like an existing
argument that was in the two source
extractor literature it's not so hard
yeah okay so I'm sort of getting to the
end so really quickly three-round ml
equipment so all we do is we squash we
like get rid of this technology message
and we put the are alongside the answer
a okay and this is going to pose like a
different set of problems if we have all
the old problems from the five around
scheme and we also have the new problem
which this poses
which is the following right we have
this extractor idea that we want to
extract we want to use that one over
wines send a new query yeah so we want
to sorry we want to use that one over
once and a new query but then in order
to like send an answer here we also have
to send r &amp;amp; F isn't allowed to know our
okay so this seems like we're stuck like
it seems like it's not going to work so
the idea is you give sort of in addition
to this like partial transcript you give
it like a random value of r to send that
sort of just a bogus value so they share
this bogus transcript and then f is
going to extract from this bogus
transcript G is going to extract from
the normal transcript but sort of check
consistency with the bogus transcript ok
and sort of this idea you have to do
some work in particular there's a new
property that you have to put into the
non malleable code and it's not so hard
so yeah maybe I'll just sort of run into
that new property that we need a lot of
time so ok so here I'm just defining F
and G like we did before f works exactly
the same right except it's going to
extract using this sort of bogus are
tilde that it has G is going to it's
just going to send a the 8th at it
receives in the transcripts along with
the real value of r it's going to get
some a tilde are tilde on the right and
it's going to check that sort of this is
the consistency check we're talking
about it has to check that the a tilde
it gets on the right is the same as the
eight so that you got on the right when
you sent the bogus are ok and that's
just to enforce that the like transcript
which f is extracting from is sort of
like equivalent to the transcript which
g is extracting from ok and right to
prove non malleability you need the same
three steps right two and three are
exactly the same as this five round
scheme and one now you have to show sort
of the correction correctness of
extraction piece of it is you have to
show that sort of the chance that a
tilde is correct this blue I tilde is
correct given that you answered using
this bogus value of r is is the same as
if you answered with this real are ok
so so I'm going to skip through most of
this let me see yeah okay so comes down
to this extra property of this code it's
like a semantic security type property
on the right state so what you want is
that for any two messages and with high
probability over L like the right state
coming from an encoding of m0 given that
L is like computationally
indistinguishable from a right State
coming from an encoding of the other
message with the same oh ok and this
yeah what the hell you ain't ah so we
have to use so we're going to take the
ADL scheme and we're going to build on
top of it really we're just going to put
some cryptography on the right-hand side
and that's going to happen out satisfy
this notion ok so um the way you do it
like we say sort of you just you draw a
key it's ok you're putting cryptography
on the right-hand side ok so you have
sort of x0 dex 0 is this information
theoretic conditionally augmented
non-volatile code and now you're going
to build on top of it this new not
malleable code what's it going to do
well it's going to like if it wants to
encode em it's going to draw this
encoding from the crypt of the
information theoretic version it's also
going to draw a key from us like
symmetric key encryption scheme and it's
just going to owe its dress some
randomness to for a commitment and then
it's going to set L to be l0 that you
got the key and this randomness that you
drew and on the right hand side you just
encrypt your message you're right state
and you commit to the key the commitment
to the key is like sort of just so we
can prove it again getting back to this
like intuition versus like actual things
you can prove it sometimes not so easy
to like prove stuff that you want but
you're able to actually prove this so ok
how do you decrypt so you sort of you
parse your state's you check consistency
namely you check that z is equal like
this commitment is actually equal to the
commitment of what you got on the left
side and then you output the underlying
decryption and you can show sort of
because of the properties of the
ography we put on the right hand side
this now immediately has the right state
simulate ability that's sort of use of
the show that it's still not malleable
it's actually hard you need to like go
through sort of the same high-level
steps to prove that the just entire
nominal equipment scheme is secure but
you can do it no no not not at all yeah
really you just need the commitment so
that like this right state can break it
open to get the key because the right
sort of again what you have to do is use
sort of you know you're gonna have to
turn sort of functions that mall this
outer code and two functions which mall
the inner code and it's not so what
you'd want to say is just decrypt this
thing and output it but you can't G
doesn't have the like what it needs to
decrypt unless the key is hidden for
them there you just call me yeah okay so
okay again what we've talked about is
only for the synchronizing scheme um the
sequential sex scheduling causes a few
problems again it's this notion that if
like the man in them if your whole
commitment on the left is defined by the
time he gets to send his first message
you can guess what it is and then like
create this pot attack so you have to
fix it and it's not so hard essentially
the idea is that if the scheme is
extractable forget even extractive on
this non malleable sense all right this
scheduling doesn't require any rewind to
any answering on the left so just make
it extractable by running in parallel
sort of this very basic extractable
scheme where what you're committing to
sort of the two shares x0 x1 are
actually shares of the decommitment of
the scheme from before and this will be
extractable problems that this poses
sort of unaesthetic like you have to
repeat it many times in order to amplify
soundness which means sort of you're
blowing up the complexity to deal with
this like really sort of stupid man in
the middle that's usually not so hard to
deal with so it's not so great also you
lose this bound to many many non
malleability so you have limited
applications to MPC not so great and so
there's this new work with vipul and
let's do new park and this is just like
the same thing but a better extractable
component in particular it's sort of
much better in the sense
that only one repetition was necessary
so you only have to use the underlying
scheme constant number of times also you
sort of retain these like found in many
many non malleability so you have
applications to npc and the proof is
like really hard sort of if you want to
make it so that he's not decommitting
everything breaks really horribly so you
need this like independence lemma and
you need like many new ideas to get this
to go through but yeah I won't talk
about them thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
