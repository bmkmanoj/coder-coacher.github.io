we are visualizing the stages of data
processing in temporal queries let's
take a look at this query which calls
clip of interation it shortens each
event to the next event with the same ID
when we click debug we see on the left
the query graph on the right the
timelines the graph shows that the user
session stream has the operation clip
event duration called on it in the
timeline we see individual events
hovering over an event shows as its
start time its end time and its payload
the data associated with it we also see
highlighted in black the provenance the
results of the process and operation
here we see that this first event was
clipped to the second but the second
wasn't clipped to the third inspecting
the metadata it turns out that this
third clip has ID equals 2 while the
first and second have ID equals 1 now
let's look at a more complex example
this is task B from the user study we're
trying to aggregate information in two
60-minute windows but looking at the
time stamps on the Left we see that
we're getting times that aren't in 60
minute intervals let's see what the
debugger shows it's easy to read from
the debugger that the query is
structured in two branches in one branch
we're calling a tumbling window lifetime
and then in aggregate that's what's
giving us the 60 minute windows on the
right but wait when we join them with
the other branch they're getting broken
up the other branch isn't in Windows
this must be where the strange times are
coming from let's fix this will move the
tumbling window lifetime call to before
the branch is separate now we see that
both branches and the results are in 60
minute intervals we've solved the
problem this is how stream trace allows
us to visualize the stages of data
processing in temporal queries</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
