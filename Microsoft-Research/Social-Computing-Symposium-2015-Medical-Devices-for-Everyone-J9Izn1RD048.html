you
so in addition to hardware devices
proliferating there are a ton of medical
devices and so Brad it's really at the
forefront of this when he was in the
army he used to train their surgeons and
advanced imaging techniques and
supervised basically how army surgeons
would learn and now that he's civilian
he's an ER doctor and helping design
mobile ultrasounds and he took all these
medical devices that use I phones and
tablets you can kind of thank him for it
because he's one who went through the
pain of teaching that the FDA that a
mobile phone screen was better than one
of those ultrasound screens that you've
seen he had to actually he meant that
and prove it to them back in the day so
here to talk about kind of the future of
healthcare is Brad younger thanks babe
so Mabel more about that in the breakout
session if everyone wants to talk
specifically about the FDA that's
probably hours of conversation and of
itself and lots of gray hair but I think
we've come a long way and since 2010 far
that goes but what I'm here to talk
about today is somewhat relevant to my
my role is in mobile tristana technology
but in medical hardware in generals I
think we're we're entering a digital
health care revolution right now
healthcare tends to run sort of about a
decade behind the tech community but
we're closing the gap and we're coming
along with some new innovative devices
which are going to change the way that
we interact with our healthcare
providers one of the common theme attics
right now in healthcare is this sort of
idea of patient-centered health care
people feel much more empowered to drive
their own healthcare in the direction
they want it's much less hierarchical
than it was even ten years ago lots of
more data you can control you have
access to your data you can choose what
data you want to learn about on your own
and so I think when we talk about where
we healthcare is going I think that
we're going to have patient-centered
health care where there's lots of
different types of health care providers
lots of different
specialties and backgrounds who will
help you assist you with your health
care and using different kinds of
medical devices to help catalyze that
conversation you know is anyone familiar
with this this gentleman here so just as
a starting point of where innovation can
come from this gentleman was in in China
and this this kind of went viral a
couple years ago he it was discovered
through a video youtube video that he
had been self-administering dialysis
from his house in China for about a
decade the reason was not that he wanted
to do a per se is that he couldn't
actually afford what it cost to get down
to the clinic in the city so he went on
the internet and basically built a home
dialysis system was based in doing
dialysis for about one tenth the cost
that would have taken him to go down to
the city to do it so there's lots of do
yourself hardware innovations going on
this is maybe an extreme example but to
say that sometimes need can drive
innovation but along with that you know
we need to remember that there's a
regulatory component this is my 11 sort
of slide about FDA regulatory components
because a lot of people don't have to
deal with that but does anyone remember
either these images here at all in the
past so the one on the the left is the
relaxer sizer so it was in the 70s the
idea was you would strap that your body
at night and then when you woke up in
the morning boom you'd have lost 10
pounds so that went for about five years
unregulated and lots of those were sold
on the market there was very little
regulation from the from the government
about whether that was actually a valid
medical device of course it was not and
then on the right my right here is much
more sort of probably tragic story of
lack of regulatory oversight so what
this area is that is a shoe video or
shoe fluoroscopy machine so in the 70s
these became popular for customizing
your shoe size so you
the shoe store and you would put your
foot in there and you'd see an x-ray of
your foot and somehow you would actually
be able to customize your shoe size
better than before there were a lot of
tragic outcomes of this these were
banned in the 70s however the last one
was found in use in 1983 in West
Virginia still being used but can even
imagine who were the people most
affected by this device the shoe
salesman or a lot of where the case
supports came from in the medical
community about being because they were
exposed to this them day-in day-out
basis for years loss of limbs lies lives
significantly affected quite a tragedy
and an example of how a lack of
regulatory oversight can really have a
negative effect on on people so I'm
going to talk a little bit about
ultrasound because that's that's where I
spend a lot of my time and then we'll
move into some other medical devices
some of the medical devices i'm going to
talk about you may own you may know
about some you may not i think a lot of
them and hopefully the ones you are
familiar with we can maybe talk about
some different kinds of ideas about how
those connect people and connect their
healthcare with their doctors and
physicians so now in the space of
ultrasound we develop probes that
actually sit on your finger so it
actually changes the way that you as the
technician interface with your patient
and and then we also have a number of
companies including ours this is not a
picture of our company but I have
handheld devices so it allows us to
truly get to the point of care and allow
us to people to carry ultrasound devices
in their pocket at fraction of the cost
of what it used to be to get an
ultrasound why do we care about there's
a multitude of reasons why we care about
ultrasound technology and healthcare CT
scanning is a huge issue New England
Journal article came out three months
ago looking at ultrasound versus CT for
kidney stone patients and looking at
head outcomes and really showed no
difference so we're pushing away from CT
imaging pushing away from any type of
imaging when we can that involves a
radiation because you know it's
lative moving back to space with
ultrasound so if we talk about Hospital
line infections we put an IV in hospital
you get an infection just this one issue
alone is estimated to be a 30 point five
billion dollar problem that is that is
significantly mitigated by the use of
handheld ultrasound or ultrasound
devices in general it allows us to do
screening in places that we've never
done them before we can look at you know
if you go into your primary care doctor
and you have a cellulitis here like this
picture here you know is there an
underlying abscess before it was this
kind of guest technique when I trained
in Seattle we would just stick needles
in and aspirate and if we got pus back
then we would know we would have to to
cut but now we can actually look before
causing any pain to a patient we
actually connect get an image ahead of
time there's a whole host of screening
techniques that you can use now that was
not even available five years ago for
the general practitioner and you know
these devices are now connected they are
connected to the Internet we did a talk
with Ted Intel with a gentleman by name
of Eric dishman who has a kidney
transplant this is online you can watch
it but essentially he was at Intel in
California here imaging his kidney
because they're his transplant position
likes to monitor the size of the cysts
that are felt forming on this to see if
he needs to come in now his transplant
surgeon is in Portland so we did a whole
essentially consultation during the TED
talk where he imaged himself and his
kidney while through skype the physician
a transplant physician in Portland was
watching and make commenting on when he
should come back up to Portland for his
next visit OOP so we can use we're
actually putting devices and medical
devices in places we never been able to
put them before this actually has taken
it Everest base camp Paul Auerbach who
as a sort of the Guru and the father of
wilderness medicine textbook took this
with him up to base camp the story with
this particular picture Paul's actually
imaging there was you know as you can
imagine people spend a lot of money to
get up to the base camp they want have
summit Everest but there are some real
serious medical complications that can
occur high-altitude pulmonary edema
getting fluid in the lungs can actually
kill you but lots of people are inclined
to try and still summit because while
they spent your training and you know
they're going to make it up that
mountain but by being able to show this
gentleman that there was fluid in the
lungs you know they're able to decide
that maybe take them down the mountain
ahead of time and get medical care this
is a picture in Haiti so same type of
thing where communities who don't have
access or the funding to actually
traditionally have ultrasound devices
now we can deploy ultrasound devices 10
of them for the cost of one in the
humanitarian situations disaster
situations to help the population at
large you know one of the interesting
things about taking things to the
miniature sort of form factor as you
know kind of like most of us we carry
one thing in our pockets we're only
going to carry one thing so most
technology and wearables have to kind of
conform to that ultimately to that and
so in healthcare it's the same thing so
there's going to be one device that
health care providers carry in their
pockets and ultrasounds one of those
probably on the forefront and other
things will likely converge into that as
the thing they carry inter-hospital
communication will be an example one of
your labs back how do you want to
communicate with patients it's probably
all going to be integrated into one
specific device as we move forward you
know I think was JP Morgan which is
actually on going this week here big
healthcare conference last year the big
topic was home health the estimate is
that seventy percent of healthcare is
going to move into the home within a
decade so you can imagine devices like
ultrasound or really any other one you
may think of in your mind are going to
allow people to stay home and connect
with their healthcare providers in a
different way than they've done in the
past and these actually are bladder
scanner so this is a probably the first
example that came out of sort of auto
diagnosis using deep machine learning
algorithms to help decide what's the
volume of a bladder so now we take this
device you just and I could show anyone
in two seconds how to use the device and
you can
get bladder volume and so for the first
time you can take the ultrasound gene
out of the health care providers hand
and really put it in anyone's hand and
that's kind of where we want to move is
demystifying ultrasound creating access
the shift way from ultrasound to talk
about a couple other kinds of medical
devices you may or may not know about
and then talk about what the
implications or consequences are for
healthcare so this is a 16 year old
gentleman up in Seattle who use the 3d
printer which we talked about earlier to
make a case that's actually a
stethoscope case and so it digitizes
heart sounds now what that important so
if you know the heart has usually two
main sounds but if you have congestive
heart failure and you can't breathe you
typically develop a third heart sound
that's actually the first sign of floor
and congestive heart failure is the
auscultation of that sound now people
can't typically hear that on themselves
so they wait till they're symptomatic
they're short of breath and they go to
the ER and see me but it's a little bit
too late we have to turn them around and
get them better but they typically have
to be admitted at the hospital so if
this device can actually digitize that
third heart sound and allow you at home
to let's say put this on your chest
three times a day you can actually
contact your physician when that when
the actual phone picks up that their
hearts out and maybe mitigate ER
hospitals or hospitalization down the
road cell scopes a company out of San
Francisco here that took a mobile phone
case and then made a toda scope so you
can actually visualize the eardrum now
again what's the consequences of
something like this is it just kind of
cool gee whiz or is there something more
to it if we talk about it in terms of
finances which we'll get to in a second
you can see why this is so important to
the way we deliver healthcare in United
States I mean it's all about cost right
it's the whole conversation about how we
get health care can we make it cheaper
more affordable more accessible for the
population at large so here you just
take this video and you can see whether
it's a red ear drum or normal your drum
but you don't have to figure this out on
yourself this can go through
telemedicine channels you can actually
have a odor laryngologist an ENT doctor
or
our pediatrician look at this and say
yeah you know that is a red eardrum and
so then they can actually remotely
prescribe you antibiotics so you
actually still do in the morning you're
there with your kid he's got a fever and
is crying because of your pain you're
not driving to the ER necessarily
anymore you're actually just
communicating through telemedicine to
make the diagnosis and what that means
for healthcare in terms of spending you
think about it this way there are over
five million visits in the United States
annually for acute otitis media or ear
infection so that results in typically
10 million antibiotic prescriptions
annually and 30 million physician visits
annually extrapolate that worldwide and
you can imagine what kind of cost
savings potentially could be related to
the use of a device like this in the way
that our quote workflow of how we
deliver healthcare could change another
company that's now at San Francisco here
alive core you may have heard of this is
the case that gives you a single lead
EKG reading now they just had if the
approval for algorithms which actually
will detect an irregular heartbeat so
what that means is it's FDA approved
that you can use this device to detect
atrial fibrillation to decide when your
heartbeat is not normal so instead of
wondering I kind of feel a palpitation I
wonder what's going on you can actually
have a device which tells you yes you
actually do have a tribulation you
should probably go the hospital that
actually is connected to different kinds
of electronic medical records and that's
the other part of this is that as we
move to the age of electronic medical
records in putting these different kinds
of data points into an EMR again
sometimes I like to start with the
analogy so I work in Kirkland Washington
when I'm working as an ER doc and so
sort of the one of the hubs of
Technology in Seattle our sister and our
competitor Hospital perhaps is 10 miles
down the road also the same area if I
want to get data from their EMR and to
me because I'm seeing a patient who
typically as at that Hospital I get it
still by facts still today last night I
got a fax when I was working and so that
tells you where we're at right now in
health care when I say were a decade
behind I'm I'm actually serious
like we have a long ways to come these
things don't integrate yet but we're
going to get there eventually so we keep
pushing these devices forward I think a
lot of it is coming from the technology
side pushing medicine towards adopting
technologies that allow a better flow of
integration of data this is a
microfluidic technology sort of easy to
think about it maybe is like
lab-on-a-chip it's a cheap and fast way
to make lab Diagnostics available I'm
gonna briefly talk about company Q that
actually came out of Highway one
actually based out of San Diego now and
they're doing a sort of a home
diagnostics using technology similar to
what I just mentioned and so there's
five different tests you put your
cartridge in there that white sort of
casing device bluetooth to your phone
and they can give you actual real time
lab so no longer you're going to the lab
to get a blood test you're actually just
doing on yourself I'm going to run
through a specific scenario here and so
when I'm working clinically right now
we're seeing almost twice as many
patients is where you typically seeing
due to influenza right now and the state
of Washington on a call yesterday or
still three weeks away from the peak we
just crested above the five-year high in
terms of volume of influenza cases so
this is a real deal problem in the
United States people get really sick
from the flu so you have the typical
symptoms let's say and you have fever
sore throat cough you have influenza you
happen to have the cue test the cute
diagnostic kit at home and so you run a
flu test on yourself that that device
goes to your phone and says you have the
flu that communicates with your
healthcare provider who says you have
the flu that healthcare provider they
can prescribe you medication for
influenza which for the purpose of this
example let's say is courier by a local
courier service because there are a
couple of those set up now with
Walgreens and such that you don't
actually have to even go get the
medicine and then you are still at home
in bed feeling not particularly good but
more importantly from a health care and
prevent a medicine standpoint you're not
out there making other people's sick
we can help mitigate the spread of
disease with technology like this we all
certain a huge amounts of data you can
imagine how much data we could develop
here if you know how Google Flu worked
this would be a much better way to
actually truly understand GU Flu Trends
the United States because it'd be real
time diagnostic data the human
microbiome project is an ongoing project
so just in a 30 second review that this
basically is stemming from the fact that
we have learned ways to figure out DNA
sequencing from things we could not
typically played out on traditional
auger methods so if you wanted to prove
that bacteria existed you would sample
from something and then you would grow
it out on an auger plate or something
and then you would demonstrate that that
actually did exist but now through other
techniques we can actually extract the
data DNA out of those cells even though
we can't necessarily grow that bacteria
and live medium and we've discovered
over a million genes so this is ongoing
project at NIH there's companies like
you by Omo here in San Francisco allow
you to order a test kit I think they're
having another Kickstarter campaign
going on right now and you can test your
saliva urine stool all that stuff you
send it in and then you basically become
part of that project you can imagine
here you can get some interesting data
out of that and how your data and in
your home admire microbiome relates to
other people who maybe have similar
disease processes you do who live in
similar areas of the country there's
lots of stuff that we may be able to
derive from this kind of data that we
we've never had access to before now
this isn't typically this isn't hardware
but if anyone's familiar with patients
like me it's an amazing story this is
where people can input their own data
about their own health care and then
they can find that people who have
similar demographics to learn other
ideas about how to treat treat their
medical illnesses so we can start to
input hardware data medical device
harbor data into systems like this to
better understand how to treat specific
disease processes
so the tricorder prize is ongoing we're
to the final round this has been ongoing
for a couple years it's a 10 million
dollar prize there's about ten
categories of things that they asked the
companies to come up with in their
medical devices and there was another
category of things they could choose
from I don't think anyone's going to get
to the actual number that they were
hoping but if anyone sort of scanadu
their one of the finalists and so this
device do you run on your forehead and
it gives you quite a bit of data maybe
not as much as they're hoping for when
they started the prize but a profound
amount of data temperature blood
pressure heart rate variability pulse
oximetry and allow us to start to
connect that data with others may be in
the same area maybe people were doing
the same types of things we're doing
it's unclear on the extent what that
data can be utilized but you know they
they had probably one of the largest
crowd funding on record I think was 1.6
million plus their vc funding to help
develop this technology this technology
was actually just released at CES two
days two days ago and was just written
up in the New York Times this morning so
bloom is really fascinating so what they
did is they took the ring that typically
you'd use for secreting estrin for
contraceptive and they took that out and
then they put in a temperature sensor so
what this allows is for real-time data
on core body temperature so that
families that are trying to conceive can
actually see core body temperature
strikes spikes and that will be
Bluetooth to their phone so they'll know
when the appropriate ovulation time is
so pretty fascinating propeller helps a
little bit one of the more popular ones
they basically took the inhaler so there
are 50 million people in the United
States using inhalers right now so
imagine amount of data sets we're
creating where we can actually
understand people always underestimate
how many times they press the button I
only do it twice a day when they do it
15 you know so this allows us to not
only understand how much you are using
your inhaler so as a healthcare provider
you can say you know you're using it too
much we need to change your baseline
medical dosing but also can go is real
interesting data about geography when is
it you need your inhale
what type of temperature is it when you
need your inhaler what type of
environment what parts of the country
seem to pose a problem for you lots of
types of question that typically
historically was just subjective now we
actually have real time data understand
when you're actually accessing your
inhaler for rescue medication so it
allows a healthcare providers to
interact here I don't think I would want
this personally but here it is a text
message demoing going to like the
healthcare provider saying you know hey
one of your patients is doing poorly
lift is a wanted to finish with lift
because I think that initially when I
heard about this I wasn't exactly
certain how profound this is going to be
but I think that it's not connected per
se there's no i don't but i think the
consequences for medical devices like
this are profound probably best
demonstrated when I saw this video I
don't Fenny one seen this video here see
if I can make it run there we go so this
is a gentleman with Parkinson's China
eat and then one the left spawn which
counterbalances the shaking of the
patient allows him to actually
functionally eat his food in a much more
simple fashion so I finished with that
because you know as an ER doc I
typically treat symptoms you come see me
because you are in pain because you are
sick you can't breathe I mean yeah you
have a diagnosis maybe maybe you don't
know what the diagnosis is but I spend
most of my life trying to treat and
alleviate symptoms first and then we try
and figure out what the problem is but
if you're in pain lots of times you care
about that first you want the pain to be
relieved that's why you're coming to the
emergency department so I think that
along those lines a lot of these medical
devices can treat both diseases but also
symptoms or byproducts a disease and
improve quality of life make people
happier because that's ultimately as as
healthcare providers why many of us went
into it was to make to help people and
so I think that this is a whole new
generation of medical devices that will
allow new type of engagement between
healthcare providers and their patients
and for me that's a very exciting time
because that that's exactly what I think
people went into health care for so just
leave it with any questions here this
there's actually one of the earliest
medical devices in modern times is the
bacons leech device so instead of
putting a leech on someone someone
thought this would be a great idea to
suck blood out of your skin and get rid
of the evil humors I don't think that
would pass muster these days but thank
you for time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
