talk about in place command so in please
come and actually menus that appear next
to your finger so fondant if you put
your finger down on the display then you
see a menu and then you can expand with
your other finger so you can control the
menu and so the advantage of that is
that it works well on small display like
slates and also on large displays so
basically on large displays you can just
make them when you appear and you don't
need to work to reach for the menu
so we are using a slate and basically on
this slate
we created a sketching application in
order to be able to explore the in place
command so here by default the pen drive
and now when I put my finger down I get
a menu just next to my finger and it
actually follows my finger I can pack
the menu somewhere and then use it just
to change font and color of my pen and
also on the top of the menu I have a
shortcut shortcuts kind of menu where I
could find such undo so if I want to
undo something I can just tap here and
it undo my last operation now if I want
to get rid of the menu I can just tap
anywhere under mine you disappear and
then I can get it back very easily if I
want to get more palettes I could just
expand the menu so I could start with a
small pinch and just expand that and I
get more menus and now I can change the
default one by just raising my index
while leaving my thumb down and then put
my index down again and now I get to
another default menu so now this one is
the default menu
so here the second menu is actually a
tool-less menu so it's like a click
through tool so I can basically if I
want to draw a line I can just go with
my pen here start my line here I know I
can position my line with two hands on
the finger side I have an offset so my
finger doesn't hide the beginning of the
line and the other side is just a pen
that shows the positioning of the line
and then when I release the menu will
come back and now I can do the same
same thing for thought if I want to do a
square I can start by clicking through
the square icon and now I can position
and size the square at the same time
same idea for a circle I can position
and size the circle with two hands which
allows me to position it very precisely
basically what we have is if you do a
large pinch it will zoom and if you do a
small pinch it will open the menu yeah
we are also interested about different
form factor and exploring different kind
of in place command menu
another interesting expression we have
done is to use the shadow of the finger
as a clipboard so for instance I can put
my finger down here and I have a shadow
I can place object inside the shadow and
now I can remove my finger the shadow
disappear
and then I can put my finger back
somewhere else on the surface and now
extract what was on the other clipboard
and they come here if I want to remove
what on my finger I can just put my
finger down and then just shake my
finger and now it's gone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
