assessing in temporal queries let's take
a look at this query which calls clip of
interation it shortens each event to the
next event with the same ID when we
click debug we see on the left the query
graph on the right the timelines the
graph shows that the user session stream
has the operation clip event duration
called on it in the timeline we see
individual events hovering over event
shows us it's start time its end time
and its payload the data associated with
it we also see highlighted in black the
provenance the results of the process
and operation here we see that this
first event was clipped to the second
but the second wasn't clipped to the
third inspecting the metadata it turns
out that this third clip has ID equals 2
while the first and second have ID
equals 1 now let's look at a more
complex example this is task be from the
user study we're trying to aggregate
information in two 60-minute windows but
looking at the time stamps on the Left
we see that we're getting times that
aren't in 60 minute intervals let's see
what the debugger shows it's easy to
read from the debugger that the query is
structured in two branches in one branch
we're calling a tumbling window lifetime
and then an aggregate that's what's
giving us the 60 minute windows on the
right but wait when we join them with
the other branch they're getting broken
up the other branch isn't in Windows
this must be where the strange times are
coming from let's fix this will move the
tumbling window lifetime call to before
the branch is separate now we see that
both branches and the results are in 60
minute intervals we've solved the
problem this is how stream trace allows
us to visualize the stages of data
processing in temporal queries</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
