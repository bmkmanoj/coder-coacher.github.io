so it's a pleasure to have been a
Doppler here and in when I the same the
end we couldn't get him from Spain
Princeton when I was a faculty and he
was visiting as part of this German
fellowship or you ought to use was it
one year and he went to MIT but and yes
getting a second chance and he seemed to
have done not that not that badly at MIT
and particular winning best student
paper award in both stottah soda in
stock and he's going to talk today about
the topic which as in this lab we have
no knowledge about so looking forward to
hear about it yeah i'm i'm very excited
to be here i'm going to talk about how
to gossip and when I say gossip what I
really mean is I want to solve robustly
solve multicast problem so meticulous
just means we have a network we have
some pieces of information in this
network and we want to communicate
efficiently is that in the end everybody
knows about everything and typical
settings that I want you to think about
is setting where we might not know the
topology visit apology is may be
unstable or changing more time and I
don't go too much into applications here
saying it's pretty clear that this is
important communication primitive just
think about databases that's this big
distributed updates come in in the end
somebody everybody should have a
consistent picture or just peer-to-peer
content distribution in sync sciences
and series I like to classical
approaches to sources problem one is I
just flat okay all the information I
have are sent to all my neighbors I do
this repeatedly it works but it's a huge
communication overhead and in many
settings in many systems not even
possible to efficiently contact all my
neighbors and the other things that you
can do is fill the spanning tree
sings along a spanning tree but again if
see if you don't know the network it's
hard to find a spanning tree and if
seedlings are not stable no let's go up
and down this is also a little bit more
problematic so the the approaches we
want to focus on is is gossip and when I
say gossip I really just mean one note
in each round contact just one as a
person and then these two nodes exchange
I say all the things that they know or
some of the things it's very simple and
see the hope is that if you choose to
write people and if you sent the right
things you know even though you don't
send it to everybody still in the end
information disperses and everything is
fine and if you go with this approach
they're really just the two questions
you need to answer if you contact one of
your neighbors which one and if you
don't send everything but you just send
one piece what is and I will talk about
both things in the first part of a talk
about some ideas on what a good ideas
for whom to contact and in the second
part that will basically give let's say
provocatively see right answer for what
you should send if you only can send one
thing and more importantly also a way to
analyze how quickly or where does the
schedule so let's start part one whom
should i contact and here really just
assume that when I contact a note I have
large enough packet small enough pieces
of information that i can send
everything that I know so I'm in a
network and yes anything do I know the
structure what do I know about the graph
or I'm just on my neighbors yeah you
just know your neighbors you don't know
anything about to go and and that's kind
of you know your neighbors are you know
who your neighbors up and he couldn't
contact them directly you know their IP
addresses let's say my model for
existing wireless for example you don't
really know no this is okay so yeah if
you're in such a network you need to
contact one neighbor but you don't know
anything about the topology which
what do you choose well the best thing
more or less you can do is just contact
a random neighbor and you can just
repeatedly do so and then you know pick
a random neighbor forward everything you
know and that's known as uniform random
consent because if I do that if I have
contact you in round one I might say now
it's better to actually not contact you
involve to know in in the round in the
first round it's more less busy I mean
that's the only thing you can do and
then if you keep doing this I could
contact you again or I could say in the
second round I choose uniformly among
the people i haven't absolutely yeah so
I mean uniform random is just keep keep
talking to a remnant neighbor and then
yes they are better things you can do
because otherwise is you know this part
would end here and it doesn't so but if
you I mean it's it's a plausible idea to
just continue contacting random notes
and see where does this get you and
essentially it works very well if you
graph is well behaved and well-behaved
means well connected or an expander so
if the exit expansion is fine then it
works in log in or if I not very
surprising but surprisingly how to prove
so it actually took a bunch of papers to
get onto the right bound and does fih
expander means i have x atras or have
proportion fire off the edges about this
and it's conductance so it's take a
subset better the expander no no I know
but it's why between 0 and 1 or between
one and n and between 0 and 1 um yeah
otherwise this very quickly become it's
a constant which is good very good and
yeah so similar similar things hold for
vertex expansion we know that lock to
lock or to the 2.5 suffices in the
examples for locks quitters but so these
results still leave kind of two
questions open one is what if our
topology
has some bottleneck what if it's not an
expander and do we really need said much
random if the graph was a click then
uniform and on gossip is not a good as
it idea right and you know that log n
you lose it for coupon collector or
something like that it no you still need
if its context a different neighbor
every time you should do it in n steps
no it's and if we okay alright you have
one step in each ear so so on a click on
expander basically just randomly say
doing things will do it in lock and time
which is kind of what we would expect it
doesn't link the set of people that you
know about every time yes yeah so what
if you have bottlenecks and do we really
need that much randomness on how much
wine industry and there are some answers
in the in the literature so 44
bottlenecks one thing we knew was it's
by paper by can sense it l'shana that we
can deal with some kind of bottlenecks
so in particular instead of having to
deal with experiments we can deal this
week expanders but now just random
gossip doesn't do it we do random gossip
and then we do something more clever uh
but still there are many pathologies
which yes so I love it I mean can I can
I be sitting there I haven't heard
anything yet but can I be saying like
I've got a hundred friends and they all
told me they haven't heard anything and
I haven't heard anything can i be
sending that message around to people
yes you can from for now we really
assume whoever you talk to you can tell
them everything if you haven't heard
anything from i mean you haven't so if
you can tell them the fact that you
haven't heard and yes good okay so you
can tell them the list of neighbors or
something like that that you have okay
so but yeah but still I mean there's a
problem still remains that there are a
lot of topologies which have very small
diameter let's say logarithmic and NZ
Scott's a protocol take forever
in yet okay ah on the question how much
randomization is necessary see results
balsam the upper bond lower bounds here
some some protocols which use for
example so the wind generators which use
much much less randomness of much less
real randomness and say assemble bonds
for restricted settings which suggests
that certain amount of randomness is
necessary to get the spreading it's a
distributed setting so people are always
interested in seeing what you can do on
what you can't do is run a mess and in
these settings can make a huge
difference I mean for example here it's
not clear whether you can do anything
without any REM yeah and this repeated
people don't like for some reasons they
don't like probabilistic guarantees
right i mean even a few thousands i was
probability you know exponentially small
and then nothing bad will happen and
they still say but what if okay so ya in
the next two slides I quickly want to go
over a few things that we did in this
direction just briefly touch upon it so
this is not so yeah in order to get
something for all topologies some things
that we quickly realized in V that's
John Karen and Peter and it said one
problem that's interesting on its own
right and also may be easier to solve
when you want to go to with something
that works for all topologies is the
local broadcast problem so again
everybody has a rumor but now i'm not
interested in all the rumors outside
which might be really far away but just
to rumors of my neighbors and I think
that's a a it's a very plausible problem
we say it's world has a large diameter
really not interested in about
everything just about my local
neighborhood but also if I know how to
solve this quickly
I essentially can simulate a broadcast I
can repeat this diameter times a number
and this is essentially what we do what
we can prove this is a randomized gossip
algorithm which solves this local
broadcast problem in locked Z cube and
the algorithm is actually a little bit
technical in part but the idea is
extremely simple so i can give you kind
of a short sketch and the two main
ingredients is where we know that gossip
is very fast on expanders and the second
ingredient is every graph i can kind of
interpret as a collection of expanders
and in particular i can decompose or
petitioner graph into 1 over log and
expanders while cutting it most harmful
see edges just think of these
experiments as kind of communities and I
can explain most of the social
interactions as at least half of the
interactions as taking part in these
well connected communities so what
happens if I do a uniform gossip well in
these communities rumors spread very
quickly so if I do this for logs where
time which is login / Phi then every
node will know about rumors of all the
other neighbors it has in its community
and from now on if I'm just introducing
in the local problem I can ignore these
people I don't have to talk to them
again and if I do this I've just thrown
away half of the edges I rinse and
repeat with this login times in them
yeah no no but you don't know which ones
to throw because you just said I've
heard from them so I know they I know
their name if I know their rumor and
that says they attach their name to the
rumor i know that i can make know that
actually sounds pretty simple right you
yeah so there are few tech you don't get
it from gossip and then after log log
squared n bounds you you will move from
you listen of neighbors everyone that
you've already heard phone yes achieve
the one one thing why can't do this is
you need preserve symmetry if you do a
random gossip I might hear from you but
you don't hear from me
if you advice or of ways eh but you
don't bien a visit directed graph and
actually turns out not just set the
analysis doesn't work but the algorithm
can feel miserable so you need to do
some things to scimitar eyes things
makes the algorithm a little bit more
intricate and in particular it's not
very natural and not very robust in but
yeah I mean is easy up sure this real
existence it's very so have you tried
this I mean so you've got a lower bound
how does it actually perform do you know
if he like implemented it in order and
yeah yeah i think if you wait three
slides you'll see why no okay yeah so
then you know you can do the local bra
workers problem look to the cube and you
repeat this diameter times the global
brokers problem indila cube and actually
you add a few more interesting
connection to graphs premise and other
things in which i don't want to go you
even get diameter plus poly look so
that's one thing and in so in a sort of
paper which i'm going to present in
three days I kind of went beyoncé's in
the next slide I'm going to just briefly
go into this what I looked at is this
fairly natural gossip process okay so
nodes have lots of neighbors let's say a
few of them they call friends initially
let's say they don't have any friends
and they become to get some friends over
all the codes and they really just
exchange rumors with your friends now
since they only have a few friends say
that works very quickly and among
friends for Miss pretty much Isis yeah
so friends is always something I don't
like bullets Rivas a top toddler what
what nice gradual 80 enlisted gossip I
grossmont search and say
I would give it away yeah yeah I was
very quick um well yeah and so I
exchanged Ramos with my friends and then
the last thing I do I need I make new
friends over time very inferring
goodnight let's say every lock and steps
or something like this and I pick
somebody who I don't know any single and
there are a lot of wii is there's a lot
of freedom and how exactly implementers
if you want to write on algorithm turns
out it doesn't really matter because any
sir anyway you will implement this will
lead to a fast-spreading or so they say
there's a very nice extremely simple
analysis which doesn't build on anything
that was there before it shows said
roughly anything that goes along these
lines will perform very quickly and
where it quickly means faster than what
we had before so even if you want to
exchange all messages with people that
are logging far away from you you can do
it in log squared ones and and these
algorithms are extremely robust and that
kind of goes hand in hand with a
naturalness if it doesn't really matter
how you implement things it's not
surprising if something goes a little
bit wrong set its doors and yes the best
thing I haven't haven't told yet it also
turns out said you don't actually need
to pick a random neighbor but in fact
any choosing any neighbor so this is the
first deterministic algorithm for this
kind of thing and all those fastest so
to say the nicest the randomization is
necessary for for some for for
restricted sites so if CI Grissom is
address oblivious and some other on as a
conditions classes for the rhythms out
certain classes of graft yes from
classes about Brandis she just makes it
one CZ so just understand you pick any
set of seven small subset of friends and
then you like over time just keep adding
yeah let's say in the beginning you
don't have anybody these friends all
your neighbors yes
subset of your near subset of you and
they just add one at a time and so in
the first one I picked boss as my friend
but you could be from picking adversary
early adversary it's a very good bike
from all the friends I think could have
faked somebody gave me boys okay um see
how we do what how much longer do we
have till noon so 40 minutes okay okay
um okay so this is all I want to say
about part one who to contact that's a
good time for questions if they all
right no okay very hard to proof is no
not at all it's yeah I can do it in five
minutes on on the board if you have time
in the end I can do it yeah but let's
let's not do it let's not do it okay so
so then let's go to part two so here is
a question is if I have a lot of things
if I know about a lot of things I can
only send one or smaller amount what was
it and the assumptions that makes it
let's say we have K rumors initially
distributed over the network and I can
only send equivalent of one rumor if I
contact somebody and what I'm going to
say is really going to work for any kind
of way of fool contacts whom but just to
make it simple let's let's just assume
for now that no it's big notes randomly
just save is a uniform random gossip but
the question is now what ways and in
general that's incredibly hard problem
what is one who was at one bit one rumor
is like a message part of the big chunk
of information that you want to send
what do you call one ah this one bit
what is one endless whatever you can fit
whatever you can fit into a packet that
you send around typically so let's say
on that Kate's whatever a 100k
okay just as I guess 10k on it k
something that's I mean so this is
something you know like yeah so it's a
high problem especially if you have no
no knowledge no feedback from the nodes
if you have no idea exactly what the
person you're talking to already knows
if you have no global knowledge about
how frequently certain rumors have
already spread or not and if you have
ever used patron and downloaded
something the last percent always takes
forever and this is exactly the reason
why because what typically happens is
some rumors or some pieces of
information spread very quickly and they
choke out much rarer pieces and use yeah
and this in this setting interesting you
would typically call it messages but
then since you already started with
cancer gossip where people talk about
rumor spreading and it's yeah it's
really just thick bubble in me I hear
what calls and messages i just kept room
with rods it up um but yeah it's it's
really it's like 100k bit vector so wait
it's a hundred k locker because also
wise i can't even tell you the address
of money it's large as an onion I mean
typically the bit size of the packets as
much larger than Z sends the number of
notes that actually what club did yes
this is this is a real issue in um and
severe severe actually yeah so I um
don't take stuff that case and come on I
don't know I ok so a typical a typical
problem that occurs is it's a following
ok suppose the boss of course knows
everything it's true we don't have to
suppose it but I know almost everything
so there's exactly one rumors that I
don't know and boss can send me
something but he doesn't he doesn't know
what I know so what is he going to send
me Yeah right and there's really no good
answer right the minister gasps and
there's no no good strategy but maybe
there is something better than just
picking one specific packet is sent and
i'm pretty sure that a lot of smart
people here so what is the better thing
to send and just picking bond rumor SI
xor right so boss is just going to send
me ZX or if all these bit vectors I
going to XO out everything I know is it
one remaining seng that i don't know i
can be cooked and the strategies that i
want to tell you about is really just
taking this simple idea and bringing it
internet and it's called randomly near
network coding and it works as follows
okay instead of sending rumors SAR in
plain text we send random linear
combinations of rumors over finite
fields for now to think of finite field
SF too so these are bit vectors and be
sent x-force ok so the packet that i'm
going to send around are going to tell
you what are the things that i mixed
together in this case coefficient 1101
means i mix the base of the rumor 102
and 104 and I sends the expo and if I'm
asked to send something out I don't just
send a room and plain text by send
something from this format and what
exactly do i send well I've received a
bunch of packets of this format just
take a randomly new combination of these
packets easy to see that because of
linearity it still has the same format
this is what i'm going to say the
headers is an ordering undo yes yes so i
have so this is a if i mix together a
hundred boomers then this is hundred
bits each room the header already like
I'd really like a fine name you have
like a hundred came about survival is
much bigger but the rumor exact usually
I mean what what's usually assume I said
see data itself is much larger than Ty
header otherwise this is one bit per one
bit per room and said he mixed together
is your something everyone yeah I mean
this is it pieces said you said Aramis
rumor also has a header that's the
idenna
higher of them so which rumor is from
work for yeah I mean like if you sent to
plain text for more here than you have
an identity that so we all agree on what
is rumor for yes how I mean if you were
to use this in practice how would
somebody know this is where we're 97 we
assumes that we assume that C rumors
have half an identifier answer I mean if
you don't know if you don't know exactly
if you don't have says something you can
do in practice if you know it's roughly
how many rumors you have you can do
hashing and but yeah I again that's not
that's not going and then yeah in the
end if you've received a bunch of if
you've received a bunch of these packets
in particular if you've received hey
packets that have linearly independent
headers you can do Gaussian elimination
exactly what we did with X or hang out
sings and decode and recover all the
awesome messages also good is that is it
clear how random linear network coding
yeah cool um if you did hashing what a
third collisions yes that's more
confident yes I'm not supposed to
understand that yeah I know I think
these are also kind of more technical
details if you actually want to
implement that it's possible yeah yeah
it's possible means 86 um okay so if you
do this what what you get from it and
this has actually been used in a bunch
of places and skating more by the minute
so one place where it has been used is
actually as in a microsoft content
distribution system and doesn't run
anymore was gonna but avalanche where
basically you improve bittorrent by by
putting network cord and network or even
top of it as a content distribution
networks and like see chinese youtube
you see they use some kind of network or
in many other places and I think the
reason why people use it and not going
to use it more and more is a it's
efficient but also be it's extremely
robust
on the other hand the theoretical
understanding of how quickly these
things converge even very artificial
settings much less understood so the the
first people that looked at it was like
Deb in Medora and this was a pretty cool
result so they just looked at a complete
graph you sent to a random neighbor
which means your venom node and you do
this network coding on top of it if K
messages how long does it take to it
very simple question and the cool thing
is that was kind of the first place
because it could show that random linear
network coding gossip does something
better than just sending sings in plain
text so if you think things in plain tex
really the best thing you can do is k
messages and you send them one by one
each message if you do random gossip
takes log in time to get to everybody so
it's k log N and this is fast as in
Caleb and this is actually almost
optimal the K has to be there because
faranda can only know learn about one
message so k is really necessary the
logging kind of has to be there because
even just flooding one message is going
to take log in time and this square K or
K factor doesn't look like it's the
right thing but yeah who knows um
they're a bunch of papers which try to
go from their tour to general topologies
is a nice but they're not they're far
from type and in particular what's a
little bit annoying is they often look
Connie I'm sure that net recording is
better than sequential flooding which is
really something you were going to
compete against and they don't other
don't explain robustness and they're
involved so just see the result on the
complete graph it has a bunch of extra
something has this weird form goes over
15 20 pages of heavy stochastic analysis
it's not fun I never feed graph which
flooding at caño complete graph in
every round you contact the venom as a
note and you sent him a random linear
combination
how long does it take until everybody
has and it's a full spin and can be
called sequential flooding is just one
message yeah so I sent one message until
everybody noses exactly and that would
be ke logon ke kai is lawyer yeah
whatever the parameters randomly random
go see whatever it takes for one message
to kind of flaps wasn't so it's okay
halo can get incomplete yell okay that's
a trivial okay look here's a trivia lon
but net recording does it better right
and the approved the network coding is
better than that they've replaced the
case but it doesn't each sequential
it this one here it does yes if you go
to general topologies they get some
bounds but usually these phones are not
even better than what you will get from
scratch not that you have lower bone
which proves that they d kind of it or
none o ok so so this is what kind of
sustained of see art and so what I'm
going to show you over the next slide is
some things that cleans the South
drastically it's it's a simple simple
analysis technique which works basically
in any kind of setting you you can
imagine it gives optimal bounds and it
even works in very nasty highly
adversarial networks okay and then I
when I say simple i really mean simple
it's so simple that i will give you the
whole technique including proofs in the
next two slides uh yeah like once it's
actually also not too complicated you
have one quick slide in the NBA okay so
let's start right in if you want to know
how quickly things spread how quickly
knowledge spreads over the network we
really just need to look at the
coefficient values right you know that
if i have a full span and if i have
vectors that full expand the full space
i can decode sore really just look how
do these coefficient vector s evolve and
this is the one crucial definition which
makes everything fall into place I say a
node knows about
certain coefficient vector mu and the
coefficient nectar is vector / sq1
coefficient for each for each message if
I have received the package that is not
a sorghum l2 that's very weak definition
so extremely weak definition exact but
it kind of does make sense right so if
you look I've received two messages they
span this this space if a look at the
red vector that's orthogonal I really
know nothing about it right i mean
there's nothing I can say about what is
going to be in this direction if I have
something along the black direction I
don't know particularly much about it by
it but I know something about and as
Jennifer says it's an extremely
extremely big definition of not exactly
and if you know then you know something
maybe if you know everything that it
does coincide with the usual definition
yes yeah but yes but every is it sets a
certain point but yes um and everything
really means hear everything right i
mean like exponentially many back ribs
yeah so that's you me too low about okay
but that's that's kind of see it's a
third point and so one nice thing is
this this definition of knowledge is so
weak that it actually spreads very
quickly very easy okay so in particular
if I know something I know the vector mu
and I send something to Jennifer since
there's a good probability in particular
1 minus 1 over Q said Jennifer
afterwards knows about me and why is
this a case what are you sending a
packet which means a random linear
combinations of everything I've received
so far so he had something which is not
orthogonal to MU you know and and you
know if if we're over f2 then the
probability half i'm gonna know
something exciting are you gonna get all
stomp yeah no I'm not very much right so
you should take it randomly neyo
combination
one of something no one else do no not
until the news no means almost lauriana
mae learn knowledge is the same right
yes these are almost nothing that's all
your definition of no means not not no
yes yes we did right and I exactly when
it says the recipient learns new you
mean it afterwards it knows right and
notice according to sister right right I
know yeah I should have okay um proof
again is actually fairly straightforward
um you know so i send something if you
know what it doesn't mean that so you're
it doesn't mean that the cosine is
positive it would be negative because it
just not also ah yeah what today is not
in oh I stood it's just non zero um yeah
but uh yeah it's um yeah this is kind of
once you have this definition it's
really good it's really nice comes
really nicely um yeah so let's let's
still do it that's as that's it so why
is this a case you know I know these
messages i'm going to send random point
from this plane and the question is
what's what's the probability that I get
unlucky and send Jennifer something that
doesn't help okay the things that don't
help with anything that's perpendicular
to move okay and it's easy to see eyes
on the picture or just by thinking about
it that these sayings form a hyperplane
in in the span of all received packets
okay in this case really it's just any
of these any of these points on this red
line in this big space to pick one of
them tough luck right anything else is
fine and now the just volume Z is a
fraction of the non informative packets
versus the package that are informative
is 1 over Q if you are operating offices
finite vector space and
so the probability that i pick something
that's informative sat-sun perpendicular
is 1-1 pitch why it's true the thing is
let's suppose that I only know mew and
that mu was self orthogonal so the thing
is I can't tell you anything that would
let you know mew because selfless argue
no mr. some vectors who are finite
fields that are orthogonal to themselves
so but if you only know mules and
they're basically just two vectors you
going to send I says the zero vector
warm you yeah I'm telling you what you
send this not know that you know is not
you know oh yeah so paste you have right
and they don't necessarily have me on
your list okay it's actually it's a
little if you think about it's a little
tricky can actually send the only
victory had in his list was then you win
millions in itself force organelles you
would actually not know me which is a
little bit confusing at first it's
fine you don't know any of you won't
care you know a lot of other vectors
right oh you know if you don't know
anything about anything it's it's a
little bit it's a little bit counter
except it's now it may be should be used
like a different world and no like I
don't know he's infected with you or mhm
yeah yeah I mean he kind of want to talk
about knowledge spreading I mean this
thing is it's okay you know be talking
about me not not know anything yeah but
it's now but what the butt Henry the
definition has to be modified know what
Henry what Henry Henry refers to is he
funny things that i can i can know okay
i can have see a message this a certain
vector in my space okay in half it
received as a packet but then I look at
its coefficient vector and according to
resist definition I don't know it even
so I can decode it I don't know it and
that's just because and also these
pictures are kind of a little bit
misleading right because or sorgen ality
over finite vector spaces over finite
fields you know they're a little bit
unintuitive and that's that's basically
all the way this comes
I mean technically these these vectors
are not in the same space as the
original vector so I'd say in the
orthogonal space you can map them
together and usually it works perfectly
fine but this is a few places for kind
of intuition breaks a little but it
doesn't it it doesn't it confused me in
the beginning to there's no need to
change the definitions everything works
out as it you don't know me and that's
perfectly fine you know a lot of
assistance so the weird part is that no
doesn't just mean not not know that you
can know something in the ordinary sense
of having the vector but not know it and
listen yes it doesn't it doesn't
coincide with you usual and it's not
just Vika but it's also in some places
it's kind of really doesn't even implies
yes if it was a different well yeah but
it's hard times yes okay so um yeah so
the last observation is what was already
said if you know everything then you can
decode so it means something and but
everything here really is exponentially
many vectors right because just knowing
for example the basis vectors if I know
the old ones vector I know all the basis
vectors I still don't know particularly
much right so I need to know everything
and this is also easy to see just proof
by contradiction suppose a county code
which means I don't have to full spin
yet which means i have something lower
dimensional which means i can find one
direction that's orthogonal in this
direction i don't know so every time I
can't decode I can definitely find some
things that I don't ok so that's that's
the definition so let's let's play with
it let's prove something so what I want
to proof is yeah it's a complete graph
let's let's go back there again and now
it's only a half page one and in the
skirt of case nuts here okay it works
this works over f2 which wasn't wasn't
true before you need it's a polynomial
large field you actually need some
assumptions on how well spread see
messages are in the beginning everything
it's just it's nice
okay so yeah let's prove sit on the
complete graph if K rumors to spread
with high probability in time log and
basket so let's just fix one moon one
direction and see how it spreads and
well initially at least one node knows
about it this note will talk to somebody
was fifty percent this node will get
infected knows about it again and you
know you see that very quickly you know
it's a very big notion so very quickly
everybody will know about it and they
can quantify this a little bit if you
say Tim you is a time at which mu is
known by all nodes then clearly an
expectation constant number of nodes
learns about it current as the number of
nodes increases by a constant factor up
to half and then and so the expected
number of rounds needed is log N and
then let's also just look at the tail
what's the probability is that after k
plus login times it has not spread well
it's exponentially small in k plus log
you're spreading so little as every
round it doesn't spread you know it's a
it's a constant probability that it
doesn't happen so we have an exponential
tail negative binomial and some very
small constant um and now claims that we
practically done somebody sees a very
last step you don't count somebody
hasn't seen it dc's alas good yeah Union
bond that's he s e to the minus oh it's
to choose okay and you're too to say it
right so we do a Union bound overall in
this case two to kiss a vectors and what
we get is the probability that it hasn't
spread of the k log and x is yeah still
exponentially small in k plus log in
actually if you wanted to but just that
Logan X 0 is 1 over 1 over it I'm
it actually it kind of CZ the its high
probabilities that we get if you really
wanted is roughly the running time right
wit nor the one of it you could there's
no special reason if you put this if the
setter in front leg gets bigger you will
get low end times that's what I just
said so basically get the probabilities
that you don't it's not just one over
pull en but it's 1 over T that is a
running time you know one over small
constant factor in terms so it's
actually say tail bones that he gets off
you know pick pick pick them pick a
graph pick any kind off and that's kind
of sort of using excited so how does
this work in general and really it's
it's it's it's that simple I mean so
what do you do if you want to an eyes it
in a special topology in a special way
of how nodes choose as a nodes all
that's all that's interesting is what is
a time for bond message to flood and
flooding is not completely accurate it's
like one of a cue for the flooding so
every node there's some rule which
governs who contacts who I don't even
care what it is right i mean we need to
fix it to get a result but it works with
anything now you know who talks to whom
and now it's just an epidemic process
and basically everybody who talks to
everybody gets gets infected except with
a small probability that not all of
these processes have tailbone an
exponential table just because it's a
markov chain it goes goes exponentially
and and then basically visit a bond you
do what we just did and the kind of
results that you get in almost all cases
the time it takes for network coding to
determinate is t plus K there yeah the
TC expected fun and um yeah and so this
is called kind of perfect pipelining and
why is this the case of tea time it
already takes for one message to flood
in many cases we can actually prove all
of t plus K is AK outside of CA of your
location so that really means said of T
it takes for the first message to come
and then this is of course not what
happened and but intuitively
in off k of t plus K time I'm done which
means from there on every next step I
get one message I mean I never really
get messages here get mixtures but I get
once one at a time so this is really
instead of getting T times K if you do
with sequential funny you give you t
plus K really simple in most cases in
some cases it actually in the click this
random spreading no because you say k
should put in a little bit apology on
this wedding yeah you need to fix you
need to fix the topology in a way of who
contacts from right i mean basically a
communication model it will in the
papers are like six different
communication models just to demonstrate
how where you can apply it you need to
fix kind of who conducts home then the Z
Z what you sent is fixed by randomly in
a net recording and si technique will
give you an answer of how quickly things
and all you need to understand its kind
of this flooding time this is this
epidemic process of one message this is
before you needed to track kind of K
different since I eventually learn I
mean what what do we what we want to
learn all day I mean in this are in the
end why nobody tell me so everybody has
maybe some information about whether
bush gets elected or not said I mean
what is the gossip or do I just learn
the structure of the net know so what
you does this this is kind of really you
learned you have some some pieces of
information some bit workers and you
want to learn the same applies it to the
Asian learning and we sort of assume I
have sort of just one state of the word
which is either the word ends as
predicted by the more months in the year
whatever or it doesn't you all have sang
always build it now so what a section of
eva is a good this a good so here you
really just want to learn the plain text
of all the information that's outside
right so there are lots of gossip it's
really never see lots of data yeah and
you
2.beijing learn that setting right so
that's one state of the world we all
have some prior on it we want to
converge to conquer the short answer is
I don't know I mean this is what I what
I want to say it's a lot of work that's
on kind of aggregate information okay
for example like viet let's say a lot of
numbers here we'll just say I want to
learn on the numbers but another good
question is I want to learn the average
right I want to learn the mean I want to
learn like it's some function of CSIS
right so that kind of sounds a little
bit like if many people have different
prior information I want to learn an
aggregate of said would be I mean people
have studied this and it's not you know
in this case you wouldn't necessarily
use net recording you would you know
combine things in a way that you can't I
mean here in the end you really want to
recover everything ok so let's let's see
ya so one example serum i give here just
because I can need it in the next slide
is if you use net recorded gossip of K
rumors then on an honor general topology
we know it takes log and Phi time for
one thing to spread take log in five
plus K time for casings to spread if you
use net recording so now let's go to the
one slides that stood something it
really confuses the robot could have and
to the 500 bits we assume that all the
rumors has the same lengths okay if one
is longer you cut it into two rumors
this length air yeah on what I'm saying
is said thing so it's l hidden in the
all in you know is the sense it in each
round you have enough space to send the
equivalent of one room so if he makes a
rumor bigger I'd also get a larger
message so you cut it into as many
pieces as so that you can fit one piece
into one packet so in this case that's a
hundred K so he's telling you how long
it takes to learn something of the
amount
and transfer yes except you're losing L
my skate bits are Elia losing every time
you communicate that's it you have to it
okay yeah okay there's some overhead and
there's some overhead of these headers
which is kind of lost in all these
wherein all this information see work
it's completely just fractured away in
practice actually it's a very
interesting question how many sings to
eco together and typically people
actually don't go together everything
because then the header gets lungs as
also you don't want to wait and till the
end to receive everything you want to
decode on the way you don't want to
solve huge systems of linear equations
for many reasons but yes so there's
there's a hidden coding overhead in the
distributed setting absolutely here
other cases where you could potentially
decode faster or are you always in full
general teats heart typically it's a
trade-off between kind of you get a
bandwidth improvement here actually this
night recording you can achieve
capacities that are provably
unachievable by just routing so there's
a kind of if you coat things together
then then there's a kind of a trade-off
between yeah so they're trade-offs but
in full generality it's hard since
isince network coding exchanged the
trade-off so you'll get everything
faster but before that you get enough
yeah before that you just get a swiss
all coding things right i mean like
before that you just get pieces of
entropy easy you know don't necessarily
make a whole lot of sense on its own
example theorem if you apply your
worship thing you get me login uh uh
yeah you can you can you can put those
two things together and see reason to
have conductance you might still want to
use I mean so one thing about the AR
BOTS previous saying is you really have
large messages okay large messages in
the sense that what you what I need to
be able to send is identifies of
all my neighbors or potentially all
nodes in the network so in the in the
original network so if the network
becomes really large this might actually
not be practical so in addition to
package information to implement other
gossip algorithms you might do that
graph information or network information
Andy in the first in the first partner
nearly or not so yeah the fact that you
don't need network information that's
awesome he don't add and I'm a yes yes
exit so so here's here's something
dynamic networks and and kind of this is
actually there's a work started so there
were a bunch of this way the people
Nancy lunch &amp;amp; Co who had this incredibly
nasty network model okay we're in each
round the network can change completely
it's no relationship between how it's
now and how it's in and they even had an
adversary who looks at how the messages
have spread and then decides the network
to screw you over and what they had is
kind of this the only restriction say
had you need some connectivity
restriction otherwise he always gets the
empty network it was always connected
and they were looking at if you forward
things how quickly can you do it turns
out it's horrible it's basically N
squared to send any messages just
flotsam one by one it's incredibly slow
and never according yeah actually never
coding does it perfectly for you get see
best times that he can be adnan namely
linea what you can get it's just keeps
being a line so yeah so here's these
highly dynamic adversarial networks
topology chain can change completely of
an adversary is trying to screw you over
and now you just throw in some
connectivity constraints or something to
you know particularly if if that versuri
has to choose an expander but you can
choose any expander at a difference by
each exactly you can still
with the time looking exactly yeah this
was all right original tearin' this
authority or in prime I don't know if
you just said good or if my slides are
designed so well that it's kind of clear
what comes next item I don't know one of
the two but yes exactly this is exactly
what comes so just a simple example
before that you had one fixed topology
in Boston expander now we it can change
from one step to the next and we allows
the adversary to look at what has
already happened and designed the next
thing and if you go back to the analysis
we really don't care the only thing that
we've used is this randomness of sister
owns that I need to that I put into
choosing the message the Islamic says
some cut and I will comment I it grow
sets the expansion and half of these
nodes will learn about it and that it
changes from one room to the next I
don't I don't care I'm said that in
order to apply seven second step someone
have to encode the addresses of my
neighbors in the original rumors to be
spread but it's an effort changes you
can't do them and in that i'm not sure
if you're talking about part 1 all right
wow this is what my do was saying before
those are different in part one you do
do that here he's not here you don't do
it so the only things that you have is
this header information in which you
have identify as for the or spots for
the one coefficient per message right
and so it doesn't those have nothing to
do visit apology actually the turns out
that's a completely different topic said
when you get these random linear
combinations they do have something to
do with the topology right because the
topology influences how this thing we
can actually infer some parts of set
apology from so this like network
tomography this network coding but if
the network changes completely from
every rounds and actually what you get
will not tell you anything about so the
here here here there is no he is a snow
the network structure is completely
that's a nice thing about network coding
right it's completely oblivious to
everything right I don't know how the
network nodes I don't know where things
are supposed to flow and that's also
what makes it robust right because what
I do is always the same and if there
happens to be a pass here is and all the
degrees of freedom Aussie yeah all the
new directions that I have a flow along
this path now if this pass failed it's
blocked somebody else can come something
absent then they flow here and that
recording doesn't really care right it
always does the same thing completely
ignoring who's talking to what the
topology is why why it only has to be
five once no fight at any time always
always yeah or every other time I mean
you can you can arbitrarily relax these
things but yes it needs to be that's
kind of the easiest restriction you guys
any instruction in this word and sit
somewhere within every in exists every
every time okay yes yes I meant every
that's absolutely right okay um perfect
so that's that's basically it so let's
its kind of quickly rapid up over the
last few minutes ah we've talked about
gossip and I've shown you two different
things the first thing is on you know
whom to contact in order to spread
things in a network even if you have
bottoms and basically as is really
simple template and it just works and in
particular it works without
randomization which is very nice even so
it's kind of more complexity actually in
reality it's also nice because you kind
of at least some of these papers try to
model what is going on in nature and
sure if I don't know who I'm contacting
saying ever contacting supper venomous
maybe you know for the irritations
that's a nice choice but it's much nicer
to say that I do it in some way might be
venom my but it's certain
not uniform even and right I don't care
I'm guys not to have an error
probability associated with each stage
you say each stage is very likely to
succeed I'm going to run this forever
into the future now you're going to take
the Union bound over infinitely many
copies of this thing that too yeah and
the other nice thing because it's so
natural and it doesn't really matter
what to how in which order things happen
how communication takes place say all
that they also extremely robust against
like links going up and down notes going
down forever many of many of seasons um
they completely didn't tell us about
that you said that apology was fixed yes
I didn't I didn't tell you I mean these
I mean this general I make some friends
and talk to my friends this template
provably Brooks in in many failure
models but then as long as it doesn't
change too fast as long as vollis it
apology changes completely it will kind
of restart itself and work on the new
topology to keeps changing to
drastically than this provably I suppose
nothing you can nothing you can do I
mean I analyze it changes on a time
scale which is shorter than the amount
of time for you to transmit information
to this all your neighbors all your
neighbors I mean the trivial things you
can say right for example this protocol
takes log square time if the network
changes comp drastically in the
frequencies as small as in every log
squared rounds you will make progress or
like every other round right because it
will be bunches of times there you have
so that's 44 topology changes for links
links going down let's say venom lee and
not adversarial e because you don't
really care when in which order you talk
two notes you just care that information
spreads within this friend networks in a
reasonable speed like you can tolerate
constant constant link random links that
go down or you can something super
constant then you just I mean the time
goes down by 1 over 1
minus P the piece of failure probability
just because the capacity of the network
goes down axis you can tolerate some
adversarial notes going down but not
more than one per time step just because
I can always bring down so I mean
especially if you have a deterministic
algorithm I can always bring down the 1
nodes that you're going to talk to next
so yeah I mean it's also kind of things
you can prove but then they if you want
to prove such things you need to kind of
make a failure model making good failure
model to all right i mean the things
like told you is basically the things
you can get and you can get some very
quickly very easily in general kind of
sexy intuition is if it works against
all these fairly add artificial failure
models it probably works against
realistic failures even though i don't
know how to model them okay and the
second thing I showed you is is well net
recording wasn't really my idea but a
way of how to analyze it very nicely as
this projection analysis it essentially
reduces the whole analysis to just
understanding the case of what happens
to one message if it gets sent every
time I can and then the only additional
thing I need to understand is what is a
tail bound in this epidemic process but
it's in general and much easier
questions it gives these optimal bounds
which FC is really nice perfectly
pipeline formed in most cases it extends
to highly dynamic networks it actually
has plenty I mean it's so simple that
you can extend it in many many ways a
bunch of them I couldn't show you one
thing I really like is you can use it to
get a very low complexity network coding
scheme so instead of net recording
really you keep all the packets that you
have received and he quotes them
together so you need to store them you
know if you're talking about
distributing video file you need to
store all these things even if you're
not interested in the coding every time
send a new new packet you need to access
all of them and coach them together it's
really necessary turns out now keep five
of them you update them accordingly it
still works beautifully and you can use
projectional our sister cooks that it
works you give some insights as all the
different papers on on capacities of
radio networks or you can prove set say
it's a network coding gap in radio
networks organ coating helps over
routing and many many other things and
hopefully there's more to come and this
is the end of my talks thank you very
much more questions many many videos are
there flooding things and I need to keep
files than what was the number five no
like 11 Burke's land to one works if you
want so the the paper says like one
packets of Pfizer's in reality you know
like if you do one you get penalized by
a factor of two or something and if you
take 5s and get penalized by a factor of
two to save my have 1 + 2 to the minus 5
or something then that's I mean in I
guess in and practice you want to all
these models these theoretical models
are usually nicely behaved in the sense
that you model communication events as
random events so that they are fairly
smooth I mean the number of times you
talk to boys versus I I talk to you this
kind of you know venom but therefore
highly concentrated and roughly the same
in reality sinks come a little bit more
bursting right and if i send you first
ten things and then you send 10 things
to voice but at every time you only
remember five things the throughput is
going to be five right because you
basically act as a storage in the
network so in practice you want to keep
the number of packets
something around two variants of C was a
burstiness also traffic so that you have
enough storage in the network I mean
it's yeah but a small number of packets
