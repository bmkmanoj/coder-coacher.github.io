of computer systems and more abstractly
computation so it's about how we think
about the world in a computational way
just as I think it's just as we kids
learn about physics because it's part
their world is governed by physical laws
so increasingly our world is governed by
digital laws I think it's important that
every child knows something about how
that world works and the laws the
government
right so that the computing at school
working group to give it its original
name is just a bunch of concerned
individuals it's very much a grassroots
organization started in 2008 there were
just kind of four of us in the room and
we were more less thinking it everybody
seemed to believe at the time there was
something wrong with ICT education in
boonton but everybody kind of feels
powerless because the educational system
has set up such a lot of inertia so Kaz
is simply an attempt to bring together
all the people who think there is
something wrong we should do something
together to fix it and try to do
something to fix it so the first thing
we have to do is to figure out well what
is one what what what is a I said as a
word diagnosis not of the symptoms but
of the disease so in the end we figured
out that what it was is that weed over
time and for quite well meaning reasons
computer science education has shifted
or computing education and Burton are
shifted from understanding quite a bit
about programming quite a bit about
understanding how computer work this is
this is back in the late eighties EO of
the BBC micro and then for the best of
reasons we'd slipped into increasing
focus on applications and at the same
time pcs came along so people it wasn't
sort of less hands-on at the hardware
level so that we spend more more of our
time focusing on how to apply and use
computers which is of course very
important but we somehow lost completely
the idea about studying computation
itself or how computers work and that as
it were decoupled the applied end from
the underlying discipline so what Kaz is
fundamentally about is introducing
computer science as a discipline at
school level in the same sense that
maths and physics are disciplines that
is they have an underlying ology body of
knowledge assets of principles and
fundamentals that last four years at
computer science curriculum that schools
should be recognizable ten years ago and
will be recognizable in ten years time
it's specifically not technology-focused
it's to give you equip you for life if
you like that's the mission
one of the huge wins his cast is it it's
very much a bottom-up organization and
then people just roll up their sleeves
and get on with it and that's very
liberating because instead of being sort
of top-down you have to wait for
somebody to tell you what to do then you
know Elinor Donahue runs a hack to the
future day and it's just an enormous
success and greenview is running hot
days in environment it's all just
individuals doing things i was at paul
clark session about you source he
single-handedly has built a system for
teaching programming to school kids
there's now been used by thousands of
school kids around the country just
amazing so but that sort of grassroots
sense and kaz includes not just teachers
but IT professionals of which paul is
one school governors members of
professional bodies members of example
awarding bodies are also member so it's
very broad organization and that gave us
a lot of credibility than we joined up
with the BCS who are umbrella
professional body and together we have
started to have quite a bit of impact at
national level but that impact comes
entirely from the credibility we have
coming from this glass which connection
people believe us because they know that
thousands of school teachers or a
thousand school teachers are involved in
casts that makes a huge difference
what's happened in the last so we've
been we've been in the last few years
we've been making the case to a national
level for computer science to be
considered as a school subject that
every child should have access to not
just as a specialist geek subject but
from primary school onwards but it was
not until Eric Schmidt made his speech
in late August that the door was really
as it were kicked wide open that brought
it onto the national radar in a way that
we are not being able to do up to that
point but we had been poking quite a lot
so then it was a great surprise and and
and thrill actually when Michael Gove in
his speech at bet explicitly articulated
the case for computer science as a
discipline at school that's a bit of his
speech that I love most of all and since
then there's been a lot of media
coverage all the awarding bodies who had
already been talking to but they they
have come out with GCSEs in computer
science which is fantastic because
without the GCSE you just can't teach
the subject people listening to this may
not know that three years ago there were
no GCSEs in computing at all none zero
if there was zero you can't
it is as simple as that there were a
dozen in ICT so this imbalance so it
wasn't that it's not that ICT is all bad
is just that we got out of whack we just
need to rebalance the situation and
having all these new JCC's is just
fantastic
the bottom up nurse
sometimes I finish after can keep
reminding everybody particularly people
who are new to cast that there is no
central organization with a head office
and three or four members of staff who
were busy doing stuff Kaz is consisted
almost one hundred percent of volunteers
has been a lot of support from bcs and
we do actually employ Simon Humphries is
a coordinator for days a week but but
that's incredibly small for a national
movement ninety-nine percent of the
energy and cast comes from its members
so it's it's like an organization that
has that is all periphery and no Center
and so the little bits of stuff that we
do as it were the center that I do as
chair and not telling people what to do
law that they're saying based on all the
stuff that I'm getting from you now I
can go with a certain amount equal
ability to Ofsted to the Department of
Education to awarding bodies and say
look this is what the country needs and
we have probability to back that
Kaz is changing the world unusually for
organization of volunteers we've caught
the wave and were in a position to make
a decisive and lasting change in our
nation's educational system and that
chance does not come by very often this
is your chance to become part of the
party just join anybody can join and
then you just roll up the sleeves and
get on with it because that's what
everybody else in cares is doing
