Heather Ford so Heather comes is coming
all away from the UK and I love
Heather's work because we also first
became friends online for internet
friends first but she wrote in a really
amazing essay that I think everyone's to
read and it's called the missing
Wikipedians and I think she was one of
the first people to really sparked the
conversation about who has authority to
edit Wikipedia and what well how do we
define the authority one of the time how
do we measure authority right and so her
work has really been pushing this
question for the last 10 years and she
is also the het the co-founder of
Creative Commons in South Africa and she
is also a web queen for many nonprofits
and you should also ask Heather about
the time that she was in jail but in the
meantime we are going to hear about
place and Wikipedia you're not going to
have anything about that thank you so
much Tricia and so I by the way I've
totally changed my mind about what I
wrote in the missing wikipedians um yeah
you could do that apparently can't
but anyway so the story I'm going to
tell is on the twentieth of November in
2011 i arrived in nairobi i was working
before I went to Oxford for an
organization called o shaheedi and we
were trying to figure out how to develop
software to enable people who are
usually geographically distant from one
another to collaboratively curates
stories especially about big
international news events like
earthquakes and you know small things
like that and so when I first arrived I
went to the supermarket and I bought
every copy of the local newspaper and it
was actually a really big news day in
Kenya at the time so almost well all of
the newspapers ran these huge headlines
about the invasion of southern Somalia
and they all had these big pictures of
tanks and my guys with guns you know the
things that you see usually when people
go to war and so I went and looked at
the Wikipedia page about this because I
was curious about whether someone had
actually created an article and I was
taken to an afd if T is an article for
deletion where someone in the Wikipedia
community can nominate an article for
deletion and the FD was by an editor who
who was saying that this fails
wikipedias notability requirements and
that's the the story was actually it
wasn't really an invasion I was actually
incursion and I quote this kind of thing
happens in that part of the world all
the time actually I used to be really
mad about wikipedians but now I feel
quite differently because in the next
few days I became steeped in the
narratives about this event and I became
steeper than through watching television
and true watching Twitter and Facebook
and having conversations with people in
bars and listening to people on the
street and what I learned is that
actually these there are three key
narratives about this event that people
weren't really hearing people outside of
this physical location and the three are
basically the first is that this was a
story about the Kenyan military for the
first time since independence the Kenyan
military was involved in an active
campaign the whole of Kenya was watching
the military because they used to make
terrible jokes about them and say they
were fat and lazy well some people did
but not you mark no we do have a real
Kenyan in the room so yeah I hate it
when that happens so so the whole
country was watching to see if they
would actually succeed the second was
that this story was actually preempted
by a whole bunch of really harrowing
stories about foreigners and locals
being kidnapped by the al-shabaab
terrorist group that was that was what
the military was trying to reach out in
southern Somalia and actually all this
was happening in the east of Kenya which
is one of Kenya's major tourist
destination so that's a second narrative
the third narrative is that there were
actually real threats of retaliation by
al-shabaab they say this is basically
Kenya at war with us and we're going to
retaliate I was sitting in a bar later
that day and I heard so I was talking to
my friends and I was a Friday night and
I said oh my god there's like no one
here wow like i thought you know
Nairobi's hip and happening place and
they said to me oh actually oh and
everyone was told that they shouldn't go
out and actually they shouldn't go out
of bars so I was thinking yeah I wonder
why we're actually at a bar and they
were like oh you know whatever and
actually later that night there was a
big bomb explosion I retaliated
retaliation attack in which two or three
people killed and let's just happened
like a mile from where we were
so what I realized when I was
interviewing people with opinions about
this and many other stories that that
are similar to this is that there's
actually these kinds of narratives are
what wikipedians outside of Kenya and
most of whom live in the US and Western
Europe don't actually hear and that
these narratives don't actually travel
well and they don't travel for three
reasons I like the number three as you
might have guessed the first is the
volume of international news is
declining at least in the West and this
means that the story that the waste
analysis were getting was just the
single story the story that I told in
the beginning basically about this
incursion / invasion and where there was
gaps people basically you know filled
out those gaps by associating this with
the war in Somalia which was a big story
that people kind of knew about and had
been going on for a while thank you the
second is that much of the local media
that Kenyans actually exposed to like
the radio radios really big television
actually newspapers are increasing in
Kenya and the and of course these
stories on the streets were not
accessible online which is where
Wikipedians mostly find and their
stories and the third is that even when
front pages of news or even when you
know these Kenyan websites did actually
portray the news that was happening
websites are really bad actually at
understanding how notable important an
event is in a international context so
you know on a headline if when I went to
the supermarket I saw five physical
newspapers all with really big headlines
that look different from the usual daily
newspaper but usually newspapers don't
actually have those kinds of clues and
so I don't think that all week opinions
are bad especially those who come from
which would be terrible because you guys
mostly do but it basically made me
realize that it for wikipedians is
actually really important for them to
expose themselves to social media
because social media is actually the
place where people highlight these
background contextual stories and that
Wikipedia is generally really against
using social media sources but actually
as a background to these kinds of
narratives are really important for us
to try and get a sense of what local
notability actually is because we can't
really have this case where as one of
the people contributing to the AFT
discussions said Wikipedia is not just
for Americans or Wikipedia is not for
Americans only thank you Thank You
