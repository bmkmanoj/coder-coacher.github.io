hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
I'd like to start with a question why is
it so important for you to be able to do
a good poster presentation I've got
three quotes to show you what sure hope
might explain why you need to be able to
do it well the first one really says
that it's a great opportunity for you to
meet people face-to-face to build your
professional network and to showcase the
research that you've done the second one
is something that Simon Peyton Jones
said yesterday and I would say that the
same applies to a poster presentation
that it gives you access to the world's
most priceless commodity the time and
attention of people and while the skills
that you need are different when you're
doing a poster presentation the outcome
should be the same that it's it's a
wonderful opportunity for you to start
to build your professional network and
to raise your profile in the academic
community so that's really why it
matters and why you need to do it well
anyone recognize this yeah were you
there last week you were I don't think
that's a picture of this year somebody
else knew that that danyoung know
somebody knew it was Glastonbury well
Glastonbury is the UK's largest open-air
Music Festival and last week Ben you're
in a crowd of I gather 175,000 people
over four or five days were you there
for the whole thing you were working all
day very often it's a very muddy
experience I think it was pretty good
this year pretty good weather and they
get bands from global superstars like
last week they had the the Rolling
Stones there's the big showcase packed
two other bands who are less well-known
or just starting out on their career and
then some acts who are just completely
unknown and just just there to
really enhance their profile but they're
all competing for an audience and the
biggest slice of that audience that they
can get and in that sense I think it's a
little bit like a poster presentation
session but on a slightly smaller scale
you're also competing for the attention
of your audience why should they stop at
your poster rather than the next one
will they stay until you actually until
you've had the chance to explain what's
on your poster will they just move on so
what you need to do just as all the acts
that blossom we need to do is find a way
to make your poster and your
presentation really stand out now part
of that's to do with the poster itself
that the quality and the attractiveness
of your poster should be able to pull
people in to grab their attention and
make them want to find out more and then
you entice them to stay by the way in
which you interact with them and the way
in which you explain your poster and
build a rapport with the person who's
come to see you so what a question for
you and I'd like you to discuss it for a
few minutes in groups of about five or
six you might need to huddle together a
bit more from what you've seen and
experience this week in the poster
presentation sessions can you identify
one thing that has made a poster or the
presentation of it really stand out and
made you want to find out more about
that poster and that research okay so if
you can sort yourselves into groups of
five or six and five minutes just to
discuss and then and then report back on
one thing that you think has made the
poster presentation stand out yep okay
catchy title on the poster were there
any that you thought oh that's a really
good title what's what makes a catchy
title
okay not too technical yes okay so short
catchy title that is aimed at a more
generalist audience than a very
specialist audience okay let's go to the
group here Ben what the group that you
were in there what did you come up with
immediately tells you why okay something
that provides the context and the
rationale for the research okay right
what about in the middle here you all
one big rig together Rule two groups
okay
behind interesting for me this year I've
seen more demos than I've ever seen
before as part of the poster
presentations you're people who had
their laptops and their notebooks and
things with them or little gadgets that
they could demonstrate things with and
that makes things different doesn't it
make things stand out okay let's go to
Ben hot yogurt
how does that come across thank you you
can see when you walk around if some
speakers already having a presentation
of giving presentations somebody else
who can I guess you can directly tell if
it's she's committed to the presentation
on that yes okay so a real passion for
the for the subject of the research and
a desire to communicate it to others yep
okay let's go to the front what did you
come up with evolve your groups
perhaps the results in the more
graphical form okay yes yes
so the visuals are not just there to be
to make it interesting but to actually
aid the explanation and aid
understanding yep okay
Alexei your group oh sorry with me the
same group okay next group yes in the
middle red jumper sorry I don't know
your name okay have we missed anything
so any other group got anything that we
haven't mentioned okay what forum what's
come out it's clear that a successful
poster presentation it's a double act
it's you and the poster you can't rely
on the poster to do all the work for you
but you can't do all the work without
the poster you have to work in harmony
the poster has to work for you as you
explain clearly what your research is
all about and where you're at in your
research now I think that if you have a
weak poster that if you're a good
presenter that can compensate for it now
you talked about enthusiasm and and
excitement passion and if you've got
that and if you're able to communicate
face-to-face very clearly that can to a
degree make up for a weak poster but if
you've got a strong poster and you don't
present it well I'm not sure that works
that equation really isn't successful
would you agree yep okay so what I'm
going to do is look at five things that
would will really make you stand out as
a in a poster presentation session the
first is to have the right mindset the
second is to start off the right way the
third is to have a satisfying
conversation not a lecture
the fourth I've forgotten what the
fourth is now Oh missed one oh yeah
fourth is the poster itself a high
quality poster and the last one is
making a good final impression the way
in which you end your conversation with
an individual so going to look at each
of those so the first one is your poster
itself and that's the starting point for
you as you get ready to do a poster
presentation and I think these are
really that the key points that you need
to bear in mind when you're preparing
the first is that you have to know your
audience as with any kind of
professional communication who you're
speaking to will determine what you say
and how you say it and with your
audience whether they are specialists in
your field or specialists in a related
field or whether there are more general
audience you need to know that in
advance so that you know what to put in
there it will influence the content it
will influence the level of detail in
there it will have influence the kind of
jargon that you put in and the amount of
jargon that you have to explain it will
also influence the amount of context
that you have to give for
non-specialists to be able to access the
details of your poster and also whether
they are an audience of speakers of your
own mother tongue or whether it's an
international audience if if your
audience are looking at your posters and
reading them in a language which is
their second or their third language you
may also have to think about some
techniques in writing it which make it
easier for non native speakers of the
language to understand just out of
interest when you do posters do you
always do them in English or do you do
them in other languages too Bernhardt
always English yep you're the NADA for
me today anyone else do post-its in
other languages than English no always
English okay
so the second thing is to follow
instructions very often when you are
asked to present a poster at a
conference you will get specific
instructions from the people hosting the
conference and in this case you got some
very specific instructions from
Microsoft on what your poster should
look like and what it should include and
it's very important that you read and
you follow those instructions they will
give you helpful guidance but they may
also be important instructions for the
people organizing the conference the
next one is to make sure that at the
beginning of the poster you give the big
picture the context so you're starting
with a general picture before you get
down into the detail and that's that's
really important but it's especially for
people who are reading your poster and
are not experts in your field balancing
the text and the visual so you said evil
that visuals are important there
sometimes just as a way to help to
explain your results and I've I think
I've read that a good rule of thumb for
the amount of text on your poster is 300
to 500 words but actually 500 words is a
pretty crowded poster with a lot of text
on it and I would say the closer you can
get to 300 words the better I read a
quote on a website the other day which
said an uncluttered poster is a sign of
an uncluttered mind and that's the
person I want to talk to that was a
nekkid academic on it on a website
writing about posters so you need to
keep your poster simple both in terms of
the amount of text you put on there and
the the quality and the size of the
visuals that you put on there
think about how your poster is going to
be used now in this case you with your
posters for about an hour and a half but
after this event I understand they're
going on the website so they're
available to other people to read
without you being there to explain them
and if they have to stand alone like
that then it seemed very important that
you have enough information in the text
for people to be able to follow it when
you're not there to explain it it may
also be your poster is is up at the
conference but you're not there you know
you've you've walked away people may
actually choose that moment to come and
see your poster they feel happier just
being able to read it in peace without
you looking over their shoulder and then
they may you know wait for you to come
back to explain it but they just want to
be able to read it so it's important
that it does stand alone and that when
you're reviewing your poster that's a
really important criteria to think about
think about yes the quality of your
visuals I like Thomas's poster here
because the visuals were really
high-quality he'd used photographs which
looked great and a lot of you had done
the same thing but they really do have
to be high quality they have to be big
enough to be seen from a distance they
have to look up to date I would say get
rid of those little stick men that came
out on PowerPoint in the 1980s that
really does look pretty dated now so
make sure that your visuals are as up to
date as your researches and that they
really enhance the the professionalism
that comes across in your poster we
talked about titles and you said at the
back there short snappy titles well this
was quite a risky title I thought Thomas
doesn't it so it's what a one-word title
I think it's probably the only title
that had a one the only poster that had
a one word title and it's a word that
doesn't really exist so it is risky in
that sense is that people couldn't you
know what's that about or they could
think oh I wonder what that's about
it's brave and sometimes you do have to
take risks like that there were other
titles that I really liked there were a
couple which were questions
somebody had are you browsing safely you
know a question actually addresses the
people in the room that's that's a
powerful way to use a title or things
which show progress I somebody wrote
from ego Network to social network so
you get the idea that your research is
actually moving something forward there
were lots of titles which started with
modeling creating any others that you
did that started with in computing yeah
what was your so much combining yeah now
last year I would have said good idea to
start with a verb in the title because
it makes the title very dynamic but
actually if 60% of the the posters have
a similar kind of style in the title
it's not going to stand out anymore so
you need to find something else another
another way to do it so short snappy
questions are the kinds of statements
something intriguing somebody somebody's
was War of the Worlds without Natasha is
Natasha here No
War of the Worlds as the main title and
then a subtitle under that so you know
just something which is going to
intrigue your audience and isn't too
technical for a generalist audience you
need to make sure that the the title and
the visuals and the headings can be seen
from a distance about two meters away I
would say so that people don't have to
come too close to decide whether they
want to view it further and have an
explanation so when you're reviewing it
put the poster up somewhere and then go
away come back and have a look at it and
feed does this really catch my attention
as I approach it anything else you think
makes a strong first impression when you
look at a poster anything we haven't
mentioned so far yes that's a good point
yes what what kind of colors do you
think worked
yeah yeah I would say a guideline about
colors is limit to them so those of you
who chose shades of blue or blue and
green or somebody used orange which I
thought was also quite brave but
actually when it was printed off it was
it was very eye-catching you want to
avoid the rainbow effect in colors so
use colors to make it look harmonious
rather than just to make it look like a
bit of a rainbow
I'd agree I tend to look for the
affiliation at the top but I know that's
some some people some templates that's
right you have to put it at the bottom
don't you max blank people do you have
to put it your name at the bottom so
sometimes you're restricted but ideally
yes I'd put it at the top yeah think
about the headings that you use within
the poster can you make them more
interesting than goal motivation results
can you use those headings to be a bit
more specific about what your goal is I
didn't see any of any that did that this
year but last year there was somebody
whose headings were things like network
hardware isn't what it used to be that
was one heading within the poster and
the next one driver developers can't
keep up hey so the headings actually
draw you in once you've got past a
catchy title some people put photos on
their posters what do you think of that
do you like that idea
I liked it it may be posed to see much
more friendly and it also means that if
your post
is standing alone if it is on a website
but you've met people already they might
associate the poster with you they
remember the face from the conference so
it can work that way
contact details also many of you put on
but not all and I think also that can be
quite helpful for your poster to stand
alone yeah make sure that you check it
that you check the spelling that you
check the grammar and that you check the
accuracy of the content and then get
someone else to do the same because you
don't always see the errors in what
you've written so yeah third party
opinion once you think it's finished is
really important don't send it for
printing until you've got that third
party opinion any other thoughts on
creating a poster that stands out yep
personally I find gloss finished quite
hard to read that sounds interesting yes
you end up you know squishing and you
end up with these lines on it where it's
being folded yes and then you ruin that
professional impact we've worked so hard
to create does I haven't seen Clough the
ones do they actually look smart and
professional yeah I haven't come across
that but that sounds like a good a good
way to go scarlet any thoughts on that
it does give a more Stern you look and
it does help with the first impression
two simple things is the way that
they're transported but yeah very
important okay people tend to the it's
like they want to reproduce their paper
with exactly the same structure and the
poster so they have an abstract an
introduction all related what section or
everything up to a conclusion so is that
something that we should do or shouldn't
I think it depends and it going right
back to the the first point here depends
on your audience you may decide that for
a particular audience that's appropriate
it may may be that if your audience are
specialists then that would be the
approach that's most helpful for them
that's what they would expect and it's
did the abstract in itself provides the
way in for them but if you are designing
a poster for a more generalist audience
you might need to think a bit more
creatively than that and actually
present your research in a completely
different way one thing that I read the
other day which I thought was
interesting was just flicking back to
this one but if you want to catch your
audience's attention then putting some
kind of a visual hook or or even a
question that catches people's attention
in the top-left corner it's a really
good place to put it
because in most cultures that's where
you start reading so if there's
something in that top-left corner that's
eye catching that can really work in
your favor so I saw it on on ploys
poster I'm sure other people did it but
hers was the one that that I picked it
out on
there's a very useful online tutorial on
designing posters for presentations on
this website Vitas is a local
organization that some of you may have
contact with it provides support for for
researchers and if you go to their
website there's a related link to an
online tutorial by the University of
Leicester and it really is very very
helpful on helping you with with layout
and coloring and amount of text and so
on so that's worth looking at and you'll
get these slides afterwards so you can
access that easily okay the next thing
that you need in order to make a
successful presentation is to be in the
right mindset Andy Murray our great
British Hope Wimbledon this year made it
through to the the semi-finals the other
day coming back from being down by two
sets and winning the match and one of
the commentators on the match after was
said well he just had a great mental
attitude and top sports people know that
that when you want to perform well is
it's as much in the way that you're
thinking about it as it is in your
physical fitness and your physical
performance and doing a poster
presentation is a kind of performance
you need to be in the right mindset to
do it well to convey that passion and
excitement and that that need to
communicate it with your with your
visitors so something so on the
left-hand side here you've got unhelpful
mindsets and if any of you had these
kind of things going on in your heads
I'm not going to ask you to raise your
hand but that very commonly that might
be all sorts of things that people think
on the right you've got some alternative
ways of thinking so the top one red
gives you positive energy gives you a
real drive to make the most of this
opportunity to build your profile within
this academic community to give it your
best shot
the second one that excitement
recognises that is not just about what
you
say it's about how you say it that
counts and if you're thinking the right
way if you're thinking that you're
excited about it then that comes across
in your face in your body language and
in the confidence that you exude and the
third one recognizes that this could be
an opportunity not just for you to give
information but for you to get some
ideas back that this is going to be a
two-way conversation so get yourself
into the right mindset before you start
keep that mindset I imagine you're
probably pretty exhausted as you went
through that an hour and a half session
some of you were busy from start to
finish and you have to keep on talking
yourself into feeling excited about it
getting ready for the next person who
wants an explanation then you need to
start in the right way that means before
anyone arrives thinking about how you're
going to manage the space that you've
got now some of you had better spaces
than others I don't know what you
thought of the space that you were
allocated sometimes it can work fine
doesn't require thinking about other
times it's a bit challenging to work out
just where to stand but what you need to
do is find a place where you can face
the traffic so you're facing out from
the poster so you can see people coming
past that you can smile and make eye
contact and look as though you want
people to come you don't stand looking
at your poster and you need to
continually manage your space you may
have thought at the beginning that you
were in a good place but as things went
on you realize you actually had to move
out I think Fiona you said that I didn't
you yesterday that you realized after a
while that you weren't standing in the
right place for it Fiona right you've
got the right person yeah you weren't
standing in the right place for you to
be able to accommodate more than one
person seeing your poster so you
actually changed your position didn't
you so that's important that you're
aware of the space second one positive
body language but you look as if you're
happy to be
there and you're there to stay so if
you've got a jacket over your shoulder
over your arm put it down if you've got
a bag on your back put it down because
they just make you look as though you're
passing through you want to get away
again and make sure you look as if
you're a permanent fixture careful
timing so when people come to your
poster sometimes they want to read it
first and sometimes they want you to
explain it first if somebody comes to
your poster and doesn't make eye contact
with you what do you do do you say
anything or do you just let them read
yeah I think in that case that's a wise
thing to do probably they just want to
read the poster but you mustn't let them
get away without speaking to them so at
a moment that you think well looks like
they've they finished now or they want
some explanation you look for a change
in the body language and then you say
would you would you like me to explain
anything to you see your time it
carefully also start with a question and
I was really impressed with a number of
you that did this really well
particularly on the second day on
Wednesday Wednesday yes most of you that
I went up to ask me about my experience
my background so you know then how to
pitch your explanation how much detail
to go into how much jargon to use and
what to avoid
don't just launch into your lecture
about your presentation about your
research any other thoughts about how
you start off were there any other
challenges for you and starting off
okay let's go on next next point is
important that it's a satisfying
conversation and again I was really
impressed that this year how many of you
made this really ins into a two-way
interaction very very few of you just
lectured most of you waited for the
person you were speaking to you to come
in with questions and comments and ideas
it was great so some of the things you
need to do especially in a multinational
environment is make sure that you allow
people to tune in to your accent because
you all have different mannerisms when
you're speaking English just as I do and
when you're moving from one to the next
to the next to the next it takes a while
to tune in to the way that a particular
presenter speaks so what enables that to
happen better is your first few words or
your first few phrases are not the
important ones you don't go straight
into the detail you start off perhaps
with introducing yourself saying where
you're from what your background is you
ask a question of them so would you like
me to explain or what background worth
what expertise do you have in this area
so it's all just a small talk really
which has the purpose of helping the
other person tune in to your accent and
then you give a signpost language that
helps the other person to see where your
apps you might say things like the
objective of my research is to that's
signposting the detail of what's coming
next in that sentence or what we're
trying to ascertain is or the biggest
challenge that we faced is and all those
sorts of phrases provide signposts for
non-native speakers of English into the
detail of what you're going to say so
remember to allow that to happen
slow down whether you're a native
English speaker or a non-native English
speaker make sure that you speak
not just a conversational speed although
this is a conversation but you need to
slow it down especially if your audience
are not specialists in your field so
that they can grasp what you're saying
and have a to have an opportunity to
digest it and then you pause to enable
them to come in with a question or a
comment concentrate very hard
that's right really important yeah it
was quite a challenge for some of you to
make yourselves heard with all the
background noise and that's where the
next point comes in as well but you need
to find the right distance from the
person you're speaking to or from the
group of people that you've got in front
of you sometimes you may need to move
closer to make sure that you can be
heard and hear the other person but you
still need to respect personal space and
that's something which differs from
culture to culture so different people
have different ideas of how close it's
acceptable to stand to another person so
sometimes you just need to silently
negotiate that until you're both
comfortable with the space that you've
got
summer school every year there's a
discussion about the poster layout in
space and there will be some pool so
that are slightly disadvantage to some
others and only on one occasion I have
seen that perfect poster space and that
was an enormous conference center and a
nice where basically every kind of a set
of posters had one corner in a room and
they were like six posters displayed but
all four different poster sessions so at
any one poster session there would not
be more than one post them and in that
corner and then when I come out there
for the whole week but obviously that
needs these massive amount of space so
it doesn't seem to be in most cases an
optimal solution yes I think that's
right yes there's no point in thinking
of this is a disastrous space they've
given me this is never going to work you
just got to work with what you've got
and make the best of it I contact again
I was very impressed with the amount of
eye contact that that that was going on
between you and the people that you were
presenting to but there's a couple of
things to to remember here that if
someone comes to you and you're deep in
conversation with with one person then
someone else comes along make sure that
you at least make eye contact with the
newcomer so that they're aware that
you've acknowledged their presence
sometimes that's difficult because
you're in quite a deep conversation with
an individual but you need to also be
aware of what's happening around that
conversation and whether the other
people who might like to join in use eye
contact also to determine when you've
gone too far when you've gone into too
much detail for people or when they've
stopped understanding you you can pick
it up quite easily from looking at
people's faces can't you next use your
hands make sure that your hands are free
to gesture so I would say if you're
gonna bottle a lot of you were standing
with a bottle in your hands and I can
understand that you need it to have some
water but put it down when you're
actually in a conversation with people
so that
your hands can be used to reinforce and
explain what you're trying to say in a
multinational context that's really
important because your gestures are an
additional route to understanding for
people any comments any thoughts okay
just a few other things about this
conversation making sure it's a
conversation first be flexible you need
to be able to adapt what you say
depending on who it is in front of you
and the amount of knowledge and the
amount of interest they have so maybe
that you prepare an advance that you
have one version of your explanation for
people who just passed by really have
absolutely no knowledge of your subject
area but who've been drawn in by your
poster and then you might have another
explanation for people who have sought
you out specifically they've seen your
name on the list they're interested in
your research and they've actually come
to find you because they want to know
more about it so you have to be prepared
for that sometimes you can think on the
spot sometimes you actually need to
think that think that through in advance
make sure that when you're introducing
your research you give the big picture
and the context before you get into the
detail and that you give an objective
that's that's quite broad and what we're
trying to achieve is and then you might
get into more detail after that so big
picture then the detail we talked about
signposting language so things like what
we've discovered so far is or what was
surprising was or it was disappointing
that or the second point is and all
those kind of phrases that just
introduce what you're going to say but
don't actually give any content but they
really help non-native speakers to focus
on what's coming next some of you did
that very naturally and very well
watch out for jargon and abbreviations
which are in daily use where you work
everyone understands what well fol was
the one we were talking about yesterday
wasn't it but there were so many there
was what's a nurbs or something yeah I
can't remember but there were millions
and millions of acronyms and you need to
just take care with acronyms don't
assume that people will know the
acronyms that you use daily think about
your audience
test out acronyms if you said something
do you know what that means just make
sure that people stay on your wavelength
and if you can explain the acronym give
the full explanation first so my
research is about first-order logic
that's fol for short then that helps
people to maintain a level of
understanding watch out with acronyms in
your titles and in your headings because
that can be quite off-putting unless
they are really familiar to everybody
make sure you've got examples because
examples are what are going to bring
your explanation to life for people and
some of you use really good examples Ben
your example of the the airline website
was one which appeared on your poster
and then it helped you to to give a
clear explanation of what you're trying
to achieve and it was a good one to
choose because it's something that
probably most people have done you know
they've been on airline websites we've
got jingjing here no Jim Jim gone yeah
she was talking about making aeroplanes
and the different parts that go together
to make up an aeroplane and again that
it brings to life what her research is
all about or you can use or paint
pictures for people somebody I don't
know who it was was talking about
marketing revenue maximization who was
that yes and you talked about imagine
that you're targeting in your marketing
you're targeting women under 40 and
targeting men under 30 or something like
that so again just that you imagine that
use that kind of language or analogies
who was telling me about balls on
Springs yes sieve oh yes so we were
talking about genetics basically weren't
we but you started off with with balls
on Springs the idiots guide to your
subject area so you know find a
real-life image that somebody can relate
to listen and look so watch people's
reactions watch to see when they want to
come in and ask a question or make a
comment and invite them in Andrew Blake
standing what a great opportunity and
you wish the student would just turn and
grab that opportunity and the poster -
Andrew is there any kind of advice on
how you do that I mean if sometimes it's
useful to have a long conversation but
maybe better to kind of not not be too
long because you want to give the
opportunity I think is that eye contact
thing isn't it that you always need to
be aware not just of who you're speaking
to
but of who's around so keep your your
antenna attuned to the people who are
around and looking interested and then
you might say to somebody who's been
taking your time you might say well I'm
sure you want to go and have a look at
the other posters please don't let me
keep you you know something something
that's a polite and respectful but
finally find a polite moment to break up
that's a conversation yes you don't want
to miss opportunities like that this was
an I love this picture this is Fabio
Fabio here no Fabio gone they said this
is a real conversation taking place here
isn't it around his poster you know
Fabio it's just essentially listening to
what these other two people are talking
about that's great it's an opportunity
for him to learn what other people think
and he's in a good place to have eye
contact with both of those people final
impressions you want a smooth ending to
the conversation that you have you need
to end confidently so have some phrases
ready to sort of fade out of the
conversation not to do it abruptly so
just things like it's been a pleasure
thank you for stopping or you've given
me food for thought yes maybe just makes
the other person feel glad that that
they stopped and have this conversation
with you and then think about if you can
give them anything to take away are
there any freebies that you can give
them or just a business card
some kind of handout that were perhaps
give a little more detail I didn't
notice anybody doing that this time but
does anyone give anything at the end No
so we're thinking about because again
that's one small way at the very end to
make you yourself and your poster stand
out from the rest yes okay so those are
the five things to consider the right
mindset a poster that stands out a
confident beginning a satisfying
conversation and a strong final
impression it's not rocket science a lot
of its so just plain social skills but
it is a performance of sorts you need to
feel the adrenaline flowing you need to
realize that this is an opportunity a
professional opportunity that you need
to grasp but if you're able to channel
any nervous energy that you have
positively and focus on giving 110
percent on building
rapport and a relationship with the
person who's come to speak to you it
should be an opportunity that you end up
reflecting on really positively glad
that you did it and looking forward to
the next time that's why I'd like to
finish any questions any questions or
comments complicated I look at the
poster I ask myself what would I
remember of this poster in three days
yes and for all of us it's the truth
that this would be very very little it
will be no details it will be no text it
might be a picture it hopefully is the
idea this is actually only thing you
need to be you get across and it doesn't
matter where you stand how you put your
hands and what pictures he put in the
left corner yeah as long as you get the
ideas able across you're just golden so
this is all of this help of course but I
think it's this happening right I mean
there's some same similar way to Simon
PJ you're kind of said you want to get
this one idea across and your research
talk and you're putting the picture in
the right place being inviting being
ready when you're you're right
to agree I do agree with you but I think
that one thing that is important is that
it's not just about the poster and an
idea on the poster it is about you as
well and long after people have
forgotten what you said they'll remember
how you made them feel
and if that was a comfortable
conversation so it's an opportunity for
you to build your reputation and your
credibility as a person and a
professional I think it's worth really
taking into account all that the social
skills as well we do have one
collaborator
here in England Holly University is
as a student you're nowadays you have to
create your own brand even and I think
you know the a good presentation at the
poster helps you do that yes and I think
the other thing is that as I said your
poster has to stand alone as well so if
it's going to be on a website afterwards
or at a conference for the whole week
then people have got a chance to take
away more than just a main idea if they
want to they've got a chance to go back
and read it again and get some more
detail from it so it's important that
you are thinking about the detail as
well as the big picture so you don't
quite know where it's going to end up or
what effect it's going to have yep yep
how do you think in an international
conference if you at some point know for
sure that you share language with one of
you like with the current the poster see
this appropriate to switch that language
if you you know expect that he will be
both more comfortable with that is it
appropriate or is it kind of supposed to
be something I would say it's okay in
that it's it's it's an opportunity to
build a closer empathy with the other
person and that's really what you're
looking to achieve but I suppose the
caveat is if there are other people
around that don't speak that language
you don't want to be creating a barrier
and making other people think oh we
can't go there because he's speaking
Russian yeah anything else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
