you
yes xr6 professor Joe and wherever I'm
very glad to be here to present a
research progress into my university and
the partially funded by the microsoft
research and a global to new one is
ongoing project multi-institutional and
you know bring new efforts in china to
enabling the global change studies why
global changes are pretty hot terms
recently casa even though climb you know
changes in a jewelry but I recently the
ripta warming of the planet and you know
is changing atmospheric composition and
why did you know sought to be a due to
human activities that's reason for why
you know people so many efforts national
international folks on our climate
changes understanding the parts that the
common situations and the prediction of
the future you know conditions if we
just focus on the climate data you know
the part i would like to refer this a
specifically no documents jenison
overpeck publishes is a good prediction
on on a science affected 2011 and you
need a diagram he did a very good
predictions here we go the the volume
expect a volume of the climate data in
terms of you know observe it and also
motor output so as we can see that you
know the climate the data is a really a
big challenges for me to deal with if
you want really want to do the globe
change studies and here's a quote the
volume of the data you know creating a
very big challenges are very aspects in
terms of physical archive and sharing
and wealth ease of access
so here I would like to share you with
examples in with five simplified is a
couple of modern comparison project and
the use phase five to modernise enters
from worldwide you know he'll produce so
so far roughly about 1.5 peter by state
of model simulation takers and here
though you know the flow workflows we
see some problems with account debt
management with cimmyt five so basically
modernist centers need to house at the
data and available you know in a web
based environment and then the PMD I
enabling a higher level architecture we
call it gateway to on top of interview
that nodes to enable get a search and
you know integrated discoveries but
here's the exact workflows researchers
need to go to the PCM di Patil to find
out the data of interest and then go to
the interview tomo learning centers to
gravitate and our cap them in a local
environment and if each individual
research you know process so here is our
questions you know when the when the
future I mean current and the future get
a volumes and that will be produced by
them climatic changes do we really want
to transform the solar 21 on the data
online so that's the either one
direction's of our research the second
if we also focus on the lifecycle of
research process basically Teddy
discovery I kept them locally and then
finish analysis so so far we believe the
count the research paradigm we called
old paradigm is kind of this way
provided on the left and the user on the
right so provide a peso for three rows
and left all the others to put to you
know to be full through the public by
the others so that we can see users need
to download data and I can locally and
finish all the necessary process after
that so that's we called you know every
single okely and shared everything
locally owned and operated you know this
is the old paradigm so we believe a new
emerging a new emerging tech no problem
is out there we can see besides a
traditional rule of provider Yoder's we
also see that new root of integrators
they are not you know general then the
undoubted you know providers I mean did
not produce the research data an honor
hand they are not
you know not the consumers instead they
playing the city in the role and I try
to enabling easy of access provided some
solution and you know research research
environment and there you know
directions and the solutions so as we
can see this a new paradigm provided
steal food food and three roles I
capitator and the Met invaluable while
the integrators plays more roles they
making the data easy access and make the
you know research publications out there
so what you know laughs it for the users
we believe just focus on science for
this our inner dreams of this a new
paradigm the third direction is kind of
a reproducible research this is a
publication back to the 2011 it talks
about you know how and why research need
to be reducible this is a ritual for
research in computational science and in
this you know reproducible spectrum you
can see on the very you know left side
if we only publish our research result
as a publications this style is
definitely not reproducible so this a
point of view is very interesting costs
back to the you know scientific go to
standard research need to be reproduced
however if we only publish the research
results as we can as we do right now
it's not not reproducible or so totally
if we focus on a lifecycle data life a
software research and also focus on a
reproducible research that's the three
dimensions that we try to deal with so
global Ginuwine is a brand new efforts
inch in wine three and five other
institutions we're trying to build a
research infrastructure dedicated for
globe changing studies here's our vision
we believe such a research
infrastructure is vital and is dedicated
for the global change studies making
possible discovery innovations and also
accelerating scientific insights this
global chain one efforts we have some
you know important characteristics you
know data resource will be shareable
online and software packages and codes
and more importantly this will be a
integrated research environment for the
researchers to include between studies
and
we have come up with is a multi-layer
architecture on top on top of the
collaborative research partnership we
have established with some other
institutions we have also identified
some others and necessary functions that
we need if we focus on the computer
install the facilities so far we have
you know a purchase an untrusted you
know large scale computing facilities
and storages and web server dunk and the
computer node that's hard way apart and
we focus on the software part because we
right now we have four research strains
in the imaging waar remote sensing
global climate model ecological studies
and advocate of science so computational
system assigns collaborating closely
collaborating with for research strains
and we have identified those problems in
individual disciplines individually so
right now we are you know make some good
progress so far for the remote sensing
and for the global climate model
ecological studies and Atmospheric
studies and here i would like to
highlight our wrists in the most recent
effort to put a sim 85 on arrow this
would be a CI Sta data portal based on
the Windows Error public cloud you know
computing platforms simply five a terror
this a new effort with collaboration and
funding from Microsoft Research we're
just focused on the sea ice data and
we're so far we have archived all the
sea ice data produced by the modernist
centers till the signify during the
phase five of the same it under and then
we enable an integrated that archive
search and visualization and in the
comparison environment so powered by the
windows error so researchers who are
interested in the you know analysis of
the sea ice data could make go directly
to this data portal and i do not think
they need to download data locally
because we you know try to provide a
necessary functions out there so
everything should be work online and on
the fly basically the the sigma 5c I
said powder have a three you know three
tier architecture on the back and we put
all the cs data in era pura basura geez
and I
the middle we never a virtual machines
and try the term care than in car I mean
income online language in a job out
there to enabling in a virtual research
environment and on top of that we
provide a web interface on top of that
so the users may search search and
analyze and compare the sia stata portal
I guess I have so in more minutes I
would like to show this table to see
what I can do it
I guess I have some problem with copying
units uio but I guess so we can do it
later right okay because i have no
several more minutes basically this is a
brand new efforts on Windows Error we
try to upload the CSI de produced yeah
no notice woken up on a UI or coffee
cream oh you are no copies did it Judith
eran de competitive sure ok so basically
you know we archive the CI state have
produced by different modeling centers
worldwide and put them in a you know
windows error archive and then in the
morning of virtual environment on top of
that and then we enable an interface on
top of that so you just may interact
with the get archived and analysis
functionalities only I don't know what I
can do it you know there's a wireless
key right I guess we can't get into it
later okay yes we do how to videos no
thanks and so far we have enable that
this is three individual three types of
functions users may go that go to that
they're you know interface to search for
the CI state of interest and they may
define model and you find at the time
and meaning of each esta pÃ¡gina months
and animals and then they could you know
quickly realize that that of interest
and on top of that they could have
selected a little angel video data and
then do the intercomparison so get a
search realize it in a comparison are
well done on this on this windows
8-based interfaces so I believe people
however interested in the CI state
analysis could go to the photo directly
and fulfilled and Edison online so we
hopefully these are you know brand new
efforts will make easy folder for the
scientists to analyze the CI side
produced in a semi five so far
I would like to share with you my
lessons learned from these activities we
believe focusing on a life cycle of just
not only the research data but also the
research process is a very important and
the reason we have some medicines to do
and also besides rooted in a rule of
providers and the others we believe an
integrated row is very important how do
we make it easy for the interview
communities and a third we believe a new
web and a service centric paradigm is
pretty important and is emerging I
believe that's part of the reason that
we are sitting here today sharing the
research data and also the researchers
that results is not it's not it's just
the beginning I believe the fundamental
goal is to share the research process so
we know the stories working behind the
scenes and that's the reason we could
promote promote the reproducibility of
research process to use science on you
know on the cloud is our beautiful
however I believe no nobody want to
change the environment to do the
migrations from time to time so we we
argue that provide a you know web-based
cloud-based research environment and
that is users a very familiar voice is a
key to bring and attract scientists to
doing scientists in this new paradigm I
mean instead of focusing on the research
environment trying to leverage the
resources on the cloud but we need to
provide a research in your arm that is a
very that they are familiar with so
that's reason in this sea ice data
portal instead of a leveraging the brain
knew the program model like worker on a
weber rose we also enable in virtual
machines and enable in carmona languages
called these other languages that
researches for doing you know simple
file and analysis working all the day in
a low-key environment so we couldn't
them a very long list that we need to
sing star here I just never feel thanks
Tony here for business deliver and talk
again and you know pro nahar horizons
and sexy and Dennis for their you know
support alpha F
on the experiment on online and and also
we need to sing those who make the
connections like a mystery and a camping
and a thinking and with that I'm really
funny questions thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
