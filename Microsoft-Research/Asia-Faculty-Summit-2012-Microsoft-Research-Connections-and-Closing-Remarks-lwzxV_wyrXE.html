president of microsoft research
connections to present his closing
remarks thank you very much thank you so
it's a great pleasure to be here it's
the my second visit to nan Chi and
Tianjin within 12 months and it's a
great pleasure to see you all here so
I'm in charge of what we call
connections it's the part of micro top
research which works with universities
around the globe so i get to see
research around the world this is the
slide that Rick usually puts up which is
Microsoft researchers mission statement
which hasn't changed in 20 years and
advancing the state-of-the-art
transferring innovative technologies
which you heard from Peter and ensuring
that Microsoft has a future we have a
worldwide present and we now have a new
york lab which I don't have a photo
because we haven't got a place yet but
almost and what I do is I'm privileged
to do the part of Microsoft Research
which engages with universities and
faculty around the world so I get to see
amazing people at amazing universities
around the world and it really is a true
privilege and for that we work with
Microsoft researchers in microsoft
research installations around the world
and plan matchmake with researchers in
universities and for example in the
demos tomorrow you'll see some of the so
amazing things that they're doing for
example with Kinect in some of the
demonstrations you'll see and I saw some
amazing demonstrations today and
secondly lastly we do work with research
groups to help enhance the tools to help
different communities different
researchers do their work so for example
we've worked with the machine
translation group to produce a kit so
unusual languages for example we were in
Mexico by now trying to work with the
Mayan community doing a Mayan
translation system it's never going to
be high on a commercial basis but it's
very important for the region and we're
also doing things like Nepalese and in
Russia in the Russian USSR there was the
state called Tula and we're doing tuvan
to english so all sorts of interesting
things and that we're doing around
languages around software engineering
and machine translation really exciting
stuff so we divide our activities into
these sort of five themes in computer
science there's the core computer
science activity software engineering
machine learning and so on a natural
user interface which is a subset which
we think is extremely important but it's
part of the general computer science we
also then have an initiative looking at
problems to do with the environment I
sometimes characterized China as being
flooded in the south and the desert in
the north and contemplating moving vast
amounts of water from the south to the
north huge environmental consequences so
can we make sure we can understand those
and minimize the consequences minimize
maximize the resilience and the
sustainability of such things and health
and well-being using computer science
technology such as machine learning such
as computer vision with medical images
and so on to actually try and do things
with the medical community and lastly as
you heard from anouk's panel education
and scholarly communication is going
undergoing a transformation and again we
have technologies that can play a role
in this sort of stuff so we see all
around us the changing nature of
discovery caused by in almost every
scientific field the amount of data is
increasing hugely whether it's from
sensor networks satellites
high-throughput instruments you name it
data is overwhelming scientists
and Industry and so we believe that the
nature of science is changing and Jim
Gray had this vision of the fourth
paradigm missus is a book in his honor
about data intensive computing where the
emphasis is how to deal with data rather
than how to program computers and it's
to be with complex models
multidisciplinary data and distributed
communities which bring challenges of
their own so just to give one example so
David hecka man who used to be lead the
machine learning group in Microsoft
Research Redmond is now leading what
used to be Jim Gray's group the e
Science Group and he's using machine
learning to tackle societal challenges
and with Peter I agree on some of things
with Peter I agree the world is four
quadrants mine has Pasteur's quadrant in
the corner but the point is that by
applying computer science technologies
to these areas with huge challenges I
think you learn new things so for
example in genetic and causes of disease
there's genome-wide Association studies
david hackman's group by working on that
problem with with biologists has
produced an algorithm a linear mixed
model which goes from a cubic algorithm
to a linear algorithm and that changes
the game dramatically it means that you
instead of sample sizes of only around
10,000 you can go another order of
magnitude and that really changes the
game and furthermore that improvement of
that algorithm will undoubtedly be
useful for product groups like being and
so on so I think that by studying these
problems you do learn new things and
we're using it to look at HIV AIDS how
that transforms and in Brazil we're
looking at seeing if we can assemble the
genome for sugarcane to make for example
varieties that are drought resistance if
in global warming or make more efficient
use of ethanol so that's one example of
computer science applied to a different
field and I think not only can you help
the scientists but also you can improve
your algorithms by
dealing with these challenges at scales
that you don't normally get in everyday
problems so i think that the vision is
really data-intensive science that data
is now becoming central to all that
scientists do and what we're trying to
do in our activities with science is use
technologies around the whole of the
data life cycle from acquisition of the
data whether it's from sensor networks
or whether it's from supercomputers and
modeling you have to collaborate you
want to visualize the data and then data
mining is really important data
cleansing and so on Shemp then you write
up the paper and you need to be able to
cite your data and look after the data
and share it with others combine it with
other people and finally to archive and
preserve and technologies from computer
science around the whole of the life
cycle are really exciting and important
so I'm not going to go in detail because
it's late and as far as I can see i have
minus five minutes of my talk so i will
find finish early but we've been working
with scientists on various techniques so
this is one which is using sharepoint
where users can put kits on top of
sharepoint to make what we call a
virtual research environment so with
Oxford they're using cancer imaging
speciality they're looking at x-ray
diffraction data in the University of
Delhi a little module that you've been
attached to this sharepoint kit so those
are some of the examples of
collaboration environments which
actually help the scientists do their
work when you've got big data you need
to analyze it one of the the earliest
things that work that we did in
Microsoft Research was a tool called
worldwide telescope now I should explain
to you that astronomers are very strange
people they classify each other in a
strange way they classify each other by
wavelength so there's visible
astronomers infrared ultraviolet x-ray
and so on and what this tool enables you
to do is to look at the night sky in new
ways by combining by looking at it in
the visible looking at objects in the
ultraviolet make
connections between them and it's a tool
that enables you to go in and out of
these data sets in new ways and
furthermore what you can do is tell
stories just like Vannevar bush in his
original as we may think article had
scientists following trails through all
this information similarly you want to
have experts showing you how to make
trails through this data and so tours by
leading astronomers in worldwide
telescope show you regions of high star
formation galaxy collisions black holes
and so on and they show you how you make
the inferences from the different types
of data that's out there so it's really
an exciting tool and for example in
planetarium I was in the Adler
Planetarium in Chicago and they now use
a digital display worldwide telescope
rather than the mechanical expensive
displays of the past and it's much more
flexible you can not only look at the
Stars you can look at the earth and so
instead of turning your telescope on the
sky turning the telescope on the earth
and this is showing seismic data plotted
on the globe and if vague nuh had had
this tool he would have had no
difficulty in convincing people that the
theory of tectonic plates you hear the
mid mid atlantic floor spreading and
round here is the Ring of Fire of which
Seattle is right on it and is overdue
for category 9 earthquake so by actually
providing new ways of doing this we're
allowing scientists to go and make tours
of the data now with earth data and so
for example there's a lot of debate
about climate change you can make
scientists give tours around the data on
climate change to come to one conclusion
but other scientists can do different
conclusions and you can put them up in
the cloud this is what this tool does
and you can share these tours and
discuss them so it's really about
storytelling with data now that's for
science but you can also do it with
history and one of the demos you'll see
tomorrow is about chrono zoom which
allows you to display across huge time
scales from the original the Big Bang
origin of the planet
the origins of life you can put geo
history bio history all sorts of
cultural history on the same plot and
look at connections it's what's called
the big history agenda and it's a very
exciting tool so I invite you to have a
look at that tomorrow so visualization
is not only in the sciences and
engineering but also in the humanities
and with big data you need tools to go
and explore that and also you need
eventually to save it though so this is
a tool that we've produced for a project
with NSF for the data one project with
the California digital library and it
enables you when you say data in Excel
spreadsheets if you want other people to
be able to use it you need to save a lot
of other stuff and this is a curation
package it's an add-on or a web service
that allows you to do that and so this
is just been released this month and
it's now an open source tool that you
can take and download and use and modify
and extend and so on so it enabled
scientists to curate their data so this
is a slide that comes from 2005 when I
joined Microsoft Research it was given
by bill gates at the supercomputing
conference and it was a wonderful vision
of how scholarly communication is
changing that you actually now with
electronic papers you can actually go to
the data you can interact with the data
you can add your own data you can
interact with the image you can run the
program that produce the image you can
rotate the image you can collaborate in
new ways and also besides citations you
can measure impact we heard about impact
in the previous debates you can measure
impact in new ways that you want to do
here so scholarly communication is
definitely under a revolution of its own
and finally when you published your
paper in these new ways you'll need to
preserve some of it and this stems from
the National Archives in the UK felt
they're facing a digital black hole
because they had all these electronic
documents in old formats how many of you
remember a word processing system called
WordPerfect some of you do all right
well what you do with the WordPerfect
file you need
be able to read it in 10 years from now
and so this is a tool that transfers it
to a modern XML format so various
formats office open XML you open
document format and in China UF they're
all xml formats you can have an open
source tool that takes you from one to
the other so this is a European project
which is with national libraries and
archives across Europe which offers a
translation service to preserve these
documents and this is another element of
the future I believe this is a European
project again again looking at various
applications in the cloud and again
tomorrow you'll hear a workshop led by
Dennis Gannon who's leading this project
in Europe about how the cloud can be
used in a variety of applications so
this project had a number of partners
all of which all of whom did a different
type of application and you can see how
it worked and you can talk with Dennis
tomorrow so this is a slide from Jim
Gray's last talk and it's his vision of
the future and I think it's a vision
that many of us share the literature is
increasingly becoming open access
there's movements around the world
making the papers the research papers
that your taxes and my taxes have paid
for visible without paying next to the
levy to a publisher and what you want to
be able to do is go from the literature
to understand the data on which that
paper reached its conclusions you may
want to add your data to it and make new
discoveries and so by combining and
using data and results derived from many
data sets you can make progress and not
reinvent wheels in the way that
scientists tend to do I see around the
world that many people repeat things
that have been done by other groups so
Jim Gray believes and I believe that
actually if we can get such a system
working we can have a great increase in
the science productivity the efficiency
of the whole scientific process it
literally is information at your finger
oops both from the papers you can find
easily and the data and about finding
papers one of the projects that we're
looking at with combat collaborating
with Microsoft Research Asia is on
academic search and the goal is to be
able to search not only in the computer
science discipline where we started but
all disciplines the sciences and the
engineering you can find in
multidisciplinary papers ultimately you
can go to the data you can find the data
and you can actually make a Jim Gray's
pyramid a reality using things like
academic search you can of loss cross
look like things like citation impact
and H indexes and all those things but
it has an API which enables you for
example nan Chi University could decide
it doesn't want to use the citation
impact for the h-index you want to have
another measure of impact and there are
various groups around world looking at
different impacts so a group in the
University of Washington called I ghen
factor there's something like PageRank
to actually figure out the true impact
of a paper the number of links pointing
to it and so on so you can write your
own with this API you can write your own
measure of impact for your University
and if you wish you can use it for
tenure decisions so research
accelerators were trying to work with
the different groups so we're working
with computer science groups with things
like languages like f sharp projects
with the software engineering group
turning your your mobile phone into a
tool for teaching programming because
many people will have smartphones but
may not have pcs anymore so can you
teach programming on such devices touch
developed tends to do that and so
there's a whole range of tools which
publishing research management learning
an exploration scientific exploration
and these are many of them available
actually in an open source form and so
you can now look at an organization
called the outer curve foundation and
it's it's repository for open source
codes and Microsoft Research
connections runs the research
accelerators gallery and these are some
of the the open source projects that we
have we've just added another one data
up is now in here chrono zoom is in here
for example so again one could actually
use and collaborate with academics
around the world building communities
around such tools or new tools that you
think are more important so to conclude
since i have 1 minute 23 seconds
remaining i think where we're moving is
towards a cyber infrastructure which is
more intelligent there's a database in
national library of medicine called
pubmed we're in pubmed the abstracts of
scientific papers in medical biomedical
area are deposited and they have two
papers per minute per hour per 24 hours
per every day of the year two papers a
minute are deposited and there's no way
you can keep up with that you need tools
to help you you need some semantic tools
and we here this is in the in the form
of of finding the user intent when
they're searching we need help with some
computers to do the inference and the
and the aggregation and the intelligent
data mining to allow us to make
discoveries to understand to find
needles in haystacks so I believe you'll
have some of these services running in
the cloud and some of them you'll have
locally exactly what the mix will be
will depend on your application but I
think that's where we're heading and you
see now semantics is increasingly one of
the words used in all the projects that
we're doing understanding from data
understanding from the welter of
information out there can we make
intelligent inferences from that data so
thank you very much for coming it's been
a great to see you all here and I'm very
grateful to be back in jan Jin thank you
very much
