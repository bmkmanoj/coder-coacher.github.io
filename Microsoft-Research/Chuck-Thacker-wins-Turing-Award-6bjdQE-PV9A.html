engineer he's he's the kind of person
that every time you see him he wants to
show you the new thing that he's built
the new thing that he's created I think
it's pretty fair to describe truck as
the engineers engineer he has an
enormous range of talents he can design
power supplies at one extreme and he can
write programs with interest in user
interfaces at the other extreme and just
about everything in between what I think
inspires truck is not just the ability
to create new things himself but to
create things that will enable other
people to create new things it always
feels like he's putting so much of his
own personal energy into everything he
builds you know he's so passionate about
it he cares so much about it he wants to
show you all the details of it when you
come to zia and it really shows the
things that he's created over the years
and if you go back to his early work on
the xerox alto the work on the ethernet
the work on the tablet pc be that
passion is evident in all of those
inventions working with chuck is a
pleasure i mean we sit down and we
discuss things we talk about things we
brainstorm he's a wealth of information
I'm amazed at how much he knows people
like Chuck never retire they keep coming
up with great ideas they're passionate
about technology they're always working
with younger people I think they they
challenged them to to keep coming up
with great ideas and driving our field
for words what draws people to chuck as
a mentor the fact that you know when
you're working with Chuck you're in good
hands I have always strived to make
simple designs and with Chuck that's
probably the most elegant thing that you
can do then he's most famous for of
course is having done the Alto which was
really the prototype
for all of today's what you think of as
normal personal computers it was the
first time that all the elements of what
we think of as a modern personal
computer were put together in a form
that would really capture people's
imagination after he joined Microsoft
the first major thing that he worked on
was the project for the tablet pc and i
think it's pretty fair to say that we
wouldn't have the tablet pc in its
current form if it hadn't been for
chuck's prototype work because it just
wouldn't have been possible to develop
the software he had taken a laptop he
served cut it and have he flipped it
over and he was showing me this new
software that he and some other people
that were working with we doing it it
was so exciting and I think it's that's
that's the experience I get every time I
talk with Chuck so Chuck could
absolutely like to offer you
congratulations both personally and from
all the folks you know at Cambridge
getting the cheering award is fantastic
recognition of all your lifetime
achievements well done chuck it I'm
really glad to be able to congratulate
you on having won the Turing award in
all I can really say is that it was very
much overdue congratulations on a
spectacular achievement that you might
very well consider the pinnacle of your
career but I know there's a lot of great
stuff still to come and I look forward
to being there to see it with you Chuck
the one thing I want to say to you as
you win this award is thank you thank
you for all the technology created
that's made my life better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
