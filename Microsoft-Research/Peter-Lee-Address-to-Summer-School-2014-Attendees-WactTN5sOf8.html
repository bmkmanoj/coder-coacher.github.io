you
it's my pleasure to introduce dr. peter
lee peter is my boss but he's also the
worldwide head of Microsoft Research so
as such is responsible for all of
Microsoft Research which is 13
organizations different parts of the
world Peter were used to be a professor
at Carnegie Mellon head of the
department is areas programming
languages and he was also a program
manager in DARPA and has a wide sort of
experience in leading research from
different perspectives but you know
without further ado we do so thank you
wow this is I feel like I'm commanding a
battleship here so it's good also I it's
a pleasure to be here and I didn't think
too much about what I wanted to say but
I thought the only thing I could do
maybe is tell you a little bit about why
I think computing research is so
important in such an exciting thing to
do right now especially right now the
only instructions i was given or just to
be inspiring and hopefully humorous and
i don't know if i can do either of those
things so so but at least try to fill
the time and then hopefully if you have
questions be open to taking some
questions so as on and on mentioned i
run microsoft research and i'll tell you
a little bit more a little bit about
microsoft research in some detail a
little bit later but for the moment the
only thing to realize is that Microsoft
Research is as a research basic
computing research lab housed within
Microsoft and I've been there for four
years and before Microsoft Research I
was at a government agency part of the
Department of Defense in the u.s. called
DARPA and
I was there for just about two years and
I'll say a little bit more about that in
a moment and before that I was a
professor of computer science at
Carnegie Mellon University and the and
in the end the head of computer science
at Carnegie Mellon and then finally
before that of course I was a student
and I was a student growing up you can
tell I'm Asian i'm korean by heritage i
was born in the US but Korean my mother
and father immigrated from Korea to the
US and then I was born and my father was
a physics professor and mother a
chemistry professor so I want you to
imagine I think it's probably the same
in India as it is in the US but Asian
household physics professor for father
chemistry professor for mother there was
never any possibility that i would be
anything but a scientist of some kind
and so and i think particularly i grew
up in a small town of us that where
there were very few asians and so I was
very very much destined to do this and
so in fact I studied hard I did well in
high school and then went to college and
started off majoring in physics now
before I went to college though in high
school I went to summer camps and one of
the summer camps that was most
informative in high school was an early
summer camp on computer programming and
this was very early days 1975 very early
days and I was exposed to computer
programming and I just loved it it I
just found it completely captivating and
I even then in high school I thought
maybe I would want to study computers
when I went to college someday and my
parents made it very clear to me that
computers were not a legitimate field of
study
you know that computers were only a tool
for the true intellectual pursuits of
physics mathematics and chemistry and so
when I went to college I start off
majoring in physics and I advanced very
rapidly through some courses in my
freshman year in my sophomore year I hit
thermodynamics and realized that that
was much too difficult and so at a great
disappointment to my parents I switched
my major from physics to math and and
became a math student now as I
progressed and completed my math degree
I finished my undergraduate degree in
math but I never really lost my
attraction to computing and in between
my junior and senior years in college I
started to do some undergraduate
projects with a professor at Michigan
his name's Eva plebon and ova was doing
this work on field of computer science
that you may or may not be familiar with
the called formal semantics and he
introduced me to the work of number of
people but most importantly for me the
work of Dana Scott and Christopher
Strachey on something some work they had
done in the 60s called denotational
semantics and what was very important
for me then was kind of a thought
process where the you know where there
was a sense of understanding is there
something unique in computer science
that really defines it as a new
legitimate pursuit in this kind of
pushing out the frontiers of human
knowledge
so a one simple kind of equation all
right here
okay and so now of course all of us in
this room I believe you're all computer
science students of one form another
computer science computer engineering
maybe some mathematicians here but of
course in our modern world today any
computer science or engineering student
instantly recognizes this as a program
and in fact the program to compute
factorials so provide this program a
value a natural number for N and you
will get its factorial but as a
mathematician as a mathematic students
particularly in mathematics student
prior to the birth of computer science
and prior to the birth of denotational
semantics this is not a program this is
simply an equation and in fact two most
most mathematicians in the time
particularly in the 70s in Prague before
then it's a statement of a problem solve
for f and so no big deal it is just math
there's nothing new in computer science
that's a prevailing view of the time and
so now we can imagine if we have God's
factorial function handed to us and we
plug that value into F then the equation
holds and so a first impulse for any
mathematician any physicist any chemist
of that time is that there is nothing
special about computer science you know
it's just a special case of mathematics
now the thing that was interesting about
about Dana Scott's work is that he
imagined other equations so instead of
writing this equation let's replace this
term with F of n plus 1 divided by n
and so now again all of us as computer
scientists immediately see that this is
not a program that this will not compute
anything sensible however as a
mathematician again if we're given God's
factorial function then we plug that the
gods factorial function in 4f on both
sides the equation still holds and so
when I first saw this this isn't one of
Dana Scott's early papers I immediately
understood may call me strange but at
least remember I was really focused on
mathematics and physics I immediately
understood oh my god this is something
the idea of computation of computable
functions is something that no
mathematics net no known mathematics no
classical mathematics could explain and
so for me as this young student it
finally allowed me to break free of the
expectations of my mother and father and
understands that there was something
very deep and new and possibly important
in the study of computer science so I
don't know if this makes sense to anyone
but this is really how I gained myself
the courage to leave behind physics and
math and go into computer science yes so
in fact one reason why Dana Scott won
the Turing award is he developed a new
form of mathematics at domain theory
that based on lattice structures that is
capable of explaining this is capable of
explaining computable functions in a
very very precise way and so it was
something that really made a tremendous
impact for me and so I went to graduate
school as a result of this and wrote a
PhD
is on in the area of denotational
semantics and type theory and so it was
fairly theoretical and and after I
finished my PhD I wrote a fairly good
thesis during my PhD studies Dana Scott
who had been at Oxford University came
to the US enjoying the faculty at
Carnegie Mellon University and so I
finished my PhD and I went to Carnegie
Mellon joined the faculty in Dana
Scott's group and and continue to do
work like this so now two or three years
passed and the department head who had
hired me at Carnegie Mellon eniko ha
bourbon who is a really a great man at
the time he unfortunately passed away
suddenly from a heart attack and a new
department head took over and his name
is Jim Morris and Gemini after several
years became very close friends but at
that time when he took over being
Department it Jim didn't know me very
well I didn't really know him and so as
a new department head he had set up a
series of one-on-one meetings with each
faculty member and so so I had my
meeting with him and I was just in my
third year I think so i didn't have
tenure and he asked me what kind of
research i do and so I explained all of
this and and Jim did not understand why
this was at all interesting and and he
said you know Peter why are you doing
this kind of research what possible use
could it have in this world and of
course you know I'm a very young
professor and so I say back to my new
department head well it's just so
beautiful and I still remember this he
said back to me well if all you're
interested in is beauty maybe you should
professor in the fine art school instead
of in computer science and and I was you
know of course you know didn't feel very
good about that but I tell these two
stories because one thing that happens
for research and I think one of the
things that I'm hoping to impart in all
of you today is that one of the powerful
things about research is developing a
devotion to a certain set of ideas
technical ideas and really trying to
understand them deeply even in the face
of external doubts in my case doubts
from parents deaths from a department
head but still understanding that the
pursuit of these ideas it can be very
important and for me I feel completely
vindicated because many of the ideas
that I had been studying at the time
that in in the formal semantics
denotational semantics operates on
cymatics type theory all have had direct
application in program analysis and
verification techniques that today for
example in Microsoft are really
fundamental in the way that Microsoft
developed his products for example for
windows and office today operational
semantics and type theory are
fundamental in doing the validation of
windows and office to eliminate as many
security bugs as possible and so it has
just become such a practical thing and
one of the wonderful things about
computer science research is that
oftentimes the most beautiful ideas that
we conceive of also end up being the
most practical and most compelling in
the real world and this kind of
combination of really beautiful theory
and valuable practices something comes
up over and over again in computing
research so anyway so over time I
developed my research program at
Carnegie Mellon and
after 20 years as a professor I became
head of computer science at Carnegie
Mellon did that for about three years
and then in 2009 it well in 2008 the
United States elected a new president
barack obama and of the many reforms
that the new president wanted to affect
in the country one had to do with this
agency called DARPA the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency and DARPA I
don't know how many of you are familiar
with the DARPA in the u.s. at least is a
very famous research agency darpa was
formed in when he was originally formed
it was formed in 1954 I think it was
called ARPA the Advanced Research
Projects Agency and it was formed
because the Soviets surprised the United
States by launching sputnik and so the
successful launch of the first kind of
satellite immediately crystallized for
the US Defense Department the
possibility that space might be the next
frontier for future warfare and that the
Soviets were head but what was most
shocking for the US was the complete
surprise there was no warning that the
Soviets were were about to do this and
so our PO was formed i think in 1954
with the sole mission to prevent
technological surprise in the future and
so many famous things were created by
ARPA one of the most famous was the
ARPANET which later became the
foundation of the internet the whole
field of material science was created
other than our program and really has
had worldwide impact
the all the fundamental technology and
concept of GPS Global Positioning System
was developed and then several military
kinds of systems like stealth
technologies also so it's a within the
u.s. it's a famous agency and in
computer science DARPA has had a very
long history of influence in many fields
of computer science in software
engineering artificial intelligence many
Sophia's art facilities in robotics
speech vision and so on oh man on and on
and I both benefited a lot from from
DARPA programs well in 9 11 2001 there
was of course a terrible terrorist
attack that took them the world trade
centers in in New York and President
Bush at the time redirected DARPA to
focus all of its effort on the war on
terror on terrorists and in that process
a lot of the kind of fundamental
research programs in DARPA were shut
down and in fact most of the core
computer science programs at DARPA were
shut down and so from 2001 to deal as an
eight DARPA really lost a lot a lot of
its power in in basic research and so
when Obama was elected in 2008 one of
the things he wanted to do was restore
DARPA to its former self and so I was
lucky enough to be invited to be part of
reforming DARPA and and so I went there
in 2009 to work on this and he was
personally very difficult because you
know I was working as a department head
at a very good computer science
department at Carnegie Mellon my wife
and son didn't want to move in fact
didn't move from Pittsburgh so this
meant I would have to live away from my
wife and son there but I felt it was
important enough to go so I went so I 1
2009
summer and when they went to DARPA one
of the things that was going on were a
lot of celebrations because 2009 turned
out to be the 40th anniversary of two
major technical achievements in the
United States so 40 years prior to 2009
in 1969 two things happened one is the
u.s. put a man on the moon with the
Apollo program and at DARPA this was
important because the large booster
rocket called the Saturn five booster
was the very first project at DARPA and
so there was a lot of celebration a lot
of pride at DARPA to celebrate the 40th
anniversary of putting men in the moon
which involved the Saturn five booster
developed at DARPA and the second thing
that happened in nineteen sixty-nine was
something called the mother was the
creation of the ARPANET so in the summer
2009 the first two nodes of the ARPANET
were demonstrated there was one node
that Stanford Research Institute one
note at UCLA and there was an attempt to
send the word log in the message log in
from UCLA to s RI and the letters L &amp;amp; O
got transmitted and received properly
and then there was a buffer overflow the
very first buffer overflow in
the internet happened that first
demonstration and then later in december
two additional nodes were added to their
four nodes the ARPANET and importantly
there was something called the mother of
all demos that year where a
demonstration was shown how two people
far apart one person in Utah one person
in Palo Alto were able to use the
ARPANET to collaborate on the writing of
a document together and so the idea that
this network could augment human
intelligence and collaboration was
really demonstrated for the first time
in 1969 so these two major events in
1969 were being celebrated in 2009 at
DARPA because DARPA really played a
central role in the in these two major
achievements in fact some people believe
that 1969 was the greatest year for
technical achievement in the united
states in the US history and so it was
really quite amazing so now a one
rhetorical question that I've asked many
people is of these two events putting a
man on the moon and creating the ARPANET
both happening in 1969 which of these
two events had bigger impact on the
world
arpanet and why why the arpanet the
world got connected and and that's
exactly right the world got connected
which means almost all the people had
access to this powerful technology and
so one of the things that is just
incredible about computers and computer
science and computing research and
networking is the ability that we have
to democratize access to this technology
and the way I put it actually I was
talking to the Secretary of Defense at
the time secretary gates and I said my
son I have a 17 year old son at the time
of course he was younger he has never
used Saturn 5 booster rocket technology
to reinforce his map studies and so the
ability for almost every person in the
world to have access to something
powerful like the ARPANET or the
Internet what it does it not only
connects the world but it also almost
guarantees a steady stream of disruptive
innovations and that is really the
defining feature today of computer
science appear engineering end of the
whole information technology industry
and so it just to my mind nothing in
this era of humanity nothing can be more
exciting than to be a part of creating
this new connected world and at the very
center of creating that new connected
world is computing research and if you
have the mind for it I honestly believe
there's nothing both nobler and more
exciting and probably more fun that you
could be engaged with for a lifetime
than computing research and it just just
so many possibilities when you're in a
situation where
these things can be democratized so
widely it's incredible this year it
happens every year for me this year for
example in Microsoft Research our new
CEO satya nadella announced the
availability at the end of this year at
one of our projects out of Microsoft
Research called the Skype translator and
so skype itself which is a Microsoft
product represents the democratization
of global telecommunications and now
imagine what is possible if we enable
all users of skype to cross language
barrier to talk to anyone else in their
language how would that change the world
it's just really incredible and all of
these things are things that come out of
computing research so now let me talk a
little bit about microsoft research
because i think i'm obligated to brag
about it a little bit and then then we
can take some questions so so now I work
for Microsoft Research Microsoft
Research is a part a division of
Microsoft that is a little bit different
than is engaged in very long-term what
we call beyond the headlights research
and so we try to do three things we try
to advance the field we in the state of
the art we try to improve through
research Microsoft's products and three
we act as a kind of insurance policy for
Microsoft where we're like the DARPA for
Microsoft so we are there to avoid
technological surprise and to create
technological surprise for our
competitors and so those are the kind of
three missions of MSR we're both very
large and very small where we have 1,100
researchers spread in 13 labs around the
world one of our most important labs is
here in bangalore so this Microsoft
Research India we at the same time are
fairly small because we're less than one
sent to the total workforce of Microsoft
and so it's a very interesting kind of
situation where on the one hand were
very large and powerful research
organization and were within Microsoft
we're a very tiny organization we're
also very young and very old were old
because we were founded in nineteen
ninety one and the only competitor of
Microsoft's that still exists from 1991
to today is IBM and all of our other
competitors that existed 1991 are are
long gone and ms are really has been
part of the reason why Microsoft has had
such a long life in such staying power
at the same time we're very young
compared to great research universities
like the iasc here we're only 23 years
old and most of the great research
organizations around the world are much
older than that and so we're still very
young so organization that's maturing
but hoping to become as great in some of
the great universities like this one in
MSR our researchers are free to choose
what they believe are the most important
research problems to work on so the
managers like under than and I are not
allowed to tell researchers what to do
and so our jobs are mainly to make sure
that we secure 7 if resources to do
their work and to hire the best
researchers we can find but otherwise
not tell them what to do and for the
most part they do very interesting work
and often times they do it with in
collaboration with the university
researchers and so it's a fun place to
be and I sometimes feel a little bit too
far away from the actual fund research
just being a manager but but I get close
enough usually but I have a great time
so with that I thank you for listening
if you have questions or
anything and really happy to engage in
the discussion ah yes do we hire yes we
do hire pure mathematician so we it we
are mostly computer science in
engineering but we do hire
mathematicians some biologists and other
types of scientists we have some very
good mathematicians one notable
mathematician is Michael Friedman who's
a fields medallist very well known
topologist and he has been leading a
group of mathematicians and physicists
in our Santa Barbara lab that has been
very focused on what are called
topological effects in solid state
systems so it's combining mathematics
and and theoretical physics and that's
it turned into very very interesting
very interesting work we have a number
of other mathematicians that are more
focused on statistics and probability
theory we have several people working in
statistical physics there's has been a
long history and fascination with
physics statistics in Computer Sciences
become highly relevant and important we
have a number of game theorists mostly
with a computational event maybe most
prominent of them being Moshe tenant
holds who works out of our Vlad in
Israel and then we have I don't think
you would call these mathematicians
necessarily but we have a growing number
of both macro and micro economists and
then most of them have have more
theoretical kind of inclination Peter
actually we have a large number of
electrical engineers in this crowd ah
yes so we have been having more and more
electrical engineers and computer
engineers also one thing that has become
very important for Microsoft lately is a
deeper understanding in
the design and future frontiers in all
aspects of hardware both in the data
center but also in the hardware on our
deaths in our pockets so some of you
might have seen for example that
recently we announced deployment in our
data centers of a whole new data center
architecture based on reconfigurable
reconfigurable fabrics on fpgas and so
there was a significant amount of
electrical engineering and also
mechanical engineering in the design of
the machinery we do a substantial amount
of networking design and deployment
around the world and increasingly
there's more and more work particularly
with acquisitions nokia in in small
devices and sensors and so the the
number of electrical and computer
engineers hasn't has been growing lately
and MSR worldwide and n mechanical
engineers as well like postal postal
mail is almost becoming outdated because
you are an email so how like it's good
to develop technologies but if people
are losing jobs yeah yes so this is very
interesting in fact one of the most
important thinkers on this problem is a
researcher Microsoft Jaron Lanier and in
fact he just published he's published
several books on exactly this problem he
just published this past year an
economics study entitled who owns the
future on precisely this problem and in
fact in his economic study he actually
blames the IT industry for
of chronic unemployment problem in the
divide between rich and poor and so he
has been very thoughtful about this in
fact he has just been awarded the Peace
Prize of the German book authors
Association and the Chancellor Angela
Merkel will be giving him the award this
October and so it has become a very
important study on this precise problem
and so in ms are we have a small set of
researchers it's only three it's not
many other than 100 but three who have
been looking at the this chronic issue
of the apparent concentration of wealth
that occurs is not just only the
disruption of industries that causes
loss of jobs for people but it also many
things in the tech industry seem to
concentrate wealth in a smaller number
of people and so we do have some
economics research that has been looking
at this phenomenon and this particular
book who owns the future was a major
product of that work so I can't say that
we have answers for this but that's been
a very that that topic is becoming more
and more important there's a related
issue about privacy also privacy
concerns as things go and some of you
might know that Facebook has been making
the news lately because it conducted a
study right and so they had about seven
hundred thousand users of Facebook where
they had divided into three groups one
control group second group were they use
sentiment analysis on status updates and
so they gave one group mostly positive
sentiment news and then then a third
group the way they gave mostly negative
sentiment
and then they ran sentiment analysis on
those users status updates and so what
they found was that the people who were
fed more negative news be themselves
became slightly more negative and so
that that study has been quite
controversial and we have had several of
our researchers who have been commenting
publicly on this jaron lanier being one
Kate Crawford being another and Dana boy
being a third and so I think we have
been really trying to be under leading
edge of these issues but there does seem
to be something odd happening with the
kind of disruptions taking place here
yes lisanna a mood i bring clothes in ec
department in wireless communication so
recently microsoft acquired nokia yes so
are you people are buying concentrating
on in 4G wireless research work what are
the domains of people are doing I would
like to know more on that aha well so
the first the the truthful answer is I
would like to know more also the so you
know the kind of merging of two large
companies is a very complicated affair
now having said that the the networking
business of Nokia was not a part of the
requisition and the nokia research
centers were not a part of the
acquisition and so there has been a very
extensive coordination with nokia to
fill the voids for the handset business
that that we acquired with MSR and so so
all aspects of wireless networking
research have been a very high interest
to nokia in with an MSR and so what has
happened so far is
series of very Britain Conn coordination
meetings between MS our research groups
and different parts of Nokia and so just
as a first approximation MSR is going to
try to replace the you know what the
Nokia had been doing with their own
research centers in the various areas in
cameras &amp;amp; photography in wireless
battery technologies and not in SOC
architecture designed many other
materials many areas the in terms of 4G
LTE and the standards and really
providing the prototype code stacks and
so on for vendors around the world that
is all staying with Nokia there msn
business and so they will maintain that
that's not a part of Microsoft so so
what will be at Microsoft are hopefully
with ms ours involvement you know our
our own proprietary advancements in
wireless networking we'll take one more
question sure and then prolly get it off
your next month lizard I'm shrikant I'm
i miss Maris's student from Hyderabad
under professor ramamurti sir first of
all it's under and pleasure talking to
you sir so I want to ask you this so how
easy I mean how hard it has been for you
to you know transform yourself from a
professor to somebody was to do
practical work at DARPA and again moving
on to Microsoft Excel theory to practice
yeah I just want to ask how hard it is
and how easy it is right wow that is the
best question so the this is going to be
frustrating but it i guess it's both
easy and hard so on the one hand one of
the things that's wonderful about
computer science so in physics there is
a very sharp distinction between
theoretical physics and experimental
physics
you know really the you know the
communities are hardly able to talk to
each other and understand each other
that distinction doesn't exist really in
computer science I mean for yes of
course you know if someone is working in
machine learning and another person is
working complexity theory they might
have trouble interacting with each other
but you know for the most part it's not
because one is a theoretician and one is
practitioner it's because they are in
you know very deep in different
subfields of computer science and so one
of the things I think is so important
about computer science research is that
even for the most theoretical
researchers our investigations typically
are motivated by or informed by what
goes on in the real world and even for
the most applied computer science
researchers at least for the best of
those researchers there is both a
facility and respect for the value of
foundational advances in those
applications and so I always very
quickly try to try to reject using the
words basic or applied in front of
computer science research because I
really don't think for great researchers
in our field that anyone is purely basic
or purely applied you know we're all
sort of a very kind of wide spectrum and
that is just a great great thing having
said that it was not easy to move from a
university to government to dentistry
and there are things that I found are
better in each case each move but also
things I miss so the joke and so I will
just maybe end with a joke about this
the joke that I would make is the
following when I was the head of
computer science at Carnegie Mellon I
had a big
department of the smartest people
smartest faculty members in the smartest
graduate students you could imagine and
I had no authority because in the
university no one listens to the
department head so very first of all
almost no one respects the department
head and and then even if you respect
tomorrow you don't listen to department
head when i went to DARPA i had military
authority so absolute kind of people
would literally salute to me and
absolutely respect but in the military
the people were i would say stupid but
they weren't like Carnegie Mellon
graduate students and so even though had
all this authority there was just you
couldn't use it on really great people
and so now in industry at microsoft
research vice president actually has a
lot of authorities almost like military
authority and people listen very
carefully maybe too carefully to what I
have to say which is a problem because
the smart people are the researchers not
the managers but what is strange now is
that Microsoft Research is in typical
industry it there's this rule that I'm
not supposed to tell people what to do
so even though I actually in some sense
have this massive power that I have the
military authority that I have the DARPA
but with the set of smart people to have
a guy named Ellen I'm not allowed to
make use of it and so so the best i can
do is come to places like this and give
speeches so so thanks for listening that
is thank you Peter and okay it is an
information session and we rested on the
Rockaways only hears of it public
continue without next engagement thank
you all for attending and staying I hope
you all enjoyed each year microsoft
research helps hundreds of influential
speakers from around the world including
leading scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
