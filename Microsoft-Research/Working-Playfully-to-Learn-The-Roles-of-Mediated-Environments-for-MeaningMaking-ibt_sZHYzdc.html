you
hello everyone my name is Alex camas and
I am education design director in at
microsoft studios in IE b today it is my
pleasure to introduce Megan rod cell
megan is a doctoral candidate at the
University of wisconsin-madison working
with the games learning a society center
over the last few months megan has been
working on MSR internship examining the
relationship between playful
technologies and lifelong learning
particularly on women entering the STEM
fields one more time I'm super excited
to have Megan here and I look forward to
hearing what you have to say thank you
hello so today we're going to talk about
meaning making in mediated environment
as Alex said I am currently a microsoft
research intern I'm a PhD candidate at
the University of Wisconsin at Madison
with the games learning in society
Center an instructional design
specialist and an aspiring educational
multimedia fancy pants but before I go
into what I've been doing I want to make
sure that I say thank you to my two
mentors alex gomez and rain johnson and
rain unfortunately couldn't be here
today is she's really ill but hopefully
she's watching yeah she's not feeling
real well so um but I just want to make
sure that they know that this has been
an amazing opportunity and that I say
thank you for this tremendous
opportunity to do this amazing research
with kids and women so what have I done
my background is actually kind of all
over the map I got my bachelor's and
master's degrees from the University of
Hawaii at Manoa and I worked with a
group after teaching high school for six
years and being technical the site
coordinator for technology at the school
doing a lot of professional development
teaching high school students I moved
into the field of curriculum design
doing multimedia design for
underrepresented groups and then ended
up doing game design for learning games
and it was after that experience that I
realized it was over and I was convinced
by a few pretty key people including
kurt Squire and jim g that my life was
over I couldn't go back to traditional
curriculum design and I needed to focus
on games and interactive spaces for
learners so I packed up moved 5,000
miles and moved to the University of
Wisconsin at Madison and I do not regret
it at all but what that means is that
I'm now in a field of research and I
have my fingers in design but it means
I've also come from the world where I
have gotten to see where the rubber hits
the road and so doing the transition
from teaching at the high school level
to being a curriculum designer my
interests have also shift because i
started with high school students but my
interests have actually gone now the
full spectrum and a lot of my interests
are now with younger audiences but i'm
looking at what that means for the
future so my work does focus on across
age groups so I won't you know apologize
for the fact that I like kids and this
is a picture that I feel like really
kind of grabs hold of the things that
I'm talking about this is a little
friend of mine named Conor and he
purchased Super Mario chess not because
he wanted to learn how to play chess but
he thought it was the ideal opportunity
to get more mario guys and so and his
t-shirt says expert gamer and he loves
the Mario franchise and he's in it like
all the time but what happens is as he
plays it expands outside of what he's
doing with the game itself into his
narratives into his play spaces and
Mario isn't something he plays anymore
it's something he does it's a set of
practices that get him really excited
about this narrative world that he then
goes into creative spaces and becomes a
co designer and participating in this
franchise and so that kind of points to
something bigger that's happening and
this isn't just with young kids it
happens across the lifespan so what's
important to me is intentionally
leveraging the potential of technology
and so this like do this right this is
kind of like my bottom line and what
that means is that we're trying to
gather education media and cultural
studies and design for the sake of
building good stuff so I came here to do
an internship and it's been a six-month
internship and it's kind of a 50-50
thing between Microsoft Research and
Microsoft Studios and so that's a lot of
interests I've been looking at
interactive media kids play in creation
spaces learning in cognition and gender
issues and I mean you could study that
for about 50 careers but what does that
mean for my six months it means that I
have a story to tell about life span
technologies and this story comes
together not in the consideration of a
particular piece of hardware and its
lifespan but the fact that our lives are
becoming more and more mediated and so
it's our life spans it's the fact that
from the child's early early years
through retirement and beyond our lives
are mediated and what does that mean for
things like learning entertainment
productivity citizenship health across
the human lifespan so what I've done is
I've been involved in three different
studies and they all kind of come
together under this idea first I want to
tell you about a study called tech
trajectories and it was one in which i
did interviews with several women who
are successful in their careers in
computer science and talking about
different values that have been
important to them along their life story
and and really allowing them to tell me
their personal life narrative and what
we've kind of pulled and sussed out from
those interviews so far and then I'm
going to talk about meaning making with
to a TV and a study that I got to do
with three and four year old and an
episode of connect Sesame Street TV and
then finally what does that mean in play
workspaces and maker spaces and so
looking at how we can do observations
that support telemetric data
that's part of the studio k curriculum
which is around kodu so i'm going to
talk about three different studies today
but they're all around this idea that
they traverse this life span for us and
bring us through different levels of
participation so first let's talk about
tech trajectories so the research
questions or how do successful women in
computer science fields describe their
life story in terms of play and learning
experiences and what happened was I had
read a piece by Mary Flanagan and she
did a lot of values based research and I
was inspired by the research she did to
take it and then modify it and so I
tweaked that list of values and then
moved it into an interview protocol that
was shaped by the women talking about
these values so the 10 values that we
used oh sorry so the guided interview
combined open ended questions about
their youth activities learning
experience experiences opinions about
women in STEM fields or in computer
science and then the value ranking and
the think aloud and they have like
actual manipulatable cards so they were
what I found was that was actually
really interesting that as we would talk
about their ranking of these particular
values by having physical objects that
they were working with the think Aloud's
came really naturally and they'd be like
well this is really important to me but
then this was really well because of
this situation and they would talk their
way through the whole thing which
actually got some really rich data um so
I interviewed six different women
different phases in their careers so the
values that we were talking about were
access autonomy collaboration community
and creativity and these were the
definitions that i was using with the
women and then diversity equality group
success individual achievement and
subversion so there are different things
to consider in the kinds of outcomes
first of all it was six women yeah
10 bellies how did you choose this
candle so the majority were from what we
know about observations of group
dynamics with maker spaces and also what
we know from Mary Flanagan's work in the
values based research she's done and so
I actually modified those to align
tighter with the research questions I
had so you just did your judgement to
those yeah but it was it was grounded in
different sets of research and then I
kind of just mush them all together into
something that made a lot of sense for
the kinds of questions I was asking um
but so factors to consider that there
really were it was six women and for
making declarative statements you can't
really make this is a declarative
statement about all women but it really
helps in pulling out themes and
understanding what are some of the
things that we see emerging its
potential patterns that need to be
looked into more or that might challenge
existing beliefs we have um so there's
definitely factors to consider like the
role of culture the role of schooling
and shaping values as we talked about
certain values there is interesting
language about this was important in
elementary school so therefore it was
important to me and not necessarily that
it was important to them but they they
just adopted it as a value because that
was what the institution that they were
tightly identified with at the time said
was important and so language kind of
indicates that difference which is
interesting and then also there all of
the women had pushed back against the
structure of traditional institutional
education which will be something in the
future that I'd really like to dig into
a little more also the role of peer
influences especially in middle and high
school more than one participant had a
story about how they had a value set but
because of the way they received
feedback from their peer group it
shifted and they chose to do something
else sometimes not the best decisions
either and then also the potential
impact of found
the background and socioeconomic status
on influences and opportunities so we
need to consider that that's a lot of
things that can vary somebody's
experience but given that some of the
things we found in the value ranking
what happened was we had the 10 values
and i gave the women the opportunity to
rank what typifies their experience or
what to provide what they felt was
important at middles a later elementary
school middle school high school and
then adulthood so we had four time
markers and then they would rank them
and they sometimes they had a really
hard time just going 1 to 10 because
they would find that some things just
were not important at all and they
didn't even want to give it a tenth
place because it just shouldn't even be
on the list and so I gave them the
option of some of if something was not
at all a part of their value set or
things they were thinking about just put
it on the side it doesn't need to get
ranked in addition there were things
that were tied and so I did like a golf
style ranking so if you had a first
place and then a tie for second the next
one would be fourth so that was how the
ranking happened what we found was
subversion was unranked by all of them
in elementary school so all six of the
women independently this was one-on-one
interviews were like that was nothing I
was even thinking of and creativity was
always ranked across all age groups so
for these six women this was something
that was important whether an elementary
school all the way up through adulthood
in some way another thing we found was
that individual achievement was nearly
always ranked there I think there was
one instance where it was not ranked at
all and so that was something that went
beyond age groups as well and was always
important for these women who are
considered successful right now in
current in computer science and this one
really kind of interested me it went
from being unranked by four out of the
six participants in middle and high
school so only two people put it in the
rankings for middle and high school to
in adulthood everybody ranking it as
something important
um and so then if you consider what the
averages were for the rankings that was
depending on the number of participants
who actually ranked it that's where the
averages came from if there was an
unranked it just didn't get considered
into the figure autonomy dropped in
average rank so it was pretty consistent
at around four until adulthood in which
it dropped and it wasn't as important
even though it still got ranked also
diversity and equality became kind of an
interesting flip-flop so where equality
was a little more important in the
younger years it flipped with diversity
later and community creativity and
individual achievement stayed fairly
consistent over time so in the range
though in looking at what the
differences were between the higher
ranks and the lower ranks for the most
part once you hit middle in high school
they were all over the place and what
that kind of indicates is that people
have very unique personal experiences in
middle school in high school it's not
really a surprise it's not really saying
anything that we don't know unless we're
starting to say things like girls like
this girl's function in these
environments high schoolers need this
particularly that interesting one about
group work and individual achievement
you start to hear sometimes people
saying when we're designing for younger
audiences for younger females may be
like upper elementary through younger
high school that they love working
together well that really didn't show up
with these six women who are successful
in CS fields until later actually
individual achievement was really
important now community was important
which means their peer groups and the
groups that they felt that they had a
kinship with but not necessarily working
together as a team to achieve something
now that I can't make a declarative
statement because this is six interviews
but there's an interesting trend there
that starts to buck some of the
assumptions that people make about how
it is girls function and work and play
spaces so I think what that means is
that we need to do more analysis on this
and right now I've got incredibly rich
data sets from these six women and so
the next step is to do a much deeper
discourse analysis of it looking
specifically at how are these women
describing their schooling experiences
what trends emerge in their word choice
around framing their identity and around
their values because I think that's
going to give us a little more as far as
clues about trends deeper quantitative
analysis of rankings definitely
expanding that data set and I think it
would be really interesting to expand
the data set to include men because
right now it is all women and so we
can't say women are different than men
because because we don't have any basis
for making that statement we can just
say these women who are successful show
these trends and then it would be really
interesting to take this protocol and
then adapt it for younger audiences and
looking at clubs like the studio k clubs
that are doing coded curriculum and
learning to game design in groups to see
how they're actually talking about value
sets while they're in that age group and
see if they're do trends align are they
showing that there's different patterns
based on reflective recollection of this
was my life story some things that
really came up strong were that all of
the women had early experiences with
technology and so that means that we
need to take a really close look at what
are kids doing at a young age how are
they connecting with content and that
that's kind of my segue into the work
that I did with the younger audiences in
looking at playful learning with Kinect
Sesame Street TV so first my theoretical
frames are really around the difference
between interaction and participation so
interactivity and participatory
experiences um if you if you've seen
Dora the Explorer Blue's Clues even
traditional Sesame Street
are very um participatory so Dora will
say we we need to get in the backpacks
um backpack say it with me backpack and
everybody says backpack and you know the
kids at home might say backpack they
might not but she's calling out a
response from the children save vamonos
and then they all go and and sometimes
kids respond to that other times they
start getting kind of tricky about it
going I didn't say it you know but
basically there's a call for
participation but the system doesn't
necessarily respond when I'm talking
about interactivity some people use
interactivity to describe that as well
but I'm talking about having a system
that actually responds to the cues of
the participant and so that's what
Sesame Street TV connect Sesame Street
TV and connect national geographic TV do
they provide a situation where the
activity is relevant to the content but
then also it's responding to the actions
of the participant and so that's a
really important distinction in what
makes the potential learning different
and also is the connection with
narrative world so this is the frame
that I'm kind of using to think about
narrative worlds if you imagine that
this is a narrative world in their ative
world kind of being the story space but
I don't want to limit our understanding
of narrative strictly to a story because
activities options mechanics etc help to
contribute to that broader narrative
right that becomes the story that we
live and we tell through our experiences
so this narrative world let's imagine um
Pokemon so there's this world pokemon
right and the goal is to get at meanings
and pleasures that's the thing that the
participants want to reach whether it's
entertainment whether it's learning they
both kind of happen together to but
meanings and pleasures are created at
the heart of the activity so here's a
platform there is a platform there was a
platform maybe this is cards maybe this
is a video game maybe that's a movie um
maybe that's toys maybe that's a comic
book and that a true transmedia
experience is going to
open with different activities that come
into this narrative world through
different through different products or
platforms and you go into this narrative
world there's meanings and pleasures
it's a two sided arrow because activity
means you're bringing stuff in but it
also means that you're pushing back out
so the experiences you've had if you
remember that picture of Connor he plays
mario right but then he also creates his
own narrative so the narrative boundary
of this world is constantly being pushed
against it's constantly changing because
of the participants experiences so this
is not tightly bounded at all and so
when we think about learning in this way
we see that it's really deeply tied to a
set of activities and practices and
that's really where the experience comes
from so in the 1970s television
experienced a revolution with Sesame
Street in the 90s shows like Dora Blue's
Clues they came on the scene and it
continued to experience revolutions in
the way television facilitated learning
for different age groups well I feel
like we're on the cusp of a new paradigm
shift with using something like the
Kinect for TV and it's important to
think that this isn't necessarily a game
and this is actually something the kids
picked up on really well this is not a
game because it doesn't follow the same
conventions of what this bounded choice
space looks like and in the meaningful
choices you make within that space and
the way that responds to the player but
it is not flat TV that doesn't physica
spawned to your physicality and doesn't
respond to the way you participate
within that space and so that's what
connect playful learning was about but
it's standing on the shoulders of giants
because when you look at the research
history of Sesame Street it's a rich and
they show that the traditional Sesame
Street model works kids learn there's
over 40 years of research saying that
this model works and so for Microsoft
this was
pretty big task I mean that's a pretty
big call you want to do something that
kind of disrupts traditional television
but you don't want to do it in such a
way that takes away from the good that
you know already happens and so that was
what kind of framed this study was
looking at things like situated learning
theory how it is the way we're tying our
physical activity to the choices you
make and the actions you do in this
interactive space how does this have to
do with the way we think about our
bodies as far as the concepts that we're
learning how does this include
accessibility like that anybody can come
in and become a participant in this
space and that it's having a dialogic TV
experience because this is how play
happens right where we have these
cultural icons and symbols and it's this
dialogic experience between them and
then the meanings and pleasures of this
narrative world get built so what we did
was a pretty intense study and I need to
say that the data set is so big that
I've named him Willis the friend of mine
actually encouraged me to name him
Willis so I can say what you talking
about Willis and I think Willis and I
are going to get incredibly intimate and
we're going to be talking for a very
very long time but what it was was three
phases of data collection with two
groups of kids the first group had a
traditional build so all of the flat
footage from the Kinect episode was
edited into a flat traditional episode
that went along like a regular
television show the other half of the
kids got the kinect episode where the
system responded to their physical
movements and choices and the
interactivity of that episode was all on
so for the first phase they came into
the lab and we did a pretest we viewed
the episode together and then there was
a mid test after that they got a disc
with whatever the version was that they
were watching they went home and they
played that again then they came back
into the lab a couple weeks later we had
a final viewing where we watched it
again and then at the end of that we did
a post-test and so in addition to
the video data from them being in the
lab I have a parent survey and i also
have parent feedback from when they were
at home and a lot of the parents on
journaled for me and talked about the
experience they were having in the home
so what we're specifically looking at
our questions of viewing interaction
comprehension and replay so for viewing
what does engagement in Sesame Street
connectv look like for three and
four-year-old participants for
interaction how do participants
demonstrate engagement when utilizing
interactive features of Sesame connect
TV and how do participants not using
interactive features demonstrate
engagement for comprehension what
concepts are participants of interactive
and traditional episodes learning and
then for replay it's basically all of
this but how does replay impact that
does this change over time so for the
assessment instruments um there is
questions about letter H recognition
this particular episode we used for the
study and it was the same episode across
the entire study if you need to know
about the letter H or the number 5 I
just encourage you to ask me anything
you want to about it because I'm an
expert at the letter h and the number 5
I watched that episode at least 84 times
during that six weeks done I know this
stuff now so we would do questions about
letter recognition and the development
of the assessment instrument was
actually kind of interesting because in
the show in the Kinect episode there was
a lot of participatory experiences so to
design a flat assessment doesn't really
make sense you want to design an
assessment that also situates the
learning you want to design an
assessment that also brings participants
into the world of play but also gives
you the opportunity to see them perform
what it is that they know so there's
letter H recognition there are
relational concept so over between an
across um we looked at counting an
enumeration for the number five a
narrative prediction and retail for the
street story the concepts measure and
launch so starting to look at
stem concepts and how the kids discourse
actually starts changing around these
concepts through watching the show
looking at stem values of curiosity and
wondering and then feedback from the
episode where they were looking at the
different segments of the episode and
telling me about what was taking place
in them so what we did was there are
more closed and question questions and
there were more open-ended questions I
provided a lot of visual queuing and
then we had manipulatable to do a lot of
the questions so here's an example when
we talked about the street story i would
say what happened in this story what was
this about what is baby bear doing there
and if they were able to tell me
measuring I could ask what what is that
when you're measuring what is it that
you're trying to find out um in addition
we would talk about the activities they
did so with Kinect Sesame Street TV if
you aren't familiar with it there's the
letter of the day a number of the day
but there's also a move of the day that
entices you to get into the show by
doing a physical activity so this
particular one that the move of the day
was thorough so when we talk about what
do they do in these designed experiences
for throwing and how did that connect to
the different content so this one
actually connects to relational concepts
because you're throwing a cross over in
between and doing it with Elmo and Paul
ball so like I mentioned they're
supporting data while we were doing this
with the kids the parents were taking a
survey and this is something that as we
do more quantitative analysis this is
going to be really nuanced and is going
to be really interesting to kind of suss
out if there's anything happening there
but looking at parent attitudes towards
different kinds of media so I had a set
of beliefs statements like does this
media help my child do better in school
helps them be more creative it's a waste
of time they learn useful things they
learn the things that don't matter in
our household or bad bad values and
beliefs and then what do they think
about those beliefs statements for toys
TVs video games internet site in books
so there
also a lot of data about that that we
could eventually start looking at with
the kids engagement data or with the way
they're talking about different concepts
does this play into it at all um also
the coding that's still taking place
right now is for every child for every
episode looking interval coding and so
this was based on an actual Sesame
Street coding scheme that was then
modified so that it started looking at
situated cognition physicality the
interaction that's happening in these
specific episodes so it's not for
specifically the television show itself
but for looking at how you're
interacting and physically interacting
in that space as well so coding for
these markers and then looking at how
does that differ for boys and girls how
does that differ for Kinect versus
traditional how does that differ for
maybe kids that tend to be heavier TV
and game TV watchers and game players
because that's part of the parent
reporting as well so the these were the
participants it was about half male half
female they're all between three and
four years old and well three and five
years old and we had internal and
external participants the reason being
that to get that high of a number there
were 42 total kids to get that high of a
number and to get that many in a shorter
time frame we did need to open up to
both but we were screening for a number
of different variables and so I was able
to mark for that too in in the data set
so we can look at if that makes a
difference as well I also for the
majority got their annual income so we
can also look at rankings of
socioeconomic because access is
something that we can't ignore and and
by access I don't just mean people
having a connect in their house but
access to knowing how to work with
different kinds of information in
stimuli so we had 21 in the connect
group 21 in the traditional group and
that was the kids and it happened over
six weeks and so what we found
this I think is a win because one of the
biggest things we needed to find out was
if we start messing around with Sesame
Street's format it has to do at least as
well as this incredibly high bar and
that happened so we can say that connect
and traditional groups had statistically
significant increases from pre two men
to post the interesting thing is it
didn't matter on the group it's not
necessarily that connect users did
better than the traditional they both
learned it's not significant that
there's a difference between the two
it's not significant the gender plays
into that and so but that's based on a
very specific set of questions that's
based on letter recognition that's based
on a relational concept so over between
an across and it's based on the
enumeration and Counting so they matched
it and these are the types of
assessments that Sesame does so that
assessment model matched the type of
assessment model that Sesame uses and it
matched it so I say that's actually a
win for the property because that bar
was started started off really high but
what I can say and this isn't done being
coded yet I can't say that there is a
significant difference in the way kids
are engaging with it and in the kinds of
discussions that we're having around the
content so that's still in analysis
right now and I don't have anything
declarative to stay say about that yet
this is preliminary also what what this
what we got from the preliminary sets of
data is that we need to dig deeper there
are some really interesting things that
have happened so for example relational
concept between this is like actually a
really funny story that i love so what i
did for this assessment was we had two
bowls upside down and i would give the
kids the opportunity to be part of the
play experience and I never told them it
was a test we were always playing games
or doing activities and i turn the Bulls
up
down and say what should these be should
these be hills or should these be
mountains and whatever they said that
went that was what we did and then I
pull out Cooper that's Cooper monster
he's important in the show and this is
his buddy flash and that there's a pond
over there and that was just a foam core
piece of blue and we had to play a game
where we helped Cooper find flash by
flipping a card that had a relational
concept so either a cross between or
over and have the child physically pick
up Cooper and have him find flash by
doing it in the way of that relational
concept / was pretty straight for it
like say / they pick him up and if they
had it they'd like move him over the
whole thing and then boonton he finds
flash yay and if it was across the pond
he would you know go across the pond and
if they got it or they didn't it was
pretty easy for those two concepts to
assign a one or a zero on they got it or
they didn't get it between messed all
that up and I wasn't ready for that and
I feel like some deeper analysis of how
they physically do the gestures of
between is going to be really important
because you might think that from an
adult perspective the most logical way
to do between if I say how Cooper find
flash by going between the hills you're
going to run him and you're going to run
him and you're going to run him and he's
going to come over here but that didn't
happen for all of them some of them
would grab Cooper and go over this one
land him in the center and jump over
this one and then get well you could
argue that well that was kind of over
but no is also between like that still
follows the rules of between this then
there were some that would actually pick
this bowl up and slide Cooper straight
against the floor across the floor to
the other side of the bowl well that's
kind of between two right because you're
going between the floor and the bowl
when you think about the real world you
can't really slide under mountain like
your kind of duck diving under a wave or
something like that's not really
possible but in this one
it was because you can pick up this mole
and you can go between the one that
Slade me and this was so amazing they
picked up the bowl right so here's the
bowl and then they pick up Cooper and
they're going like this and then looking
at me like I'm an idiot right it's like
you can't go between I can't molecular
Lee shift the atoms of this bowl and
make Cooper go between this bowl like
yeah I apparently didn't get that one
right I mean because the child looked at
me like I had just set them up for
failure by asking them to go between
that's really interesting like that
their construction of meaning was the
word between like I was talking to
earlier i'll dad education specialist
and we were talking about this and she
said you know i'll bet you could have an
entire career based on the word between
you probably could so that's something i
think that is going to require deeper
digging and it just shows that the
gestural behaviors of the kids in the
assessments are something that needs to
be looked at another great example see
do i have that one I want to do this one
first okay another funny example was for
the word measure we talked about
measuring and one of the little girls
had said when in the pretty test before
we had even watched the first episode I
said well what is measuring when you're
measuring what what are you trying to
find out and she says how tall how tall
something is like oh okay that's
measuring okay so in this story that's
part of this episode Hubert the human
cannonball is trying to launch precisely
five feet across the street and into a
bucket of blue gelatin so then baby bear
comes and measures five feet so after we
watch the episode I says so what is
measuring what are you trying to find
out and she says well how tall so that
changed right she's using the same word
but she's going how tall so she's
understanding that there is a horse
whore
zontal distance thing that's happening
in that episode but her words don't
necessarily demonstrate that she has the
vocabulary for the nuance of that
meaning and so that's why it's going to
be really important to dig deeper on how
kids are talking about things but what
they're physically doing with their
bodies as they talk about these things
because as they're situated in the
meaning as their heads are kind of
thinking like my body has a role in this
understanding of this concept they're
going to display that in different ways
I'll do this one to the number one kind
of broke my head a bit and so I've been
talking with math specialists and they
actually have some theories on why this
one took out took place so again
remember how I was saying how I would we
would do this kind of imaginary play for
the assessment and so I'd say do you
know what an orchard is an apple orchard
so it's where there's a lot of trees
with apples on it's like an apple farm
well let's pretend that you and I and
whatever parent was in the room we're
walking through this apple orchard and
oh my gosh we found these apples and I'd
flip the page and there's five a picture
of five apples can you count how many
apples we found a lot of kids one two
three four five great well we're going
to cook with apples today what should we
cook what should we make cookies apple
cookies or apple cake or applesauce and
they would choose what we wanted to cook
with the apples and cookie monster came
out and he was good it was he was going
to be cooking this recipe and then I
pulled out that green Bowl again and
said well for that recipe we need
exactly 5 apples can you put five apples
in this bowl the number of kids that got
the first one with the enumeration
correct and that we're able to then put
five in the bowl was very different not
as many kids had success in counting
apples and putting them in the bowl as
they did in enumeration it's a different
kind of application with the number one
of the theories is that they're having
to hold two things in their head at the
same time with the knowledge of its
supposed to be
but then we also have this separation
because there were seven apples so there
were more than they needed so having to
distinguish what five is in comparison
to this amount that they have here and
then somewhere in the bowl and some are
not some kids they would use strategies
like they would count five first draw
the line push the other two apples away
and then just grab them and throw them
in that was a pretty successful strategy
but so again something really
interesting having to do with the
numbers and the way they're
demonstrating their knowledge of the
numbers so deeper analysis is needed um
like I said Willis is huge he's a beast
um and so this is where the analysis is
heading next looking at the interval
coding for behaviors and responses with
what engagement exactly looks like i'm
looking at a quantitative analysis based
on multiple variables like coming in
deeper with maybe where some of these
nuances are looking at propulsive
sampling where we've got some kids that
we know are talking about things in
pretty interesting ways so doing full
transcripts of what it is they're
talking about and doing a discourse
analysis of how are these concepts
moving from their mediated experience so
what they're doing with the television
show in to how they're talking about it
with me and then gesture analysis of
their content descriptions I actually
want to show you a few videos um lalola
of some of the video data so this is a
child that is um where did the Moscow he
is watching a traditional episode so
this was pretty common
so for a lot of the kids doing the
traditional episodes they stayed sitting
for almost the whole thing some would
get up but the majority would stay
seated but would still participate from
their chair so they'd respond but it was
often like half hearted and some would
get frustrated because of the timing
it's like I threw it and then I have to
wait to happen that's pretty common for
the traditional viewers knows um there's
another traditional viewer thank you and
how she inking with Grover influent open
keep missing I shot now I have two
coconuts in the box for time romia
coconut I am ready rolla coconut to your
old pal Grover I noticed that by the
second time they were watching they
would know about how long we had to wait
because of the replay they would know
about how long they needed to wait for
the next throw but again she's sitting
on the floor and she's still but I mean
she's still participating right she's
still following up with the cues of the
television it's just engagement is
looking very different than the kids
that are doing a connect version so
here's a connect version not that one
will do this one so here is throwing the
ball again there's also really sensitive
so when they would throw you would see
immediately like they might not have
waited for Elmo's entire Hugh they would
just do it on the 70 this is the Frog
one who likes a buzz there was a lot the
second time they came in to see another
interesting thing there happened was a
lot of the kids would do things and then
look at me and go see like they're
teaching is the first time they didn't
have the mastery of the show but based
on their replay later when they would do
it there was a lot more interacting with
me and making sure that I could
recognize for them that yes they had
learned how to watch the show which does
follow some of the research done by an
Blue's Clues looking at how kids learn
to watch certain television shows but
that was pretty interesting with the
kids think si si so here's one where um
this is during the assessment part and
we're talking about oh did I just close
it
hold on you want to see this it's
hilarious and this is one of the girls
who nope yeah this was during the
assessment as we're talking about some
of the stories and this is her telling
me about the story that had to do with
measuring in lunch alright so here's a
picture from the show she didn't want to
talk about beverage you told me what the
story was not yes that's baby done which
button is it good um in this story
there's not a girl that is crisp and
then we don't see in this picture I'm
Hubert but Hubert's our own somewhere
too so what is this story about
Hubert the human cannonball Lewbert ah
what was what was he were trying to do a
huge animals mm-hmm Oh what are you
gonna do it I don't know maybe it's just
a man on Tessa me street what is baby
better doing measure 5 feet mm-hmm and
then he's gonna launch I was clear oh
you're gonna launch if you're gonna
launch was what happens when you launch
I go up on the students then i get x
dude oh I can't no one's way too i did I
pop it I so she's like completely put
herself in the story now she understands
that Hubert ends up with his feet stuck
up in the air and she's telling me she's
launching she's showing me feet up in
the air and then um she proceeds to make
up this huge story about and then I got
stuck by the blue goo and then this
happened and then this happened and she
she kept doing that our entire interview
at the end she kept making up these
stories that were based in the narrative
of the show but then she would expand on
that and make this huge thing happen
funny aside because you know when you're
working with three to five year olds
you're getting cute stuff like all the
time major cute overload this one Ernie
sings a song about wondering why and we
talk about wandering and what is
wandering and do you wonder about things
and so in the middle of the song in the
episode he's singing a wonder you know
what makes the the birds go sing the
song they do or this why did the stars
sparkle what makes a bunny go hop hop
hop what makes a popcorn go pop pop pop
she walks up to me and she puts her hand
on my knee and she goes he doesn't know
anything how come her knee doesn't know
anything
like that was hilarious but you can
absolutely read it that way right I mean
we're like in this adult mode of oh this
childhood wonder and asking questions of
the world around us and her read on this
was completely like he knows nothing
obviously but then later in the
interview she was saying how she doesn't
know anything at least that's what her
sissy tells her but there's a lot of
connecting to the self and you hear that
when the kids start talking about their
experiences another one she did she she
was really rich in connecting from the
show to her own personal world Elmo's
World featured a horse and so when we
were talking about the horse and Elmo's
World she points to and goes when i get
older me and my sissy we're going west I
was like oh sweetie you're in seattle
you know get more less than this but she
like had this complete connection with
horses in the Wild West she's like it's
going to be hot so we got to get older
and stronger but we're going to go west
and there's a great example of when you
have multiple narratives from multiple
worlds converging right and she's
starting to pull in these these icons
and these symbols and these ideas from
different narratives she's experiencing
and pushing them together into the way
she's constructing meaning with the
things that she's seeing so kind of fun
all right where is my mouse e la la the
kids got really attached to the
assessment um they wanted to take it
home instead of a toy sometimes like I
had one girl pitch an actual fit where I
had to hide the assessment instruments
while her mom was like redirecting her
with a toy and they all got the choice
of a new toy from the toy bin right no
some of the kids were like I want that
too green bulls some foam core pieces
but the thing was when you think about
it they got to be involved in that play
space right there was a different kind
of involvement happening and I think one
of the things that that's kind of
telling about is that when there is a
connection with an experience and there
then connecting with the content in
their experiences in the show to
actually playing it out something
happens there where they then start
moving from a participation within that
product or platform to taking it outside
the bounds of that product or platform
another example of this is a friend of
mine her son was really into angry birds
and this is before angry birds got big
this is before they like over marketed
the heck out of that thing um but it was
when it was pretty much just the app and
he decided he wanted to play Angry Birds
but he wanted to do it in the house so
he drew his own used ribbon as the
slingshot and then started pulling on
couch pieces off of the couch and
building this giant obstacle course and
trying to fly these paper angry birds at
things got frustrated when it didn't get
knocked down but hey that's a really
good lesson in physics right I mean
paper has a certain kind of strength or
hardiness and couches have a certain
kind of strength or hardiness and to
push something over takes a different
kind of physics but so he's having these
experiential learning just experiencing
this with the things that he made
because he was driven by this narrative
world and then took it outside of this
narrative world and so these experiences
are mediated experiences can really
serve as catalysts for then moving into
maker spaces and playfully looking at
playful work and creation and so the
third study that I've been working with
has been looking at studio k which as I
mentioned is a curriculum a game making
curriculum for clubs right now but
looking at an online curriculum that
links to some co2 and doing game design
through co2 but also starts bringing in
telemetric data so that you can see how
players are spending their time whether
it's an editing or programming or
playing and starting to look at patterns
that emerge and different kinds of
players and what does that tell you
about the kinds of learning that are
taking place so that's what studio k is
and so the research questions we started
looking at here with this kind of a
maker space of a mediated experience
where something interest driven takes
you into the desire to
I want to make games right so how can
themes of computational thinking be used
in an observational protocol to support
telemetric data in studio k how to group
dynamics in a club setting influence
information seeking behavior and how is
gender a factor in the group dynamic and
so this is optimal with two observers
and this is what's going on right now so
we developed this protocol and it's
being used in Boys and Girls Clubs right
now looking at a site description so
what is the general site what are the
resources what is the kids energy like
when they come in for the club and then
every ten minutes using a new sheet with
the themes so we make sure that we're
addressing all of the themes regularly
through the observations of looking at
debugging logic and feedback how are
they talking about figuring out the
answers to problems or how they're
explaining the programming that they're
doing with other people or with a
facilitator how are they talking about
design or a user experience like
designing for the idea that somebody is
going to play this and then looking at
information seeking in the group
dynamics who's talking to who is it a
facilitator talking to people are the
kids talking to each other does gender
play into that I'm conveying information
is it a guiding thing we're okay so
first you do this now what do you think
you would do now what do you think you
would do or is it telling like do that
do that do that do that or give me the
controller you do this because those are
different kinds of showing and how did
that all play out in the dynamics that
are happening in these club spaces and
what happens then is you start to see um
what the telemetric data looks like so
this is the kind of time telemetric
imaging the output from the telemetry
and so you can see over time where the
points are that they're doing more
editing in the world where they're doing
programming with objects and where
they're playing so this one is somebody
who's going to play they play the game a
lot this one is someone who's actually
doing more looking at the world than
objects worlds objects
play it out how does it go okay there
might be an issue coming back
reprogramming that try it again and so
you can see how different kinds of users
are going to be different doing
different kinds of things what might
this mean though does that necessarily
mean that they're playing for that long
what kinds of things are happening in
the room that the telemetry can't
necessarily tell us so by doing these
observations we can start to see what's
happening on the dynamic and with the
kids and with that group and how that
might link and help us understand more
about the telemetry so that's going on
in that's in process now so I don't
really have outcomes to share with you
except that that's how we're looking at
that so in conclusion and since I have
the floor I figured I get to say the
things that are really important to me
um I was talking about lifespan
technology as not the lifespan of the
piece of hardware but about our lifespan
and so in intentionally leveraging the
power potential of lifespan technologies
it means that we need to be designing
products and environments with an eye
towards activity and practice so what
does that even mean um how does this
activity move a participant towards
meaning and pleasure how do these
activities and practices empower the
participant to make larger connections
beyond just the product or even have the
product or environment serve as a
catalyst for deeper engagement and
creative expression so this means
different kinds of things to different
kinds of development so what maybe what
that means for Workforce Development
increasing the number of females and
computer science it's not necessarily
about persuasion but it's about leveling
a playing field it's about understanding
what are the experiences that young
women young girls are going through how
they engage what their practices are
like what their activities are like and
then leveling that playing field so that
there aren't the same barriers that
exist and let them make their choices
right so it's it's not just persuading
people to go into a field
it's making sure that's enough that
nothing is going to stand in the way of
them making that choice what does that
mean in designing for kids well it means
that kids are way more complicated than
a less learn it grown up they're not
going on this trajectory from knowing a
little too knowing a little more to
knowing a little more and no it's a big
grown-up now it's way more nuanced it
means that when you're thinking about
childhood it means we're not thinking
about just anyone under 18 years old
different things happen in different
places in childhood is a culture that
needs to be respected because it's an
interesting kind of an indigenous
culture because it so tightly relies on
its own cultural networks and frames but
just because we were once kids doesn't
mean that we can ever claim allegiance
and identity to that culture again once
we're out we're out therefore it needs
to be respected in the way we listen to
them the way we understand them the way
we understand that development is so
much more nuanced than little grown-ups
and what that means for thinking about
spaces for play work and creation is we
need to consider our opportunities to
move participants into deeper activities
and creation spaces so things like Kodu
where you're actually doing something
that has interest driven learning and
allows you to create in this mediated
environment that takes you through these
different types of narratives and allows
you to help create your own narrative
and your own experience compelling
narrative experiences are catalysts for
this kind of participatory movement and
that's I think what I care the most
about is those things actually one thing
I forgot to mention was in the tech
trajectories the stories with the women
in CS fields one thing that was a theme
across the majority of them was they all
had some kind of deeper interest driven
learning taking place in their younger
years as one of them described I was
really into games I built my first
computer when I was in high school but
it wasn't because I knew I was
interested in CS it was because that was
just the thing I needed to play games
and so these powerful experiences of
interest driven learning
can become that catalyst for much deeper
things to happen and that is my
presentation the research is ongoing
there's a lot of data there's a lot of
questions to be asked continually and
I'm actually really looking forward to
even though the internship is ending it
doesn't mean analysis is ending and
hopefully there'll be really really
exciting things to share in the future
as we start to get even more nuanced and
dig deeper into these datasets I'd like
to open it up for questions yes so you
mentioned this interest rate in learning
is it was important for some of your
successful female so recently I a
sponsor this goofy box project so this
is a kick stop Kickstarter projects or
soap some woman of Oklahoma in San
Francisco she wanted to design
engineering tools for girls he found out
it's not that all the building blocks
and stuff that they goes and staffing
like your two employees and their four
girls just their peak but your girls are
not you know although pink eyes are more
appealing than other colors but that's
kind of what appeals to the girls it's
what she found out is the girls they are
really interested in the story making
they want to tell story about a lot of
things so when she designed this
engineering toys for girls she's so
everything's about making stories right
hmm build stuff so that you can make
stories so I thought that that kind of
observation was pretty kind of
interesting she's still making towards
it's not up in the market yeah yeah I'm
trying to see whether you have a kind of
similar observation
so Edward for girls you know you need to
have some kind of different motivation
for them to engage with engineering
right and I think that's one of the
things that in looking at the gender
differences across the different types
of research I think that's one of the
things that hopefully is emerging is
that there are boys that really like to
create narrative worlds as well there
are girls that connect with narrative in
different ways but then you also don't
want to just pigeonhole a gender and say
this is what you do and this is what you
like I think one reason that minecraft
is as exciting and compelling as it is
is because it does give the opportunity
for those that want to do the narrative
and the story building the opportunity
to do so and that for those that really
are in two different styles of play that
affords them the opportunity to do that
as well and so one thing I think that
was striking in the conversations with
the women in CS field was that yes there
were some things that stayed true to
perceptions we had of females and their
experiences in their life stories but
there were definitely things that also
defied the things that we thought we
knew um themes showing things like group
work isn't as important until you're
grown up and so I think in thinking
about toys and play spaces which really
are so rich for meaning making in play
is just so so important I would
challenge anybody to continue to knock
pigeonhole a gender but to break down
the barriers that allow them to
experience different kinds of building
and meaning making yeah I get really
irritated with pink Legos seriously
irritated a one of one of my women who
is interviewed had said how she used to
they used to play like theatre and
role-playing was a big thing for her
when she was a child but she mostly
played with boys and then they always
got in fights because she didn't want to
be the pink ranger and like because that
was their token female 1 right and it
was
pink one and she was like I hate pink I
don't want to be the pink ranger and
that was like she's playing with the
boys but still they're trying to
pigeonhole her to the pink one but I
mean so there's different kinds of
experiences and I think we need to
respect gender a little more than that
yeah yeah I'd like to just ask your
opinion on a couple of things how kind
of sort of the empirical study just I'm
curious if you have any thoughts on a
couple of aspects of this one was you
mentioned the importance of imperative
to engage in these two beasts deeper
kind of just patiently play spaces is
what do you think about the use of an
existing narrative like Sesame you know
where the kids have have have knowledge
of it I mean you mentioned too that we
had to kind of you know move into that
world and try to do what we wanted to do
within that space so that versus maybe
the development of entirely new kinds of
narrative properties so new narrative
properties are exciting and if first if
they hit that sweet spot of whatever it
is that makes them awesome like and
sometimes I hate to say this but
sometimes its marketing sweet spot like
look at Skylanders what's happening
right now with Skylanders it's like
exploding and that's kind of a new
property I mean it's building on old
spiral but it's also this new world so I
think there's there's something to be
said for new properties definitely but
where that sweet spot is needs to be
looked at as as far as what is the
practices in activity to take place
within that world and how can that world
then become a catalyst for deeper
practices and activities um another
thing to say on that red yeah this is
just in the general of
no your experiences with interactive
storytelling as a word you were able to
contrast the passive classical viewing
experience versus this interactive
experience and it's interesting to me
because you're dealing with a audience
that is sort of they're not they haven't
they don't have like two or three
decades of experience for the passive
way over and I just wondering where
there were the frictions to the to the
interactive narrative experience I don't
think friction and because it wasn't
necessarily interactive narrative where
the choices that they made changed major
outcomes in this story the way you would
think of really really richly developed
narrative experiences um like perhaps
some of the more trying to think of one
off the top like mass effect right where
you're looking at a rich narrative that
has specific outcomes in the way
something is played that being said that
narrative experience isn't really only
about the story but is about the set of
practices and what they're doing in
their head and then how they're taking
that outside of it and connecting to
those concepts I remembered what I was
going to say before there was a study
when you're looking at younger kids I
think there needs to be a mix of the
familiar and the unfamiliar there have
been studies that show that when younger
children are being taught something
there was one where they're being taught
something from elmo and they were being
taught something by somebody new that
they totally didn't know they trusted
Elmo more because they knew Elmo already
and so they actually found for that
particular comprehension that they were
looking at kids who experienced it with
Elmo did better because they already had
a relationship with the character that's
not to say that we should just stick to
the ones we have because there's
definitely something to be said about
the kind of attention drawing that new
experiences provide for younger
audiences I mean that's when you have
deeper attention is when you when you're
wanting to connect to it you want to
figure it out that's when you're drawn
in
when there's something new and those
confounding things that you're trying to
piece together so yeah anything else no
yeah we were first starting this I could
have some kind of expectation of what
press outcomes and success was and you
know clearly the kids learned as did the
property are the things that you have
not been able to measure or didn't think
to measure but that you would design
differently in the next study that it
would give you the kind of better
insight about what the outcomes of my
opinion there are definitely so there
were a couple things I changed on the
fly like after a couple kids and like
whoa this has to get adapted now I'm
just not going to get the richest data
possible one was the decision to measure
lunch and it originally had been
precisely and what I had done was I did
a Content analysis of the episode and I
got word frequencies for what are the
words that actually come up the most to
see how they're connecting to the things
that are most reinforced and precisely
was like that had high high high
frequency in the episode so did launch
freak precisely had a little too much it
was just a little too ambiguous for that
age group and so that's that's when
understanding your age group really is
important and even wonder was like not
to be crossed but it was a bit of a
crapshoot like that's a tough one for
three and four year olds it's abstract
um but on the off chance that they were
going to get it I wanted to have a
conversation about it I think for
changes um I think I would design some
of the relational concept stuff a little
differently with what problems I had
with the word between I think I'd like
to mess with different ways of showing
expertise with that concept and
different ways to perform it for me in a
play space so that's one thing I think
I'd do differently and then I think
as I go through the discourse analysis
of the transcripts of the kinds of
conversations we had after the
open-ended stuff I think there's going
to be a lot of really interesting things
