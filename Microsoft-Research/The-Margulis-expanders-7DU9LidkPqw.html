you
okay good afternoon we're happy to have
James Lee tell us about the margalus
expander say what I'm gonna say oh yeah
so that no that makes sense no sir I was
teaching a course on spectral graph
theory in the spring and I showed all
the students that are random regular
graph is an expander and I want to do an
explicit construction and so I've you
know you hear a lot of things about
explicit construction of expander grass
and zigzag product but I want to do
something that was really sort of I was
hoping I could do something was
elementary enough that you could do it
in one lecture and Billy understood and
I remember the actually ryan o'donnell
wrote this blog entry a few years ago
that upset avi avi victor soon because
ryan said you know everybody says that
the zigzag expanders are the first one
who's not sis can be understood but
actually the Gaborik a little analysis
is just a cup you pages of analysis and
so in an okay oh we got upset cuz he
always said nobody ever said that they
were the first understandable examples
and so on so then I when I looked at the
Gaborik a lil a analysis and
unfortunately it is it's elementary but
there's three or four pages of
calculations which don't seem a mutable
to a lecture and then there is a
follow-up paper of jimbo and meralco
where it's the proof I guess is more
elementary because there are no complex
numbers so but it's a little bit more
complicated and then even in this sort
of the expander survey of a hoary lineal
and vigorous in they say you know here's
the analysis of margules grass it's a
few pages but it's still subtle and
mysterious and so it just turns out that
if you take various pieces from various
places and put them together in the
right way then the proof is almost it's
almost disillusioning lee simple almost
trivial which is kind of which is kind
of yet you always when you think about
expanders you think there's always
something deep lying behind there like
some kind of exponential some or some
product theorem or something
representation theory so the point today
is that a
hope for everything I almost everything
i say is like it's very easy to follow
so this will be like 25-30 minutes at a
very leisurely pace okay so let me just
say who are the what's going on here so
in 1973 margulis presented the first
example of an explicit family of
expanders and then but this the analysis
used quote unquote deep facts from
representation theory and then gulberg a
lil in I guess their journal papers in
81 there Fox it was in 79 gave an
elementary proof using just sort of
essentially a bunch of inequalities with
complex numbers and then Jimbo and
Moroka in 85 but in actually this was in
Fox 79 I think this was in Fox 83 gave a
even more elementary proof as I said
with no complex numbers but slightly
more complicated ok so today I want to
present just what seems to be a proof
that has almost no ideas in it okay so
let me remind you what's going on we
have a graph and a subset let's define
the expansion constant of this subset
inspected the graph and by the way of
course ask me questions at a time and
also I don't claim anything here is new
so and I heard a noise when I said that
I think they stopped filming but ok so
the expansion constant of the subset s
is just a number of edges that cross
from s to its complement / the size of s
and then let's define also overloading
notation a bit h of G to be the
expansion constant of G so look over all
subsets I the most half of the expansion
of that subset ok so that's the
expansion allergy and let's also define
the course by notion of a functions so
if F is a function from the vertices
let's say to the complex numbers for the
sake of what I'm doing here then the
Rayleigh quotient is that correct
Russ it's not rally it's really
according to us I mean according to the
world that's the correct pronunciation
but all right okay here's the the
Rayleigh quotient and finally the second
eigenvalue of the laplacian of this
graph is just the minimum of this
Rayleigh quotient over all functions at
some 20 okay so this is the setup and
then let's define what an expander
family is so I an expander family is a
sequence of D regular graphs such that
the second eigen values are uniformly
bounded or equivalently the expansion
constants of the graph our uniform about
it ok so the goal today is to present
and a an elementary family of graphs
with an elementary Niles is showing you
they're expanders ok and I need one
thing for this to be elementary so I
assume everybody sort of believes the
following
connection between agonize and expansion
but let me say it in a way that I need
it and again the you know i'm assuming
that you know this sort of that this
seems like so natural to you that you
wouldn't question it so because that
that makes the proof you know in order
for the things I said about triviality
be true that has to that has to hold so
what is this so we have a graph G a
subset of the vertices you okay this
grass can be doesn't have to be finite
so this graph could be an infinite graph
and when I'm saying here graph G you and
we have a function from the vertices so
I need the complex numbers here let's
say the complex numbers of course it
doesn't matter for this it's for what i
want to say such that the support of F
so the place all the places where F are
nonzero is contained inside you in fact
that's not clear that I need to set you
so let's just say this way I have a
graph and a function and and the
function is bounded in NL to so fu
squared is less than infinity then there
exists a finite subset of the vertices
and in fact the subset is a subset of
supported f ok so this subset has nodes
on which contains only nodes on which F
takes a nonzero value ok so there is a
subset with such a the expansion of this
subset is that most square root 2 times
the Rayleigh quotient ok so given any
function on the graph which is bounded
in l2 there exists a subset of support
of F whose expansion is that most some
into ballys bounder in terms of the rate
equation ok alright so now we are ready
to to start the proof of the theorem so
I'll state a theorem in a second first
let me just introduce let me sort of
state a the main technical lemma ok
which is very simple so suppose I see
your maps on the plane to itself you
find by so let's say sxy is maps
ex-wives you x + y Y and T of X Y is the
same thing in the other coordinate
that's it 2x y plus X and also need the
inverses of these folks let me just
write them for sake of not having to
think about what they are okay here are
the inverse of these functions so i have
st s inverse and t inverse and let me
define a graph based on these functions
so the graph will be a vertex set which
is integer lattice and the edges of the
graph will be the following will connect
a vertex X Y to let's go to sxy TX y s
inverse X Y and T inverse X Y ok so this
graph has degree at most for the origin
for instance has either you can think of
it as having for self loops if you want
the origin has has no adjacent things
and now here's the main yes absolutely
thank you I planted that so I can check
if you're paying attention so ok ok so
now here's the main technical theorem
well let's call it a limo ok so I mean
we want to well I'm going to prove sort
of the drugs you know there's a sequence
of expander graphs so we need something
something to expand so this this graph
is going to be on our expanding object
and here's the main proof the main lemma
for any subset of the integers it
doesn't contain zero ok so remember zero
doesn't have any neighbors so it's
that's like mid zero the number of edges
from
to its complement is at least besides a
day okay so in some sense this is the
infinite gravely sometimes this infinite
graph is expanding ok this is the clamp
and and and this is the really this is
the expander part of the whole proof
okay so let's prove this the proof is
really simple so here's the proof so
let's here's the plane this is the plane
let's break it up into four quadrants q1
q2 q3 and q4 and I want I want to
partition the plane except for the
origin so I'm gonna so I will include
the y ax or the sort of x axis in q1 I
don't know if this notation makes any
sense but ok so just to be clear q1 is
the set of pairs X Y such that x is
bigger than 0 and Y is bigger than equal
to 0 ok that's q1 it's the quadrant with
the positive x x and similarly for q2 q2
is in fact just the 90 degree rotation
of q1 and q3 is hundred a degree
rotation of q1 and so on ok so these
four sets partition the plane I mean the
integer lattice minus minus the origin
and I'll define a sub I to be QC to be
the intersection of a with the I
squadron so I'll break the set into
quadrants and then ok so I have to
remember not to write and just no man's
land over here here's the claim that I'm
going to prove that the number of edges
from a1 to the compliment intersected
with the first quadrant so these are
edges that that go from a one outside of
a 1 all inside the first quadrant this
is at least the size of egg 1 ok and if
I prove that I've proved dilemma because
just apply it separately to a1 a2 a3 and
a4 and really it's without loss this
graph is completely this graph is
invariant under rotations by 90 degrees
so right I have the if I flip or
exchange the coordinates the graph isn't
very
so I really need to prove for the first
quadrant everything is symmetric and
here's the proof for the first quadrant
it's a okay it's simple enough to do
here the first thing is that if i apply
S or T to a 1 then I stay inside the
first quadrant that's straightforward I
have none I have you know non-negative
coordinates I add to them i keep my non-
coordinates good and and the second
claim is that actually they're disjoint
and the reason they're disjoint is
because if i draw the line y equals x
then s Maps everything above this line
and T Maps everything below this line
and if you think about the boundary so
point here will get mapped by which one
changes the y coordinate will get mapped
by T up to the diagonal and of course
they're also get map to themselves by by
s and and points but points on the
diagonal get mapped off the diagonal
okay so it's really the case that their
images are disjoint the image of s and T
in this quadrant I just joined because
again s Maps everything you know up here
including this line to hear and T Maps
everything here to here okay okay so
that's the end of the proof right
because that implies let me do it here
by the way tell me if it's if it's out I
won't right over here anymore but
because that implies that okay that
implies that this equals this but sncr
by jection so this is just twice a one
so you know when i apply smt the set
gets bigger by a factor of two so i have
at least a 1 edges coming out of a 1
okay so that's the end of the probe of
the claim and the end of the brew of the
lemma so it's really just that I mean
it's really just that you take a set and
it's sort of okay half the set goes up
here and sort of another copy of the set
goes down here and that happens in every
one of the four quadrants so you get an
extra so you get twice as many vertices
so you get an extra you get an expander
okay so I claim it that's it that's
that's that's I mean the proof is not
finished we haven't even defined a
family of grass yet but this is the main
technical part of the proof and in fact
this is the part that corresponds to the
mysterious subtle argument and all the
other proofs that involve a few pages of
Fourier analysis just listening okay so
now let's see what I want to do yeah
yeah so no no so now of course we
haven't but I but you'll see that this
is everything else is now just sort of
Han you know I mean is a it's like
parlor tricks but not then there's
nothing deeds it happens now what's that
so so the first thing all the proofs
have some kind of fundamental flaw so if
you try to use discrete Fourier
transform then everything has to be
messy if you use the continuous Fourier
transform then and you don't use the
discrete chicken equality then this
proof looks much harder than it actually
is I think that's the essence of it
although could argue that it's yeah
that's that's essentially why it's yeah
so okay all right so let's uh sure
cheater or even if you just I mean now
you prove that combinatorial expansion
yeah if you stick to the combinatorial
expansion okay so maybe you'll say at
some point there's something subtle to
happen so that's not at some point will
have to pass to will have to pass to
function it's not sets just because
basically just because if you take the
Fourier transform of the set you don't
you won't get a set in the in the 48
basis but ok so I said now I said
Fourier like eight times so it seems
like something complicated gonna happen
but it's not true okay so let me sorry
is this okay okay so let me define okay
so we have those infinite family
infinite graphics let me define a finite
currently of graphs and which is the
most obvious thing if you think of which
is just take everything mud and that's
the infinite family of grass so okay so
the vertex set is just going to be
discrete porous and the edge set now you
have to be a little careful the edge
that's going to be these edges plus the
neighbor edges then just so the edge set
earth is XY gets is adjacent to X plus
minus 1 y XY plus minus 1 X plus minus y
y so these are the s edges and X ok
that's the graph and now let's even
state the main theorem here here on
lambda 2 ok I'm not there exists to see
such as rauhala and lambda 2 GN is
bigger than see that's the main theorem
ok so uh alright so now let's prove it
ok I'll keep a discreet cheater and
quality we don't need it
okay so now you not okay so people might
take issue with the part of this part of
the proof but I claim that this actually
makes the proof less interesting so so
let me so I'm going to want to use the
the continuous sort of the tote the two
Taurus ok and I'm going to think about
the hilbert space of functions here so
this is the space of all functions from
the torus to the complex not very such
that there are two norms about it okay
right so again I mean the two tourists
is just right the unit square with the
sides identified ok that's the two tours
and now let me define I'm this is just a
number there's not going to be any
operator here but lambda 2 in the
analogous way to be the minimum over
functions here of ok so i should take f
minus f composed with t f minus f
composed with sorry s and T and subject
to the constraint that when you
integrate F over the torus equals 0 so
this is the second eigen values of the
torus with this strange smt but just
this is just a number yeah which means
two things oh yeah so this is a type
setting issue than ever I just
encountered now I just my blackboard t
looks really bad it looks like a pie so
I wasn't sure how to her I see ok so
let's I guess we've already used her
let's get let's replace T by something
else scooped tea is dangerous how does
want to do script that's a J all right
I'll see you
oh the other direction like this it
looks like all right I'll I'm gonna make
up a symbol okay mask LT is that all
right I'm not sure I can okay i'll use
the blackboard bowl that's a good okay
it's it looks it's now i'm not going to
need to use a notation more than for a
few seconds okay looks like a pie
everybody has to get over this fact I
apologize alright just you know if you
have if you have bad eyesight like me
then just squint and it looks better
okay right so here's the this is just a
number this is not second negative
anything i'm just using it for analogy
okay and here's the second main lemma
which is that the second and final main
llama that there exists an epsilon such
that for all and lambda 2 of GN is at
least lambda 2 of the tours with these
SNT operators ok so I ok ok so this
should be reassuring because it implies
that there's we're not going to be using
any number theory in our analysis of
this object right you could look at this
you know x + y y plus X so this is
somehow using the pseudo random nature
of the primes with respect to I don't
know okay but but if we replace it by
the tourists and there's really no the
modulus and has no effect so it really
just and it's nice it tells you why the
graphs are all expanders because they're
essentially just converging to the
Taurus okay so so let me prove this the
proof is very simple and again I claim
that sort of if this is you should be
happy to see this because this means
that nothing you know once you're here
there's nothing tricky going on there's
no number theory at some point right
okay so what's the proof so take any
function from the vertex side of this
graph GN say the real line
here it's fine the ticket of your line
okay because I i guess i define it in
terms of complex numbers it doesn't it
doesn't matter okay such that the sum is
equal to 0 okay and I just want to
define an extension of this the taurus
and i'm going to define it in the
simplest possible I'll be fine in a very
simple way at least okay so here's the
taurus i can put ZN on the Taurus is
like a I can put the grid lines
corresponding to sort of mod N and then
so I want to define some extension of F
to the whole Taurus so I think about my
vert doing graphics fitting inside
vittoria so I want to define this
extension so suppose that let's see okay
so was it I have some square with
corners u1 u2 u3 u4 and I have some Z in
the middle here and I want to define the
extension to this point Z so you can do
this in any sufficiently nice way you
want ok you just interpolate I guess the
cleanest way to do it is something like
like this so I'll explain what this says
in a second so I'm just going to write
as an average of the four points how am
I writing the average well here looks
like the L infiniti warrant norm looks
nicely so basically for every point I
just look at the L infinity so I sort of
the maximum of the x and y distances to
the four corners and I use those for the
weights on the f and now it has a nice
property that if I look at a point here
it the extension only depends on you for
and you three because there's no weight
corresponding do you one on you two so
in fact it is consistent along although
this consistently defines the extension
f ok big is not so important this is
just some sort of you know it's got a
define F right sort of you know define f
hey girl
so here the Infinity no te one should be
one so the coefficient of you one goes
away do you Jenna take any smooth
function that vanishes when you okay you
can this is not okay so now we just have
to nice want to prove that that the sort
of the Rayleigh quotient for F tilde is
at most the Rayleigh quotient for F okay
so we need to verify so let's first
verify that F integrates 20 that's
straightforward just by the symmetry
when you integrate you pick up every
corner with the same weight and the sum
of the s20 so that's 0 that's that's
easy in fact pulley everybody remembers
smt the second property I claim is that
integral F squared over the torus is at
least some constant times n squared
times the sum of f u squared claim this
and this is again very simple take any
square say take the maximum corner and
take a little box around it you know a
box of side length 18 then in here the
the integral of the square of F tilde
will be proportional to the f of u F of
U 1 squared so okay and and the the
volume of the little boxes is a constant
time over N squared so when you
integrate that to the middle box you
pick up this the maximum corner at least
and so sum over all the squares you get
this kind of thing all right so then
that last we need to verify is that is
that F feel free to argue with me at any
point about whether this is elementary
but hopefully all these things is we
just really like you know okay very
alright so the last point is to prove
this that most the constant times x that
this is again very easy yes thank you
okay so what's the reason for this well
take any take any square and any other
square and suppose I have said here and
up here is s of Z ok so now basically I
want to say that whenever whenever the
torus has to pay over here this sum over
here we'll also have to pay ok so how do
you do that well the first thing is just
to notice in the graph anyone it so
there are eight points here correspond
to the corresponding to the eight
corners any one of these points can
reach any other point in the graph in at
most five steps so you know you might
have to take s somewhere and then take
an edge to get back here and then come
up here but in at most five steps any
point here can reach any point here this
is the only place by the way we're going
to use the where we use the fact that
the that we put these edges in there
it's just to make the graph look like a
tourist so what it means is that so now
I want to say that say this distance is
say F tilde is has a difference of Delta
between here and here I was want to say
that there exists at least one corner
their existing these two corners whose
whose distances at least you know dealt
over for ok and the reason for that is
just that well suppose all of these
corners are within Delta over four and
all of these are within Delta before
well this the value of F tilde is a
convex combination of the corners so
that means that the value of F tilde
here and here is also it's also is also
within Delta over four so so we've okay
so so there must be two corners that
differ a lot and since all the corners
are connected by path ahead lies at
length at most five some edge in this
sum has to pay for this difference okay
and everything I wrote here is correct
except for the fact that I want when you
integrate this only has only one over N
squared so you have to pay it you only
get one around square ok so I claim
that's the I think I basically I claimed
that this Lima was trivial like I mean
you just extend it to F and just observe
that holds and now ok good so now the
proof now we're just left to show that
this thing is bigger than 0
so let me first let me do it and then
I'll explain it okay so the proof really
only has about one minute left in it
modulo the explanation so what I'm going
to use now for the final step is the
Fourier transform the classical Fourier
transform from the from the torus to its
ok so by l2 Z this is the set of all say
complex-valued functions on the square
such that ok ok so I'm going to use this
Fourier transform all right and the
point is just that this before you
transform is a linear map and it's an
isometry ok so now here's what I'll do
so it's a linear map and it's an
isometry so what it means is that let's
just apply it in here ok so how are you
applying it look so let's write F hat
for the Fourier transform of F so you
know ok the Fourier transform is a
linear isometry so I can apply it I can
take hats in all these places and it's
none of the distances change and it's
linear so i can i can distribute the
hats and then well I don't take a hat
here but this condition is equivalent to
an almost a just a second that the
Fourier transform vanishes at 0 that's
the same thing as saying excitation is
that the fourier coefficient of 0 is a0
ok so so now you have this and now
here's a claim that i'll just to find a
second you need the fact that when you
apply the fourier transform to a shift
it's also it's a shift in the four-year
basis as well so what does it mean the
claim is that this is the same thing as
i guess it turns out it's t inverse and
i'll argue this in a second but let me
finish the
proof first okay that ok look let my
claim is this will prove this in a
second now with this in hand we can just
rewrite this so I'll rewrite it lambda 2
equals the minimum over F hat of okay so
some over Z in the lattice f of z minus
F of T inverse Z squared plus F of Z
minus 0 there should be hats all over
here s inverse Z squared divided by sum
F hat squared subject to the constraint
that F at 0 equals 0 okay all right so
this is so I'm just rewriting so I took
Fourier transforms and then i use my
claim 22 right that the fourier
transform of F hat se is actually just F
hat composed with T inverse okay now the
point is that this is I guess we could
just write it this is exactly the
minimum Rayleigh quotient of F hat with
respect to our original infinite graph G
on the integers all right our graph that
was had edge is defined by smt subject
to the constraint that is equals zero ok
this is just the Rayleigh quotient of
our original graph G ok but now we know
that this is at least half by dilemma
combining the discrete chigger
inequality so the screeching equality
says that for any that the Rayleigh
quotient of so what does it say the
Rayleigh quotient of nef that vanishes
at zero is at least
the expansion of sets that Duncan as at
least the half times the square of the
expansion of sets that don't contain
zero so this is half times one squared
where one is the expansion constant
upset that don't contain zero okay so so
I'll justify the claim in a second but
that's the that's the proof you prove
this fact about the integer lattice then
pass the finite grass by taking
quotients move from your family fine I
graphs to a single just to the torus
okay and then just apply for a
transforms and and they and the problem
you let your left was after you apply
for you transfer which is exactly the
problem on this on this lattice okay so
I mean I think the proof is simple
enough that you can actually remember it
like you could you know recall it later
so let me just argue about let me just
remind people so here I'll do it right
here what's going on okay so what does
the Fourier transform look like okay so
first of all what's the 48 basis so for
integers mi name you look at functions 2
pi I MX plus and why that's the Fourier
basis and then the point is that you can
write every f as a sum over m NN the
actual fact that this whole was not
proved until actually I wish I remember
the history of this but I my feeling is
that for functions of this form that are
very very simple it's not too hard to
show that okay so the point is you you
have this you know you can write any
function in the four-year basis where
the dysphoria coefficient is just the
inner product of offending
right what we don't want anything like
that right this is only know we're just
gonna get a summer okay we just need the
fact that this is an isometry yeah we
just really need the fact that yeah this
is a oh yeah we threads really simple
right it's not just that it's like this
is a Hilbert space and you have our
thought analogy of the characters okay
there's all the truth of completeness
function which is orthogonal to all
friends
it's of July detected either cover
but we don't even need that we just
needed that set to help fill out first
hey listen none of it matters I mean
even if you had some error you can take
the air to be epsilon and then take from
it epsilon with a zero so you actually
can just do everything with bounded
error right it's like okay so okay uh so
so you disagree with the Urgals is euro
is good bleep the selects go with the
point proving it for this function there
goes a zero is darn near trivial I mean
this function is like just but it's like
you can you could make it peace while I
you know very nice effect about it to
the point just rush submitting this to
their when you have the minimum over at
packets yeah so suppose so the subject
fact is in fact it is on trees onto
no using you just need to be injected by
everything here it can be can be
so I'm proving a strong improving that
this minimum is large which is stronger
than proving that the image of this
thing under the Fourier transform is
large right but any case so now you can
see that you know the first fourier
coefficient is just adjust the integral
of F because it's a constant function
and then what's the other fact you need
to see just that if you take eq compose
one a nominated for a basis with F and
what you get is is this with s is this
because now X gets replaced by X plus y
and so why picks up an M so I get that
okay and similarly plus n and and this
implies that well okay so what does it
imply so look at the Fourier transform
of F composed with s this is sum over N
n of this but now we have to write em n
plus m and then just change the
variables and we get i get this so this
is why okay so that proves this claim
that when you take the Fourier transform
of F composed with s then what you get
is
had s compose with T inverse and
similarly for us yeah so it's really
just the yeah these shifts just act as
shifts in the four year basis okay
that's the proof any question in Bodega
that I'm curious doesn't know whether
people think that was simple AC we not
we didn't do anything hard right so just
think about the lambda 2 of the Toros
must be some exercising differential
geometry boots no I mean they know
because this SNT these are these are not
like all Samantha's announced and yes
these are some strange operators not
sure what you that you would want to
consider those in like I mean they don't
reflect the geometry of the I get we
then some sense that's where the
expansion is surah has come from how do
you start with to mention object and get
an expander you have to have some
operators that don't behave or not
geometrically well-behaved these things
jump across the space it's just
virtually is it to take everything with
all your mortgage okay
but ok so that that's and it seems to be
I mean you know okay
at least if you user if this is second
nature to you then all the steps of the
proof really just flow very nicely okay
maybe maybe you guys have a different
opinion but you you're sort of
apply I mean don't get your graph really
as a caution of Z square but you take
your graph you approximate Doris with it
and then Fourier transform gets you to Z
square yes I mean there's two point
right the lattice okay z squared expands
and that's you know again it's almost
trivial just because right so in general
if you took that if you took the
standard generators on the on the
lattice then of course you wouldn't you
wouldn't have an expander because you
know the boundary grows linearly in the
volume goes quadratically but here the
the the boundary grows along with the
size of the ball so sort of you fix your
fixing it by making the boundary much
thicker because you're taking these huge
jumps so this is sort of second nature
and now the question you're I guess
really want ask is what when you take
can any funny things happen when you
take torsion so that somehow you get
this miraculous thing where all these
jumps go to the same place and once you
get to here I mean this sort of says
that nothing miraculous I mean this this
kind of says nothing miraculous is
happening right i mean because there's
no the end doesn't play any kind of role
so there's two steps right expect the
expansion for z squared with these with
these smt operators and then the fact
that wrap around doesn't hurt the
expansion okay so the fact that wrap
around doesn't hurt the expansion maybe
that's the little mysterious see that
you have to give the function i think as
you start off with just come to show the
expansion for that's what you end up
with as well so so in fact you can
there's there is another there's another
way to the proof actually which is you
could you could you could start with
commas or expansion you could maintain
common or expansion and just go to some
kind of continuous expansion for sets in
the taurus that did that also works I
actually just think this is simpler
because when you allow yourself
arbitrary functions you can just it's
actually a little bit easier than
playing around with the sets to make
sure they all line up but then when you
take Fourier transforms eventually you
get arbitrary functions again
so so you can't say what sets a little
time it seems so what does this have to
do with mogu listen formulation that's a
good question that's a pretty wimpy yeah
you know I this is one of the problems
with his paper being in Russian and also
inaccessible which is that at some point
I looked at it no no there's an English
translation sorry yeah but then every
time I you know the past five times I
tried to go back and look at margos his
paper I I couldn't get it so I don't I
no longer remember what I mean you know
you can see the matrices that correspond
to s and T the question is yeah I I want
to remember so i'll tell you when i
figured out what the what Margolis is
construction was and what the
representation theoretic machine right I
mean I guess it depends on whatever
representation do attic result he was
using whether I needed primes hear ya
there are no prompts right Chris dumped
us off
yeah that's yeah yeah so
alright so I mean that sense you can say
it's
actually don't remember the history is
very well is he the one who observed
that sort of cars don t and then you
pass to potions gives you expanders ok
Leo did this crap ghazal Galu did this
graph but for various reasons they took
instead of plus minus only took plus
minus two just because when they did the
Fourier analysis that help them have a
square somewhere so so they did this
thing ok Davie I mean they did
essentially the same thing but but now
they analyzed you know they analyze
these they didn't use a cheater and they
didn't pass the sets to analyze the
Fourier transform they just analyze it
into you know so the proof has a similar
flavor where you sort of say that a
function has to grow a certain amount of
the time with you know two-thirds the
time blah blah blah but it's nothing but
it's it's a it's a few pages of complex
analysis you know I mean that complex
analysis but it's you know do you you
see things like bounding characters and
then there's a square and there's like
the oh we have to make this square there
to have a trick in the Fourier analysis
so it's any time you have 14 oz it's a
little subtle upon your just have
sequences of inequalities that work out
so it's nice that and in the in the
discrete case you're completely screwed
because you can't I mean you can't get
rid of the torsion so so again you can
do something which simulates sort of
what happens in the continuous case but
you can't get something just pretty if
you take screech eager
quality you get down to two finite sets
so somehow because the number one works
because you were only looking at finite
sets so they they are open to the
outside and you get lots of edges nobody
even here you'd be bounded out to so you
would sexually be finite I mean you can
even if you can if you weren't gonna get
discrete chicken you're just gonna
operate this
this isn't the trucks in my zoo
or
ok
go on
we're supposed to be elementary proofs
of the typo
but for the Zen you know at some point
about two months ago I look through
everyone's lectures notes everywhere and
try to find the simple proof and in fact
I should say that lemma 1 this is there
is a paper of lineal in London which
considers the same problem but for
continuous sets in the plane and this
this proof you know it's very simple but
this proof is essentially an observation
of Z's vir about their paper but it's
very yeah but the point is the
complicated parts and although the proof
really our lemma 1 it's just a lemma 1
plus the chigger inequality that's what
yeah so all right change</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
