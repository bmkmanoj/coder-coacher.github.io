you
okay ah good morning everyone ah it's a
great pleasure to have Daphna shut off
here from Carnegie Mellon and Stanford
is going to talk about the aha moment
from data to inside thank you okay first
of all I can you hear me excellent so
I'm Daphna and like I said I'm going to
be talking about my recent project the a
moment from dated insect so what does it
mean the thing is there was a time not
so long ago when getting your hands on
good data was really really difficult
like this port interviewer here that had
to ride a horse across the country and
ask farmers how many colors they had and
of course today it's a completely
different star right there you have this
okay yeah cuz they tell you where they
are and where they've been acting today
so getting your hands on data is no
longer much of a problem we have more
data than we know what to do is and it's
actually a great news for everybody
right because logical data has potential
to transform almost every aspect of our
life from science to business and sport
and public health and if you can really
address some of society's most pressing
problems the thing is for this potential
to be realized it's also have to collect
this data to acquire this data not even
to search your list data you have to
actually understand it you have to make
sense of it you really have to turn
those heaps of data into insight okay
and this is where I come in and my goal
is to develop computational approaches
for this proud of turning data into
insight and these are yourself the
question that I'm most curious about
okay for example what is inside or give
a lot of data how do you help people
understand is the structure order the
most interesting bits and pieces and
ultimately how to use those idea to
build a system that you all for sales
they discover it gets let me give an
example this is going to be in the
context of news so here's the scenario
suppose you're trying to understand a
really complex news story okay die Greek
that crisis or the presidential campaign
so what do you do well most of us would
go to a search engine right we love
search engines thing is search engines
are great at your giving those nuggets
of knowledge but they won't show you how
to order at 57 million results fit
together right is absolutely no
structure
now I'm being slightly unfair here
because there has been a lot of work on
incorporating structure into search
results including worked it came from
here like news junkie but most of it
boils down to a timeline ocala this is
about a Greek debt crisis now I'm going
to claim that this stuff summarization
really only works a simple story that
are linear by nature and the field
stories are nothing like linear if I had
to go over the picture of the Greek debt
crisis then it's not a single line it's
more like that's so what do you do with
this spaghetti type of stories let me
show the Holy Grail how many of you have
seen a few maps before okay that's kind
of what I expected the little an issue
map it's a set of seven posters but the
great AI debate about whether computers
can think calamy just zoom in it's very
a graph for each node is an argument and
the argument like machines can have
emotions and I just tell that this
argument is supported by that argument
which is disputed by the other argument
case you're real supposed to look at it
and get the big picture now I stumbled
upon those issue message Carnegie Mellon
and it's a topic that i absolutely love
okay one of my favorite topics so just
stood there for an hour and read two are
the whole thing and finally made sense
in my in my brain final everything
clicked together so I immediately
started jumping up and down like okay
great so how do they make those
beautiful creatures and turns out it
took them 20 min years and they did
pretty much everything manually so my
next questions are okay great so how do
you build those things automatically J
making sense good sell a few maps are
complex creatures so I'm going to start
the simpler and the system I propose is
called metro maps because your input is
a set of document you can think about
them as the result of a query okay
documents about the Greek debt crisis
and the output is the metro map where a
map is a set of lines okay so each line
is a sequence of articles and each line
follows a coherent narrative thread okay
so this one tells you how the Greek
bonds already junk and have the
Commodore 30 points to get a bailout and
you have different lines that focus on
different aspects you might have another
line about their strikes and riots
triggered by the austerity plans and
another line about Germany case you're
supposed to look at it and really get
both the temporal dynamics and structure
so what are the major story
and how they relate to each other okay
good so how'd you come about finding
those maps so anyway finding a map is a
really hard problem because you know
it's very intuitive if I show you a good
map then you know it's a good map but
but why so what I do first of all I
start on this intuitive level so just
what makes a good map for example each
store line is coherent but coherence is
this really fuzzy term so how do for us
it mathematically a jicama is an
objective function you if something
computers can play with and once you
have an objective function you're happy
with you everything interesting i do
tends to be np-hard so how do you
optimize it how'd you come up with an
algorithm with some guarantees can
making sus start intuitive level was our
properties of a good map formalize them
and find a way to optimize the
subjective ok so let's start take a cup
of seconds then just think about it so
what makes a good map well I guess I
gave you the first thing already right
its coherence so each line follow it's a
coherent narrative thread but what does
that mean so likely had an entire paper
where this question in KBB 2010 where
the question was given a chain of
articles how do you measure the
coherence of a chain ok and ask this
question about coherence to a whole
bunch of people and they always come up
with the same answer ok oh it's really
easy question just make sure that you
have strong transitions ok the d1 if you
want to document to a similar document
3324 and you're good to go in the entire
point of this paper with the strong
transitions are not enough this
coheeries is not a property of you know
local interaction between neighboring
articles along the chain let me share
what I me so those bars here means that
the word on the left appear in the
article above it ok so this is an
article about the Greek debt crisis now
suppose you want to build a coherent
chain so first thing you do is you know
you try to find a second article listen
to the first one and you might come up
with this well the Republicans think
about the debt crisis now if you
completely forget about the first
article and you try to find a third line
similar to number two you might come up
with this one where the Pope thinks
about Republicans can it is going to
keep drifting farther and farther away
and you see this staircase behavior it
really means that you get a stream of
consciousness here that each transition
is
wrong but because of a completely
different reason than the other
transitions okay so overall effect is
incoherent ok let's try again same
document Greek debt crisis same second
document what Republican sing about the
debt crisis but this time you know where
you came from and you know the trooper
what guns are not the main point she'll
keep finding since that are on topic
again they consider the overall
behaviors much smoother and I so you
don't see the circus behavior and most
importantly there's a small number for
that can capture the entire story that's
all that's our formula length first
thing we want for a chain to be coherent
is we want each transition will be
strong okay so this means we need to
define a score for transition first
thing we did super simple a transition
between document di and di plus one is
the number of shared words okay just
some over words score one point if it's
shirt super simple singleton was this
was way way to course because first of
all some words are more important than
others and also water kind of noisy
features so you might have an article
about judge and jury but not lawyers is
it really implicitly there I really had
to replace this indicator function with
a softer notion that you call the
influence of where W on the transition
between document di and di plus one can
intuitively this influence is high if
both documents are related and W plays
an important role what makes them
related even if he does not appear in
either of them can i'm not going to go
deep into how we did us but just to give
you the flavor so i made a random as or
a bipartite graph between documents and
words and we looked at random walks
between di and di plus one they were
looked at the same thing when you're not
allowed to go through war w okay and see
how we're double actually affect with
random walks yeah sure how are these
documents why did think of a query okay
you have a query Greek debt crisis yes
speak document oh you mean a the
document of the chain yes so this point
I'm asking about giving an entire chain
how do you measure the coherence that
are going to talk about how to find
actually a good chain okay good okay so
this is the score for single transition
and since yawns often to be strong then
you really want to weakest link to be
strong yeah
you didn't want to go into too many
tales ok but so one side of the
bipartite graph was was work document
document oh so an edge means a day and I
wore it appears in the document and you
can wait by TF IDF and I do you do the
wall ok we should probably talk about
Lisa offline but Eddie is just a random
walk with random research that's
relatively high so it's short walk so
you don't get too far away and then you
look at random walk from you know di
just back and forth through the world's
2d 2d I plus 1 and then you do the same
thing with double or becomes a sink node
so it gets trapped until the next three
start ok i'll talk about it later that
so you want the weakest link to be as
strong as possible this means it's also
the transitions are strong ok good so
now we have it all transitions are
strong but what about I just told it
what there has to be a global theme you
can tell out the stream of consciousness
there need to be a small number for that
capture the entire story right so we
turn this into an optimization power
actually find this small number for that
capture the entire store ok so suppose I
give you a budget you all have to pick
three segments ok and I'm going to
pretend the desert the only worth it
appear in the document and score just
like before but only using those words
so if you pick those three segments
there is nothing between document one
and document to write so your we sing is
zero but if you pick those fee the new
weakest link is much much better guess I
stand up summing over all the words you
some other words that you call active
and the plan becomes just an
optimization over activation patterns
because you will look at that way to
choose those active bored subject to
constraints that are trying to mimic
this behavior of coherent chains ok
breathe in breathe out this is our
notion of coherence and the way you
resolve it was using an LP and around an
algorithm yeah
yes my colonel occupied with it hmm so I
didn't get they were timestamp a whole
big thing no no it's news article they
all have touched them but I've used
please come out of different times you
have a new story that appears later that
describes earlier events yes I was I
keep wondering about it later i'm going
to talk about this for books and movies
and i was wondering if i can do the most
coherent suicide maybe maybe you don't
using the word differently than you are
so as far as I'm concerned if the news
or even if it came out later and talks
about something earlier and still
follows this behavior then people will
still get something from reading it in
order that's silly when the events took
place in the article no no I'm just
using the timestamp it seems to be okay
I was worried about this you know like
in the books where they have flashbacks
but this has to be good enough even if
the articles are not entirely and
according if the timestamps are not
completely matching their time of the
event okay it says that's the assumption
what can argue about it yeah definition
of max activations so it's which word
you want to pick to be active which
segments you pick mr. mayor Mullin hmm
no change it appeared here that are
basically you have a budget of how many
you are allowed to do okay good
superamerica all subsets implements of a
certain size these frustrations
ex-partner was a great debt prize good
run not in English in German in Greek
and maybe turning and how you deal with
these documents now it's not only yeah
and nobody human languages and life
insurance salesman will tell you a last
survivor and you will understand second
to die and save us diplomatists yes so
for her fault you know languages we're
only focusing in english right now
especially exactly because of this now I
was worried about using words you know I
part of the goal of this project was to
see how far you can push really stupid
features k named entities noun phrases
and see if I actually have problems I
need to use more sophisticated and nopee
tools it didn't seem to be a problem
okay not yet good coherence so we have
the first property coherence and at this
point you should be asking me so great
so are we done can I just be the top
three coherent change and college
die so let me show you what happens when
you actually try to do this okay so your
queries Greek debt crisis and those are
the top three coherent chains okay so
there's one about Asian markets and to
about a strikes and riots and so oh
what's wrong Rilla two things are wrong
first of all you know i have a budget of
three lines in asian markets are not
really the most important thing that was
going on right there's so many more
important things like what Germany was
doing and also the bottom two lads are
redundant there's really no reason for
the map to include both of them okay so
the challenge seems to be balancing
coherence who is what I call coverage
okay the map should be about diverse
topics that are imported to the user
okay so what does that mean so let's
formalize it coverage first of all I
keep calling coverage so let's talk
about the element I'm trying to cover
and you can think about them as words
okay so Obama in China so have a
probability that each document covers
each word and this can be based on
tf-idf one more thing that we have is a
weight for each words for how much would
care about covering it and if you don't
know anything this can be based on
frequency now everybody's talking about
Obama he might be important but this is
like a perfect place to plug in
personalization if you do know something
about him like you know they don't care
about politics but they love sports and
what I said in the earlier slide was
that high coverage map should be about
important things and that should be
encouraged diversity diversity just
means a majority right have this
intuitive diminishing returns so let me
show you how this works okay so this is
our corpus decide the forwards
correspond to its frequency and we have
the documents covered words fractionally
if this blows ah commence is lost about
Obama and Washington and these are
important words we get lots of carpet
coverage and then you pick another
document it completely saturate Obama in
New York so this point if you pick
another document about Obama gets better
knowing current or coverage so the
objective should push you to pick
another word that's important and hasn't
been covered yet okay let's formalize
this so each document off the map flips
a coin and with this parable it tries to
cover a word w okay now if all the map
documents try doing this independently
this is the pro bowls that at least one
of them succeeded okay then you take
this this is kind of how much the entire
map covers a short and exam of our words
and you wait them by how much you want
to cover this word
okay so some other words how much do I
care about this word time how much the
math covered it and this is our notion
of coverage okay now i have two things
go here is encouraging how do they play
together now hopefully i convince your
day agent Marcus example this coheres is
not necessarily you know you don't want
the most coherent change in your map
it's more like a constraint a chain is
as a coherent enough for you or it's not
and coverage you the thing that you
really after ok so the parent becomes
fun make coherent map that achieves max
impossible coverage cattleman should
have anyone try to optimize this you get
this map ok same query Greek debt crisis
one-liner birthday strikes one line
about Germany one on about it I ms the
all coherent are important their diverse
what's wrong oh come on you're all
thinking that right it's not the map
it's a set of disconnected lines and
it's especially frustrating when you're
sitting at the bottom list about Germany
and the IMF and it should have been
connected to the red line here's the
last thing I had was connectivity if two
lines are related then I want a map to
reflect us okay good so there are many
many ways to formulas connectivity we
need the user study what people care
about in terms of people they got really
upset when two lines were related but
not connected but I didn't seem to care
much about how they were connected no
one point multiple point beginning n so
started with some really simple
objective try encouraged to encourage
connections gets on two lines intersect
you score point super simple just some
over pairs of lines if they intersect
your score point now later on we went
with more and a complex objective but
this is our first shot sorry okay so you
have stressing down coherence which is
this optimization proud that we solve
with an L paint rounding coverage which
is a similar function and connectivity
there's a super simple thing that just
encouraging intersection okay good so
how do you how do they play together so
hopefully again like before coherency
silicones Frank and now coverage in
connectivity you know ideally I'd like
to optimize both but if I show you a map
super well-connected about something you
couldn't care less about then you
probably still critical less about right
too coverage is really our primary
objective and connectivity doors
k so the problem becomes consider all
coherent maps that achieve maximum
possible coverage and out of those
finally they want its most connected and
this here is lexicographic optimization
so the first term is infinitely more
important than the second okay good let
me just give you a brief overview of how
we optimize the subjective so our input
is a set of documents again you can
think of them as a result of a quirk now
I said a coherence is a constraint or
now ideally I'd like to enumerate all
possible coherent chains it can serve as
metro lines but it's clearly invisible
so I do instead is I encode all coherent
chains in this structure that I call the
coherence graph can the idea that each
node of this graph is a short coherent
chain in an edge mean you can
concatenate them and in remain coherent
and it's a transitive property passing
this graph correspond to longer and
longer coherent chains okay so I really
AM code Oh coherent chains as passing
this graph next thing I want to do is I
want to pick a pass from this graph that
again correspond to coherent chains such
as the underlying documents maximize
coverage okay I want to pick a high
coverage map that's coherent so let's
talk for a second about finding a high
coverage path in this graph if you think
about it apparent is just find me a path
of some length L maximizes a coverage of
underlying articles which is just a case
of the more general proof find a path of
length L maximizing some function of the
nodes visited which is luckily a
well-studied brownish color into account
can many smart people have paid
attention to it before so we use the
algorithms of two current policies our
coverage from case of mode you are weak
uses some more on King algorithm and
it's a very nice precursor greedy
algorithm with approximation guarantees
okay good so just going back so we have
a set of documents to encode them as if
it is a short its path miss graph and
then we'd samajh orienteering in order
to find a set of pass at our high
coverage and coherent last thing we do
we have the local search step that tries
to increase connectivity without
sacrificing coverage okay so let me just
show an example for the result of this
algorithm so we started from this very
simplistic map of the Greek debt crisis
none that's the real thing
one line about how grief struggle to say
float and they need help but is it
enough another line about distraction
right another line about Germany and a
tiny line about the IMF can I just want
is you always staring wrestling well ok
it's a nice picture but is it any good
like how do you even evaluate those
things and evaluating maps is
challenging ok cause you don't have
ground truth we don't have a golden
standard and we can use all those
surrogate methods from you know machine
learning and data mining but I'm going
to argue that for what i do then user
studies are crucial okay first of all
colors I might want to make sure that we
captured us intuitive notion we started
from you know coherence and also to make
sure that what we're building is
actually useful for somebody ok I really
want is not to be youthful so let me
tell about the user study so the
question of the study was well can Maps
health news readers understand news
events better than state-of-the-art yes
we had New York Times articles from 2008
year 2010 and I pics free queries the
miners trapped in Chile the earthquake
in Haiti and the Greek debt crisis can
the question was again can maps help
people understand over three stories
better so first thing we tried was a
really simple just question answering
because who gave people's ten questions
like how many miners were trapped here
we measured how well they answered us
and how long he took it amusing other
maps google news or something called
poppy detection and tracking we had
roughly three hundred and forty users
and we're doing better than competitors
but nothing to write home about okay
nothing major and I was talking to
people and say you know if I wanted to
learn the name of the Greek Prime
Minister I would google it i would go to
Wikipedia this is a complete overkill
and they're absolutely right so I think
what we learned is that maps are not
about this small thing about those
control f type of started to really
about a big picture so we need to design
another study to see if maps help
somebody understand the big picture now
how do you know if somebody understands
a big picture so okay if you thought the
class you should know what I'm talking
about you only understand something if
you can explain to somebody else like
that's what I think so what we did is we
asked people to look at the maps or look
at the google news and write one
paragraph explaining the store to
somebody who has absolutely no idea okay
then we took those progress we put them
on a mechanical turk pairwise evaluation
double blinding as people so which
paragraph does a better job
playing the story so had 16 progress
writers but roughly 300 devaluation
protest there is also much much better
okay for the Greek debt crisis who had
seventy two percent of the people
preferring paragraphs generated by map
users now it didn't look as great for
Haiti we're under sixty percent now is
curious about why and I went looking at
the actual paragraphs and turns out the
IMF had one major store I know you know
their heirs quaking damages and efforts
and a couple of tiny lines about what
was it um wykel's vision running for
presidency or missionaries accused of
kidnapping children something like this
and protect everybody to summarize this
map just focus on the one major
storyline okay so i think that the
bottom line is that maps are the most
useful as high-level summaries first
just as a quick story they don't have a
single dominant storyline yes people
doing the evaluating mm-hmm do they know
anything about the topic beyond got
another person those I mean do they
already know about the topic about the
edges so this is mechanical turek was
like slight quality control you know to
have to know English and to have to have
someone else is it yessir ya mean one
could argue that that's a flaw because I
mean it's just a paragraph that is
appealing and appears to be helpful to a
non-expert yes one can totally argue
dish and I was talking about it a little
bit in the paper but it seems like a
reasonable baseline okay good so I tried
to convince you that maps are good for
news and my goal for the next few slides
easy to tell that maps are not just
about news forget I didn't write a
really really easy to adapt to other
domains because the main principles you
know coverage coherence connectivity
stay just the same but you might be able
to use the manual to come up with a
slightly smarter objectives and I'm
going to talk about three examples of
science legal documents and books so
that's always science so the Gulf least
project was to see if max can help
somebody understand the state of the art
of some field for example a word
reinforcement learning been asked you
and the data we had was a cm papers we
needed to do some slight modifications
to the objective mostly not taking
advantage of it citation graph but other
than this algorithm said exactly the
thing just so let me just show you an
example so this is an about
reinforcement learning I don't think she
expect you to British I'm
walk you through it so there is one line
about the multi-agent setting one line
about MVP MVP one line about controlling
robotic arms 19 about bandits and
expression exportation and a line about
bouncing theory but you see that those
are actually disconnected but there's
those funny dashed grey lines between
them that's because in the scientific
domain you might have you know I line
about Syrian a line about applications
and there's really not a single article
looking fitting both right there is no
direct intersection but those lines are
clear related it's also citation going
on between them so in the scientific the
way we allowed for indirect connectivity
okay so if two lines have lots of impact
going on between them then we count this
as well so this letter says see stuff
like you know how the fury liner had
impact on the Bandit line or how their
MVP MVP line head and impact both in
their robotic arms and on the
multi-agent line okay let me tell what
do you this delicately or the fun one
actually so the question was keen maps
help somebody a first a grad student
understand the state of the art gay of
some feel better than can sing so what
we did we brought people in my office
and we told them pretend to be a first a
grad student who's kind of embarking on
a reinforcement learning proach and you
know you go to the professor you're all
excited you want him to teach you
everything he knows about reinforcement
learning and professor gives you a
survey paper Alec Brown his paper was
written in 1996 okay so the goal is
really to update this survey paper to
find the more recent research directions
and relevant papers and they could use
at the google scholar or Maps and Google
Scholar okay so had 30 participants we
basically combined all papers into one
long list and we had an expert judging
precision case which papers are relevant
and subtopic recall so we compose the
list of the top 10 sub areas of
reinforcement learning in the last
year's and we wanted to see how many of
those areas they managed to find that's
just in a nutshell and the result on
average the map users had ten percent
more of their papers deemed relevant and
also two of those top ten they managed
to find on average almost three more
just at this point we were very happy
one more thing I want to do in order to
convince you that matter a good idea for
science which he made a map of our own
related to work at some point okay so
this is Oscar Moreno connecting the dots
to metro apps and again I don't want you
to read it just to see
spin around us so a lot of for
consumerization especially news lots of
work on narrative some work on Mac and
coverage notions this pink line about
visualization like concept map in mind
maps and this red line about mapping
science good sir thing we did legal
document okay so there is a company in
palo alto that came knocking at our door
one day they do a search engine for
lawyers and they wanted to know if maps
can help lawyer argue a case so they
gave us Supreme Court decisions I know
have you seen Supreme Court decision
before you might have no so they fell
out that they're insanely long okay they
can be hundreds of pages so my tf-idf
was completely not signing signaling
those so we turned out that was working
that when you cite in our case you have
to say why you're citing them okay so
you know in blood versus blood I
defended Commerce Clause applied here so
if we just use this anchor text so kind
of pinpoint us to the most interesting
parts of the document their everything
else fall just beautifully into place I
can't you an example this one map were
computed for them for commerce clause
you can see for example this purplish
lying about who can waste a community
and if you work for a state-owned
company can you sue them okay great how
about in federal court and okay great
does this section apply or not so we
better you show this map to the lawyers
to get a reality check and they first of
all said it you know it made perfect
sense they were nice enough to label
each line for us and then we went ahead
and computing the words that made its
line coherent from our point of view as
you can see for example the third one
the lawyer said the Eleventh Amendment
state of Randy we said immunity serenity
Amendment Elevens or the last line
regulating wholesale energy cell and we
said wholesale electricity resolve steam
utilities guess what I've been happy
about us who are probably integrating it
into the search engine out okay last
thing I did they saw just for the fun of
it I wanted to see if max can help
somebody understand the structure of a
complex book and when I say complex book
I actually mean Lord of the Rings okay
mostly because you know I refused to
read a song of ice and fire until I
actually finishes writing it so we had a
lot of rings and they're my biggest
fellows coherence okay okay think about
it journalists are really nice because
they actually tell you what happened
before okay
but books are really work this way they
don't say okay now that we're done with
the bethel at helm and this guy is dad
we can go in and do that they just you
know go on and do that so co here is
completely breaking so what we decide to
do or say well hopefully a single
character point of view is a coherent
narrative thread okay so focus a lot
more named entities and I would just
show you a detail from the lord of the
rings map so i said that hobbiton gonna
start working on our merry way they
collect people all the way to the
council and the next plate up missy
peeping and mary going somewhere some in
further going that way they meet gone
the bad guys are down there and they're
going to eventually meet the good guys
so there's lots of structure already
emerging okay whatever thing i want to
tell her but what we did recently to
make maps even more useful so first
thing I was worried about with
scalability okay I really want to do him
the web scale corpus so basically
remnant our objective you know
everything I used to say was
embarrassingly parallel actually made in
versus are made parallel and we came up
with a hierarchical i clustered version
of metro messaged h metro stop is not
just a single article anymore we brought
it down from 11 minutes 17 thousand
articles to 30 seconds per query on
hundreds of thousands of articles second
thing I was worried about was
interaction again I really think it's
going to make or break metro map because
i'm not going to nail the right map
based on a cup of keywords so but on the
plus side I mean wrapped up with so many
awesome interaction mechanisms right so
we try to sing one day they call
multiresolution we can zoom in to learn
more or zoom out to get a high-level
overview where the most interesting
technical bit work we had to come up
with a community detection algorithm
this makes this really non standard
assumption of dense overlaps kids we had
a metric stories they should
algorithm with some block coordinate and
gradient descent second thing we did was
word feedback so remember in the
coverage side I told this is a perfect
place to plug in personalization lose
weight so we actually had the mechanism
that lets people say stuff like okay I
don't actually care much about what
Germany was doing but all Portugal is
interesting and the map would recompute
based on whatever I think is important
to them now with ideas from umass okay
from Andrew McCollum's good something
called feature-based feedback last thing
I think the did the semester and this is
a really fun project with a student you
think about controversial
topics case it's what you look for
something like Obamacare so there's
really not one MapReduce really more on
Democrats versus Republicans so we look
for how to format this notion of
controversy using polarizing sentiments
and how do kind of class your documents
based on their sentiment and compute two
different maps represent need two
different point of view one of my thing
that's been going on we have the website
very final stage of GUI debugging and I
have a student whose entire mission for
the quarter is to come up with an open
source package so people can plug in
their data and see what comes out yeah
so this is very real real exciting
semester now okay so much rooms the
entire point of this project was to take
a news reader or first-year student or
paralegal or really anybody that have
lots of data and used to rely on search
we want to show them a perspective of
the field okay we're going to show them
the structure and housings connect to
each other we talked about how to former
I this you know here's coverage
connectivity we had an algorithm when we
have used a study to validate the or
idea now at this point I was kind of
staring it isn't trying to sing or to do
next so what don't i like about metro
maps and the thing i dislike the most
maps will only show you connections that
are explicitly made by somebody great
journals told you that those two things
are related but we'll see if you want to
make new connections ok what if you want
to discover something new so this is how
they have project came to life where the
goals you have lots of data how do you
find something insightful in it or
really how do you define this fuzzy
notion of an inside here's a just a word
of caution this is work in progress it's
a lot less mature in metro apps but i
have been having so much fun with it out
I thought I'd teller them okay so the
goal is to define inside now there's
been lots lots lots of related work
about us right there's you know
psychology cognitive psychology door
data mining and you can argue that and
our kiddies about taking data in getting
inside same thing for us of the info
breeze conferences and I was basically
going through a lot of papers and trying
to abstract those ideas okay so what
makes an inside ok so just like before
what makes it inside your first thing is
almost trivial right it has to be
surprising if you nobody then nobody
cares but surprise alone is not enough
because if you know she give me enough
data I find plenty of things that will
surprise you just because they're noise
or bias or
incidence so it has to be what they call
plausible really well supported by the
data j and this is a super general idea
so let me just show you show you how
this plays out in the medical domain
Jenna the medical away is perfect for me
because you know there's lots I'm a lot
of data just lying around and every day
you see those articles about researchers
found a link between blah blah so
there's a potential for many many new
links to be discovered because we want
to use this idea to build a system
there's will kind of take researches and
give them some promising research
directions okay so identify where the
gaps in our current knowledge okay so i
said plausible and surprising how does
that work first of all for the purpose
of this presentation i'm only going to
restrict myself to a really simple kind
of insight it's a pair of medical terms
okay like there's a connection between
sleep apnea and diabetes that I think is
insightful because just pair of medical
care now for something to be plausible I
need this to actually coker a lot in
practice okay so many sleep apnea
patients actually do get their business
and in order for this will be surprising
you go to the literature and nobody ever
thought about it nobody ever notice it
before guys who look for pair of things
that coker a lot in practice but nobody
in the literature seems to know about
okay so what's kind of dated you need in
order to computer things so for
plausibility we had 70 degrees of
hospital notes okay natural language
just know to have about 10 million of
them and for surprise we have 11 million
papers from medline now this is an
overview of the system and if you lost
me by the way this is a good place to
kick up so we have a system it start
from a quarry now it doesn't actually
have to start from a quarry but you know
research is usually have something they
care deeply about so let's talk from
court in this case sleep apnea so are
the system does first of all it goes to
the medical note and looks for plausible
candidates okay so what happens to sleep
apnea patients in practice the new
titles candidate and you rank them
according to midline so what's
surprising okay so sleep apnea what
happens in practice and what does the
literature not know about now for this
to work I need to tell you three things
the where are the terms coming from
what's plausibility and what's your
price okay terms we extracted medical
terms from the notes and from medline
and first of all this was a lot more
annoying than I expected kk no its
natural language so free
she's my tell you sleep apnea cute sleep
apnea care sleep apnea and this was
completely messing up my counts case I
need to know when I can merge something
and when I can't if you decide to use
medical hierarchies okay so we have this
kind of thing this is no matter i think
you have stuff like my grandest orders
that has two children cover migraine and
not so common migraine and you really
want to know when you see something
where you can merge it up or not guess
what we decided to do was use KL
divergence so compare how much
information is lost when you use a
parent in order to approximate your
child and you can see for example is if
you seek on migrant you can propagate it
all the way to migrant disorders maybe
in vascular headaches depends on your
threshold but if you see this other type
of my kind no it's a completely
different beast okay now surprise we're
not to sing surprising well first of all
they can't coker together too often
right so have a threshold so the number
of papers mentioning them can't be over
k but it's still not good enough because
there might be two terms it just don't
appear because nobody cares about them
right because you know five people in
the universe combined have them so it's
more surprising if those terms are
popular okay FM now nobody knows it's a
connection between sleep apnea and
diabetes that are really well researched
so we have just like before we have wait
so the importance of a term and the way
I like thinking about this is it has
novelty and it has utility okay so this
is surprise now plausibility no way
works exactly the other way around right
226 root chakra together in practice a
lot so tweeted with we aggregated all
the nodes that a single patient received
in a year hit the tower basic document
and first thing we did was just computer
real simple jacquard coefficient so how
many patients have both those things
over how many patients have at least one
and let me just show you what happens
when you try to plug those two
objectives into our system get your
stuff and dementia those are the top
signal and think at sex jacquard
coefficients thing that happened with
dementia so the first three are
Alzheimer into medications used to treat
dementia so they're going to be filtered
away by medline but then you left with
hip fractures of your fibrillation and
realtors and this point you should get
real overly suspicious and say well hip
fractures wheelchairs and we might have
a problem here because it might not be
about dementia might just be this
popular
intends to be old so we needed vertical
explanatory power again I'm trying not
to say the word causality but you can
think about it this way if it helps you
the idea was we took a group of people
that are really really similar to
dementia patient but don't have dementia
can we use propensity score matching to
compute this group and then we say well
hip fractures are they a lot more common
for dementia patient for this other
group to just really seem of it doesn't
happen to have dementia and if it's not
then you're not capturing the right
thing here okay it's not about the
message about them being old or
something else so plausibility is about
having high jacquard and also about
passing this matching test okay so let
me just share what happens if start from
dementia now wheelchairs and hip
fractures don't even pass the test and
the other thing you love for easy a
tribulation and they sponsor okay so
what do you do with it is it an insight
again how do you evaluate I know ideally
I would make just a series of bold
predictions and send an armed your
physician to chase them down but this
requires you know time and money and
physicians and I don't quite seem to
have either of those things so instead
what we did with Earl discovery if you
ask physician to give us a list of then
breakthroughs of the last five years and
then we time traveled on the data and
say well if you had run this algorithm
five years ago what could I have told
you and specifically what would show up
in the top three results of my search
engine that isn't if you can predict
anything it's you're really strong
indication you have something now I said
it was real or eliminate their only gave
us forcings a an obesity in colon cancer
diabetes type 2 and sleep apnea after
your fibrillation and dementia and
increasing and bhakri olives but out of
those four we actually managed to figure
to the finishes are much more happy and
they're a lot more willing to cooperate
with you right now and it comes to give
me a much longer list okay now but I
started by saying this is a really
general idea so I want to show you how
the exact algorithm exact formulation
works in completely different domain can
this is the courage to make the idea is
to get a search engine diving card you
serendipity okay here's the way to sing
about it suppose I want to buy a laundry
hamper today I don't actually want a
laundry hamper and it applies to extort
laundry so what the same idea of an
algorithm does is fine products that are
plausible
in the sense that they solve a similar
problem and they're surprising in the
sense of whether you go to Amazon your
people who've you deceive you this that
nobody in the right mind who is looking
for a hamper would consider this other
product is an alternative because I have
a search engine that says you know you
don't need a laundry hamper how about
you buy a really big trash can I thought
I was telling with your friend of fun
and he said the t use is a trash can for
a hamper and I was so happy but anyway
my entire point here is Estella that the
algorithm is just the same just instead
of medical 0 to use concept neck in
order to learn common sense fact water
sings use for and instead of medline we
use Amazon people who viewed as you view
this graph and everything else is just
the same now I thought if I already tell
you but I can give you some shopping
tips from you know playing with my
algorithm just in case you want to buy
something so here are some things I
learned first of all it is in this
country pet product and baby products
are surprisingly interchangeable okay
just keeps showing up it's scary also
you might want to look up at the car
department every now and then okay so
here I was working for am you know the
senior put in a bathtub in order not to
sleep and cars really have the same
thing and also battery died system said
forget the idea of images by stickers
that people put under circus again in
order not not to slip and fall which
made perfect sense to me okay that have
project the point was that medical
researchers I really wanted to give them
a tool that will let them discover some
promising new ideas and your formal out
the surprising possibility we have this
early discover of some medical
breakthroughs and I didn't quite talk
about your so many applications in other
domain okay so we like the way this
product search but it's also something
called medical effort literature by
discovery there's also we did this to
Wikipedia lots and lots of places where
this could work out okay this seems like
a good place for you take a step back
and try to and say what we had here so i
talked about to project the metro apps
and they have project but what's a
common thread was then you know
underlying common same so i guess the
obvious answer is you know decide you
have turned lots of data into inside but
it is really more okay so the first i
like the most are the ones to start with
this really intuitive problem definition
okay so we know what's a coherent story
line or an what's an insight and a new
formula which mathematically optimize it
and then tie it back to user study okay
both to make sure that you captured
right
and to make sure the two system is
actually useful for anybody I really
want to build those things to be useful
now in order for this to work i
basically borrow ideas from you take the
money in machine learning information
retrieval lots of algorithms especially
optimization and graph algorithm and
some HCI in visualization okay this is
what comes in what goes out is I try to
apply this in as many domains as I can
and today I talked about medicine and
science and news and legal documents and
commerce and literature okay good so
this is what I do let's talk about what
I want and do next so first of all I on
the inside project again it's super fun
living it and be really excited about he
said you're building a set of tool that
will allow anyone okay so scientists
analyzed really anyone just plug in
their data and see what the most
insightful swing that comes out and
really to enable some new discoveries
and again I want to stress out this
importance of finding a technique that
generalize across domains I really think
it makes a technic much stronger okay so
I talked about South applications
already tried and I'm a brief hotel
about the collaboration that I've been
mostly excited about recently so first
of all I gave this talk of the Stanford
computational social science conference
and there's been all those social
scientists in political scientist just
came to me afterwards carrying awesome
awesome buckets of data k filters
Congress notes and crime they kind lots
of real beautiful datasets life sciences
I really wanted to apply this to biology
I don't actually know how so if you know
anybody who might be interested you know
where to find me and he stood okay
there's a history professor who really
wanted to apply this idea of metrics two
telegrams okay personal data something
I've been dying to do for a really long
time case of search browsing history
because it's about you're trying to plan
a trip and you find yourself an hour
later with 75 tabs open in firefox and
wait what just happened but really I way
to kind of organize your browsing
history into a you know some structure
I'll go Adele there's been some interest
from corporations about or incorporate
data financial data this idea of insight
for Investigative Journalism and the
nothing on this list actually really
surprised me yeah I never saw this will
work for anything that's not text based
but recently some you know researchers
at UT Austin applied my algorithm to
summarize a video is a sequence of
images ya know it just do it so anyway
so
apparently this thing also works for
images again really surprised me okay so
this was lying short term long term I
like I said I really like this idea of
taking fuzzy things and formalizing them
and out of those my favorite by far is
the thing here in yellow is creativity
and I just I know it sounds kind of
mugello manic so let me just tell them
briefly about one thing I started doing
this semester about it okay so just two
slides so the goal is you own a company
you own a product okay you have the
technology and you want to change your
product in order to expand your business
so what you do and we follow this thing
called ask m / model that's basically a
set of question you should be asking
yourself right you know what can you
combine your product with how can you
put it to another use how can you
reverse some functionality my favorite
example this company that used to make
water pressure showerheads and now
they're making water pressure and dental
floss which is just sort of completely
brilliant anyway my point is I built the
prototype system using the same ideas of
concept net in order to answer those
questions in Amazon to filled out the
obvious things now I have a search
engine where you typing something like
alarm clock and it just spits out
suggestions i can combine it with a
coffee machine so now you wake up to a
fresh cup of coffee or combine it with
the DeMars the room kind of becomes
lighter and lighter as you wake up or
maybe make a silent alarm clock
something that vibrate know either for
deaf people or if you don't wake
somebody else up and I just keep
spitting and spitting suggestion do you
know SkyMall the thing you get at
airplanes so I think I'm roughly at
their level right now but hopefully it's
go better and get better soon okay good
so breathe in breathe out the point of
this talk was we have plenty of data and
this is excellent because data can help
us understand the universe and make
better decisions but it's not enough to
collect this data or to even search
service that I really really have to
make sense of this data okay we have to
reveal the structure like in metro apps
and we have to eventually discover
unknown connections like that hot
project can we head of user studies and
we have Aroldis coverage validate our
ideas and if there's one thing I want
you to take from the stock it fell this
image right here
okay we really have to go beyond you
searching our data that's about it
thanks any questions cyber question
because you were saying that the people
who looked at the Metro mountains didn't
care so much about the relations that
might hold between the nodes on the map
is that because you are drawing the map
and a document level it might actually
be i'm not entirely sure why they're
doing this but it was pretty clear from
the data you know we showed him two
things that were related and they could
intersect the beginner at the end they
did say that something was ugly if they
just kept like bouncing on and off but
other than that they didn't seem to care
much and I'm not sure why I actually do
medical discoveries it Oh probably will
be more yes important then I completely
agree thinking in and I wonder if you
move this to the sub document level so I
really want to know the few maps like I
did at the beginning they have a node as
an argument and I just don't know how to
get this like how to abstract but hey
we're going to have a meeting and talk
about it right fine how did it work Ne
people are watching it online do they
have any way of asking questions you can
run downstairs again great hold the bus
really bursting through the door so we
were measuring the number of action
working you hard how did you send the
threshold giving them the more words you
have the less effectively becomes yes
the more words I have I can actually go
back to the staircase behavior at
cribbage transition is going to have its
own budget yes are you sure also just
tried it on a couple of stories that
we're not useful user studies and we
just manually tweak this again
eventually I would love to learn this
but it was just tweaking parameters
experimenting with what you did was
selected threshold and then treat all
these words equaling just summed over
the number over the last warning so
something for every active or we found
over the influence of discordant
transition so it's not just says you're
worth it but then you you copy after
like 30 5 which was learned yeah hmm
supposed to just uh yeah I wouldn't let
him die yay we also I mean it's in help
you working just not rounding it would
still work
if we have a lot of faith how can we use
your project and like Olivia I would say
email my student in banking but I should
probably email me so I'll buy games yes
but he was supposed to finish it like a
couple of weeks ago you know it's it's
probably going to take me a couple more
but it's almost ready now kids what were
they didn't you have oh actually I think
we have a lot of data we're just trying
to find a way and using the data binding
inside right now we're still at the home
of make a lattice the pits yeah we wanna
move forward and this is very nice bring
it on I like to track it yes right where
did have you published they work on the
medical discovery so you're a wants it
to be in nature paper which which has
been taking me longer than any other
paper everything in my life if you and I
can send your draft but um so which
hospital were you collaborating with
that you can get the peanuts telephone
I'm prettier to Stanford Hospital it's a
Stanford Medical Group it saturday so de
palo alto hospital i'm using data
usually no I mean like I've worked with
data sets with you know most 500
patients and that takes like two years
to get access to so that's an amazing
pattinson conferred medical team has
been awesome about it okay let's thank
the seizure again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
