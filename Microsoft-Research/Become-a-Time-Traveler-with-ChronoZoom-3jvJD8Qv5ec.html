best researchers together to collaborate
bringing in science information
humanistic information under one canvas
and bringing history to life Khurana
zoom is a way of visualizing everything
that's ever happened in the past on our
planet how does it make learning fun
because it's visual you can dive through
time you can look at pictures you can
listen to videos you can examine
articles that it's very visual
experience I believe the chromosome
project will be very interesting and
educating for not only for historian and
humanitarians but for all people who are
interested in what's going on in our
world
professor Alvarez and I started across
him on the chalkboard there's the idea
we had after class talking about the
different time scales in big history how
do you convey those scales of time from
human history all the way back to cosmic
history and I tried various kinds of
drawings not I'd drawn it in linear
scales and I'd drawn it into logarithmic
scales and I'd tried this way and that
way so after class one of the students
came up and that was rollin say cow and
he said professor I think we could show
those time scales by using computer zoom
technology the Walter Knight developed
the idea for Chroniton at the time it
was just a little idea we had drawing on
a chalk board it's become this amazing
tool that you can now use in any web
browser to see the past with Chroniton
you can browse history instead of
digging it out piece by piece so what's
really amazing about Crona zoom is that
it's built by the academic community at
Berkeley there's about 8 of us who are
all working to to create all of the
sample content for the beta release
marks off research brought Moscow State
University to help undo the coding the
development behind the scenes so this
has really been an international efforts
it was a challenge for us to create such
applications as chromosome which will be
used by million people around the world
we got a lot of new experience working
with Microsoft Redman team and with
Berkeley team I've never been to Moscow
before but it's great to go online and
collaborate with them in real time
usually occurs at like 2:00 a.m. because
we have to deal with the time difference
what really excites me is them learning
a brand new tool that they haven't
learned in the classroom and to get them
excited about what computer science can
really do and how it can help teaching
and learning how you can change the
world with technology
will definitely have big future
collaboration is just the absolute heart
is the secret weapon of make
kazoom happened here at berkeley we have
all kinds of ideas but we wouldn't know
how to make them become reality the
people at Microsoft Research know how to
do that they're really good at making
something happen we know that these
students in these universities are going
to keep growing it and making it a
better tool none of us could do it
without the others and that's one of the
really rewarding things about making
crona's in down the road we hope Kronos
in really grows the amount of content
has inside of it we've set the framework
but of course its greatest use will be
when we have lots of data so that people
who make comparisons so that people can
see trends and patterns their history so
it's gonna be really exciting for
students teachers and researchers and
that's we're looking forward to in the
future so what's great about Kronos ooh
is that it's built on Azure and in the
cloud so they don't need to worry about
being able to maintain it worried about
too many people hitting it or when it
gets terabytes and terabytes of data in
it the students and the computer science
departments who work on Kron ISM can
focus on making an amazing tool while we
take care of everything in the backend
there are sometimes special moments when
we're showing Kron ISM to people for the
first time and we make a great sweep of
time maybe we start with just a picture
of something in the present day and then
you zoom all the way out from one day to
all of time back to the Big Bang and
sometimes you'll hear this gasp of
breath ISM and that's a very rewarding
thing to to see to to realize that
somebody is understanding something they
never understood before and maybe that's
the power of chromosome
