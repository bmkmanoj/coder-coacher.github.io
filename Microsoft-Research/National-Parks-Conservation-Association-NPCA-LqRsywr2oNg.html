lectures freely available
you
all over the place hi I'm Patricia
Donelan and I'm a Microsoft employee who
really cares about The Giving Campaign
this is my absolute favorite time of the
year the month where we get to relax her
policies and have our favorite
nonprofits come on board and drive the
awareness across our campaign for those
of you that are new to Microsoft or need
a gentle reminder we have some changes
to the policy I want to highlight for
you this year they have announced that
one there's no minimum for matching that
means hours and monetary matching so
previously you had to donate at least
four hours of your time at a non-profit
and a block in order to have that
matched and so now there's no minimum so
you could spend an hour sorting things
that the goodwill had that match to $25
per hour which is amazing and there's
also no minimum previously we for
overhead costs we had the minimum
donation needed to be $25 and now it's
pretty much a dollar so if you give ten
dollars to a bake sale that's going to
be matched and it also is matched with
your name so as we're driving for
significant participation this year neyo
participation those that are new to
Microsoft those those new employees also
benefit from having fifty dollars
sitting out there at the gift site for
them so if they go to whack whack gift
they will see at the top I think it's in
read a banner that has fifty dollars so
they can go and choose to spend
Microsoft's 50 bucks that they put in
their account find their favorite
nonprofit donate that fifty dollars if
they choose to they can donate another
$25 Microsoft matches that $25 so 50 25
25 your nonprofit just got 100 bucks 45
minutes of your time and that's for any
employees and I believe that it sits out
there in the give tool for 18 months two
years or so right so when you're
overwhelmed noodle Microsoft drinking
from the firehose just put that in your
back pocket in six months later when you
coming up for air I find whatever drives
your passion for the community so today
I'm standing before you because our
beloved Monica Rosenberg had an urgent
issue that took her out of the Seattle
area this week so I'm just standing in
for Monica although she's really the
person behind this event
day and cares so deeply about the
national parks conservation agency so in
a moment I'm in handed over to our two
speakers we have Shannon Brundle who's
been with the National Parks
Conservation Association for about three
years she's the connective tissue over
there she understands what it means to
bring the volunteers together so if
you've got interests in volunteering in
this area I highly recommend reaching
out to Shannon who I'm sure will share
her contact information with you shortly
and then we also have one of my good
friends I'm really glad to see you here
today Paul Bali who's been he will be
celebrating one year with the national
parks in December but he's got 15 years
of conservation nonprofit work under his
belt and before that of course he was
one of us he was in Microsoft if we were
about ten years so we're excited to have
these two here today to talk about the
National Parks Conservation um for those
of you in the room I have a couple
questions for you if you can answer them
I've got some really great swag I'm
going to throw at you Oh got right hook
and for anyone who's just joining in the
room there's a pizza great Pagliacci in
the back feel free to help yourself um
raise your hand or nod if you know the
employee matching limit so that would be
what you donate in merchandise it's
matched from microsoft store so either
merchandise or time at $25 an hour or
cash donations what's the maximum
matching from Microsoft per year
the cat when it caps out from all the
money that you donate what does it cap
out for matching oh ok guys we got well
yes ok so are you ready oh ok oh yeah
employee down I think that what I think
there was a ball that a strike my cue
swag from the gift campaign this year is
amazing lip balm I've got more up here
so please please see me after we can
takes them I've got some kind bars some
extra stickers and stuff so uh we've got
40 minutes left in this I'm going to
initiate for those online i'm going to
initiate the live question tag so if
you've got a question and the streaming
please type it in and we'll get your
answer will get your answer for any
questions that you have so we'll start
with Shannon senior administrative and
outreach coordinator and then we'll
follow up with Paul the regional do it
regional development director we're
gonna do the yeah I'm swap actually I
minister we do this right on you right
now you wants to go back to his pizza so
Paul thanks for being here today come on
up and give us chat Thank You Patricia
and we really appreciate you standing in
for Monica we miss you Monica but this
is being recorded so everyone will have
a chance to view this again yeah so I've
been with npca for about a year now just
just shy right now and it's a great
organization we do some really cool
things and hopefully we can tell you a
little bit about that today so you know
this slide actually was created by a
regional director rob smith and I I kind
of chuckled when I first thought saw it
but then I thought you know it's really
true we kind of live in eco topia right
here you know we've got hundreds of
miles of premier hiking trails you know
within an hour of our doorstep perhaps
even less than that we have you know
biking opportunities we have fishing and
boating and we have pods of orcas that
sometimes can be seen from Seattle
they're the closest wolf pack is about
an hour and a half from here hour and 15
minutes from here so this is a pretty
amazing place to be living here in
Washington State
and on top of that we have some of our
premier national parks here as well so
we have Mount Rainier National Park
we've got Olympic National Park north
cascades some really amazing places that
have been protected but our mission here
at National Parks Conservation
Association is that we're all about
protecting our parks in fact our mission
specifically is to protect and enhance
America's national parks for this and
future generations so we're not only
concerned about protecting it for us
we're also concerned about leaving a
legacy for future generations as well
Stephen Mather is was one of our primary
founders of npca back in nineteen 19 and
in fact Stephen was the first director
of the National Park Service back in
nineteen sixteen when that organization
was formed in the government and stephen
realized that the park's really needed
kind of an outside advocacy organization
that was going to be interested in
protecting them for their best interests
and for our best interests and so he and
the gentleman to his left there Robert
Sterling yard who which Robert was his
hapa Blissett e chief there at National
Park Service they got together with a
couple other folks and they created what
was then the National Parks Association
back in nineteen nineteen but I think he
really had a lot of vision because even
today there are many threats to our
national parks and you kind of think
about it and go well they're national
parks right they're protected they are
but there are many threats to them
including for instance underfunding
there's about an eleven billion dollar
backlog of maintenance projects that
have not been funded for our national
parks across the country and Congress is
doing a very good job of continuing to
ignore that there are threats from air
pollution climate change and there are
threats of development as well here's
another case we go Wow their national
parks right they're protected but there
is oil and gas drilling and my
going on right up sometimes right up to
the borders of some of our national
parks in the West and there have
actually been bills that have been
proposed on some sides of the house
where it's being proposed hey why don't
we start drilling and and mining within
our national parks so there are a lot of
threats and Steven I think was really a
visionary and trying to to make sure
that we we do the right thing and we
protect these places so here in the
northwest in fact i was going to briefly
tell you about a little bit more about
who we are i told you about our mission
but we are about a hundred forty person
organization roughly about twenty four
different regional offices around the
country we have a DC headquarters and we
are a non-profit we're not part of the
government so you know we are definitely
a 401 C 3 501 c 3 i'm thinking about my
401 k there for a second how did that
happen but anyway here in the northwest
we have an office here in seattle
there's four staff including myself and
shannon rob smith and who's our regional
director and Graham Taylor who's our
program manager and we are specifically
focused on Washington and Oregon and as
you can see there are 14 different park
units in Washington including some of
the places that we know and love ranier
Mount Rainier National Park Olympic
National Park north cascades also some
places that we don't know as much about
or you may not be as much aware of that
are part of the park system the National
Park System and that includes the
Bainbridge Island exclusion exclusion
Memorial which really recognizes and
pays tribute to the japanese-americans
who were actually put in internment
camps during World War two the Manhattan
Project which is a new national park
which was just announced last December
and that's going to be set up in in the
Hanford area there to educate people
about you know the whole the whole you
know nuclear age and are entering into
the nuclear age and talking about the
development of those weapons back at
that time kind of taking kind of a
you know a non-partisan approach to it
and kind of educating people about what
happened there and then in Oregon we
focus on six different Park units
including crater lake national park and
a few others now today what we want to
do is I'm going to focus particularly on
one national park and then Shannon is
going to talk about a couple of others
and specifically I want to talk about
North Cascades National Park north
cascades as you'll find out in a few
minutes is one of the least visited
parks in the state if not in the country
and is one of the most beautiful and
rugged places as well and the Park
Service has proposed that this might be
a prime habitat prime ecosystem to bring
back the grizzly bear and we'll talk
more about that and our involvement in
that particular project so first off I'm
going to give you a little bit of an
overview here of of the North Cascades
ecosystem so if you look at it around in
this huge you know red dotted line is
the North Cascades ecosystem it includes
North Cascades National Park it includes
Lake Chelan National rec area it
includes a number of wildernesses
glacier peak and pass aten for instance
comprises about six million acres and
this is a very rugged mountainous
beautiful place and it's the area that
the Park Service thinks would make the
most sense to try to restore the grizzly
bear population so what I want to do is
talk a little bit about that and you
know why we think that makes sense so
first off North Cascades National Park
which is part of that North Cascades
ecosystem is a place that is becoming
more and more referred to as the wild
nearby it's one of those beautiful
rugged places that in an hour and a half
you could be on an amazing trail and
what's interesting too is that the
visitor ship is actually pretty pretty
low for such a beautiful gorgeous place
only in 2014 there were only 24,000
visitors to the park and they
we're talking about 24,000 recreational
visitors so people go there to hike or
camp and enjoy the park now compare that
for instance to ross lake national wreck
which is right next door 725,000
recreational visitors every year and
that was actually a 2013 number but you
can see the dichotomy between the amount
of visitor ship that you see between
those two areas is is really vast North
Cascades National Park has the most
glaciers in the lower 48 a lot of people
don't know that roughly 300 glaciers and
of course some of them are melting more
rapidly because of climate change these
days and it has some of the most rugged
mountains in the lower 48 as well so
let's kind of take a look at this as
grizzly bear habitat let's let's talk
about that a little bit first I should
start off by saying that the grizzly
bear does exist in the North Cascades
but their numbers are incredibly
diminished you know they have gone from
a population of say a thousand bears
maybe a hundred years ago in Washington
State and there may be 20 in the North
Cascades if we're lucky there's another
30 or so bears located in the Selkirk
mountains in the north east of
washington but we're talking
specifically about the North Cascades
here so that 20 roughly bears probably
less and the Park Service really wants
to see that population you know brought
back but this is actually a picture of
one of our bears in neighboring British
Columbia and this guy was captured on
film back in 2010 and on a remote camera
at Manning provincial park so we know
they're there you know it's an easy it
would be an easy you know 10 15 mile
walk for a for a grizzly bear to walk
into the North Cascades we have just had
a very difficult time trying to detect
how many there really are so we know
that the numbers are pretty darn small
the invisible wire system yeah well the
good thing is courses grizzly bears
don't need passports to go back and
forth across the international line but
but yeah you know there's a few bears
that are making their way back and forth
across across the international border
so in 2010 you know we've been there
been a number of studies done trying to
locate bears trying to get a better
sense of how many bears there really are
in the North Cascades and we just don't
really know and that's why we say 20 or
less but in 2010 a hiker up at cascades
pass in north cascades took these
pictures of a bear and if you looked at
these pictures what would you think
looks like a grizzly bear doesn't it
look at the big hump the very
distinctive hump that you usually see on
a grizzly bear and it's a big bear it's
a big animal so you know 12 of 13
experts agreed you know what I think
this is you know at least the first
photographic evidence in years that we
may actually you know have some grizzly
bears out there and then if you look a
few weeks later another hiker was up
there in cascades pass and in fact took
this picture of this black bear very big
black bear obviously he's been working
out he's got a big hump on his back so
the question is was this bear on the top
a grizzly bear or not we don't know we
don't know for sure but it again it kind
of harkens back to the fact you know
there are so few grizzly bears that you
know we get very excited when we think
we may have seen one question I know how
to repeat its they hear it oh okay is
there it is it a part of the
conservation or a different organization
when they know Affairs to potentially
trap and tag them and put any radio
frequencies on them so we can better
track and understand the population
growth or division yeah we're not doing
that so much with grizzly bears they're
doing that a lot with black bears you
know kind of tagging colouring etc if we
could find a grizzly bear to the point
where we could you know
trap it and tag it and cholera we would
but you know it's been so difficult to
try to find them so yeah that's done
with black bears quite a bit in fact
that kind of leads up to the next slide
here so some of you may be asking okay
so grizzly bears come back to the North
Cascades what's my risk of being you
know attacked or killed by a grizzly
bear well I'm here to kind of help set
the record straight a little bit first
all first of all in North America
they're about 600,000 black bears all
across North America we have about
25,000 to 30,000 black bears that are
actually here in Washington State
grizzly bears in all of North America
not that many about 60,000 and you know
as I just talked about we may have 20 or
less in the North Cascades we may have
about 30 in the Selkirk's so looking at
numbers here in the 1990s 29 people were
killed by bears and it's kind of
interesting when you see how it kind of
breaks out 18 people are killed by
grizzly bears 11 by black bears if you
go out another decade the numbers
dropped even you know they actually
dropped and there were nine people
killed by grizzly bears and the number
of black bear bears that killed people
actually went up so what this says in
general is you know whether it's a
grizzly bear or black bear there's a
risk but if you look at the kind of
putting in a perspective here in this
twenty two year period down below the
risk is very low 250 people are killed
by were killed by dogs in this twenty
two year period 35,000 people a year are
killed in auto accidents so the risk of
you actually running into a grizzly bear
and having a fatal altercation is pretty
slim even if the population does rebound
in the North Cascades so just kind of an
interesting food for thought npca as an
organization we're involved and try to
educate people about grizzly bears and
why it's important to bring them back
and so I haven't really talked about
that so I want to take a second and talk
about that now so first off you know
grizzly bears are kind of like an
umbrella
species if you have a healthy eat if if
grizzly bears can survive and thrive in
an ecosystem you have a healthy
ecosystem so first and foremost that is
is it they're kind of an indicator
species in that way but they also do a
number of things in the ecosystem that
actually you know provide benefits first
off they do end up distributing seeds
and nutrients around and primarily
through their poop is how they do it
coastal bears that eat salmon will
actually you know spread nutrients
around through the forest and bears in
the interior which are more referred to
as grizzly bears will actually eat you
know berries and other fruits that
produce a lot of seeds and so when they
poop they're going to be pooping seeds
and kind of doing their own Johnny
Appleseed thing around in the ecosystem
which is actually helpful there are also
nature's roto tiller they're out there
trying to dig up roots and grubs and
also to occasionally get at a ground
squirrel and a hole and they help kind
of till the soil so that's another
benefit that they provide to the
ecosystem and then on top of that they
also will occasionally eat carrion the
come a comp upon a carcass maybe that
was killed by a wolf or wolves may be a
cougar and they'll actually take that
take that carcass and take it apart and
eat it so they perform a number of
benefits for an ecosystem and this also
brings me to a point which is useful in
mentioning grizzly bears primarily are
our herbivores i mean i'll technically
they're omnivores but eighty to ninety
percent of their diet comes from sedges
grasses roots berries those kinds of
things so they don't eat that much meat
they they actually you know it's only
about ten percent of their diet or so so
just an interesting point to make so
that's part of what we've been doing is
going around the state and educating
people about grizzly bears why they're
important to the environment as well as
hopefully imparting some knowledge about
how to coexist with grizzly bears out
there as well and you know I'll just
throw out a couple of pointers right off
the bat
I think we've got some hikers in the
room and you know that if in your in
grizzly bear country the last thing you
want to do is hike by yourself that is
like one of the worst ways of you know
potentially making yourself vulnerable
to an attack bears are known to as the
number and a hiking party goes up the
the risk of an attack actually
diminishes so for instance the guy that
you heard about in Yellowstone a couple
months ago was traveling alone and that
is one of the primary things you don't
want to do in grizzly bear country
always traveling groups always make
noise make sure you carry bear spray
those are some and know how to use it to
so if it's clipped to your belt you
don't know how to use the bear spray and
yet up squirting yourself not a good
thing so we definitely are trying to you
know get around particularly around the
North Cascades communities and tell
people about you know why bears are
important and how to coexist with them
we also had a series of presentations
around in the North Cascades communities
called ghost bears that was put on by
dr. bill gains and he was actually the
one that produced those statistics that
I just showed you a minute ago and he
talked about the study that they did for
a number of years trying to document the
existence of grizzly bears in the North
Cascades and they came up with very
little if anything no hair samples at
all no pictures of grizzly bears from
all the remote cameras that they set up
so you know that just tells you how
scarce they really are out there so
what's next so you know we're going to
continue to talk around the community go
to various events talk about why grizzly
bears are important to the to the North
Cascades but in terms of the schedule
the environmental impact statement which
is kind of the you know the standard
procedure process that you have to go
through that's that was decreed at the
federal government level the
environmental impact statement or study
was initially announced back in 2014 so
back earlier this year there were some
initial public meetings to get comments
from people and kind of understand how
they felt about grizzly bear
and you know try to take some public
record to get a sense of where people
were at so that happened earlier this
year next year we expect that the
National Park Service will actually
issue a draft environmental impact
statement and there you know the
proposal that they make could range from
don't do a thing leave the Bears where
they are and and see if they you know if
their numbers do increase which is what
we've been doing for the past 20 25
years and nothing has happened in fact
the the population is diminishing as far
as we know it could always arrange all
the way up to the possibility of
restoring the population which might
require some augmentation may be
introducing some some bears into the
system so we're expecting whatever their
decision is we're expecting to come out
mid next year and at that time the
public will be able to comment on it and
then a final environmental impact
statement will come out in 2017 so that
tells you a little bit about one of our
priority areas in the north cascades
what I want to do is bring up Shannon
and she's going to talk about some of
our other priority areas that we're
working on in Washington State Shannon
and we got a little clicker here ok back
to advance cool thank you yep hi thanks
everyone for being here and thanks to
all the online people so um Olympic
National Park one of our jewels in the
northwest here how many of you have been
to Olympic oh cool so you all know what
a special place this is Olympic is one
of the most diverse parks in the entire
system it has coastal areas it has
inland it has mountains it has the
rainforest and so it's in Washington
it's our largest and most visited park
and it was created through a tool that
the president has the antiquities act
it's a way that allows the President to
elevate public lands in to Monument
status so that's how we have the olympic
park and the olympic park when you look
at that
images of it you can see that there's so
much pressure on the peninsula for
logging that the only reason there are
any trees out there is because they are
in the park essentially like you can
when you are out there the border of the
park is it's cut pretty much right up to
the park so that just shows and tells
like how important it is to have these
places protected the elwha river dam
removal this is something that we worked
on for a very long time we were involved
in this process for over 20 years and we
did all kinds of things in our
involvement we worked with the represent
that rep at that time was norm dicks and
we did a lot of lobbying with Norm Dicks
we did a lot of presentations at the
Elwha we would bring people out over 30
tours and show them the biodiversity out
there and we would work with the
scientists and the ly itself has five of
the native salmon species in it and
since the dam has been removed those
five species have been returning to the
upper areas and so that was something
that we focused on with partnerships
with a lot of conservation groups and we
continue to work out there and the dam
has been removed the project was
complete but then they realized that
there was a little bit of damn that was
remaining in glines canyon the upper dam
site and it was actually a barrier to
the fish migration so they didn't think
there's going to be an issue but this
last year the water levels were at
record low they were so incredibly low
that it was barrier so they're in there
now the road was closed last week I
don't know if it's still closed this
week but taking out that last little bit
of damn to remove the last little bit of
barrier there and a couple of boulders
fell down on top of it too so I'm
they're clearing that out and what we're
doing at this time is and we have been
doing this for years but we take
volunteers out to the Elwha and the
olympic national park the park service
as they were going into the project
built these amazing green houses out
there and they started collecting seed
native seed from all
over the park because they wanted they
knew that once the reservoir was empty
that nate are non-native plants were
going to spring up like that and they
wanted this area to come back and to be
how it was before to maintain the
integrity of the biological integrity of
the area so they started planning
thousands of seeds they have huge
greenhouses and every year they plant
and then they bring them out in November
so we go and with our volunteers we work
at the greenhouses replanting the plants
and then we will go out to the Elwha in
November which is coming up so if you
want to join us on that trip it's really
fun we pack out where pacts take the
plants out to the river plant them and
it's just it's a great way to see what
is going on out there and the efforts
the astounding efforts at the Park
Service in collaboration with the Lower
Elwha Klamath clallam tribe what they're
doing to get this river restored to its
a historical level and this is a shot at
the greenhouse and their scientists are
incredible they've done a great job with
this project it's kind of running to the
end of its course now so we'll see what
happens in the next couple years if if
the funding continues or whatnot and
this is our group when we were out there
last year so it's right in that that is
what the riverbed looks like the the new
exposed area a lot of rocks it's pretty
harsh growing conditions really so and
then at Mount Rainier we do every year
we're up there for a National Public
Lands Day that this is a picture from
this year we did a revegetation project
in an old driving campsite there and the
reason we do these projects is because
we work on conservation we work on Park
protection but we also work on
connectivity so it's really important to
get people into the park doing service
projects and feeling that level of
connectivity where oh this is my Park I
belong here this is my work is helping
to make this a better place
and then this is in the North Cascades
we go up there every June which is early
for the park as you know probably that
you can't access a lot of it into a
little bit later but and we go the first
week of june and work on one of the
front front country trails so that's
always a good time and it's a good time
for volunteers to come out and work
directly with the Park Service and hear
from them about what the issues in the
parks are and what the challenges are
and what the successes are and they the
parks are we have a great working
relationship with the park service as
well and then we go out to the Olympic
Coast this is at it's very near clay
lock it's at south beach and we do a
coastal cleanup out there and we partner
with other conservation organizations
the coastal cleanup is put on by
organization called Co savers and
they're made up of a lot of marine
scientists and park service and a couple
of our other organizations out there but
it's the largest coastal cleanup in the
state so last year I think we removed
1,500 tons of debris off the coast so
it's really significant and it's not
just on the park beaches but there are
people all the way around the entire
peninsula down to Long Beach out on that
day so it's a lot of fun and that's
that's my main work with the
organization so that's all I have I
think yeah crater lake yeah
sure absolutely Thank You Shannon that
was great and unfortunately I haven't
been able to participate in one of those
volunteer projects but I'm going I'm
going next month so I'm going to get out
there I was also told to remind the
folks who are online if you would like
to submit a question feel free
Patricia's monitoring that so we can
certainly answer your questions if you
have them so hopefully we gave you a
little bit of better understanding of
what National Parks Conservation
Association is all about we're not part
of the government we're a 501 C 3 and we
do a lot of great work advocating for
our national parks and you know really
we just kind of hit the tip of the
iceberg of what we do here we also do a
lot of lobbying we talked to a lot of
our government officials here in
Washington State and we also talked to
our our senators and representatives at
the federal level as well so there's a
lot of work that's going on behind the
scenes to make sure that our electeds
are paying attention to our national
parks they understand the issues and
making sure that they you know vote the
right way to help the funding for our
parks so speaking of funding I did also
want to make just a quick pitch of
course it's The Giving Campaign time a
year and we are in the give tool so if
you're inclined and maybe you want to
take advantage of that fifty bucks that
Microsoft has given you and you want to
make a donation to npca or maybe you
want to increase that or however you
want to do it we you know we would we
would welcome your support and we'd be
grateful for your support so I just
wanted to put in the two cents there
what kind of questions you have Oh new
employees Microsoft all new employees
the new employee yeah forgot that little
detail they're all great for new
employees that you're given fifty
dollars that you can donate to whatever
whatever 501 C 3 us okay that's meaning
also case fifty bucks and also you know
when you can get twenty-five dollars an
hour for any of
projects that we went out that's correct
so you know Shannon talked about those
volunteer projects Microsoft will pay us
and PCA if you come out of NPC a project
twenty-five dollars an hour for the time
that you put in so that's pretty awesome
stuff so yeah you know which weekend in
november they're doing that cleanup what
weekend in november are we doing the
cleanup twenty and twenty first okay
right before thanksgiving then mm-hmm so
november 20 into 21st yeah i can send
you the flyer for that why don't you do
that in the monica and i will make sure
he's just first out to anyone that was
invited that's great yeah I appreciate
it enjoy additionally probably
information that you shared especially
about the Chris Lee's i think is really
interesting for those of us from camp
hey have it somewhat abnormal fear of
dying your hair myself um do you have
information out at your website and
organizational level that provides
information about the grizzly population
kind of speaking to the slides that you
were just showing us sir we do have some
information on we're in the middle of a
revamp of our of our website all
together so I'm not a hundred percent
certain what's up there but I can
certainly you know if need be we could
even share the slides or you know send
some some links when our website is has
been brought back up to speed was it the
next week sometime version or the
national version the net Walter we have
a link to our local page from the
National yeah so in a 10 yeah NP CA org
right right so next week hopefully the
new website will be unleashed so but
yeah it's a good point Patricia I mean
you know it's not just about hiking too
it's about camping and you know one of
the things that you should do of course
and I think every camper knows this is
don't store food in your tent so you
know a bear has a really really
sensitive nose and if he smell something
he likes and he smells that it's coming
from that little you know colored fabric
you know house over there you know he's
going to go and check it out so
definitely want to make sure that you
keep things either
either you hang your your food or you
put it in a you know bear in a
bear-proof canister and some places you
know some wilderness areas they actually
you know that's and national parks
that's the way you have to camp you have
to take a bear-proof canister with you
to put your put your food in so and as
far as the you know the actual grizzly
population you know they're predicting
even if there is a restoration project
that has put in place where they
actually bring in some bears it's going
to be over a hundred years before they
have even what they consider a
sustainable grizzly bear population you
know grizzly bears have anywhere from
one to three cubs you know there's
usually a fifty percent mortality rate
so you know they're there aren't a lot
of bears that are born that survive and
so it's going to take a long time for
their to even be you know a population
of 150 bears it's going to take a while
thirty percent it's kind of scary it's
kind of scary if you're a bear cub yeah
I got life is rough mentioned like any
numbers that they would try to move him
oh they're gonna transplant guys I think
they have no idea be from yellow sound
or something oh well you know the
earlier on there are interred you know
introductions in certainly a glacier and
I think they did it in Yellowstone to
you know some some bears but you know
some of those are remnant populations
that were left from the unity grizzly
bears ranged from you know Alaska all
the way down practically into Mexico
back in the day but most of them were
killed off during the western expansion
so yeah I mean there's probably there's
there's data from reintroductions that
have done been done in some of the
national parks and I'm sure if if that's
the decision that's made that is you
know they'll they'll certainly be
looking back at what was learned from
some of those other you know
augmentations that happened previously
but you know hope
here we're talking about at least
restoring a population that may already
exist you know there may only be five
bears there but hopefully we can add a
few bears to kind of make sure that
we've got a viable population question
about the walls like wolf population are
also pretty Nikita's oh and are they
like plans to introduce back rolls well
wolves are actually it's interesting you
know wolves were originally reintroduced
in Yellowstone back in the mid-90s and
there have been some wolf
reintroductions in Idaho I believe as
well over the years and so what's
happening here in Washington is we're
seeing the descendants of those wolves
actually coming into Washington and
they're also coming from the north are
also coming from British Columbia so
we're you know we're getting kind of an
expansion from the south and from the
north right now my last the last I knew
I think we have roughly 15 packs of
wolves here in Washington now you know
and a pack could be as few as you know
three individuals so you know it really
varies and as I mentioned the closest
wolf pack to us here is in the TN away
and I think one was recently killed one
was recently shot but you know there may
be only you know three or so individuals
in that pack right now so the TN away is
a area is right next to cle elum and
Roslyn right out there so I mean if you
took you know 90 out to cle elum and
then you just had a little bit farther
east you know you're up in the TN away
beautiful area so it's kind of cool in a
way that you know Washington State
didn't have to do anything you know wolf
just came back of their own accord same
thing happened with Wolverines
Wolverines were extirpated as we're many
of those carnivores back in the 1900s
but in the late 80s and 90s we started
seeing a few individuals actually
showing up in the Cascades and basically
what they did is they're making their
way back from British Columbia down into
Washington State so there may be as many
as a couple dozen Wolverines
you know in the in the North Cascades
and the mountains in Washington which is
kind of cool so I mean that's the other
thing too I mean North Cascades National
Park has all these different critters in
the park and in that ecosystem that I
showed you but the one that's really
suffering the most is the grizzly bear
just because you know reproduction rates
are so low and there's a lot of
development other things they have to
kind of pass through from British
Columbia to get down into the north
cascades of Washington so you know
letting it kind of take place on its own
so far that philosophy hasn't worked so
you know we're crossing fingers that the
Park Service may makes a different
decision but we don't know for sure
we're advocating for augmentation for
restoration and we'll see where it goes
before you call with the olympic
national forest if that's a natural
habitat for grizzly bears but they have
to supplant them there because they're
probably not gonna go on a bear
walkabout oh they certainly wouldn't um
area you know I actually don't know a
lot about the history of Grizzlies down
in the Olympic Peninsula do you know I
would guess there may have been some but
there may not have been a lot you know
because it's always been a little bit
isolated up there I mean there were
wolves there too but it's gonna take a
while for wolves to get back to the
Olympic Peninsula as you say you know
it's a it's a pretty big walk about to
get over there so um yeah I I don't
really know about the peninsula nice
question we are looking to volunteer
what is the best place to find events
and sign up Shannon what's the best
place to sign up if someone's looking to
volunteer or should they email you Oh
automatically fix haha yeah well you
have a life are you oh my god so you can
email me at s brendel at NBC a org and
our website will be up next week
hopefully but right now it's not I don't
have the events listed on there so mpca
org is the website and you go to the
northwest there's a little star for
Seattle you go in there and then all of
our events will be up hopefully next
week but
until then email me directly and I can
get you the information that you need
cool great sure hi yeah you mentioned
lobbying like the new organisms and
loving I'm wondering like in the recent
events with the land and water
preserving fun that it was hired yes
what is I'm wondering if maybe you
organization there's something about it
or you coordinate with a group of
Association it's something it's a big
thing that before you don't even know
that a lot of things have been bought up
yeah with that money or food it use like
many trails outside of Salem you
mentioned there's a hundred miles of
trails within an hour a lot of it was
true then and water the water
conservation fund right yeah yeah
exactly in fact I was working for
conservation Northwest at the time of
the Cascades conservation partnership
and we used the Land and Water
Conservation Fund to buy land to add to
the forest service areas around the
Snoqualmie Pass so yeah I mean and land
and water conservation fund money is
used by other organizations like
Washington wildlife and recreation
coalition and others as they advocate
for you know adding lands to you know
the public domain and that money is used
to buy those lands so right now there is
a threat to the Land and Water
Conservation Fund in fact the spicket
has essentially been turned off the fun
still exists but where the money
normally comes from is from oil and gas
drilling revenues leases lease revenues
and so right now Congress has basically
turned off the spigot and and the the
funding expired I think I was at the end
of September so we're involved as our
other organizations and trying to make
people aware of it and encouraging
people to inform their you know
congressional folks and and folks in the
Senate is well obviously same thing but
your your house folks and
our Senate folks to stand up for the
Land and Water Conservation Fund and see
that it gets funded again because it
does a lot of good and it has added a
number of great you know areas back to
the public domain that were previously
in private hands so so it's yeah it's
absolutely true and we're working on
that it's it's a difficult issue
unfortunately there's a big contingent
you know we are nonpartisan but there is
a contingent in in the government right
now that is you know working towards
making sure that those monies go towards
other things for instance funding the
training of energy workers which you
know let's see should we buy you know
lands and Adam to our public land domain
or should we train energy workers I mean
that's just one example but there are a
number of things that that Bishop is
looking to you know funnel that money
towards instead of what it's you know
primarily been used for in the past so
yeah so we encourage you you know
contact your your representative contact
yours your senator and let them know you
think Land and Water Conservation Fund
is important so I'm mailing list yeah
yeah yeah it was yeah yep yep yep yeah
we are we are trying to make people
aware of it any other questions anyone
has anyone online have any other
questions okay thank you so much for for
coming today we really appreciate you
being here we appreciate your interest
and Patricia thank you so much for for
standing in and being our host today as
i said before Monica we miss you and
come back soon and thank you patricia in
the interim we really appreciate you
being here to help kick things off okay
