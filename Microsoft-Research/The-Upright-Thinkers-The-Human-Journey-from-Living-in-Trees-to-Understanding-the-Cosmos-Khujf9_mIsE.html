hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading

thanks so much for coming my name is Amy
graves and I'm pleased to welcome
Leonard Mladenov back to the Microsoft
Research visiting speaker series he's
here to discuss his latest book The
Upright thinkers in which he points out
that the way we think it has just as
much influence on science as science
does on human thinking curiosity and
striving to learn are critical for the
future of mankind he was an Alexander
von Humboldt fellow at the Max Planck
Institute for physics and astrophysics
he has written several for several
publications and is the author of five
bestsellers including the drunkards walk
and fineman's rainbow he has also
written for television series like
MacGyver and Star Trek The Next
Generation please join me in giving him
a very warm welcome good morning
everyone
well a little bit after morning I guess
but for some of us this morning so I'm
gonna talk about the human journey from
living in trees to understanding the
cosmos today I structured my book
chronologically there are a few
different eras that we've gone through
in our development the first eras take
millions of years the next one takes
thousands of years then hundreds of
years and now we make as much progress
in just decades that that we would make
in a million years
previously because the pace of the
growth of knowledge is ever increasing
because the amount of new knowledge we
get is proportional to the knowledge
that we have already into a number of
people that we have and so it's really
exponential growth but in the beginning
we were just Apes living in the wild and
there were actually many species of
human Homo means human it's a genus this
group of species were Homo sapiens
we're actually Homo sapiens sapiens
which is a subspecies but there are many
other homo species and all the rest of
them went extinct except for ourselves
and you know we tend to think that we're
smarter than other animals and that that
intelligence is somehow helped us serve
survive but really the reason that we
have a bigger brain scientists believe
now is for social cooperation because to
understand each other and what each
other are thinking and to work in a way
that helped us survive in the wild
despite some of our physical and
adequacies took a lot larger brain than
other species have so when we look at
somebody we can read on their face what
they're thinking what they're feeling we
can have if we have an idea what they
think we're thinking we have an idea
what they think we're thinking they're
thinking we have an idea what what we
what they think we think they're
thinking we're thinking and
psychologists say we can do this too six
the degrees of depth and that's pretty
amazing I can't even say it the six I
stop at four I think but so for that
reason we we have we've developed these
huge brains and but once you have that
as you guys know I guess once you have
the software capacity you can use it for
many things even beyond what what it's
designed for
so around 10,000 BC we started to do
that that's the time of what people call
the Neolithic Revolution or the
Agricultural Revolution and in school
you may have learned that that was a
time when the humans used we're living
in as nomadic tribes wandering around
without a permanent home and they
settled down began to settle in villages
and domesticate animals and grow crops
and back when I was in school we were
told deaths because that was more
efficient way of growing food and so it
was a better led to a better life and
that's completely wrong we have now done
many studies of the skeletal remains of
people from back then and they actually
when they settled down they lived
shorter they had more disease and a
lesser a worse diet so why did we
actually settle down well a leading
theory of that has to do not with with
what we eat but our spiritual
nourishment it was around that time that
the first temples were built and that
people started to wonder about what
happens after death and what is the
meaning of life and so by settling down
they could keep their departed loved
ones with them that literally kept them
under the floorboards generations of
generations they just lived on top of
the graves
and so this is what caused people
believe what caused the first
settlements and these were these could
have thousands of people but they
weren't really cities a city is defined
as a settlement where there's a division
of labor
so each family is not self-sufficient
but there's butchers and bakers and
candlestick makers and so forth and that
that death started around 3000 BC and
that development was huge for the
development of science and all
intellectual things because in order to
live in a society like that we had to
invent writing and arithmetic and
writing is a very difficult invention
all nomadic tribes speak there's never
been a tribe found through the centuries
that didn't speak spoken to have spoken
language but scientists believe that
written language only originated in 2 or
3 times and all the other languages all
the languages that we have today are
derived from those couple inventions so
when that happened we started to have
the first scholars and the first jobs
devoted to the to the intellect they
were bookkeepers record keepers and
there were scholars professors so to
speak of reading writing and arithmetic
and eventually they started thinking
about other deeper things they would
collect books of effort or not books but
written tablets of aphorisms it's like
don't piss in the river and statements
very useful statements for life like
that
and then a few hundred years later or a
thousand a couple thousand years later
the Greeks had this idea that we could
use reason to understand the world and
we started moving away some of us from
believing that God's everything is due
to the gods and and looking at whether
observation and logical analysis could
tell something about the world that
culminated really an Aristotle who was
an extremely good empiricist and I call
him a one man Wikipedia because he
really studied everything he studied
fish people's stomachs the climate meat
volcanoes you know and anything you
could think of a science today almost he
he studied and probably wrote a book
about it unfortunately most of his
thoughts were wrong and they were in a
wrong direction because he had the idea
that all of nature derives from a
purpose the final per
of the world and and he didn't do
anything in the quantitative way it was
all qualitative so the next big step to
liberate from Aristotelian thinking came
in what's called the Scientific
Revolution and again this is not really
a revolution because it happened over
hundreds of years and different people
to different parts and they were very
confused and weren't quite sure what
they were doing but we call it the
Scientific Revolution anyway and then
finally the decades I'm talking about
was the beginnings of quantum theory and
modern science modern physics but also
modern chemistry and biology and this
was a huge departure in the way people
thought about the world because prior to
this we the only thing we dealt with was
we're phenomena that we could see feel
smell scents with our senses we may not
have something like a microscope or a
telescope to help us but that eventually
we saw things with our eyes and so we're
really dealing with the world as we
could take it in with our senses and
around 1900 we started to have enough
technology to look beyond that we
discovered x-rays for instance which
made film a change color and and the
electron electrons were would impede
impact upon phosphorescent screens and
you could see electrons indirectly that
way and we start looking at
radioactivity and we realize this as a
whole kind of universe out there that's
beyond our senses and that left laughs
people behind cause it was a very hard
thing to accept so there was lot of
opposition to ideas like the atom in the
quantum but over several decades that
was developed so that's kind of the
timeline that I follow in the book from
millions of years BC to today but that's
not really why I wrote the book and
that's not really the let's say the soul
of the book this is a picture of my
parents when my night my father proposed
to my mother and he's a Holocaust
survivor went through concentration
camps and he was in the not anti-nazi
underground and he saw some of the worst
of humanity and some of the best he only
had a seventh grade education and when I
hit seventh and eighth grade and God
didn't started reading about science or
talking about science he took a great
interest in it and not in the technical
theories of science but in what science
means for he
and what it tells us about people that
people do science and how is science
done and he wanted to understand the
soul of science so I always thought I
would write a book about that one day
and that's what what this book is he's
been dead for almost 30 years now 25
years but better late than never so so
here's the book in school we learned
that science is about the scientific
method
I certainly had this in high school you
ask a question I'm sure being at
Microsoft you've all seen this many
times I state a hypothesis you do an
experiment you check to see whether your
prediction was right you adjust your
theory or throw out your theory or you
believe in your theory a little more
than before we did the experiment and
that's how science is done and my
daughter who's 14 a freshman in high
school came home recently and and said
daddy daddy I learned all about the
scientific method and I learned how
Darwin was following it with evolution
so she was really excited and this was
really cool and I'm she's taught me all
about and I look in her book to see what
it says and there there it was talking
about Darwin found evidence for his
theory had a theory or hypothesis found
evidence from fossils and geography and
in particular from the finches on the
Galapagos so he went from island to
island and he could see that the bills
of the finches were each what were
different in each island according to
the habitats and according to what the
Finch had to eat and so different
species developed because the fittest
one survived and this is all great
evidence for evolution and then you know
she all they also use the internet a lot
for their studies so here's a BBC
website that talks about it while
studying wildlife on the Galapagos
Darwin notice the finches showed wide
variations on the beak etcetera etcetera
etc etc so there's only you know this is
a very nice lean explanation
illustration the scientific method that
suffers from only one problem it's
completely wrong and it didn't happen
that way at all and I'm surprised to
learn that they still teach it like that
but maybe I shouldn't have been so in
the upright thinkers I try to talk about
how we really got from stone tools to
and trial and error exploration of the
world to modern science and what is the
scientific method and what do scientists
really do
and some of the lessons are these that
science is far more complicated than
these myths portray that most pioneer
geniuses experienced failure after
failure after failure before they hit
the right thing so it's very important
to be able to accept failure to be wrong
to admit that you're wrong and that's
something that people in many areas of
life have a hard time with but if you're
a scientist you're faced with it all the
time and you have to be willing to
accept that if you want to be successful
I mean unless you're super lucky but
it's hard to think of anyone who was
that that lucky even Alexander Fleming
who supposedly came upon penicillin by
by a chance observation if you read the
real story it was much more complicated
also scientists are often confused about
their theories right up until the moment
they complete their theories and they're
often confused about their theories even
after they complete their theories so
we'll see that it gives examples that
throughout history where that happened
whereas the people they think that
they're showing one thing and then later
on it takes years and years to interpret
what they really said and the theories
that we learned in school in our
textbooks which I've been fine-tuned
made more elegant over the years are not
that's not the form that these theories
often came up in and not the way that
the inventors understood their theories
also most scientist ideas prove wrong so
as I said that you have to be ready to
say that you're wrong and so throughout
science history curiosity stubbornness
and what the psychologists called grit
have proved more important than
scientific insight and you know grit I
don't know if you've heard of grit but
it's a big topic in psychology these
days and it has to do with your ability
to overcome obstacles and they keep
going despite daunting daunting problems
in front of you and it seems to be
correlated to success in everything from
the military to marriage and certainly
important in science so in this talk I'm
going to tell you three stories today
and let's start the first one is a
Darwin story darwin's barnacles I call
it the real story so Darwin did start by
asking a question
as the scientific method says you should
but his question was what so I do with
my life he had been sent to medical
school by his father so I like to say
even though Darwin wasn't Jewish he
seemed to have a Jewish father and yet
he couldn't didn't do very well because
he couldn't stand the sight of blood
and this was a time when when you
operate on someone blood is flashing
everywhere and the patient is screaming
because there's no anesthetic and Darwin
just didn't have the stomach for that so
he quit and then his father decide he
should be a clergyman and Darwin thought
he might do that but he suspected that
it might not be too quiet a life for him
and he was looking for something to do
instead when this offer came to go on
the Beagle now we say that Darwin was a
big O's naturalist because the ships did
carry along a naturalist in those days
but the reason he was that this that the
what the captain really wanted was a
companion because the voyage is several
years long this was five year voyage and
the captain being of a certain social
class was precluded from talking to the
crew so you're basically in solitary
confinement for five years unless you
find somebody of your class that can
join you so the previous captain of the
Beagle responded by shooting himself in
the head attempting suicide and he he
survived actually but then he died from
complications some weeks later and the
second command took over and he was now
going to be the captain on the next on
the next voyage and he thought I'd
better find someone to talk to so he
ended up picking Darwin after the first
fellow he asked turned him down and even
though he was he Darwin came on board to
be the ship's naturalist he didn't
really think himself as much of a
naturalist as he did as a geologist his
entry all interest greater interest at
the time was in geology not in not in
nature not in biology so it's a
startling now we know a lot about what
Darwin was thinking from his notebooks
his journals and his letters so that's
where were all this insight into what he
was really what he was really thinking
comes from from scholars studying all
those documents sometime decades after
he came up with evolution he wrote his
own stories of how he got to it and
that's where some of the myths arise
from but if you look at the stuff he
wrote at the time you get you get the
real story and the start of the cruise
he wrote back home that geology and
invertebrate animals will be my chief
object of pursuit through the whole
voyage so maybe a little bit of you know
studying some worms or something but
mainly geology and then after the voyage
did he write wow this was an amazing
voyage I I figured out evolution I found
all kinds of evidence for it and now he
said during this cruise I have done
little except geology well that's what
he planned to do and that's what he did
and actually he got pretty famous for it
he made some great observations along
the way and when he got back the
geologists were really applauding him so
where did evolution come from well he
sent he sent specimens back as he went
and so other scientists were looking at
the specimens and this got him thinking
about evolution I mean he wasn't the
first one by any means to think about
evolution but he was the first one to
really make it scientific and to look at
a mechanism for it but as far as the
finches go they he did collect finches
and send them back but most of them were
misidentified as blackbirds grosbeaks
and other things and they weren't marked
according to which island they were in
so they really weren't that useful and
he wasn't a very good ornithologist but
in his studies over the years as he was
developing evolution just to show you
what kind of work he had to put in this
is example of just one byproduct of his
studies it's a book 635 page book on the
topic of different species of barnacles
so he wrote 635 pages on barnacles and
that's just one of his undertakings that
he took over the years when s/he was
developing evolution it was a lot harder
than looking at a few finches beaks and
just to show you graphically what how
long it took in and how difficult it was
this is a picture of Darwin when he
started the theory of evolution this is
a picture when he finished so here I'm
just gonna quickly a few things that he
was up to he studied the animals in the
zoo he fed bird seeds and studied their
poop because he was interested in you
know as plants spread how do they spread
and how can they spread from Islands or
across bodies of water
well birds can carry them you know in
their feathers if they get stuck or they
can eat them and what are the chances
that a seed will survive intact and come
out in the poop and how long can it last
like that and so on so
studied that he examined the work of
people who are doing artificial
selection and breeding animals so even
though even though he was queasy at the
sight of blood he dissected hundreds of
animals to to compare their Anatomy and
he studied the emotions of monkeys and
other primates and also of people from
different countries to see what kind of
expressions they have on their faces and
to compare that to see if they were
Universal among humans and to compare
them to other primates and this is a
work that still referred to fairly often
in neuroscience today and of course he
did the barnacle work and a lot of other
work so his this his true timeline was
he spent five years on the voyage as a
creationist he started developing as his
theory still a creationist five years
after he started developing his theory
he finished a 35-page synopsis of
evolution so if someone who writes books
I go wow a guy who's even slower than me
seven pages a year that just shows you
how hard it was and he was still a
creationist at this point even though he
was believing in evolution so he had to
modify his ideas of creationism a little
bit I don't think this is filtered down
to Kansas yet but his modification was
that so original creationism says God
put animals on here and they never
change and his new version was God put
animals on here and and designed their
habitats so that they would evolve in a
certain way and that's what we're seeing
is God's plan at work so he was able to
reconcile his deep religious faith with
his theory of evolution although it you
know his faith did perhaps was not as
literal or as strong through the years
he still was considered himself a devout
Christian and a creationist
for most of his most of his work and
what really changed his would finally
destroyed his faith in God had nothing
to do with science at all it was when
his ten year old daughter and he died in
1851 and was after that that he became
an atheist and so when people talk about
evolution being godless it's much more
complicated in Darwin's case than that
and there was 1858 some twenty years
after he started working on the theory
that he finally felt he had on the
theory
well enough developed and enough
evidence for it to announce it so just a
brief aside about the the danger of some
of these misses that they make science
simple easy and today we were faced with
that in many in many domains people who
think you know perhaps they heard the
story of Darwin and the finches or
Newton in the Apple and they see
something too and they think well I have
my own theory and that that is all I
need to have a theory and and I just
want to show you an example about autism
and vaccines so here's here's one of the
early papers on that this was they
studied 498 individual cases and
analyzed them and analyzed a timetable
and found no correlation between
vaccines and the onset of autism and
this an article that was referred to by
more than 2000 researchers over the past
15 years which means there was at least
2000 other people looking at the same
thing and they all conclude the same
thing that there's no connection but
then if you just think you can that
science is easy maybe you don't need
that and you get statements like this
I've heard of many tragic cases of
walking talking normal children who
wound up with profound mental disorders
after vaccines and that's Rand Paul
sorry so I think that one of the
problems with believing in the myths of
science is that it makes it too easy to
draw facile conclusions and and think
that it's true or maybe he's just being
a demagogue I'm not sure which is the
case because he's not a dumb guy but he
makes statements like that and a lot of
politicians do so one final example of
what science has come to today and how
unsympathetic I'd like to talk about the
Large Hadron Collider we talk about the
Higgs boson we discovered the Higgs
boson we saw quote the Higgs boson so
what does it mean that we saw the Higgs
boson in in the world today okay well
first of all our lab is 27 kilometers in
circumference so it's quite a big lab
it's if it were to run for a year it
would consume the same amount of energy
as a country of Madagascar so I named
the unit 4 of 1 Madagascar
and it it's a total of 10,000 scientists
working together so I talked about
social cooperation to survive in the
wild but now we're to me this is the
most impressive feat of social
cooperation in human history that 10,000
people in 60 countries around the world
can collaborate with a very delicate and
complex and 27 mile-long
electronic machine and measure something
too many decimal places and get it right
and to do the analysis we needed the
most powerful supercomputer in the world
made of many computers that are
networked together so when we see this
we so in the old days we would see
something when Newton saw something he
maybe saw the Apple fall right later on
we had the telescope where you see a
something but he still record it with
your eye but you enhance it with the
telescope or a microscope and then and
around the turn of the century we had we
would see like electrons by their their
image on a screen we would see something
indirect or we saw the x-rays but in
this case what are we really seeing so
the Higgs decays very quickly so you
don't see the Higgs hit anything Higgs
decays into other particles they decay
into other particles and they do it in
different it does it in different ways
that there's only a probabilistic
description so there's many different
ways that Higgs can decay so there's all
these different possible outcomes
eventually there are electronics which
are something like the old
phosphorescent screen but much more
sophisticated but it the electronics
take measurements on the decay products
of the Higgs so it's an indirect their
indirect particles that we're looking at
not the Higgs itself right
but we're eventually detecting them with
electronics but even that isn't really
what we're doing because we're not you
can't tell anything from just one
incident we're looking at millions of
incidents and the statistics of the
millions of incidents and the statistics
of the different decay products over
millions of incidents that is what we
mean we saw the Higgs you're not even
seeing one instance of it so this this
amount of indirect in direct indirect
it's been taken to the nth degree now
and when we say we saw something what we
really mean is that we recorded some
statistical evidence of it so it's all
much more complicated than it used to be
and just to show you when you do this
you have to match it to the theory
of course so let's look and see what the
theory looks like this is the standard
model these two pages are the standard
model of particle physics that describe
leptons hadrons and the higgs higgs
particle so except for gravity this
describes and has been very successful
in all areas of particle physics but
it's it's it's something that takes
years to understand it's not something
that you can take a course in when I was
in college we took a course in quantum
mechanics and by the end of the course I
could solve the helium atom and other
physical systems but for this you have
to know a lot I mean you have to know
pretty advanced mathematics of course
there's a lot hidden in here matrice
matrices and differential equations this
was built by not one or two people but
by hundreds of people there's all these
parameters of the masses for instance
that have to be measured by people over
the year so it was quite a team effort
to put this together and to add the
cherry on top having this doesn't tell
you anything because we can't solve what
this says there's no way to know what
this says other than using approximation
methods we use we're called Fineman
diagrams as a kind of you've heard of
perturbation theory where we to
calculate this so you need an a whole
other set of knowledge to derive the
predictions from this and then you need
a computer to put it all together so
it's all it's all quite complicated
removed from what one person could do or
from an apple falling well so my next
story I want to tell is I call it we may
be right but we doubt it the story of
quantum mechanics and you'll see the
significance of the title later on the
equations I'm using to illustrate it
here our the equations for the helium
atom it's this is what's called the
Hamiltonian for the helium atom and just
to show you how things have changed in
the past hundred years this is a lot
easier to understand then then than this
and in fact I can tell you really easily
quickly what these different terms are
the r12 is the force between the two
electrons
it's a repulsive force it has a plus
sign the the one over R one and one over
r to represent the force between the new
which is blue and the red electrons so
they have a - because they're attractive
forces and the first two terms are
differential operators that represent
the kinetic energy and that's it and
that's the helium atom so it's simple to
write down at least it's not it's
impossible to solve but we again solve
it using approximation methods but 100
years ago this is the kind of equation
that physicists dealt with so the first
step in quantum theory was taken by Max
Planck I was showing my daughter this
slide and she when she saw this she said
my god he invented quantum mechanics and
he only lived to be three years old and
I said no no no he invented quantum
mechanics during those period he was
doing that work in that period I like
Max Planck a lot because I have a
complicated name Mladenov and so when I
make a reservation in a restaurant I say
I'm Max Planck and they always get that
and only one person has ever recognized
what the name so so it's not a problem
so what did max planck do or Max Planck
he started he started just as you would
understand from the very simple
description of science he started from a
kind of a hypothesis or an idea a simple
idea that there's no such thing as atoms
so he wonder he wanted to find evidence
for the fact that there's no such thing
of atoms he was one of those people who
didn't believe that physics should be
dealing with things that we couldn't see
even though there were reasons to do so
that arose from observations in those
days and he decided to attack a problem
called blackbody radiation and to try
and solve that problem without referring
to atoms and this would help bolster up
that the case for the idea that there
are no there's no such thing as atoms
does everybody do you guys know what
blackbody radiation is I don't know okay
some of them okay so that's the
radiation that that is of a body of any
object that's due to its temperature so
today we know that things are made of
atoms the atoms have charges they jiggle
around a jiggle faster at a higher
temperature so they because charge
things that jiggle give off radiation
there's this stuff called blackbody
radiation and
depends on temperature because things
are jiggling faster at higher
temperature doesn't depend on the on the
material the bodies made of this is just
what's due to the thermal motion and
there's so there's certain
characteristic ER for how much energy is
given at a particular frequency and when
physicists of the day tried to calculate
that from Newton's laws they got
nonsense
so people were wondering what's going on
they weren't wondering about Newton's
laws they were wondering what mistakes
are we making in our model that we get
the wrong answer and Planck was one of
those and it was an important problem
today because the light bulb had just
been invented and there people were
trying to figure out how to make a more
efficient light bulb so here's a graph
the different different curves represent
different temperatures and the along the
horizontal axis is the wavelength in
this graph so as you can see the shorter
wavelengths are toward the origin and
then red and infrared and so on are to
the right this is what he was trying to
explain and he spent three years trying
to explain it so we have to have
patience and have to accept failure and
he failed and failed and failed but he
didn't give up and he backed up he said
I'll forget about how it happens let me
try and find an equation that describes
the curve because no one even knew the
mathematical form of the curve and so he
came up with what's called Planck's law
which is there and the the old law that
Newton's laws gave the was a Rayleigh
Raleigh jeans law which is shown there
and that you can see how it just goes up
to infinity and it's totally wrong but
plaque figured out that this equation
works pretty well so he went of course
this was the days before computers and
before he could look up data on the
Internet and so you know it wasn't sure
quite sure how well it worked but he
went to the October meeting of the
Berlin Physical Society and presented
his work this equations I don't know why
it works but look at its pretty good
equation and one of his friends who's an
experimentalist took it home and started
plugging in the experimental data and he
got so excited he worked all night and
plugged in point after point after point
doing all the calculations by hand and
found that this works amazingly well
much better than it had a right to do
given that it was just guessed by Planck
so so plaque now got desperate to derive
the law and that's how I stumbled on
quantum theory the first thing he did
was he said okay I couldn't derive
anything
by not using atoms so to his great
credit what did he do he did what a
scientist is supposed to do he said okay
maybe I'm wrong what if there are atoms
let me try and derive the law using
atoms and that's and that worked and
that's how he found he discovered
quantum mechanics oh I understand was a
big Einstein was a big admirer of Planck
because he was able to do this to step
beyond his his prejudice and to find the
truth but in order to in order to derive
the law I had to make one additional
really weird assumption which is that
atoms could not have just any energy
they could only have certain discrete
set of energies so if you imagine my
hand you know I can shake it faster and
faster and faster at any speed
apparently but for atoms it seemed like
a gonna go like that or like that or
like that in certain discreet manner
well that was really weird but it did
give the law so he went back to the
Berlin Physical Society in December and
announced his explanation and he got to
be very well known as the person who
explained the blackbody effect the
blackbody radiation but nobody thought
that this was a big deal nobody thought
that this was a new a new way of looking
at nature they thought this is some
property of material was causing this
that and and we didn't understand that
yet but Planck figured out what property
of the material we would eventually
figure it out and some people just
didn't like it at all just to show you
how science works here is mr. genes Sir
James Gene's who is one of the inventors
of that Rayleigh genes law so if when
planks and Planck's law if you set 8 H
equal to 0 you get the Rayleigh jeans
law so Planck introduced this what's
called a Planck's constant which
describes how the energy can only have
discrete values if it's zero then
energies have continuous values and you
get the old law which doesn't work and
he fixed what the value of H must be by
fitting the curve and what does jeans
reaction of course I'm aware that
Planck's law is a good agreement with
experiment but essentially I don't
believe I still don't believe it I like
mine better so I like to quote Robert
Frost on this one why abandon a belief
merely because it ceases to be true that
seem to be the the
many physicists for the next five years
not one single paper was written to
further this theory and guess who came
along finally and took the next step it
was Albert Einstein so Albert Einstein
was now the young kid just shortly out
of school and he's looking at planks
work and he goes wow there's something
deep there plank himself didn't see that
but Einstein did so he is the first one
to interpret Planck's quantum principle
as a general law of nature and then he
invented the idea of the photon he said
well light must be it's not just atoms
that can that that can't have any energy
light also can't have just any energy
and so it comes to must come in
particles and so this is the
quantization of light and when he put
together the quantization of light with
with Planck's idea of quantization of of
atom energy well this is fine and and
and at this if that's all he had done
he'd be like one of these people who
often send me emails and say wow I have
I have this I have this idea that the
that the early universe was like stars
and this and that and they see it's this
is this is how it works and isn't that
great and I go well I don't know
although there's just you know this
doesn't really tell me anything you can
anyone come up with ideas even Ron Paul
and it doesn't prove anything
so if you want to prove something you
have to you have to you have to show
that it works so this is what he did he
applied this to another effect another
problem of the day that hadn't been
solved called the photoelectric effect
that's the effect of when light hits
certain metals they eject electrons and
you get a current and when you study how
that happens the experimental results
again didn't match the theory based on
Newton's laws and Einstein showed that
this picture did match it so what
happened here did people go wow quantum
theory let's work on it it's great know
people who had the same reaction that
they did to Planck's law they said wow
you explained the photoelectric effect
you know don't make it bigger than that
you just explain the photoelectric
effect huh we don't quite get it but you
explained it even eight years later in
1913 somebody was writing a a
recommendation for Einstein to get a
Nobel Prize okay
and that somebody
as uh Max Planck and he said Einsteins a
great guy he had a lot he had a lot of
good ideas
except this stupid idea about quantizing
the electromagnetic field this Fulton
idea except where he took my my Planck's
constant and tried to make it more
important than it is if you ignore that
he's done a lot of good stuff and indeed
when Einstein won the Nobel Prize it was
for the photoelectric effect without any
mention of quantum theory so the guys
who really ended up putting quantum
theory on the map for good are to these
first Verner Heisenberg not the guy from
Breaking Bad the other Verner Heisenberg
I'm as a physicist I found it very
hurtful that if you google Verner
Heisenberg the first couple pages are
the other Verner Heisenberg so I think
we need to have more physics shows about
real physicists but and then Irvin
Schrodinger so these guys each invented
a new so I say that they kind of put
qualm theory on the map to stay because
they invented each invented their own
theory that could actually replace
Newton's laws and it's a quantum version
of Newton's law so there wasn't just
here's an idea I'll apply it to this
phenomenon here's an idea I applied to
that phenomenon this is a whole theory
to replace Newton's laws and in 1925 so
you know what was the reaction to this
again now they have the whole theory so
you think everyone would jump on it
right well this is why I said we may be
right but but I might be right but I
doubt it the Feinstein thought he might
be right but he doubted it he said he
didn't like quantum theory as we all
probably know that because it was the
interpretation had these probabilities
in it right
Schrodinger well shor Nagar didn't like
it either after he saw what it meant and
he said I wouldn't have even published
it if if I had known and and he actually
derived his theory shortly after
Heisenberg's and his inspiration was
Heisenberg's because he didn't like
Heisenberg she hated Heisenberg so much
that he derives his own and he happened
to get it right but the two theories
looked very different so he published
his own he thought ah I finally got it
right
Heisenberg's is wrong I like mine it was
much more like classical theory and
evolved waves Heisenberg's looks very
weird to scientists okay so so he was
very happy without Einstein complimented
him
they were all very cheering each other
on and then someone proved that the two
theories are mathematically equivalent
so now you now shorting her turns
against his own theory because oh my god
it has the same predictions it might
look different but it's really the same
as that schmuck Heisenberg and so you
know this is horrible well in the
ironically guess who proved that they
were equivalent Schrodinger so that's
again a complement to Schrodinger
because even though he hated the fact
that they were equivalent when he saw he
was trying to find the difference
between the theories and when he saw
there was none he went ahead with it and
published it and hated it meanwhile what
did Heisenberg think of Schrodinger's
theory he said the more reflect on
Schrodinger's theory the more disgusting
I find it what he wrote his crap so it
wasn't exactly a mutual admiration
society and it wasn't exactly a case
where everything is seen clearly by
those who invented so it's just the way
science is done so now before my last
story we're gonna do something
completely different briefly play a game
cry call who's the crackpot okay Susan
man I can tell you some things that this
guy believed the floor plan of the lost
temple of King Solomon in Jerusalem
contains mathematical hints regarding
the end of the world
Moses Pythagoras and Plato had all
discovered the law of gravity before
Newton and encoded it in text to hide it
from the unfaithful the truths are
nature of nature are contained in code
in the Bible and only revealed to one
scholar in each age and a mixture of
turpentine beeswax rose water and olive
oil will cure tuberculosis and protect
you from the bite of a mad dog all right
sound very interesting so who's the
crackpot Newton Newton himself he spent
years not trying to work out gravity the
laws of motion from calculus but trying
to find it in the in the writings of
Pythagoras and Plato so I think Newton
had a lot of ideas and went through a
lot of dead ends her law failures
showing that Thomas Edison was right
when he said to have a great idea have a
lot of them and he did have a lot and
one of them was great and so I call this
who's the crackpot now the Isaac Newton
story
well we know a lot about Newton because
if Newton was alive today he'd be on a
reality show anyone guess what reality
show he'd be on the hoarders Newton was
a hoarder
Newton kept every scrap of paper he ever
wrote or even he ever received so so if
he went to the into town and bought what
did you buy in the 17th century let's
say a couple of seats of paper or a cup
he would take the receipt and he'd take
it home he'd keep it so we know a lot
about Newton by looking through all this
stuff that he kept through the year so
we just like with Darwin we know from
his writings with Newton we know a lot
and this is Newton's timeline and 65
1665 and 1666 was not his miracle year
whether or not he saw an Apple fall we
don't know he did tell the story later
so sometimes these myths come from the
person himself but he if you look at his
his notebook where he rolled on every
thought that he had he was not even
close to his law of motion or his law of
gravitation then he went on when he went
back to Cambridge to or do some other
work optics algebra and then he spent
over 10 years and then even beyond that
on alchemy and his analysis of the Bible
looking for when the world's going to
end he had a huge alchemy lab and he
owned every single book that was ever
written at the time on alchemy and when
he died he went to his grave with with a
a content of mercury in his hair that
was 15 times the healthy limit and
several times more for other elements
like antimony and lead so he was he did
a lot more work on alchemy than ever did
on physics and also on the Bible it was
to the point where it when age 40 had
Newton died this is from historian
Richard Westfall in his Newton's
biographer and Newton died in 1684 at
age 41 we would had most mentioned him
in brief paragraphs lamenting his
failure to reach fulfilment so what what
changed that well it's kind of chance a
fellow named Sir Edmund Halley of Comet
Fame dropped by and asked Newton a
question he knew that Kepler's laws
described orbits and said that planets
go in circles or ellipses and he was
wondering if you could prove that using
the idea of a force
that the ministers with the square of
the distance so one over R squared force
and and so yes doing that question
meanwhile a one a sometime nemesis of
Newton they got on each other's nerves
Robert Hooke had sent Newton a letter
saying that you could you could describe
motion in the ellipse or a circle by
decomposing it into two into two
components one is tangential which means
to say if you just if you're like
swinging something around in a circle
and you cut the string it just flies off
from that point in a line that's the
tangential motion and then the radial
motion is back toward the center so you
get a sawtooth like that but with
Newton's ideas about calculus you could
do you could do that you could make each
of those legs very very small and the
soul sawtooth shrinks down it starts to
look like a circle so that was very
important in Newton's thinking and he
refused to credit hook for it and hook
thought it was the basis of everything
that Newton did yeah and they were both
wrong really
plus 200 hours of two years of hundred
hour work weeks after all that he ended
up taking this one challenge from Halley
and turning it into what people some
people call the greatest scientific book
of all time the Principia and in the
Principia you know we learned in school
that Newton has three laws of motion but
this is three volumes about motion so
it's not just three laws of motion and
it's extremely complicated and not only
did he present his ideas and his laws he
solved dozens of problems and showed
that his theory really works here's a
few examples he of course predicted the
rate of fall of bodies but to one part
in three thousand when compared to
experiments he explained the tides
calculated the speed of sound and error
by assuming that air is made of
essentially atoms he calculated how
gravity creates irregularities in the
most from the moon and also the
precession of the Earth's axis and many
many more applications this is three
whole volumes of applications and they
were very complicated here's an example
of some pages from the book Newton
didn't use many equations he used
geometry and it's extremely complicated
and and tedious to try and understand
plus it's in Latin which is hard for me
since I I don't know any but
but just to show you how how difficult
his work was and what his hundred hour
weeks are going into so I hope I've
Illustrated that you know that yes there
is a time line of science but there's
also an idea of what real science is and
that it you know it's a group effort and
that you know it arises from skepticism
creativity clear thinking curiosity and
that we reward not just coming up with
new theories which is difficult but also
debunking old theories and over the ages
we've discovered thousands of planets
that look like Earth like that that
could be like earth and stars that are
similar to our Sun and galaxies from the
early universe the blueprint for the
human being and other animals but most
important we've increased life
expectancy life expectancy if you look
in the centuries before the Industrial
Revolution was between 30 and 40 and
then around 1800 when science started
feeding into the Industrial Revolution
and we started getting better chemicals
and medicines and machines to make life
easier and to help us survive life
expectancy has been taking a steady
climb ever since then and let's hope
that it continues and that we wake up
about some of the damage that we're
doing to our environment let me just end
with two quotes one from Albert Einstein
the most beautiful and deepest
experience a man can have is a sense of
the mysterious and then from Tom
Stoppard which I like even better it's
the best possible time to be alive when
almost everything you thought you knew
is wrong and that's the soul of the
scientist thank you
I'll take questions if there are any or
answers if you have answers will give me
the answer I'll think of the question
well with books like this but I mean the
real thing you want to do is reform the
educational system and you know science
has taught kind of like history so in
one way it's boiled down to just
headlines that make it seem like
everything was easy and came out you
know like a baby
that's full-grown right and the other
thing is it's taught like history and
you just people just learn dates and
they learn facts and they don't learn
the mystery the curiosity the the you
know the wonder of science you people
are Sciences approach as if you just
you're just learning facts like so it's
the history it's like history but it's
facts about the physical world so good
luck with that though I'm not I don't
have a lot of faith I mean it's hard
enough to get them to teach evolution in
certain places much less teach them how
Darwin really discovered evolution so
we've come quite far
you would think based on what you
presented but it seems like there's a
lot of doubters of science still in our
society and to some extent it seems like
it's increasing right are we living in a
rational time period or not what's your
take on that well I I don't know whether
it's increasing or the people have
always been this stupid but and it's
more in this country I find I'm I lived
in Germany for years and yeah it's or in
this country in a lot of it has to do
with religious fundamentalism which we
have plenty of in this country as well
as other countries but so yeah I don't
know if it if it's growing up but it was
the knowledge is out there obvious it's
published it's well both names you could
go online and learn oh yeah okay so you
can also be misinformed a lot online but
there seems to be serious doubts yeah
people write it just mystifies me so I
was wondering
I'm also you know I mean some case some
cases it's what psychologists called
motivated reasoning which means that
people when you look at arguments on
both sides but you have one side that
you prefer and even if you're sincerely
trying to judge the arguments you can't
sincerely you can't really be neutral
your unconscious mind takes over and
he'll and makes you disbelieve the stuff
that tends to be disconfirming about
what you want to believe and tends to
make you value more the evidence on your
side and that that happens a lot too but
you know on another level there are
people who just completely dismiss any
any ideas from science say I know I've
heard them on radio and TV they go I
don't I don't care what you proved it's
this way how I have no idea what they're
thinking
yeah I knew fire book about firemen
fireman's rainbow it's about when I was
first Caltech in the 80s and and I my
relationship with firemen and finding
you know his influence on me and you
know I have know a lot of Nobel Prize
winners but yeah he really was different
finding I mean when you talk to him yeah
I don't know I may be I mean that maybe
there was some hero worship and I'll put
it it did seem like you know he was
always saying sagacious things and I
talked to him a little bit about my
physics work and even though he hadn't
worked on what I was doing for many
years he had great insight and very
quickly saw through the and
always had good good things to say so
but anyway it's called fineman's rainbow
if you want to really the world are
about like the world same time why I
know I don't think we know how language
came out unfortunately since there's no
writings left behind no one really knows
even exactly when they look at the
fossils and and
the the shape of the of the throat
because I guess if you have you can make
certain vocalizations that's an
evolutionary step that's only needed for
language and so there's some indirect
evidence I don't remember quite when it
started but we don't know a lot about
that and also there's if you look at the
DNA there's certain genes that are
necessary for language but writing is
different in writing and writing as a
technology that was invented like the
wheel or fire and it came out when it
did because people were settling down
and they had they had to engage in
commerce and it's hard to run a store if
you can't if you can't have no way of
keeping track of your good so the first
writing was simply lists there was lists
of goods list of who owes whom what
lists that are related to taxation
because there was an assent relize
government that was run by the clergy
and they had police army they had to
build walls around the city because
these cities were always fighting with
each other they have to build you know
irrigation so they had to tax people and
so the writing was really very practical
for those purposes so you mentioned that
ugly human being settled down for
nourishing their spirituality for
nourishing me spiritually I mean so is
it all done or we still find in
additional spirituality is our spiritual
journey is our special journey and the
minds not about yours down finishing and
then well you know this dichotomy
between religion and science is very new
so you know the pioneers you know Newton
was did science to learn about God and
Boyle and the chemists also the same
reason Priestley was a was a clergyman
too although I didn't work at it later
but I mean Darwin I mean these are all
religious people who are studying
science to learn about the God's
creation of the world you know so I
don't I don't think there has to be a
you know any kind of split between those
two and you know I
this book with Deepak Chopra war the
world views you know where I argued
science and he argued what he calls you
know spirituality but I didn't like that
because I don't think that science
preclude spirituality but then later we
changed the subtitle to be less
combative we call it science and
spirituality but I know I don't think
that either journey is over what about
well yeah so I talked about grit and
he's got like the most screwed of
anybody is Nix he always says his
greatest quality is the stubbornness and
I can attest the fact that he is very
stubborn and of course to overcome his
disability he needed to be stubborn and
just sit but to do physics he also need
to be stubborn it's interesting in the
movie about him that just came out they
they have one of these myths that they
portray on the screen you know he's
famous for something called Hawking
radiation which is about how black holes
radiate energy and shrink and so in the
movie he's staring into the embers in
the fireplace and just like Newton's
apple whoa and then the next scene is
he's announcing that he has this theory
and that's not how it happened so you
know he was actually working on showing
something else he kind of stumbled on it
kind of like Planck did he didn't
believe it and he spent months trying to
very frustrated and upset with himself
trying to find his mistake this mistake
of this Hawking radiation that we call
now and finally was convinced that it
was not a mistake and it was all over a
long period of time with a lot of
frustration involved and a lot of hard
work and but I guess on the screen they
decided to take the easy way and have
him stare into an ember so this is the
kind of thing there were then you get
like I was you know I get people in the
audience at these live talks or on the
radio when I'm on the radio they call in
with they're just like hawking I was
looking at a butterfly going and I
realized that that that that the early
universe could have had two other
universes colliding and that
the Big Bang and then there isn't that
true you know so yeah why not if that's
all it is
so you know oh look embers glow black
holes evaporate oh yeah you know big
mitts sorry the way the benzene benzene
ring yeah yeah yeah uh I don't know I
didn't look ended up I've read that that
same story many times I think he wrote
that story too he said that
weather but they didn't really you know
have to here's an interesting thing to
really know if these are true you have
to look at the historians of science you
can't really look at popular media or
books and you'd be surprised how many
myths are false and even if they're
quoting the person now that person could
have after the fact for
self-glorification purposes come up with
the myth or they sometimes it's just
that your memory is not that accurate
and psychologists study memory I wrote
the book on the unconscious mind
subliminal and we I had a chapter on
memory so I know a little bit about that
that yeah that your memory is not a a
real record of what actually happened
your memory runs by having key words key
events stored and when you recall a
memory you're putting it back together
and when you your brain reconstructs the
memory it can seem very clear and real
to you and it can be totally wrong or a
commercially wrong and when your brain
is reconstructing it it often it's not
just an objective reconstruction you're
putting in your prior beliefs your
expectations your desires and a lot of
times things in the past get rosier and
cleaner the gestalt psychologists study
this you know how memories clean up with
time so you can remember mning that was
kind of complicated and had some
complexities you asked them a month
later and a year later and each
successive time it's all smoothed out
and much more
you know storybook like so I don't know
which what is happening when these
things happen like Darwin told the myth
Newton told the myth of the Apple so
they're not just things that people
necessarily pulled out of thin air but
but they're not you know often not true
either and in that case I have
and looked at what was done and usually
what has to be done if you really want
to know is you have to find the people's
letters and their diaries and their
papers and you have to do a lot of
reading and figure it out and so for
Darwin and Newton people have done that
I don't know if they've done it in that
case so just imagine for a second God
exists and if you've met God what is the
one question you would ask him okay
first of all if if I meet God so that
though that's a hard question for me to
answer because immediately I realized oh
shoot
my thinking has to change completely so
so now I'm trying to put myself in the
frame of going oh my god there's a God
and so what would I ask god I guess I
would ask God you know what what's the
best way for me to be happy and that's
that you know for me that's the key and
and to make other people happy that I
love so I why not a stack and everything
if it doesn't have to do with that who
cares right okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
