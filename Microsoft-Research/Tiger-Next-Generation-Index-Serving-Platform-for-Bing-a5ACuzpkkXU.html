information and a website in order to
provide paid research service is
obviously the job of being at the same
time if you need to increase the cost of
serving such big index size the cost to
business will be very very significant
the tiger project is a collaboration
between Microsoft Research Asia and SGC
a the goal of it is to improve the
efficiency of the bean long time serving
system this is a very good match to take
a research and make a big impact
Microsoft product Tiger invents a new
architecture for index serving Bing is
eager to use this new technology for
their index serving infrastructure Tiger
project is a great innovation and
collaboration between MSI and this TCA
the ideal is first researched and
validated by the Amazon team and then we
join the engineering organization and
really help us to push through some
significant execution challenges through
this kind of technology to dramatically
enhanced capacity were able to use the
fuel data center and then it will also
dramatically reduce of course over time
looking forward we see there's even
bigger potential for this new
architecture so in Tiger we not only
look at improve efficiency but also look
at new ways of processing queries and
these new ways we enable scenarios where
we can significantly improve the
relevancy of the results seen by users
they tag project leverages the unique
properties of solid state
technology or SSD this emergent
technology dramatically improves the
overall efficiency of Bin's in this
service the Tiger architecture can also
be applied to other search problems such
as enterprise search within your
organization and this could also be very
helpful for our other products
innovation is a very critical for the
success of Microsoft products and by
working with researchers we can bring
new ideas and innovation into the
products constantly and that query
improves our the user experience of our
products Microsoft research gives a lot
of flexibility for us to pursue
individual research results and also is
a very good place to turn the research
into real products tackle is one of the
best collaboration we've ever done we
look forward to many more tiger-like
collaborations between Microsoft
Research Asia and HTC a the most
exciting feeling is to see those
scientific discovery in the lab that
actually can benefit the hundreds of
millions users life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
