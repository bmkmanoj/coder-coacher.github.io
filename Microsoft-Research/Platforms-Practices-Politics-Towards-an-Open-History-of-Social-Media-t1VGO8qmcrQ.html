hi ooh like this hello thanks for coming
welcome to the first colloquium of the
spring from now on they're going to be
every two weeks so those of you who are
here know that and those of you who
aren't please feel free to keep on
coming back we've got a great range of
speakers lined up some other social
media ish things coming up but also lots
of good stuff that's not social media
today we have gene Burgess from
Queensland University of Technology in
Brisbane Australia who's going to talk
about platforms practices and politics
the three P's oh thanks short but sweet
thank you everyone for coming late in
the afternoon I'm sure you're as excited
as I am that spring is here almost as
exciting as this seminar I think so
first of all a few disclaimers as is
traditional someone ambitiously have
titled my slide and I note towards an
open history of social media towards so
notice wars or speculations towards
something like that but of course as
many of you know I am NOT in fact the
historian what I am is a person traded
media communication and cultural studies
I would say my intellectual formation is
primarily in cultural studies in the
British cultural studies tradition which
means that i have in fact throughout my
career being engaged in thinking about
history but in terms of thinking about
objects formations and what they tell us
about where we are in history so objects
for me like music scenes like social
media platforms like the iphone and a
bunch of other stuff in between but if
you look for social media history on the
internet in a using a search engine of
your choice what you'll find is what i
like to think of as host of museums
you'll see an endless procession
in in chronological order of gadgets and
gizmos usually starting but funnily
enough some of them start with phone
phreaking as the the first example of
social media so rien scribing on to the
history of technological devices
whatever desires we want to write on to
social media in the present so I'm not
doing that either today for me the term
social media becomes interesting when it
becomes a trope a dominant way of
thinking about how we connect to each
other how we represent ourselves how we
engage with the media sphere that cuts
across a whole bunch of of technologies
and forms and practices and in keeping
with this kind of cultural studies
approach to thinking about cultural
objects cultural formations as a
starting point to understand history for
the last few years I guess I've been
working with in and alongside in popular
culture what I've started to think about
as a platform paradigm so I need to just
say a few disclaimer e words about this
as well because it can too often appear
as if you are in fact doing what some
people pejoratively call toaster studies
right and so you so you say i'm studying
youtube and in fact with joshua green i
wrote the first book on youtube from
this kind of platform perspective you
say that and people think that you're
just studying technology as if
technology is just something outside of
media and culture and history and
everyday life and meaning and that's not
at all how I mean it I see platforms as
an articulation among all of those
things and therefore is a really
interesting starting point to understand
where we are in the history of media and
culture and everyday life and many of
you know when many of you will know this
work by Tarleton Gillespie on the
politics of platforms as well which is
something that I'm very I've been very
inspired by and what he does is to very
carefully unpack the various meanings of
the term platform which of course has
become a dominant term
the technology literature in popular
culture for things like YouTube and
Twitter and Facebook and to think about
all the way different meanings of this
term and the way it's deployed four
different different audiences
simultaneously almost what like what in
Australian politics is called dog
whistling right so you're saying one
thing to one constituency while just
giving enough away to show that you're
really also addressing another
constituency so in the case of web 2.0
or social media platforms you're saying
this is a platform in the architectural
sense for anybody to stand up and speak
to represent themselves while you're
also saying it's platform for developers
to build upon or you're also saying it's
a platform for the advertising industry
and all of those things are true in
different ways but crucially they can be
withdrawn at any time so there's a whole
bunch of promises out there in terms of
the affordances of platforms and their
democratic potential but these
potentials can be withdrawn at any time
so that's all the disclaimers stuff over
hopefully situates this talk a little
bit in where I'm coming from so however
having done a quick look through the
news the history of the news and
references to the term social media
there was it was a kind of a minority
term really deployed by people coming
out of alternative media and community
media for a while started to be used in
the tech and business sphere around
blogs in the mid-2000s but really where
it becomes a kind of catch-all phrase is
where we see the rise of major dominant
monolithic platforms at least in North
America Europe Australia etc like
Facebook and especially Twitter because
what we see with Twitter i think is a
convergence of what we used to call SNS
is social networking sites or social
networking services with what we used to
call user-generated content and the
beginning of my career there are
tremendous arguments in my field about
user-generated content about
amateur creativity the Democratic
potential of these kinds of platforms
and I think what we see with twitter is
a real convergence of social networking
activity interpersonal communication
everyday communication with media
consumption with mainstream media uses
of these platforms so things I think
start to get really interesting and
actually really quite mainstream due to
the convergence or the articulation
between news values major world events
like natural disasters so-called
revolutions and and riots and latterly
the last really just in the last year or
so in extreme acceleration in the big
social data market so so debates
discussions and the politics of social
media platforms are no longer even about
what happens on them or how they relate
to broader issues of media power and so
on but to do with the exploitation of
user data in a range of different ways
including computational social science
which many of us are quite familiar with
and also marketing so this is where the
term social media comes in for me so I'm
not doing really an etymology of that
term a genealogy of that of that term
but this is my starting point okay so
what do I mean by open history then
first of all I think a lot of work that
has been done in my field on platforms
despite good intentions despite real
attempts to can stick contextualize and
historic eyes the the elements and and
phenomena that understudy there is still
beat attend tendency to create snapshots
of the present that aren't really
capable of longitudinal study of serious
competitive imperative work and I think
that's starting to change so in my own
work on Twitter for example
starting to really investigate how
patterns of for example key actors in
crisis situations on Twitter how those
patterns are changing how different
roles and responsibilities are shifting
over time and there's and there's plenty
of recent work taking advantage of the
fact that pipe for these platforms have
been around for five to ten years for
examples recent work forget the name now
or people looking at the change in
people users privacy practices in
relation to facebook's privacy settings
changing beyond that kind of paying
attention to to the way that practices
change over time I'm really inspired
here by a couple of key recent works in
last year or two years from within
cultural studies so not looking
specifically at social media but more
broadly history of the internet Tom
Streeters book the net effect which
looks in a really sophisticated way very
much grounded in cultural studies and
cultural history at the at the
articulation between kind of romanticism
and capitalism and the growth and
development and evolution of the
Internet what I take from that work
especially here is that this is a non
teleological model of history which
means not simply an endless procession
of heroic inventions one after the other
and an inevitable progress but always
trying to hold open that the possibility
that things could have turned out
differently and asking us in our
contemporary research in this field to
think about keeping open holding open
the various possibilities and
conflicting desires and and trajectories
that exist at any one time of most
relevance though is this new book by
Jose a Van Dyke which combines actor
network theory and other social shaping
of Technology perspectives with
political economy to take a really
sophisticated
in deep and detailed look at the
development of social media over about
the last 10 years across key platforms
again taking a platform by platform
approach I think this is a really
important work and coming from the actor
network theory or social shaping of
technology perspective allows her to
always always always understand
causality is highly complex as
contingent as material as as much tied
up with mud with microscopic technical
choices as they are with macro political
geopolitical and economic trajectories
but I think I think that this book has
at its heart a question or a worry which
comes out of very familiar debates about
social media and the internet which is
this question are things getting more
open and more democratic or are things
getting closed down and locked up and
despite the amazing complexity and
richness and you know this book has been
done so that I don't have to do it
frankly it's an amazing piece of work
that question does bother me a little
bit that there's there's still an
either/or ism there still a the internet
is good over here or maybe it's bad over
there and in our field you know this is
a bit of an inside baseball thing I
suppose but in our field of media
communication and cultural studies
approaches there is still far too much
of that it's getting really boring so
where am I in all of this as a scholar
my interest has always been in
understanding the ways in which icts
afford constrain enable and shape user
agency particularly in regard to
cultural participation and my question
when addressing these issues of whether
things are becoming more open or more
closed door or captured by corporate
interest is a question of cultural
generativity in other words to what it
does any given platform at any given
time afford new ideas new modes of
expression and diversity to what extent
is it overtly shaping and so given that
those are my kind of ethical motivations
I suppose openness is always very
multivalent for me so I don't assume
upfront that a more hackable hardware
object is going to afford greater use
user agency because there are lots of
examples of how that isn't the case so
the position of this this sum was a you
know quite an impactful work at the time
of jonathan's it rains about the future
of the internet and how to stop it again
it's his argument that things are
becoming more closed captured by
corporate interests and therefore
lockdown and therefore less generative
he takes us is one of his core examples
Apple's iPhone and this is to be fair
before the app store and says that it's
basically a toaster it's an appliance
because you know it completely fails the
hacker manifesto test of openness if you
can't open it you can't you don't own it
there's been also a lot of critique
since then of the App Store and the the
way that Apple controls and curates and
census every new app that that isn't
allowed to be released through that on
the other hand this control creates an
environment of perceived safety that may
in fact offer a lot of comfort to some
developers and there's no arguing with
the flowering of of development that has
Colonel net platform so an example that
I have used before but I'll use again of
a platform from a little while ago is
the Kodak camera by which I don't mean
just the box but I mean the roll film
system the entire system of
distribution and development of
photographs so famously the advertising
slogan was you press the button we do
the rest so I complete and utter capture
of the prote the technological process
of producing photographs right from what
was an extremely ad hoc scientific
hobbyist maker manifesto friendly world
prior to this you just had to get this
roll film stick it in the box press the
button posted off to Kodak and they
would send the photographs back to you
this by the way perhaps apocryphal II
was an answer to market failure that the
roll film was extremely unpopular with
professional photographers and so
famously the story goes anyway that
Kodak developed the box camera and
attendance systems to actually create a
market for amateur photography that
didn't exist before highly
commercialized it completely completely
implicated with the popular magazine
media this camera the system the whole
idea of being a photographer was sold to
us through advertising very particular
versions of what photography was for
very much oriented around modernity and
the family particular constructions of
femininity and so on but at the same
time again this can be seen as a
tremendous opening up rather than a
closing down of the possibilities of
photography is my point so
a few principles i would like to lay out
for what i see going on in the history
of social media over the past 10 years
or so based on that kind of theoretical
framework i think we see the coevolution
of media business models with platform
architectures with media representation
as we saw with Kodak and of course with
users and norms it's not a simple
one-way process of invention selling and
then take up we see recursive tensions
at all steps through this co-evolution
tensions between the kind of economics
of scale ethics and governance as
platforms scale up and across national
borders for example corporate pressures
and increasingly a user activism now
with each with it each kind of step in
this coevolution and each shift in scale
and reach new problems new tensions
emerge but I want to suggest that these
these tensions these frictions these
competing understandings of what
technology is for our what in fact drive
the ongoing evolution and innovation in
this system forward so I'm going to have
a quick whiz through two platforms some
of my work on youtube since 2005 and
then something about Twitter and then
I'm going to finish up at there's no
Facebook because I should have put this
on the disclaimer side slide actually
don't really use Facebook because I
throw a public tantrum about its privacy
settings a long time ago it got printed
in the paper it's so public that I'm
going to have to really think about how
to sneak back on if I'm ever going to
use it enough to study it properly so
there you go
so be careful with you with your online
tantrums okay so 2005 is the year that
that YouTube's domain res register that
the first instance at versions of its
site or up that people started using it
its tagline at that time was your video
your online video repository which is
not that catchy but pretty descriptive
and actually pretty indicative of how
they were thinking about it right it was
just another really just another online
widget for sharing video at a time where
it was was pretty difficult laborious
for individual users to transcode upload
and publish video right it was not
really non-trivial there were plenty of
other plenty of other competing products
services this was theirs and not many
people know this although I keep I keep
talking about it in talk so I guess more
people know about every time I talk but
there are the guys actually imagined
that YouTube would be kind of like a
video dating site so you can see in the
first version of the is the first
version of the webpage available on the
Wayback Machine up the top there you're
invited to provide a username and a
password and then say I'm a male or
female seeking everyone or males or
females between the ages of the idea is
that you would basically upload videos
of yourself and people would judge
whether you were hot or bottom since the
Viacom lawsuit so much internal emails
have become available that you can see
that this is this is actually you know a
serious contender for the business model
of the site for a little while very
first video on YouTube is Jared Kareem
one of the initial co-founders who
much in line with the dating site idea
is standing in front of the elephant
enclosure at the San Diego Zoo saying
elephants have really really big trunks
and that's the end of the video so I
show this not to not to kind of mock
these guys but to demonstrate how
completely under determined YouTube was
so when I say YouTube to you or I say
twitter to you I don't mean the
technology at that stage or this stage
of its advancement I mean the entire
formation or user practices of content
of the way it's represented in the media
because whatever YouTube is now it
hasn't it hasn't become that simply
through decisions made within the
company it's become that through the
practices of collective practices of
thousands and millions of users and
media companies and now government so
moving along we see the tag line up the
top has shifted to upload tag and share
your videos worldwide so starting to get
a sense that this is a site that maybe
is going to be the site for online video
for user created content and networking
around that content 2006 as we all know
YouTube has become the online video
sharing platform really consistently in
the top 10 websites by then already
bought by google for a couple of billion
dollars in google's stock with millions
of videos uploaded and you know with the
most popular videos having millions of
views which was you know really quite
shocking quite disruptive to some of the
thinking around the media industry at
the time except i mean exceeding the
reach of a lot of popular commercial
television even at the time and all of
this activity the the number of users
different users and communities flocking
to the site are starting to produce new
genres to new media genres you new ways
of reaching audiences a new business
model is built around that content again
not pre-programmed
centrally in YouTube egg somewhere
fast-forward to 2007's and I really
started studying this thing seriously
and the broadcast yourself tag line has
started to appear at the top
increasingly users are being addressed
as audiences for other people's content
and not only I forgot to mention back
here but but there was a lot of
recruitment of users going on through
giving away a free ipod to people who
uploaded a certain amount of content and
actually at one stage i can't i can't
imagine how they actually manage this in
the advertising material but though i
actually explicitly seeking hot babes to
upload videos because there weren't
enough hot babe videos apparently so
back then despite a lot of people
thinking that youtube is stupid and
trivial on a project proper objective
study for serious scholars we thought
typically of us we would approach it in
this kind of cultural studies way saying
what is this thing how people using it
what does it tell us about where we are
in history and we start with a simple
question which was you know really how
are people using it there are a lot of
debates flying around about youtube
being good and evil and causing
cyberbullying and narcissism and it
sounds familiar right so we simply kind
of did a really big kind of content
survey of the the most 4,000 most
popular videos where popularity was
measured against some of the built-in
architectural models of popularity which
no longer exists but did at the time
some books came out of that and what we
found was that there are kind of two
nascent youtubes hustling and luckily
that insight has proven true and it
really has had some legs as we went
forward about half the content was
uploaded sorry about half the content
was originally sourced from traditional
media sources a distinction which made
sense at that time that doesn't now
either and the other half was
recognizably user-generated content
video blogs cat videos silly stunts
stuff of that nature but most of the
content at that time was being uploaded
via channels who are identified as
ordinary users so not companies not
organizations and what we see moving
through the rest of YouTube's history up
to now I think is this tussle between
these two YouTube's is ongoing even
though YouTube has since then become a
major player in the media industry a
highly formalized business as opposed to
the extremely ad-hoc informal business
that it was when it started oh sorry
this slide this this slide represents
the most subscribed channels in other
words the channels that YouTube users
are most loyal to and at that time this
was the key way that that uploaders
shared in advertising revenue and the
crucial point here is that almost all of
these channels are YouTube native right
so they're not identified with external
mainstream media brands their properties
that are built up through an expert use
of the way YouTube works as a culture
it's a cultural practice so YouTube it's
bigger and bigger and bigger becomes
starts to look like a really viable
threat to to the mainstream media and
the it starts to crops starts to run up
against copyright law as well as
international regulation of all
times it also develops country specific
sites partly in response to that also
but also in response to the pressure to
generate to segment the market and
generate advertising revenue so we get
to the point now 2011 where we're
starting to try to develop a second
edition of YouTube and almost everything
that I've just told you can't be
replicated can't be studied again
because the underlying architectures
that we use to do all that work no
longer exist because the business models
are shifted because the scale has
changed so the home page of YouTube in
the in the US this week looks like this
so massive advertising banner the
homepage is all social which means that
rather than me being being confronted
with this is what your fellow youtubers
like or or what is popular this is what
you based on your google account or
cookies should like the convergence of
commercial streaming services video
rentals and so on with user-generated
content at the same time new businesses
like next new networks which are kind of
like i guess they're kind of like are in
kind of like anr or indie labels for
user-generated content a cut an
intermediary that looks for talented
amateur video producers and grooms them
into more rounded advertising friendly
mature businesses which is this next new
networks is actually actually part of
YouTube now and YouTube's own attempts
to try to improve quality advertiser
friendliness of content producing the
all of these tutorials and material like
this which
almost always as as models of best
practice holds up video bloggers the
types of YouTube channels apps and shows
that are developed indigenously within
within YouTube right so rather than
saying you know TV show x over here is
doing a great job of coordinates content
to YouTube they're actually there's
actually a whole new kind of regime of
value a whole new set of genres that
have grown up within YouTube that even
YouTube is using to promote to
professional video producers so this
tussle between the two YouTube's the
kind of amateur ugc over here the
professional media over here is ongoing
but getting even more entangled and
interesting and just finally when I
tried to find out the most the most
commented videos or the most popular the
most of the most favorited videos today
I couldn't I can see the most video
viewed videos today which interestingly
are just you know the usual kind of
random youtube stuff on the other hand
the most viewed videos of all time is it
are an interesting combination of these
two YouTube's we've got well you all
know this here and we've still got
charlie bit my finger coming in in sixth
place so just really cute kids whose dad
happen to be there with camera at the
time now hugely mainstream pop artist
Justin Bieber who of course grew up and
produced his bit brand very much within
YouTube and then we've got j.lo and
Eminem and Lady Gaga's dropped off the
top three so that's a sign of something
in terms of where we are at history I'm
sure finally when I went to find out the
most subscribed channels this week
earlier this week wanting to find out
who the YouTube community was still
really loyal to what was going
that kind of really small subculture a
really active users who see themselves
as part of YouTube community I'm not
allowed to find that out anymore that
functionalities just couldn't been
completely removed when I go to browse
channels everything's just suggested to
me because it's being helpful it's
because it's gone really social but just
like a lot of search inquiry search
search queries these days often you're
not quite sure how it's being helpful to
certainly I'm not sure that that I'm the
recommendation that I watch a whole lot
of TED Talks is helpful to me in any way
okay so just a very quick very quick
zoom through one particular slice of
looking at the Twitter platform which is
the way that the taglines the invitation
to use is the strongest indication that
we have of what a social media platform
wants us to do with the thing how that's
shifted so back in in 2006 2007 Twitter
asks what are you doing the idea is very
short SMS like burst of of life updates
meeting my lunch at the time of course
Twitter didn't have trending topics
integrated search or hashtags are in
fact at replies or retweets of any of
those things as many of you will know
there are many competing ideas around
for how we might better organize Twitter
as it as a group because the stream was
getting just too hard to handle we
wanted more coordination one idea was
this funny thing using the pound symbol
which would the idea was would create
groups like in IRC channels
we then see mainly mainly through the
lobbying of Chris Messina and a powerful
group of digerati clustered around him
we see the hashtag take off become kind
of soft integrated into the platform and
then become very very embedded but not
without contestation not without
competing alternatives the whole whole
step step of the way we then start to
see Twitter kind of mature become more
commercial more and more people joining
Twitter just to kind of see what it's
about and we start to become a dress
more as an audience as Lucas so you can
kind of share what's happening but you
can also discover what's happening so
it's this this this relationship between
the self and the world shifts a little
bit it's not just about you and your
friends it's about you and your friends
in the rest of the world the basic
invitation to post becomes what's
happening instead of what are you doing
try to encourage people not to tweet
about their lunch I suppose and then two
years ago follow your interests today a
user not logged in will get this splash
screen where you know I don't know what
city that is does anyone know it's like
I don't know it's dead ball or you know
so some really cosmopolitan far away but
extremely urban environment huh maybe it
is a montage ring is welcome to Twitter
find out what's happening right now with
the people in organizations you care
about
at the same time Twitter again is more
and more like a formalized media company
extremely extremely big money deals
going down in relation to your data to
advertising to the use of the brand
Twitter itself is integrated into the
mainstream media you know the tweets at
the bottom of the screen all that sort
of stuff Twitter ratings for television
are now integrated into the Nielsen
rating platform at the same time there's
a bunch of controversies around at the
moment micro controversies that we
forget as soon as they've happened when
Twitter changes the interface when they
when they changed how @ replies works
changed how retweets worked API rule
changes which are of less less obvious
to the user community and often to the
mainstream media but of great interest
to the developer ecosystem that sprung
up around Twitter developing almost
everything apart from the very basic
functionality of the platform
so two points about next things that I'm
interested in doing the first one is a
project that nancy beam and i are just
starting up here at MSR we're actually
looking at peoples lived experience of
these changes in their everyday
practices and using these platforms
starting with the opportunity that some
users now have to access their own
Twitter archives for the first time
going back right to the beginning this
was impossible until Twitter decided to
roll out this service after banning
every other service from offering the
same functionality so we're going to
basically sit down with people go
through their archives with them and
talk to them about how their practices
have changed and really for me
particularly I'm interested in seeing to
what extent the externally observable
shifts in the platform and its business
model actually impact on or don't users
experiences of the extent to which they
have agency to which they're able to use
these platforms what they want to use
them for or not but finally I you know
something else i'm very interested in
investigating further and writing
something about is the big practical
challenges ahead of us given that not
only our media history but a lot of our
social history and public history is
tied up is in fact locked away in
proprietary archives which are sometimes
accessible through things like the
Wayback Machine jizz where I've got a
bunch of my screenshots from but I'm
trying to find out exactly how or why
twitter has blocked their entire domain
from the internet archive but they have
so you can't go back and grab even
screenshots of the home page it actually
also can't access any historical Twitter
data without going through a third-party
provider like netball data sift because
that's a huge part of the Twitter
business model now is selling
Twitter data so i hope i've opened up
some areas for a discussion debate
question and I think my times up thank
you for like a historical set oh yes you
might study sort of old history with the
hopeless of understanding how things
happened and just but you know if you
study like you know modern African
history or studying almost with explicit
purpose of figuring out you know
something descriptive to somehow inform
like modern political decisions in this
room I would argue rather than simply to
document what's happening and something
doesn't like social media you know so
much has happened in the last you know
34 years and there's so many people who
are desperately trying to learn from the
last 34 years explicitly with the view
of let's try to make something better
lens let's try to somehow change the
path of where things are going and
especially I mean I guess I haven't
talked too much to the social media
people in Microsoft especially being at
Microsoft I mean you're here for a
reason in some sense and I'm sure
Microsoft is hoping to get some but um
but yeah I know so if they're I guess a
concrete present yeah are you thinking
about this from refreshment prescriptive
Sam Sam Boyd and have if so you know are
there one or two lessons to keep in mind
like moving forward or you know if I was
starting some you know Twitter based
company that's gonna do something rather
you know what are the things that you
would suggest thank you
I guess there's a few different answers
so the question question is do I have a
am I doing this so that I can be more
normative and more or more prescriptive
for example and I guess this a couple of
answers to that one is that I mean like
everyone I have personal politics and
ethics and and the ways I ways I would
like to see things go more from a more
puppet proper intellectual standpoint I
hope the message would be that things
could always have gone a bunch of
different ways and and a good history
done properly not that I'm saying that I
have even done a history here but a good
history done properly should open up
that reals that says that path
dependency isn't isn't necessarily an
unstoppable force that they are options
and a lot of a lot of a lot of the way
things turned out is through accident
and lobbying but everything they're
always lessons that have been learned
and these lessons are things that one
should keep in mind you know moving
forward I mean but I mean in a really
practical day-to-day sense in terms of
like for example if you wanted to build
something you wanted to work with me
then there's lots of kind of microscopic
concrete instances where you could point
to well actually that didn't turn out
quite the way you're saying it will in
this other instance and you know
so thanks a lot it's really interesting
stuff and I like the avoiding the
toaster Museum I think it's a smart idea
my question is I can get without social
media and these words platform and
social network and online communities
and and thinking back to how we used to
talk about the internet and cyberspace
and virtual worlds and immersive
environments and and I guess one of the
things I'm wondering is that even we
have this word social media is there
something that was happening yeah what's
new you know I guess our how should we I
mean I always wonder is it where to dive
in there's a really interesting question
it seems to me because it's so part of
the question is say well just what
everybody else call social media will
call that social media but the other way
to look at it is say well what makes it
social i used to be web two point O a
while ago now it's a social and it could
easily be that the important words going
to change again but is there something
new about the social that you see I mean
this or something and I get you know say
if I were to say what one of the things
I think of it as that there was an era
of content and now there's an arrow
platform and there was a you know
consume producing some content versus
platforms for participation and that
would be a way I would think about the
difference but it starts to fall apart
pretty quick actually a particular model
and so that's a nun wondering is sort of
how you think about I guess is there a
shift with the social media moment and
if so what how do you describe that
um first first of all I hope I've
avoided arguing there's anything new
that there's a break or anything like
that it's why very careful use the term
paradigm when I'm talking about my
approach you later argue that there's a
break so if you want to say not a break
I'd be sure is interesting to me too I
think there's there's paradigms right so
of course there's a break that everyone
everyone used to talk about user created
content and participatory culture my PhD
is full of these arguments the term
social media maybe appears there
somewhere because someone at Yahoo
mentioned in a conference somewhere or
whatever
and it's but it's not just a matter of
terminology these paradigms these
paradigms kind of congeal different
academic approaches different business
models and whatever the dominant
discourses having said that I spent
quite a long time grumpily going or what
kind of media is there that wasn't
social and stuff but then eventually
give up because you want to talk to you
want to talk and make yourself
understood in a lot of other contexts so
I don't know if that answers your
question so you would say the one always
answer is that the social media is just
a new way of looking at media it's not
as if immediate media itself is changing
is that a fair characterization know
things are always changing things are
always changing I yeah I think that I
think I made the point that what I see
with the ascendancy of the term social
media alongside the focus on these kind
of monolithic platforms is a convergence
between user-generated content everyday
communication and the distributive and
connecting networks we thought of as
social networking sites within these big
companies so yeah I guess there is a
shift now socialize I was social like
Drew you were talking about how when you
were looking at things
been socialized in the sense that it was
pulling in stuff from your social graph
like not just the over art show you see
you say so i think that struck me is
really interesting because it seemed
like it is not more socialist less
social it's more personalized to you
it's more like filter bubbly and
isolated and so i guess if that is the
case like think that that is kind of
what's happening like you know you can't
see what's going on in the larger site
culture like where does that culture yes
but I mean yeah I mean that but they've
done this for the very good reason that
there has been a shift in the user base
so that the proportion of people who
want to upload stuff and see themselves
as a youtuber or a vlogger or whatever
is so tiny in relative to the rest of
the YouTube audience that they've
audience ified the entire site
experience to match so I think there is
a as these as all of these platforms
have scaled up and become most popular
and really mainstreamed there is a
reordon suffocation and so that's
another reason I think from that shift
away from the focus on user-generated
content and how much you create your
video and so on is scale
no all that stuff still there what's so
you have to be careful about not
introducing a kind of a viewfinder
problem because all those video bloggers
and and youtube communities and stuff
are all still there it just doesn't come
through and kind of the mainstream view
of the other side's not what this
YouTube is about for most users anymore
the viewfinder problem I'm sure you
thought about the word medium frosty
more than I have that's your viewfinder
right it's a its social media I have a
comic who not use that phrase he talks
about social networks because he was to
place the finder of the its structure of
what you would call the audience because
that modern audiences feel better so I
don't know to what extent to identify
with social media and what baggage you
bring from the world will commercial
world and the medium as a has
essentially between a producer and a
consumer
which is not much more about to a
traffic
I think that's a really good point I
think if I was studying Facebook
seriously in this way I run into even
more problem or problems although less
so I think as again the convergence of
mainstream PR communication for example
with facebook which you know again
originally was very much focused around
interpersonal communication and social
networks I think that I think that
keeping social networks over here and
media over here anymore is not very
feasible in any of these platforms which
is why social me is not a bad not a bad
buds word if you have to have one
something somewhat of a PR we were all
mentioned said the old world free
network world PR agency created the
stunts and the Press reported and now
the consumers create stunts media the
social media publicize it remember
eventual media report yeah agencies or
in the case of something like Red Bull
leg create the media and just skip the
whole rest of the process this was a
very sort of outsider looking in kind of
history and sort of you started out by
saying that the evolution of YouTube has
been not just governed by what it's
direct abort what its board decided one
of the things you kind of mentioned in
passing was that the Viacom case lot of
YouTube emails were released and I
presume you've got to look at some of
them so I was wondering if you could
talk a little bit about what kinds of
decisions were made within you do in
response to that oh yeah so they can how
that actually change things or retracted
questions about the internal
correspondence that was released as part
of the Viacom I haven't looked
systematically at it I had a close look
at the very beginning because I was this
is what we have little information about
and says where you this is where you see
a lot of Mythology created about the
origins of companies and the thing that
I found most
interesting was that they were kind of
it I got the impression they're kind of
sitting there going Wow people are just
uploading all this stuff and there's all
this like Family Guy footage and what's
going on there's porn what are we going
to do we're going to do with very very
little sense that there was kind of a
any cultural programming going on so
they were really completely agnostic as
to what the content was going to be as
long as there was growth and it's it's
only later when that you know that they
start to get worried as the skate as
they scale up without copyright that
they start to very softly introduce some
mainly community level features to
enable flagging porn and definition from
copyright to float porn to flow pirated
stuff introd you know being careful
about the duration of videos but it's in
response to people discovering this
thing and going off this for hadn't no
let's just Chuck stuff on it see what
happens but I would love to spend more
time going through those emails all
right we have treats outside so please
join us for a reception for half an hour
and join me in thanking thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
