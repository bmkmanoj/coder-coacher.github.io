you
alright so next up is Rafiq Rafiq has
done the most awesome i'll just let him
talk about it this is such a cool
project also in LA so all my speakers
are like design in LA so something's
going on in LA we always going on but
Rafiq is at UCLA just started teaching
there may be a week ago and welcome
thank you super excited sorry sorry for
this microphone thing I'm I'm rific an
adult and recent graduate from user IDs
a media arts department and today as a
consequences concept I would like to
show this photography it's maybe
reflecting but I am there with a short
at microsoft research summit design expo
2013 and actually that day was my one of
the important day that i would like to
show my master is a graduate student in
master of fine arts degree one of my
dream how it came alive and how that
chain my life and I like show the
process in a very quick way so I said as
a media artists in Turkey Istanbul and
like most teenage what was so fast I was
dreaming a lot about and board about
reals that we are always in and the
language we have and is like limitations
of reality and then I started like
exploring like actively photography and
then try to understand how i can create
these third juxtapositions of reality by
using visual communication design tools
and during this research to create a
graduate project I just come up with
Lebanon which one of the biggest for me
a wonderful quote that he was exploring
this in his politics of augment space
piece about the reality and how it was
like actually my biggest approach
started to merge from there and what he
was basically saying it in other words
like this along with artists can take
the next logical step to consider
invisible space electronic data flows
it's absurd than just as avoid something
that needs a structure a politics and a
poetics it was for me like a very exact
moment to understand the world and the
city is in a different in a different
perception and as an artist I was super
lucky to have like a lot of the first
contemporary art centers in 2008 in in
Turkey Istanbul
the architect was a very young and
collaborative person and my idea was
what happens if I have a chance to
create my maybe first artistic
exploration by using these left building
it's by 100 years old electronic
electric creation place in in Istanbul
so the idea was just using projection as
a tool and light as a material and the
create one of one of my first personal
approach to this idea of using I
creatures a canvas and luckily it just
helped me to meet different people for
different stays and like first
exploration with saunas layer design
school of design building in Germany and
then has a chance to go on our
techtronic as festival to to get into
the new worlds and understanding the
importance of software because each each
each performance was asking for any
software and in Istanbul I have a chance
to create my first a test data sculpture
frozen son of the Istanbul sky street
and then I just thought that there will
be a bit more to explore and decided to
move to master of fine arts degree in
the United States and I apply apply to
UCLA then start my new dream which was
the reason I was at Seattle to show so
frankly was my one of the biggest
inspirations architectural photographer
and my idea and dream was one night I
saw that if you think that just
functions in a different that is so what
happens I have a chance to heck the
existing functionality of a building
with a collaboration with a big themes
and creating a whole new software that
analyzes real-time son of the whole
flammock orchestra additionally what
happens I was always by the way truly
inspired from the musical experience in
analog and digital in any kind of but
but that was like kind of the dream that
i was there at seattle to show and and
for the dream i have a chance to create
a very short demonstration of the idea
to show how it was like working in like
on the plane like creating all the all
the visuals to show and i was the only
student on the stage that i didn't have
any professor with me and other teams
were super strong and they were like
really really very powerful and very
wonderful ideas so basically just make
these two ideas one was the interior
because I was also very inspired from
the temporal quality of spaces how to
hack that existing function and make
Energex opposition by using
now projection but maybe feature any
substance that makes that awareness and
the second idea was of course if I have
a chance to collaborate with such a
pleasure wonderful team and then I have
maybe explore different opportunities
starting from inside and get the
audience's feedback and how it was react
kind of an experimental approach um so
basically the whole space becomes like a
temporarily immersive environment by
using projection and also a pure analog
experience of sound and additionally of
course experiential in the public space
by making a clinic just an outside and
make a free public space event and
activate the space through again the
same technology so shortly after the
very great wonderful feedback from the
Microsoft Research that great day I just
started to explore of course how to do
that so I came up with to my friends and
start to build a custom software called
vvvv for it's open source free and just
we just developed this whole idea into a
one merge software that can analyze in
real time and also i get this 3d data
from the body weight gear like heard the
project and his very positive feedback
helped me to get the 3d data of the
building because it was a super hartman
remodel and then of course finding tons
of ideas how to use a procedural
procedural ideas to make a visual music
expanding cinema experience by using the
the whole space as a canvas and tons of
architectural implementations work super
hard like i have to learn how to use
five-axis CNC machine to make the
building almost hot won by 20 size
almost this this table and because his
ball was handmade and not accurate and
the idea needs a super accurate pipeline
to plug that it may work and luckily
last this summer i made this whole
system running and as like a kind of a
presentation for an MFA degree and that
helped me to of course start in if
dialogue with the LA philharmonic
because it was a running like a
prototype and then they just asked first
it's the idea by using temporal
insulation inside Paul and of course it
was another easy canvas actually it was
more challenging than the outer
experience for two reasons first of all
you're inside the
experience and you have almost no
distraction plus the software needs to
be super accurate there is no way to
behave an error and the whole
performance in analog world is like like
super perfect so it's like super super
super excited process and I never been
such in a big spaces and also a worries
it over his piece on the pic is chosen
to perform in 25 minutes it's a PEC
Estonian was the conductor if I super
open-minded and of course the process in
the hole was I won't like in 12 hours I
have to install all the thing with my
very limited time and make this video
mapping process super accurate and at
the same time get all real-time data
additionally connected was in in the
stage and dissolve with other
instruments to transfer essa Becca's
body motion into the story itself it's
all real time running a system and also
a septic I was super friendly in the
process but the idea was not using any
kind of 3d scanning or like to play 3d
tracking system that just he can veer
it's all about living the whole process
truly natural and just this old to the
tracking system like the other 110
instruments so i have a small very short
video for today how it was work and the
small system and small midi keyboard and
two laptops and lots of PCs and
projectors very short video for you
you
you
Oh
you
you
so sir okay thank you thank you so this
is the first phase of the dream and and
having like I mean this was a very
meaningful photo for me because it was
my birthday night and it was like the
night that I one dream happen and also
freaky seeing Frank gave a super heavy
and like getting his positive feedback
was another challenge and I think the
best part of my experience was bringing
architecture and music and media arts in
a one kind of an idea together with the
software and technology it was super
super experience just open a new mind
open mind my mind and to explore more
got a very well reviews and feedback
from different communities but I think
the most successful part of the process
was opening a life with our money to get
this big amount of fund from one of
their board members and 10 million
earmarked for the discovery and
innovation to make the next ten years
and and I think it was a very wonderful
collaboration so also as a media artist
I have a chance right now to open my
studio and moving Los Angeles and
working with real-time GPS data for the
department transportation and make one
of the first my permanent public art
project and thinking about feature like
how to create a heart piece that
Lauren's 15 years the date is running in
real time and like super fun part is now
starting and learning a lot and
collaborating with different artists
also another huge building another
public art project its kind of exploring
the new that idea of creating a
real-time piece for public space and
runs for a long time and I would like to
thank you so much for that wonderful day
that just helped me to start a new
carrier and thank you so much see in the
next dream
yes author is going sure so so the whole
idea was creating at 25 minutes running
a performance oh sure sorry so we have a
three super powerful product the world's
brightest projectors because the
material is Douglas fir so it needs to
be super bright to get to transform into
yes kind of screen idea and we have
three super powerful machines and that
runs the whole system in real time and a
kind of a real-time 3d analyzing system
that that transformed the whole surfaces
polygon systems intellect at performing
idea a channel of sound again in real
time and also like a connect as an
add-on that is so it's a hole like a
generative timeline that is designed
according to the notation and which I
suspect was super helpful to create this
logic and embed into the sonic
experience for us it'll be eating were
crazy alright well thank you that's
great
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
