hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
you
thanks for that so one object that you
won't find in any museum collection at
least not in the design section is the
breast pump the best examples of breast
pumps that I could find in any museum
collections I went fishing to see what I
could find were a 1920s glass pump from
the health and medical equipment section
of the Powerhouse Museum of applied arts
and sciences object just there and then
I also found a 1793 engraving from the
rare book section of the wellcome
collection a collection that deals
largely with sort of medical
anthropology and that's all I could find
and that's because the design of the
breast pump really sucks but you know
what product is more primed for our
connected and quantified future then the
breast pump particularly in the US where
limited maternity leave seems to make it
an inescapable part of being a mother so
the next speakers in this morning's
session Alexi hope and Catherine Ignacio
a co organizers of the make the breast
pump not suck hackathon at MIT which
happened sort of late last year and got
a lot of press attention as well the
hackathon responded to the headline of a
blog post on the x mother lode blog
asking shouldn't the breast pump be as
elegant as an iphone and as quiet as a
prius by now pretty far from that so and
I guess my personal connection to this
is I had twins who are now two years old
but they were born a couple of months
prematurely so even though I had really
extensive maternity leave there was
definitely a period where I was
connected to that pump and then moving
to the US and working in New York now
it's been really interesting to see how
much sort of lactation rooms and pumping
and everything are actually a part of
the working everyday experience for
American women here in the US so the the
hackathon definitely got my attention
when I saw coverage of it so Alexi is a
designer and researcher studying at the
MIT Media Lab in the center for civic
media and prior to joining the lab Alexi
worked on a multi-year project to design
build and test
a portable ultrasound machine for
midwives in low-resource environments
and this project included fieldwork and
co design with midwives radiologists and
mothers in Kenya Uganda and Seattle so
on another occasion I'd love to know
more about that project and Katherine is
an artist software developer an educator
she's the director of the Institute for
infinitely small things she offered the
performance of John kegs air cages
silence later this evening and her
artwork has been exhibited at the ica
Boston I beam and mass moca and she was
formerly director of the experimental
geography research cluster at r is DS
design and digital MFA program so
alexion Katherine I here to tell us
about how they shaped an inclusive and
critical makerspace hi there my name is
Alexis hope and this is so we're here to
tell you a little bit about the make the
breast pump not suck hackathon that we
held in September this year at the MIT
Media Lab this was an effort to have a
critical conversation through making so
there's seven of us in total who
organized the event so many of us are
parents and we're all MIT students our
affiliates and together we're engineers
artists and designers Oh breastfeeding
and breast milk are recognized as the
superior way to feed your baby there are
official guidelines about this the
American Academy of Pediatrics promotes
at least one year of nursing or are
pumping to feed your baby the World
Health Organization advocates for two
years of feeding your baby breast milk
oops and sorry I so the breast pump is a
machine that is made for extracting
breast milk when a mother or a trans dad
cannot be physically present for their
baby and so the way that it works is
that so
you go somewhere private ideally not a
bathroom floor but occasionally if you
hold these pumping your breasts at you
turn on the motor and the thing sucks
out milk which then you store and
bottles and fridge and at a later date
ideally be to your baby so the thing
sucks literally it works with vacuum and
it also sucks figuratively as well it is
nothing like the kind of warm cuddly
experience of actually nursing a baby
and sort of getting this one full
meeting so the machine sucks literally
it works through vacuum technology and
it also sucks figuratively so it's
nothing like the warm and cuddly
experience of holding another human
being and giving them nourishment and
food from your own bodies which is a
really amazing thing this is a very
medical experience you look at this
looks like a medical device the flanges
those horn thingies are cold they're
hard they're plastic it's hard to relax
and do this you have to pitch yourself
forward so that the milk goes goes into
the bottle thingy there's a ton of
little fussy parts and if you forget one
part and you are away from your home the
thing doesn't work the most systems are
not hands-free so you have to actually
be like holding these things this and
doing this and then finally there's the
terrible awful noise of being milked by
a machine which I don't know why they
haven't Minister xelement so if you
think it's not very advanced that's
because it's not and so the basic design
of the device hasn't changed if you want
to show that great image this is
basically kind of a similar image it
hasn't changed we actually found the
patent since nineteen fourteen at basic
same technology yet at the same time
breast pumps save lives and so this is
particularly the case for babies who are
born prematurely and
are in the NICU unit of hospitals we
actually haven't been able to their
mouths haven't yet developed to where
they can left onto the breast they can a
mother or trans dad can pump milk and
then you can feed a baby through the
tube and this is I mean so preemies
don't get fed formula ideally because
there's a recognized sort of medicinal
amazing sort of life-saving value of
breast milk at this for this particular
use case and then the other very common
use case for the breast pump is women
who are returning to work and so
although there are these like clear
public health guidelines as I was
explaining about this the-nonexistent
family leave policy and countries such
as the US makes it extremely difficult
for families to meet those
recommendations and so this is a public
health issue and moreover it's really a
public issue it's not just something to
me to be negotiated by an individual
woman and her machine in a private
lactation closet away from society so
here's the story so this is the story
that that brought our group together at
the MIT Media Lab we the New York Times
my blog published this article about you
know why don't we have a breast pump as
elegant as an iPhone and as quiet as a
Prius and so a number of students at the
MIT Media Lab women and men are parents
and new parents and parents-to-be and we
started meeting and formally as a little
group and saying man we're like at the
MIT Media Lab like we are in a position
to do something about this and at first
when we started coming together we were
thinking like it's going to be us who
invents the next pump so we were like
and you know imagining all sorts of like
a warm pump but pump where you can lay
down all this stuff and then
increasingly as we brought in the
conversation and started meeting with
midwives and nurses and lactation
consultants and end users it became
really clear that this was a larger
public conversation there was space here
to catalyze a larger force of creativity
and innovation
wouldn't just come out of our small
group so so after we did some initial
efforts with our group you publicize
some of that on a blog and it got a lot
of attention on social media and a lot
of emails kept pouring in and so we
thought there would be a way to include
a larger set of people in the
conversation so we decided to stage a
large public hackathon at the lab so we
had lots of critical a lot of goals that
we wanted to address through making so
for sure we wanted to critique the
object itself but we also wanted to
critique a culture that prioritize smart
dog bowls over quarter breast pumps so
that was a big part of our goal and also
we wanted to stage a little bit of an
intervention into the MIT Media Lab
culture as well so the lab has kind of
been at the forefront and innovation
rhetoric and about inventing the future
but we wanted to create a new space for
people who normally don't get to sit at
the table for conversations about
technology design so one of the amazing
things when we we first wrote up some of
our activities on the media labs blog is
that hundreds and hundreds of people
reached out to us over email with their
creative ideas for how they wanted to
see the breast pump improve and their
stories of frustration and what their
relationship was like with their breast
pump and hundreds of people at all the
emails sort of ended with thank you so
there with all these people saying thank
you for addressing this issue like even
just bringing attention to this issue as
being a thing in the first place and so
that outpouring of creativity on the
part of you know kind of these people we
had never met really became central to
our design of the larger hackathon event
and so we saved all of those ideas we've
actually created an open source
repository on github of all of those
ideas and they became we hung them on
the wall at the hackathon and had we had
people at the hackathon highlighting
them and then we also had we actually
tied the judging of criteria of the
hackathon to having to engage with these
stories and noting which problems your
solution addressed out of these stories
so we really didn't know what kinds of
things were going to people were going
to build going into it so we just tried
to get a variety of different material
so we had lots of electronic equipment
we had tubes and connectors we had
fabrics for soft prototyping we had 3d
printers and then full access to the
media lab shop and cardboard and paper
for prototyping and we also had a lot of
people who reached out to us prior to
the event in the Boston area who
couldn't make it to the hackathon but
still wanted a way to participate so we
had a lot of donated breast pumps we had
a collection bin in the atrium of the
Media Lab where people could drop off
their breast pumps and that also started
a lot of conversations with in the lab
itself oh hey what's that box and what
is a breast pump and that was again part
of our goal so hackathons normally draw
a large largely male young and child is
public population maybe that's because
if you're expected to stay overnight and
an event probably aren't the type of
person who has to put a kid to bed and
there's probably not childcare options
at that hackathon so parents don't
usually go to these types of events so
we wanted a hackathon to be a unique
space for parents to create while also
caring for their children so we
encourage them to bring their children
and also their partner or a friend to
care for them if they like so we also
had a lactation room a nursing area a
kids play area lots of toys and plenty
of snacks and so it was really a common
sight to see people caring for their
children and also I'm working on their
creative ideas at the same time and
we're pretty sure we had a Guinness
world record for the number of babies at
a hackathon and so we tried to be
equally inclusive of moms and dads and
partners and so often breastfeeding is
seen as this thing that is only the mom
and the baby's thing but we really feel
and there's actually research to support
this idea that partners and dads and the
support of an extended family and
community have a huge difference in how
long moms and babies will will continue
to nurse so these amazing teams formed
at the hackathon this is this is an
example of one of the most amazing teams
we were very inspired by well we did
have prizes there were financial prizes
at the hackathon people did not seem to
be motivated by that at all so this was
a team that formed they were called
second nature they had 30 people under
team they had an amazing level of
organization for all just having met
each other they formed like four
subcommittees each of the subcommittee's
was designing a different aspect of the
system for how a breast pump could more
accurately mimic the sucking of an
infant so they were building like a
tongue and a stomach and all of these
amazing things another really stand out
team was the helping hands team which
they actually are continuing to work
today they were building a system that
was based on compression rather than
vacuum technology and that's actually
what you do when you manually extract
breast milk is by squeezing so they were
developing a kind of bread blood
pressure cuff like bra to actually
extract breath no so I mentioned we
tried to be prepared for anything with
all the materials we ordered but people
did really surprising innovative things
with stuff they brought with them from
home so this is from the team that's
trying to mimic mimic the way a baby
actually sucks so this is part of the
baby's telling mechanism they brought
these balloons and fashioned this up and
we this is something we didn't expect
and a lot of people were using
unconventional materials that they
brought with them or found around the
lab to make stuff and I also mentioned
that we had breast pumps that were
donated by the the wider public but we
also had our sponsor companies also
we're very gracious and donated lots of
their pumps for people to take apart and
hack and do whatever they wanted with so
here's some people putting a software
control layer on top of this common pump
so that you can basically make it do
anything you want and it provides a
layer control that currently doesn't
exist and our sponsors were really very
surprisingly cool about letting people
do whatever they wanted with their
equipment so as we said one of our goals
was to take something seen as being
private individual female thing and then
use the platform and the context of the
MIT
Media Lab to have a more public
conversation so it was also
simultaneously kind of media
intervention as well and the hackathon
generated a huge amount of press in the
u.s. context in particular and what most
outlets seemed to focus on was that MIT
seen as kind of a center for male
oriented technology and engineering
culture was focusing its energy on a
design object as seemingly mundane and
private and female oriented as the
breast pump so this got written up in
Forbes The New Yorker CNN Fast Company
it was discussed on TV and the radio on
BBC World News NPR's DBC WNYC and it
went viral on social media where users
there were a lot of diverse reactions
but users applauded the effort people
offered their ideas and many diff on
many platforms and forums and emailed us
they criticized the winners of the
hackathon of a stiff virtually once the
once they got announced they debated
about whether breast pumps should or
should not suck by definition and
generally just sort of exploded in the
weeks prior and then a little bit after
following the hackathon so these are
some of the design principles that
guided the design of that so I'm not
going to go into these in detail but
we're currently writing up an academic
paper that's going to talk a little bit
more about the design and impact of the
hackathon itself but we're happy to talk
about these during the Q and a little
bit later so as probably most everyone
in the audience knows to hackathons get
criticized for failing to produce
real-world impact and so one of the
things that we're trying to do post
hackathon is really track what happened
as a result and to help Shepherd efforts
forward so we really see our shift as
organizers kind of went more into this
support and community kind of stored in
a maintenance mode and so that's sort of
where we are now but just quickly there
are some really awesome amazing things
that emerged from the hackathon that are
continuing to sort of flourish so three
of the winning teams merged to form one
sort of super team that has now
submitted their prototype into the MIT
hundred K accelerator where they stay
and to win a good chunk of cash to take
it to the next level they also have VC
interest so they are they have banded
together they're really they're really
pursuing this to the next level they're
very serious about it there are a number
of media lab students have taken it on
in classes and so there's actually a
class that produced an open-source
Arduino powered breast pump classes have
taken on the challenge there are a
couple of moments as personal decisions
that came out of the hackathon so one
woman actually decided to return to
school for mechanical engineering as a
result of participating in the hackathon
we are making the data visible so we're
doing a data story right now for the New
York Times actually on what people want
from their breast pump and writing a
research paper and our next thing as
organizers is that we're working with
the MIT hacking medicine group to
organize a maternal health a track on
their large spring health hackathon that
we expect to have over 500 participants
so we're trying to keep that momentum
going and kind of keep bringing more
people into the conversation just a
shout out to our sponsors at like Alexa
said they were super cool about us
hacking their breast pumps and talking
about how much they sucked the whole
time and that's that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
