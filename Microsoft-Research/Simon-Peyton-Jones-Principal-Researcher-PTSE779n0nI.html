group so the best way to think of a
programming language is like it's the
material that a builder uses to build a
building so the better the programming
language the more ambitious the programs
that people can build so programming
languages people are in the business of
producing better materials for software
engineers so I study a particular kind
of programming language called a
functional programming language I'm a
one of the people who developed a
programming language called Haskell so
computer scientist there's been a lot of
time studying software software
artifacts that is programs are among the
largest and most complicated creations
that human beings have ever made if you
look at a suspension bridge or an
airplane or the Empire State Building
they are big and impressive and you
think it's amazing that human being
could have designed and built that and
it didn't fall down when you look at a
Bing or Google search box it's just a
little white box in you type a query in
it doesn't look big and impressive at
all and yet behind it is this
astonishing infrastructure of software
that takes your words sends them over
the network to the right place has
gathered all the data from the web put
it in searchable form distributes your
queries among thousands of servers it's
just an astonishing achievement that it
works at all and yet it's almost
invisible so when one of the exciting
things about computer science is getting
inside these incredibly complicated
software artifacts and figuring out ways
of of managing that complexity so that
we can build software that actually
works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
