you
so I'd like to take you back a third of
the century to Edinburgh in the period I
will end by anberlin bell labs and
period from nineteen eighty two eighty
four to see some of luca's first work in
in programming languages in particular
his work on ml so the to set the scene
Luka arrived well first of all around
1978-79 the LCF system with ml as a
matter language was released and the LCF
and ralphie f book was published by
springer in 79 Luke arrived as a
graduate student 78 is that right not 79
hmm can't remember anyway I know you
were there in 79 I have a picture so
around the same period rod bursal and I
were working on the language hope and a
rod bursal and Gordon Plotkin moved from
Ho Park Square in the school of
artificial intelligence down to King's
buildings in the computer science
department to be with Robin Miller and
his group and and together they began to
plan the laboratory foundations of
computer science hello CS okay so look I
decided that ml was a nice programming
language and had potential and he showed
his interest by deciding to build his
own ml and so he called it backs ml I'm
sorry I'm in the wrong slide back up
this is just the usual summary of a few
of the main properties of the original
LC FML I swim type inference some funny
conditional looping constructs failures
and failure trapping products and sums
let ref
so that's about all you need to know
about ml in the original lcf system the
implementation was the whole system was
in Stanford Lisp ml was translated into
Lisp and then that list code was
interpreted so this it was pretty slow
and one of the kind of interesting
things is that the parsha was written
based on bond pratts precedence parser
or siegel parser and i had the peculiar
property that was hard to reuse symbols
for multiple syntactic purposes and
hence you get things like comma used for
pairing that means you have to use
semicolon for this separator that means
you have to use semicolon semicolon for
statement separator so there's some
peculiarities based on the fact that we
didn't really know how to parse and we
accepted this quick hack by from Vaughn
Pratt anyway so Luca arrives and
sometimes 1980 starts thinking about his
own ml compiler and is essentially zone
variation or dialect of ml he had a
working the first design documents that
i have found her from late nineteen
eighty including a description of the
his functional abstract machine he had a
working compiler by the end of the 81
and it actually started to be
distributed in 1981 there was a five
page text document called ml changes
which was the initial description of the
language in terms of how it was
different from the LPF ml which was also
called dec 10 ml because the LCF system
ran on deck can and lucas ran on the
backs so the implementation well that
language innovations included labeled
records and variants and the interesting
thing about these was that they were
purely structural you didn't need to
create or declare wreck
types all the record types just existed
and Luca mentions that his way of doing
records and variants was partially
inspired by Gordon Parkins domain Terry
lectures he had an interesting kind of
algebra of declarations with the certain
declaration Combinator's he had a ref
type replacing the letter F declaration
construct from LC FML he had a basic
kind of stream IO with bi-directional
streams and he had a interesting module
system so in terms of the compiler it
ran under the vax VMs system it was
written entirely in Pascal Luke assures
me that there was not a single line of
assembly programming in the system and
he used the Pascal's unsafe record
construct to allow low-level
manipulation and generated native thats
code and that meant that it ran orders
of magnitude faster than the LC FML and
that was major point in proving that it
was a general-purpose language and there
was an interesting piece of technology
having to do with the serializing
internal data structures and writing
them out and this was used in the module
system in particular and as I said it
was distributed to users starting in
nineteen eighty-one and by the end of 82
I think there were a couple dozen sites
scattered around the world that had
copies and were running a backs ml okay
so oh I should mention that this is not
as we've heard from Gordon at the same
time Luke was writing his PhD thesis on
sticks and stones and so this was a side
project and another side project was
that he wrote his own scribed like text
formatter to write his thesis in and he
wrote some of the ML documentation in
this and apparently Kevin Mitchell says
you also wrote a planetary simulator yep
so he had lots of spare time lots of
spare time okay that should have told us
something so in April 82 Luca finishes
his thesis and immediately comes to Bell
Labs no vacation or anything gets right
into first porting the compiler from vax
VMs to unix and it's still written in
Pascal as before although parts of the
compiler that constituted more less than
runtime got translated into C and that C
code apparently is the only piece of the
system that still exists i had a
printout in a file of the at least part
of the the c code where the compiler so
that's frustrating thing about these
historical investigations is that code
doesn't last very long and so it's very
hard to find fine code days so what did
what did this do well obviously the
first thing was it showed that ml could
stand on its own as the general-purpose
programming language and it could have
an efficient implementation and it also
created the impression among some people
I'd mentioned bird suffering that there
was a worry here that there might be a
forking of the ml community and there
might be a division of work between
different dialects etc so murdered
talked to Robin melanin and convinced
him some sometime in the fall of 82
probably
that he should maybe try to lead an
effort to bring everything together into
a standard ml noble purpose and of
course it also inspired features of
standard ml and acted as an immediate
precursor and as we'll see prototyping a
test bed as well okay so the standard ml
design proceeded in a series of meetings
in the spring of 83 84 and 85 and Luke
Ablett was able to attend the 83 meeting
and the 85 meeting and I kind of served
as his representative at the 84 meeting
this led to a bunch of drafts all this
material I've got for instance 21
different design document drafts and I'm
going to put them all on to a standard
ml history website that already exists
in a very small way at all it has right
now it's my paper for this this meeting
but that will be at standard ml Oregon
and starting around 1986 Robin and
Mustafa is a PhD student and Bob Harper
at that time we started working
intensively on drafts of the formal
definition that was published in
nineteen ninety okay so meanly a vax ml
started moving toward the standard ml
design adopting features through late 83
and 84 early 84 and so it became
prototype meanwhile there was something
called edinboro standard ml which kevin
mitchell alan my craft and others
developed a Denver where they basically
translated Lucas compiler into its own
language so it was a self bootstrapping
version and that
also became a major prototyping vehicle
during the standard ml design and that
is also poly ml that Dave Matthews
derived from his poly compiler ok so the
inheritance the the record construct was
adopted more or less directly with
slight notational change labeled sums
were subsumed into the algebraic data
type notion that was inherited from hope
the declaration structures versions of
eng kandynce and rec 3 of the the
Combinator's remained in standard ml the
ins became local the local in construct
and anchors just sequential composition
the ref type construct was adopted
although it took about 15 years for us
to decide exactly how it should type
check that was settled in the SML 97
design the stream stream io introduced
by Luca he iterated his design a couple
times and then kept being further
elaborated and the module system was
superseded by my module design meanwhile
on the theory side I should mention that
he wasn't entirely idle he also wrote
this interest in paper which is probably
the one of the main sources of the
theory of object-oriented or type
systems for object-oriented languages I
semantics multiple inheritance that's
basically the record subtyping paper and
then he moved on continuing to work on
other languages amber and squeak at Bell
Labs and then went to Dexter Konquest f
sub oblique modular 3 and etc yep so
that's about it it was in a very
important stepping stone toward toward
standard ml and lasting language
implementation
federate cetera ok so I'm finished</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
