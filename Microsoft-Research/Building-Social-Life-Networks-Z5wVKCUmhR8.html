you
I
first introduced ramesh dementia is the
entrepreneur social and also anteater he
is a fellow of Isis are to be a theme
and many other organism and professor
from University of California to man and
llama she has founded a multiple
companies and he still running some
company you know and that place were you
are ready for work commission thank you
very much if what I am going to discuss
with you today it's something that I'm
very very excited about but these things
are not very concrete these things are
in their little early stages of what we
are we started doing and as usual they
are the real work is done by some other
people i only talk about it so the
people who heard then the real work it's
vivek singh who finished his PhD and is
now at media labs at the MIT mingun GAO
and she also finished her PhD and the
seed is now at Google and I have sleep
and pump I'd set and knowledge al ahly
who world is still very actively working
on this project so these are the people
the problem that we started thinking
about and we wanted to solve is one of
the most fundamental problem how do we
connect people to resources and in
trying to do this you have to consider
the three very important factors how do
we connect people to resources
effectively efficiently and promptly in
given situations as you go forward I
will explain this slightly more details
and these things are extremely relevant
for building new kind of social systems
we are all going through that starting
from social networks to all kind of
sister
that we are seeing nowadays are emerging
and we continue to be designing these
systems so the issue that starts
becoming is when we start looking at
this what are the important things that
are happening to me the first and the
most important thing is happening is
that now social observations are
possible earlier when social science we
will try to study any phenomena there
was enormous amount of latency there was
no data available now enormous volumes
of data is being available it's becoming
increasingly available and importantly
there is very little let em c is now
they're so that's one very important
thing because of the first thing now we
can start using feedback in social
systems we can start designing systems
that will have feedback and that has
very significant those things available
from our perspective as computer
scientists and researchers in certain
areas it appears that in order to
connect people to require resources one
of the most important thing is situation
recognition because in any given
situation you want to connect correct
people to correct resources how do we
identify who really needs what kind of
resources and where are those resources
available this can only happen in given
situations so that is becoming the
important thing and much of the thing
that we will discuss today is going to
be related to the third point what we
have started doing this everybody talks
about Big Data nowadays so this is
obligatory slide that I need to put
these are the three important aspects
now I will not worry about the volume
everybody knows there is lot of volume
coming in but the other two important
aspects that are very important
were really utilizing big data a are
variety and velocity and this is where
our focus is going to be yes as you will
see is this becomes the most important
thing now one of the things that we are
trying to do is to solve some real-world
problems because when we are talking
about connecting people to resources
these things are all happening in the
real world in physical world and when we
are trying to do this the most important
thing becomes how do we model the world
there are three important things that
happen in the real world that we need to
consider number 1 theta that's why we
are worrying about these problems
because we start collecting data from
different sources and start using this
but what do we do with data is to find
out what are the objects in this and
many of you who have been working in
multimedia or computer vision and all
these kind of things have always been
worrying about object recognition and
things like that the next thing that
becomes equally important is what are
the events taking place and what are the
relationships in different objects and
how they are evolving this is a very
important thing to consider because when
you think about modeling the real world
as you possibly remember when you
started learning mechanics is you
started learning statics and dynamics so
when the Newton was trying to come up
with principles of mechanics he realized
that in order to model the world you
have to deal with the statics and
dynamics which are very closely related
but they are not the same thing by the
same token when you are dealing with
computer science there are objects and
events they are very closely related
they cannot exist without each other but
they are different they are fundamental
characteristics that have to be
considered and that have to be more aged
and so far in computer science we have
dealt a lot with objects we have not
learned how to deal with events as
effectively so a long time ago we
started dealing with events and started
trying to see and how do we deal with
events and in that prayer thing the
first thing that we need to realize is
the type of event that we are going to
discuss today for solving this
particular problem they take place in
the real world okay and these events are
being captured using different sensory
mechanisms this is very important point
because in multimedia when we are trying
to deal with or with all these devices
that we nowadays start using these
devices that are bringing us to the real
world there are many different types of
sensors they are all trying to capture
the real world none of the sensors
whether it is camera whether it's
microphone whether its GPS or any other
sensor none of the sensor really
captures the event completely it only
captures some aspect of the event so the
information that being captured by any
sensor is incomplete it's been many
cases right information but very
incomplete information so in order to
capture the event completely you have to
capture this event from multiple sources
and you have to combine those things so
if you think that you can analyze what
is happening in this room using only
video stream you are wrong you can never
do that you have to consider it helps a
lot of other information sources and
then only you can do that so this is a
very important thing and that's why when
you start considering events one has to
realize that events create context and
that's the very very important aspect
because you want to connect people to
things you want to connect people to
places at particular time what kind of
data
is coming how one event is related to
other event and all these kind of things
so that means when you start considering
this for representing an event you have
to consider these six facets very
carefully and these six facets are time
location but then informational aspect
this is what in computer science we
always like to do that extract the
information who is the person what is
the relationship between different thing
when this particular event takes place
and so on but in addition to that
experiential aspect becomes extremely
important under experiential aspect as I
mentioned to you you had different
sensors each sensor is giving you
partial information at one time we
wanted to get rid of the signal as early
as possible we wanted to process it and
throw it away because we didn't have
memory to store it but now he storage is
dirt cheap you start destroying
everything so follow that philosophy
just start exploring all the
experiential data all kind of sensory
data that is coming in and from this
data depending on the different
requirements you started extracting
these informational aspects of this
thing the other things are how events
are related to each other and what could
have caused this information this is
mostly dealt by ontology and knowing
more information about this causality
the most difficult thing is to extract
okay so effectively when we start
considering this we all know we have
been designing lots of very complex
systems like this and we are now talking
about one of the most complex system
that you can think of and you may be
surprised at my saying but this is one
of the most complex system that people
are trying to design because this is
going to work in real world in with
different types of people under
different conditions how do we deal with
this when you start analyzing either
this system or that this system
system is very simple environment not
very complex very simple environment and
this is extremely complex environment
when you start thinking about designing
these systems the most simple thing that
you learnt at one time is this principle
that all these things use real-time
feedback and feedback is the reason why
these systems can work so what happens
in these systems very simple principles
the simple principle is you always know
what is the desired response by the
system but in order to accomplish this
desired response you are always
monitoring what is happening at this
particular moment and this is being
considered here you generate the error
signal what is the discrepancy between
the two things and based on this because
you have the model and you understand
this you have the actions that are
designed to be applied based on this
error signal they are applied there
could be noise coming in all kinds of
disturbances but these things can be
handled very easily because of the
feedback mechanism because at every
moment where this is happening so that
has been the reason we have been able to
design extremely complex systems and we
can go further and they keep designing
this complex system when we start
thinking about this they are three comp
effectors in this you have to know what
is the desired state then you have
system model and the control signals and
finally you have to know the current
state for applying feedback yeah and
based on these things we can start
designing this I can get into what are
the detailed implications of this but
that will not be of great interest to
this particular group and but the
important thing to remember is that
signals could be very noisy anything
could be a all kind of uncertainty could
be there
these systems work for one simple reason
and that is this mechanism of knowing
where you want to go and knowing where
you are this is the simple first
principle in AI that I studied when I
have took my first course in AI but we
always forget about that we get
fascinated by all other simple component
we forget that this principle of knowing
where you are and where you want to go
taking the difference between those two
applying appropriate rules to get where
you are we always forget so the
important thing is now that we always
talk about this big data and data is all
available that means effectively we
start talking that this can be done now
earlier this could not be done of course
whenever you are designing a system if
you don't know what this is then you are
wasting your time and all the resources
you have to know this you have to have
idea about this kind of things the
biggest problem that has been always
there is this particular loop so the
issue is how do we go there that's all
kind of data available now and when you
have the data there is always this very
interesting problem depending on what is
your background which field you are
applying your techniques people did
consider that you always go through a
three-step cycle in many communities
they call it observe recognize and act
what is happening is that you first
observe the data based on our
observations or based on the data that
you are seeing you apply different
recognition techniques and then based on
that you perform some action most of the
time we in multimedia or computer with
an have been dealing with observe and
recognize now all kind of recognition
techniques and if we complete this cycle
and come here then we start generating
knowledge this is what part of machine
learning techniques are starting to do
this when you are given big data you
want to recognize objects
but you can now we start recognizing
situations and that's what we will be
talking about and in terms of X and you
can not only do the planning but you can
start doing real-time control and when
we start talking about real-time control
then we start thinking can we really
apply these engineering principles to
social systems is it possible to do that
and I started thinking few years ago
that it's worth trying we may fail but
it's worth trying to see what could be
done and what could not be done and
that's what we are trying to do one of
the things that all of us are familiar
with our social networks yeah and the
social networks where started being
designed and became so popular only for
one simple reason what social networks
do is basically social network connect
people okay they you can have different
types of social network which are
symmetric or asymmetric Facebook is a
symmetric network in order for me to be
your friend you have to accept me as a
friend or it could be asymmetric
networks like Twitter where I can follow
you but you don't have to follow me yes
the all this kind of relationship you
can design different conditions there
and you can put together different types
of network but the question is are these
things meeting everybody's requirement
what kind of things are needed so when
you start looking at this you look at
the Maslow hierarchy most of you may
have heard about Maslow's hierarchy
because this is one of the most famous
thing from the social sciences that for
every human being you have these
different levels starting from basic
needs that are food security sex and
things like that to accomplishing
self-actualization or nirvana so these
are the different steps that you go
through
you start thinking all for human beings
all these things are essential we have
developed social network where do they
fit in so you start looking at that and
you find that social networks really
deal with the top three levels they help
you with your ego they help you with low
end belongingness and this of course is
if you do the job right possibly you
start going towards doing some exciting
things but they don't do anything for
the lowest level Louis two levels so
much of the social sciences though they
sometimes address these issues but these
are the most important issues for human
being can we start applying some things
that will help us do this kind of thing
and for that you start thinking that now
in the word we have all kind of things
available we have web and we are feeding
information from all kind of sources
starting from satellite collecting data
to all internet of things like putting
sensors in all the devices including on
us in terms of mobile phones and things
like that you can we start considering
all kind of applications that are going
in the mobile phones and these
applications that you put on the phone
and you use are extremely important and
how many of you have used the system
card ways w a GE anybody use the system
now have you heard of the system no oh
my gosh what's going on in this part of
the world way wage is a company that
started in Israel and just 15 days ago
it was acquired by google for more than
a billion dollars yeah it is a real-time
traffic system yeah and it is pure
crowdsourcing based traffic system it
tells you exactly what will be the speed
what is the condition of the road I
cannot live without it whenever I am
driving
I have to have the system on and in fact
it becomes very interesting because
initially my wife will say you are
always crazy with these gizmos but now
as soon as I get in the car she will say
they turn on your ways because it will
tell me what is at what speed the
traffic is moving for the next five
miles or anything it will tell me if
there is an accident if accidentally
there in which particular Lane is the
exeunt is if there is a particular
object there or a police waiting with a
speed trap you know all this kind of
information and it is done basically as
soon as i turn on my phone sistar system
starts collecting information from me
and aggregate this influence but we will
come to that later on yeah so all these
kind of things are happening in social
media we are collecting all all these
kind of things so these are all
different kinds of sensors they are all
feeding into the web can we use these
sensors and start designing something
that we started calling rightly or
wrongly social life networks yeah there
the basic idea behind social life
network is what we discussed can we
connect people to real world resources
effectively efficiently and promptly in
given situations that means what we want
to do is we want to design this kind of
things that there are people they are
trying to get information people are of
different kinds they are government
agency that could be feeding information
there can we detect different types of
situations based on this and they start
connecting people there could be expert
that could be feeding into this so can
we create a network which add not only
the sensing devices but all these kind
of things there and if you want to do
this what do we need to do what we need
to do is for this we had to collect all
the information from all kind of sensors
that is coming in after aggregating that
thing we have to detect the situation
and then send the information there so
what I am going to be talking is what is
really required into this and these two
are the most important
different steps aggregation and
composition collecting information from
all kinds of sensors all our
heterogeneous sensors collect all the
information how do we detect situation
from here and then these things are easy
they have been done by social network we
will so I will not touch those things
there so as multimedia or computer with
and researchers if most of you are in
that area we have to understand what is
the interesting things going on so when
you start looking at this we have been
dealing with pattern recognition or
object recognition and all this kind of
things for quite some time and when you
start looking at this you start looking
at something very interesting that you
can consider that there are these two
important aspects time and space if time
it's sending then you say that there is
a dynamic thing so video is dynamic if
you are looking only at a picture it's
static the similar thing you can start
considering if the system location
unaware or location aware then you start
considering whether you are going to be
dealing with only one medium there so is
the data text or images or video so in
the last century we mostly dealt with
this kind of situation that we wanted to
deal with objects in photos okay if you
wanted to have multiple objects in the
same photo you started calling it seemed
classification or scene recognition you
start even calling it concept
recognition in their images if you help
the video then you start trying to
detect visual events and if you are
location-aware then you start finding
out trajectories how the objects are
moving and things like that so this is
what we have been doing in concept
recognition when you start looking
looking at the history of these things
this is what it is started you started
initially with object because you had
only pictures it was difficult to even
restore a picture then you went to the
scene recognition slowly you started
going to the trajectory event and it
first time somebody talked the whole
situation was Dick Mons
when he was trying to design this ought
to know what scars yeah but after just
mentioning the term nobody did any
research in that area for quite sometime
this century when we started looking at
this situation things change now we are
dealing with heterogeneous media all
kind of sensors GPS your accelerometer
to your temperature to all kind of
sensors are coming in if you have
literally millions of types of different
sensors and when you start considering
this kind of things then you'll find
that the type of things that you will
have to start recognizing are these
things he does you start talking about
real world object you are not only
talking about how this particular object
looks in pictures we are talking about
the real object like this so you will
start talking about your skillful
characteristics in all other forms and
the same way you start considering all
these kind of things so effectively you
start talking about what are the real
world objects what kind of environments
exist there what are the activities and
finally when you start considering this
how situations are evolving yeah one
very important thing that we start
recognizing when we are dealing with
this kind of data that every kind of
data is data when we start talking about
data and metadata we are introducing a
caste system in the data don't do that
every kind of data is data in some
situation one kind of data becomes
important in other situations and other
kind of data becomes important yes so
you consider that and then based on that
you start trying to analyze the things
so the first thing that it starts coming
to mind is that if we are going to talk
about situations as I said will be
important what is situation you can go
through many different definitions and
all this kind of thing we make while
doing research in this compiled
something like 50 different definitions
of situations that people are using in
real fields they differ
and he extracted those things to come up
with this definition that is that we
started calling computational definition
of situation and that is basically in X
enable abstraction so you want to take
some action yeah so the situation should
be defined but because you want to have
that particular action it should be
based on observed data so you have some
data the data is a spatio-temporal yeah
related so you have to consider a time
in space very importantly so if you can
do this then you say that you are
starting to do situations the type of
situation that you start considering
could be very simple like somebody
suffering from energy so today is a very
bad day for energy type of thing so for
energy and a stoma and we develop
replicates and for that so you will see
that there could be flood there could be
different types of and the flood could
be increasing decreasing would be really
bad and you could be stuck in that
situation how do you deal with that i
will show you an application that we
built for this kind of thing traffic
applications we are i mentioned wage
system somebody in our lab is trying to
explore some applications towards this
so when we start considering this
situation this is how you start finding
out let's skip this and go to a simple
example yeah suppose that you know that
there is a person salting that's an
event you can start considering this at
a particular location at a particular
time a person is Saudi but if you find
that they are 1000 people distributed
somewhere and they are salting now if
these 1000 people are all over the world
if you consider next ten minutes and you
count how many people are shouting and
they are distributed all across the
world you will say nothing is happening
but if all these 1000 people are in
building 99 okay then you know something
is happening that could be good that
would be bad but you know that there is
something happening
so effectively what it starts happening
is that you start aggregating these
events in space and time and if you can
start doing this then you start finding
out what kind of events could be
happening same thing can happen here
that one person is complaining about flu
nothing big deal this person is
suffering from flu but if 1,000 people
are lots of people start complaining
about flu in bellevue there is some
epidemic going on here so effectively
what you start doing is that you start
considering that there is massive
streams of data at all locations that
are coming in and you want to try to
analyze those you want to detect events
in individual streams from those
individual streams you want to start
combining heterogeneous streams and
detect what kind of events are going on
in real world and then from there you
want to start detecting situations and
this is very interesting now because as
you know there are billions of disparate
kinds of sensors that are being placed
everywhere if nothing else you are
carrying this phone and this phone has
number of sensors and those number of
sensors is continuously increasing
people are putting all kind of sensors
in this kind of thing and how many of
you have started reading this kind of
devices see the agency at least one
person is there at all they are crazy
people like me who are putting on one
two and three devices it's there so the
variable computing and all these devices
are also including yeah so effectively
what's happening is that you are is
going to start collecting data from
different sources of different kinds and
it has very serious implications okay
because each sensor detects some basic
events so the important thing becomes is
how do we combine these micro events and
make them useful yeah because when I
showed you these three sensors on me
the in fact each of these has multiple
sensors so between these three they are
at least ten sensors that are there in
each sensor they are micro event that
would be detected how do I start doing
something with this how do we do the
following thing that in place of putting
a video and this video camera trying to
determine very detailed thing who is
walking and who left the back there and
all this kind of thing that's good
that's important but equally important
is when it detects some simple micro
events and that is a blob in this thing
was moving left or a blob in this thing
was moving right and things like that so
it is can you start detecting those
microwave events and if you start doing
this very important things Emil's this
is throwing a camera in a second same
surveillance camera that is put in the
very close to my office there and this
so the activity that's going on you can
very clearly see the days inn in this
thing at what time people are coming
what time people are going etcetera
etcetera so you can start putting all
all these kind of things which are
purely based on this this is not the
first time that we are talking about
this going from micro events to
situations has been a very popular area
so for example in case of economics 2005
nobel prize was given for analyzing
micro motives and macro behavior yeah
and we all know thermodynamics
thermodynamics has been used to
understand particle behavior and from
there how do you go to the bigger
behavior and so on so this kind of
things have been going on all the time
so coming back to our thing when you
want to start detecting situations there
are two types of data you will be
dealing with I will not discuss all the
things but basically static data that is
kind of fixed things that this
particular room is there this is the
structure of the room this is how tables
and chairs are laid out and these
sensors are here and all this kind of
thing
but then this dynamic data could be
related to type of diseases could be
related coming from Twitter etc could be
coming from different sensors could be
coming from mobile phones and things
like that so you you start considering
this kind of data okay so when you start
considering this you have to consider
something very important that from here
this all this data is being connected
and we want to design a system that will
use feedback to do this so what kind of
accents have to be taken if you want to
understand this the most important thing
is to consider what is the social
structure in social humane society we
have different kinds of organizations
each organization can help multiple
people in these things that means
ultimately this person if I want to take
some particular actions here really
there are two ways to do this there
could be a top-down approach in this
case it appears Baltimore but the top
down approach where society decides and
make some rules or we can provide
feedback to individuals that will be a
kind of bottom of approach so you start
changing behavior of each person or I
start telling each person to take
particular actions and you have to
combine both these approaches in order
to do this this kind of thing when we
try to do these systems what are the two
important computational problem the
first thing becomes data ingestion data
is coming from different sources these
sources are very very different
temperature measurements may be
available on the room basis or on the
county basis or on the country basis or
whatever pressure measurements could be
available at entirely different is all
listen they could be coming at different
time intervals and all this kind of
thing how do we do this equally
important becomes is a stream processing
engine as I mentioned they are literally
billions of these streams that are being
generated they are continuously coming
how do we analyze those
and try to do something meaningful with
this so that we can start doing
situation recognition and this situation
recognition unlike the earlier databases
if you go back to your database
knowledge you find that in originally in
databases the idea was that data is
sitting in the storage and somebody is
asking your query and you are getting
the answer the current multimedia system
current video systems are all like that
the video is had been collected and then
you say I want to find out this thing so
you go and analyze look at the data and
get the result but about 10 15 years ago
in database also they started thinking
about stream processing they started
thinking about continuous data where the
model is completely different now you
assume that in the first case in the old
databases data was fixed in the query
was coming so credit worth changing now
what you start doing is sent the problem
completely you say my queries are fixed
I want to know whenever flood is going
to be here I want to know whenever
energy situation is bad and so your
queries are fixed but the data is
continuously changing data is coming and
going so you are dealing with the
extremes yeah and as soon as you start
considering this this aspect becomes
very different okay so we started
looking at that the other very important
thing that starts happening is that here
now you have to start considering that
this term stts is transformed space time
and theme you are collecting information
for example I have been saying flood or
I have been saying energy let's consider
energy for energy then no sensor that
will tell you that today is very high
energy environment or bad day for us
some of you but there are sensors that
will measure different kinds of pollens
they are sensor that will measure
different kinds of pollutions they are
sensor that will
measure how active I am that will
measure where I am now all this
information has to be collected from
here and this information is coming from
different types of sources so
effectively I consider a particular
location at a particular time and for
particular application I have to select
these different sources and decide which
source is going to contribute
information combine that and use that
thing so effectively this is what it
starts happening that I have this
situation there so I have all this kind
of different things happening in the
world I consider a particular location I
all these sensors and for this sensors I
collect the information that is
represented as a particular point here
when I do it for all the things I start
converting this image to this now once I
have this situation there then I can
start converting it to feedback loop I
have the goal and I can start sending
these signals this is what the system
has to be there when I am trying to do
this another thing that I need to do is
I have to consider each individual
because as we will see in a minute the
actions depend on each individual so I
have to consider each individual and
again for the individuals I have to
consider a similar kind of sources so
when we start designing these frameworks
basically without going into details
these are the three important things
number one how do we model the
situations based on this how do we
recognize the situations you will see a
direct parallel with all the things that
you have been doing in any kind of data
and understanding you have to have
models whether you get these models
through learning or somebody specifies
those models once you have those models
then you develop the recognition
techniques and once you have the
recognition then you can start taking
the actions so these are the things what
do we do basically how do we start
collecting and recognizing situations
globally and how do we start applying
this at the local level that so
effectively in a second you will start
seeing that you start combining
information from multiple sources to
find out what is happening at the
country level and now when an individual
comes you look at the individual
situation where the individual is what
is the behavior of the individual
combine these and define the rules and
take the axles so in order to do this
how do you start representing this data
luckily for us if you have been working
in computer vision or video one very
important thing is we are using a very
good representation because the grid
representation don't think about the
image representation but the grid
representation represent the real world
whether it is two-dimensional grid or
you can go to three-dimensional grid you
can consider a grid at different
resolution level and so on but that's
why people have started putting all kind
of what they call the thermal
representations or temperature maps or
heat maps or whatever time you start
using this starts happening so you can
come up with the representation of these
things the first experiment that we did
was very interesting it was purely based
only on Twitter and that's what
convinced us that we can do lot of these
things what we did was three years ago
then we started collecting the tweets
and we collected this is sewing from
zune 2nd 2 jun 13th density of tweets
from different part of the country as
you start looking at this you see that
there is some activity the activity
keeps on increasing and it becomes the
maximum here on jun 8 and then it starts
going down yeah so you immediately know
that there was something happening and
something happened on this particular
day whatever happened was that iphone 4
was announced that day okay so everybody
is anticipation is building up and then
slowly this is
IDK okay so you can say okay this is
good that's what twitter is doing
through trend analytics and all this
kind of thing then you can do something
very interesting from here okay what you
can do is the following thing this is
what those tweets are on different days
I can start aggregating those tweets and
I can start representing all over the
country this map that how much interest
in which part of the country is there
for iPhones now I had represented this
here I know where the retail stores are
these retail stores I can consider they
call it store catchment area that means
this store can serve in its vicinity
this many people okay so you consider
that do the convolution of this and this
represents the given stores can serve
this kind of people you take the
difference between these two things and
you say this is underserved interest
areas okay now if this is the case and
you know they store catchment area
formulas you can decide where you need
me to put the new stores so effectively
in order to put the new stores you could
be just monitoring these things and
based on the current knowledge of this
thing you can immediately decide that
this can be done now this was for iphone
we are using the similar principles for
deciding where should we put the new
shelters when sendy storm comes in or
when earthquake hits a at some
particular place etcetera because
principle is exactly the same so this is
what he starts happening that means what
we start doing is effectively the idea
becomes that you have raw data streams
coming in you start converting them to
this stt data and then you start
combining those things and start
representing the application oriented or
what we call dometic maps and from the
schematic map then you apply the
situation recognition techniques and
classify those things yeah so this is if
you go back and you will see that this
is taped to this state
is exactly same as you have been doing
in computer vision etcetera the earlier
steps the are because we have
heterogeneous data you have to map the
data that convert the data into unified
format and things like that but now we
start considering what kind of
operations are required and you start
analyzing and you find that there are
different types of operations and these
are some of the operations are purely
database type of operations some of them
are purely computer vision type of rain
we have used lot of opencv operations in
this particular case but once you have
that you can come up with this kind of
rules so based on this in fact minge and
Gao came up with the idea that we should
implement something called event saw and
the reason that she insisted that we
call it event shop is because it's a
very funny region and Photoshop as you
all know it gives you an environment to
analyze photos apply different kind of
image processing operations to do
particular task and come up with the
final results yeah you don't have to
know what those operators really do you
never say that I'm going to use this
Gaussian filtering with this support
size etc you start saying I am going to
do blurring or I'm going to use magic
wand and and all this kind of thing so
effectively when you start applying
those kind of things you don't have to
have any knowledge of image processing
and because Photoshop was done in my lab
by tom nolle who was my student and
minion said that if we can use the same
principles and apply to detecting events
combining the events and give an
environment in which people can comest
and they start defining different types
of event that will be wonderful so with
that goal and with the fact that now
there are lots and lots of different
data sources can we provide environment
for selecting and combining appropriate
sources to detect different kinds
situations and can be developed
prediction operation for different kind
of proactive actions and this would be
useful for decision makers as well as
individuals so with that this is the
architecture that that was put in there
that there is a front-end GUI there is
data wait web observatories all the data
is coming from there you can have
different techniques for visualization
or from forming the models and all these
kind of things combined this this these
are the different data streams that are
coming in and effectively you come up
with this thing and this image which is
the situation image will be used by
different people to combine and do
different operations this is showing
details which we don't have time to get
into this but just there this is how the
interface starts looking like so this is
the events of environment you can go and
select different types of data streams
that are coming in so this is the data
stream selects and mechanisms you can
start using these operators that list of
operators that I showed you you can
combine those operators you can form
intermediate results and based on those
intermediate results you can form come
finally your final queries that you want
to register so that now these data
streams will be feeding in and the
system will be continuously detecting
those queries you can start do as we
will see in a second you start doing
visualization of those things and you
can start defining the rules so the
first application that we implemented in
a very simple demo form we haven't
completed that solution we are still
working on that was for a stoma type
thing and in this effectively if you
really start seeing this is pulling the
data from one source is scaling that
this is the other source this is third
source and this is the Twitter types or
so these are all the sources that are
taken the results are combined using
different operators and this is start
giving you the map green is a good area
yellow is the ok area for people who are
suffering from
nice one in red is the bed area you can
start defining the rules now for these
people that means if you are in this
particular area and you suffer from
these things you should take this action
or not take this action type of thing
and this this information we started
giving through Twitter and at that
particular time when we implemented this
about two years ago soon this is we are
now modifying this application and we
are putting app in android so that if
you have energy or some of problems you
will go to that in place of Twitter and
because we believe that Twitter is a
very bad source of information for this
kind of application and that application
that you will have on your phone will
provide the information and the system
will automatically send you the result
same thing we did forth I flood when
City pen with the person working on this
project when she started working on this
project just at that time the bed floods
came in Thailand so she said why can't I
apply this system to thai floods and
that's what she did so you take the
Twitter data you take the level from
flood data you find out where the
shelters are and what is their situation
and you start combining those things
they are different detail is operator
that we are applied and when you execute
this this is what the system starts
coming in that sword well where the
situation was at any particular time and
based on that thing you start defining
the X and rules and these extend rules
where that if you are at this particular
point and flood level is increasing you
should immediately contact particular
shelter if you are at a place where
nothing is happening you should be told
that don't take any action and so on
okay so this is what did and this we
implement a system in which the system
will intercept any tweets from people
that I am here and it will respond back
to the person
that you go to this particular location
what we found very increasing was that
we never advertised the system or
nothing but the tweets that people were
receiving from our system automatically
we are being retweeted by people so they
were finding it useful we implemented a
version of this force ND also when came
in and this whole thing took less than
three hours to implement the system so
this is the kind of things we started
doing but then we realize that in most
cases you look at a particular user who
will be using some particular
application and based on this the system
will go and the result comes in there
but different users have different
requirements okay so you have users that
have very different requirements and
this should all of them should not be
given the same recommendation they
require to be given different
recommendation so for that the lolly is
implementing now a system that looks at
your mobile phone collects all the data
and tries to identify your persona that
means effectively it is collecting the
information by asking you some questions
but also by collecting all the sensory
information from there and based on that
it is trying to build the complete
persona so that when your system is
looking for help or as soon as you run
the application and this thing gets
connected to the events of events up
immediately looks at you try to decide
what kind of person you are and when it
is trying to recommend an action is
trying to take that particular thing
also there that means effectively there
is this general situation and there is
this personal situation and those two
things are being combined we are in the
very early stage of this one the first
application that we have decided and
that's why when I showed you these
sensors is for health reasons so for
energy estimate cetera because if I am
energy patient and I am very active then
the system should tell me whether I
should be active today or
should not be active if I want to remain
active if I want to go outside what
exercise to take what medication has of
take and all this kind of thing so for
that that this information comes from
this this kind of system so this is what
we are doing the current status of the
system is you can see the live event
soft demos at this particular place if
the system is currently password-based
and things like that but within next two
months we are going to release the open
source for them so anybody can start
using the system because we found that
in Sri Lanka some people are using this
for agriculture purposes they are using
this system and from Japan and
organization called Nick National
Institute for communication technology
they are building this project
cyber-physical cloud computing project
they collect lots and lots of data and
after the last earthquake they are very
interested in building a system that
will guide people during that particular
time so they started working with us
they have a very big team of researchers
which is working with us and we are
trying to develop what how they are
event warehouse combines with our
extreme processing engine and this event
stop it being used their company from
India it took the responsibility luckily
for us to develop the open-source events
up because my students are interested in
getting degree not in developing open
source software good for a student but
if we want to add one this area we need
to do this so luckily this company is
doing this and they are the one who told
me we have made good progress or soon
will release this were than there so
what did I want to communicate to you
today was that now social I observations
are possible with very little latency as
I mentioned in the beginning it is now
possible to design social systems with
feedback okay situation recognition is a
very interesting topic very interest
english area and lot of things to be
done there this will get gave us need an
availability and that's what can be
there so we have started looking at this
event soft as the first step in this
direction towards implementing this
that's all we are doing so thank you
very much find the situation very
interesting when you define spend on em
from the past people always talk about
then a different scale and also taught
talk about a normal event data so is
that a 4k this situation is abnormal
large-scale the abnormal is the wrong
term there okay but otherwise the
situation is aggregation of lots of
events they could be classified into
different things and some situations
will be abnormal and that's where you
want to start they're taking particular
kinds of XL but you want to be
monitoring all kind of situations that
are you alway Asian that's so the when
you start aggregating events from all
kinds of sources you are starting to
identify situations now with some
situations you don't have to do any X
and some situations take place really
and one of the things you indirectly
refer to a particular point that is
extremely important and when I first
started working on this many of my
friend said you are working on disaster
response because I give you the example
of flood that was one of the early
things my reaction was no that's not
true because consider that Apple example
or iPhone example that's not
abnormal situation that's not disaster
response or energy type things are
happening almost every day I want to
find out as much as that it's a good day
for me as much as I want to find out
that it's going to be a bad day for me
yeah and another very important thing
that I realized and that is why I do not
want to focus on disasters is that
during the time of disaster there if you
develop systems that work only during
disasters most people don't know how to
use them they don't know even about
those systems so they are rarely used on
the other hand the system that are
commonly used people are very familiar
with this so Twitter Facebook and these
things are very commonly used during the
time of disaster now yes sir
the large population unlikely that those
are the only places where it infra clear
yet observation days in fact that you
you I ok the question was that in the
energy example the areas the heat map
that I sold so the bad energy areas only
it where there is a large population
yeah and that observation is very good
observation the reason was one of the
four sources was the Twitter if we
remove Twitter okay then the maps will
be very different so for example if we
go back very quickly too oops what is
why is this not going back if you go
back to the other things pollen count
and pollution levels and this kind of
thing you will find that the pollen
based things are for all the areas now
pollution level is also currently little
bit related to the urban areas because
I'll people major pollution more
precisely in urban area they are not
measuring pollution in Idaho and all all
those things there they will be
measuring in New York and LA area a lot
more so the data sources that we have
used in indices tape are biased towards
popular idea okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
