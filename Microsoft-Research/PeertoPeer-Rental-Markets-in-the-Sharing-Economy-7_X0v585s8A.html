you
I guess we'll start I think there may be
one or two more people trickling in but
thank you guys for coming here today and
I know that this appreciate everyone
getting out here today
Samri burger is PhD candidate in
economics and weiu and this is the first
of our postdoc talks for the new
economics position and he's gonna be
talking about here - peer markets and he
does a lot of work in the intersection
of data science and economics so I'll
turn it over to you thank you thank you
David so I'm gonna be talking about
three topics actually today the first
one is about the sharing economy and the
question is what happens to an economy
when we have two pure rental markets
become widespread and then I'm going to
be talking about two other questions
which are project that are ongoing so
I'm gonna be taking a little bit less
time to talk about them I'm happy to
talk about them more afterwards of light
so the these two questions are what is
the relationship between personality
traits Facebook friendship and
embeddedness and the last one is can we
improve the forecasting of macroeconomic
indicators by using a sentiment
extracted from news articles so they
seem unrelated but actually I'll show
you that there is actually something ok
so let's start with the sharing economy
and this is actually part of a larger
research agenda where we are trying to
measure the effect of what people now
call the sharing economy which range
from measuring consumption shifts and
welfare effects to trust mechanisms and
that in collaboration with over a dozen
peer-to-peer platform before I give you
some specific about the paper let me
provide some context so a range of
economic activity that used to be
between a firm and a customer now have
peer-to-peer counterparts there are
digit that are mediated by a digital
platform and so this
which took took place over the past ten
years or so has been sometimes although
not always paired with a shift from
ownership to access so what do I mean by
that well that instead of owning an
asset I can now access it or rent it
when I need it so that's just a picture
to give you a sense of the type of
things that can now be rented on sharing
economy platform so basically almost
anything in a household now can be
rented on a sharing economy platform so
what happens to an economy and a market
more specifically when you introduce
this you have to pay rental markets yeah
I've never tried so I can share my
experience okay so I won't be talking
about ducks today without be focusing on
cash because that's gone by data out
front so two minutes on the economics of
a cow an airship it's very inefficient
and why is that because well first of
all chances are very expensive so on
average the cost this is Canada knows
something like $8,000 yeah and most of
it comes from depreciation so that's
what the composition of the cost is and
a third basically of it is value
depreciation on the other hand childs
are underutilized so that's the
distribution of child
usage in the US when averaged around
five percent that means the ninety five
percent of the time
cows are not used what happens when you
introduce peer-to-peer rental well this
is the picture of an app could get
around which is the company that we're
partnering with and that's sharing their
data with us so it's an app that allows
you to rent a car but by the hour and
unlock it directly with your phone and
that's the distribution of availability
of Charles on the platform so you see
that it narrows the distribution of
this is exactly yeah it's only
availability so it's actually given that
the car is available it's rented on
average ten percent of the time I'll
show you that later there's actually
still a lot of friction in this market
okay so so that gives you a sense of
some of the efficiency gains that are
generated food is sharing platforms
right you have expensive channels which
are underutilized and you now have a
technology which produce certain
matching friction and that allows to you
know use this underutilized capacity and
allow people who for multiple reasons
choose not to own a car to now have one
when they need one so we can see
intuitively that there is lots of
potential gains from trade from having
these platforms and so what I'm going to
do is sort of intuitively lists the
foxes that we think are the most
important ones and then I'll present
your model that that that formalized all
that so as far as the gains from trade
is concerned well obviously one one
obvious one that I into that earlier is
that you know someone that say I don't
have the resources to buy a car but I
may wish to rent you know a very nice
Tesla for the weekend to take my
girlfriend away is it some concept you
may also allow trade between someone's
whose utilization rate is high enough to
justify ownership but has this extra
capacity that of time that he's not
using that may decide to trade with
someone whose utilization rate is too
low to justify ownership and can then
generate a firm trend between these two
lists of yourself and you can also
generate gains from trade over time by
you know since what I've income and
preference shock they may want to smooth
these shocks over time and then also
generate something
so that's interesting but if you want to
design policy you may want to think
about what are the indirect effects of
this platform so you may want to think
about what will happen if you design a
policy experiment and say something that
the city of San Francisco is doing now
is subsidizing parking spot so you may
want to think what are going to be the
indirect effect on the market on price
and quantities of Charles and the
welfare effects as these markets become
liquid and widespread so the type of
effect that we think matter are for
instance the fact that when a char so
allowing a car to be rented creates an
option value right because basically you
can now choose to purchase it knowing
that when you're not going to need it
you're going to be able to rent it so in
some sense it pushes it value up on the
other hand the fact that the car is used
more intensely as a result of rental
makes it depreciate faster so it's going
to decrease its lifetime and potentially
decrease its value in equilibrium so you
have this counter balancing effects and
it's not clear what the the sum of all
these effects will be as frictions
diminishes so that's what we're trying
to focus on and that's the topic of the
paper so what we do is we're going to
build the model that captures the
features that I've just described we're
going to then estimate it in the data
and we're going to run some control
factor analysis with this machinery to
see what we expect to happen so to give
you more details the model will have
different several features so first
we're going to have a tow genius
consumers who have different sensitivity
to prices think of you know income
levels and different utilization rates
we're going to have Goods of different
qualities New Yorker or daka's and we're
going to have different types
maket we're going to have markets where
people can resell their old jar when
they don't want it anymore
and we're going to have these new
peer-to-peer rental markets where people
can rent their cars when they when they
wish and we're going to introduce what
we think are the most important
frictions to explain choices which are
the transaction cost in the resale
market which we observe our function of
the rate at which cows are used so
that's one thing we're going to estimate
in the data in the second path and we're
also going to introduce rate of physical
depreciation of the a of the durable
goods which corresponds to the fact that
well you know Chan's become obsolete
after a while they tend to break more
often and people tend to tend to scrape
them as a result and this behavior is
also a function of usage so that's also
something we're estimating in the data
and finally when so of police the
experiment is going to be mostly in
varying the level of friction in the
peer-to-peer rental market so we're
going the model is going to account for
the fact that these markets are still
relatively small in size so we're going
to have a parameter which control for
that which varies the level at which
people have access to this rental market
at this stage and and also the level of
friction that they face so what there is
what David was hinting at the fact that
when you wish to rent you don't find a
car 100 percent of the time and when you
supply your car you don't actually rent
it 100 percent of the cap over the time
so that's what the model will look like
going to estimate it with two years of
transactional data from the peer-to-peer
platform that's a proprietary that I
said that comes from get around as well
as some publicly available data from the
to estimate the pilot cost of car
ownership the transaction cost function
that I mentioned and the rate at which
car tend to be replaced that is the
function of that use
okay I'll skip the researcher review
just to tell you that it's building on
some literature in IO and and he and and
and you know complementing the
increasing literature and the Shang
economy but the main novelty of the
model is introducing this peer-to-peer
markets in some more traditional model
in a oh okay so I'm gonna have three
slides with the model I'll try to give
you a sense some intuition of what's
what's being done so just bear with me
for free slides so the three the first
going to describe the consumers then the
the goods they can trade and how they
trade them like how the markets clear
and then the estimation so we have a
consumer massive consumer mass one the
the model is dynamic so this kind of
future our trade bata bata is simple
very same for everybody
we receive the consumers to be able to
all and most one good at the time it's
wrong assumption but it's tremendously
more complicated to explain the choice
set to holding multiple Goods and there
these consumers are going to be
heterogeneous in four dimensions so
there are sensitivity to price which is
called theta in the model there you
choose the strain rate which is called
Rho and the level of frictions in the
rental market which are gamma and gamma
D so gamma is represents the fact that
given that you wish you choose to supply
your car on the platform it's going to
be rented
gamma is percent of the time and gamma D
represents the fact that when you
start searching for Chow on the platform
we're going to find one game ID percent
of the time so in the estimation given
is an intuition EMS is something like
10% game idea is something like 60% in
the way sign estimation but we are going
to simulate and change the range for the
diameter yes they are they are reduced
form yeah I'm calibrating them in
equilibrium okay wait a minute but they
are reduced from there's some deeper
phosphorus here that I'm not modeling
and so to answer to give you and the
rate row here is like the ingen
conditional usage rate right so the one
might that we observe in the
distribution of user is the distribution
of usage conditional on being an owner
of a car so I'm actually going to
calibrate going to sorry estimate the
distribution of a few such em
conditionally on not conditionally on
holding account that's going to show
that as we move on ok so what can these
consumers do you can purchase goods and
to simplify we're just going to decode
on eyes the space of goods between
Newark goods which are indexed by zero
and all the goods which are indexed by
one and the outside option is going to
be indexed by two that's the choice of
not owning any good so here is the the
matter is dynamic but here is the period
utility from owning a good of vintage a
when you CH and B represents the
indicator it's an indicator of choosing
to rent so it's equal to one to n so if
you are no now you are you have to pay a
fixed cost of ownership so that's one of
the main difference between being an
owner and B you know not being an owner
you have to pay this cap this chap out
the fixed cost ownership and you get a
flow of utility XA which is the maximum
flow you can get from a car that's
multiplied by the rate at which UT does
your cure
then if you choose to rent you have this
extra utility fill here which is a
function of the fraction of time your
key actually gets rented when you supply
it and non utilized flow and also
multiplied by the the rental rates
that's determining equilibrium and then
you have these preference shots which
captures the fact that people don't
enjoy their car as much every period but
some yeah you may want to go indication
10 times and Sonia I'll stay at home and
so this shocks schedule this type of
changing in preferences for the no no no
you have this utility flow which is
mirroring the other one except that
you're only the difference is that when
you choose a vintage B hat you also get
the same flow but your cost is now
variable it's proportional to your usage
and it's all the utility flow is then
multiplied by the fraction gamma D which
is the friction on the on the platform
okay I just skip quickly to the the
resolution of the model is is they stand
out with clear rental markets and and
and and resale market and there is a
transaction cost in the in the resale
market which is a function of you said
as I mentioned in the introduction so
the transaction cost function is
actually function of row your usage rate
plus the extra use edge which comes from
rental so if you decide to rent you get
a revenue out of it but you the price
sort of sorry the value that you receive
when you resell your carriage is lower
that's sort of trade-off that you're
facing yes
- or is it the fraction of time yes so
so I think I understand the question
I don't turn this off I'll just say that
Gemma D is not is not a choice it's a
it's a friction that you're facing so
your your choice of user let me take
that back your your level of uz is bro
and is exhausting you fixed it so demand
is the same thing everybody has a role
you live far away from New York and New
Jersey and you row corresponds to the
fact that every day you have to take
your car to go to work
exactly yeah so and then you have you're
facing these frictions which corresponds
to you know perhaps the fact that the
matching algorithm is not perfect or
perhaps the fact that you wish to use it
at a time where there is you know not
enough supply or something that's the
the friction in itself is at between is
from it does not corresponds to your
it's just to do something everything you
can think about it as a scale
okay and then so the matter is dynamic
so we solve it dynamically it's it's
very standard the design the people are
not going to get into them now but I've
happy to talk about me more later how do
we estimate it how do we how do we solve
the equilibrium well there's a bunch of
parameters that we directly estimate
from the data the ones which an artist
image directly from the data which I
liberate them by minimizing the
difference between what we observe in
the data and what the model predicts and
we get the missing parameters that way
and so I'll move through that quickly
and show you the policy experiment we
solve which I think the meter in terms
of estimation here I'm estimating the
transaction costs function tau it's a
function of U 0 so I'm scraping a bunch
of price of use detail from this website
called n le Na da and I'm building this
transaction cost Charles I as a function
of usage and vintage and I just take the
average and use that in the estimation
procedure yeah yeah of course yes I'm
sorry
so it was I went fast so maybe it wasn't
clear this is the transactions cost that
you pay when you resell your car it has
nothing to do with the peer-to-peer
market here this is when you go to a car
dealer and you resell your car you're
going to this is just capturing market
depreciation as far as the price of the
car when you reset it is concerned which
is function usually have two variables
how old your car is and how much has
been used
yeah it's actually a when use edge is
around 5% at the average usage rate it's
so here the blue the blue line
corresponds when I scrape a bunch of
very common cows and I've read the
difference between the price at which
you buy them old and the price at which
you sell them old and I look at what's
the the fraction of the price that that
gives me and I averaged across cow I get
I get this curve as a function of the
number of miles that the cow has been
has been driven here on the other hand
I'm what I want to capture is that rate
of physical depreciation so the fact
that cows you can obsolete after a while
they're too old they tend to break too
often and people tend to just trade them
so what you observe in the model tells
you that this quantity in equilibrium
will be the fraction of new care that
entered the system over the total stock
of child
so if you take this ratio and you
condition it on use edge you get a rate
of replacement of child at different
level of usage so these are blue dots
that I have the data is a little sparse
but I try to fit a line to that by just
touching some of the outliers and that's
also one estimate that I use directly in
the model other quantities that I am NOT
going to get into those nothing all
stand out the as I said the the second
step is for the parameters I cannot
directly estimate like the utility
parameters which has constant I
calibrate them by minimizing the
difference between some
fractions that are observed in the data
for instance you know a fraction of
above median income households who
purchase a new car accelerator so I I
find you know bunch of these frac you
know quantities that I can instil a joke
in the data look at their counterparts
in the model and find the parameters
which minimize the difference okay and
finally from the platform the platform
data I'm trying to get a sense of what's
the current level of friction that we
observe so I look at you know fraction
of time cars are available and the
fraction of time that they get it gets
rented the model predicts that that's
going to give me the distribution for
gamma yes
which which part are you worried about
super very point I I did come to a
factual on on this so basically by here
in the baseline in the baseline I'm
using the average age transaction cost
function at the average rate but I
looked at for one curve below and one
Java bar and here too I looked at when
standardization blew this doesn't have a
lot of effect on what does have a lot of
effect on the result is what I'm going
to get to now is the the level of
friction in the peer-to-peer market so
that's basically what what the results
are very sensitive to and
so in the baseline estimate I use the
level of friction that I observed today
and I assume that people over time start
to using the platform more because you
know they become more aware of it the
system enters new cities the sort of it
becomes legitimized I mean all these
things super reduced from right it's
just one parameter in my model there is
a lot of things going on in the
background of course but in the baseline
scenario I assume that the level of
friction on average stay constant I'm
going to do actually several simulation
where I I instead of us making this
assumption I I assume that you know
perhaps the people that were actually
observe now on the platform are the ones
that are facing the lower level of
friction but that you know other people
are opting out because the level of fish
in the would face would be would be
higher and perhaps there is not enough
benefit for them at this point so so
that's the what I call the baseline
result then there is going to be I'm
just skipping and going back to the
baseline but that's going to be the low
liquidity result where the average level
of friction is so this is liquidity so
the average level of friction is higher
and high liquidity when the average
level of friction is lower but just to
illustrate what happens in the baseline
basically across the different
calibration the directional effects
don't change it's the magnitude the
change and we think that here we are
varying access to up to 100% it's likely
that the world is not going to look like
that at 100% level of access there's
going to be a lot of you know all of
officers competitive forces that are
going on but at least it gives us a
pretty good directional sense of for for
the the combined effects so just four
observations
four or five observations from this
table the first one is
that we observe a shift away from
ownership so the first two lines shows
you that ownership tends to go down so
can go into detail in the in the number
in a second but yeah ownership tend to
go down and on the other hand there is a
big shift to towards non ownership right
so the fraction these are the staff
fractional number so here when you have
25 percent level of access the level of
the increase in the percentage of
non-owner increase by fact by 86 percent
and at 100 percent level of access the
increase by a factor of more than 3
other interesting things to notice is
that Chaston to be used more intensely
that's the rate at which charts are used
as sorry the increase in the rate at
which cards are used as you increase
access so remember I mean you you you
you can you can refined the model for
DMS and the ad which I'm not doing at
this point that's clearly like the next
step to make this more robust on the
other hand so you observed like that
calves are is more intensity obviously
so you may know that the starting point
was 5% as you increase access it's
increased by on average so 30% for new
cows and 60% for all Dockyard so that
means that you go from 5% of usage to
something like 8 8 percent of its
Zoomers with peer-to-peer access and the
baseline friction rates so wouldn't they
be endogenously acted so as the
fractured consumers increases your four
generates are going to like so so i so
perhaps this is not the dis notation is
not perfectly clear when i want what i
mean by when i increase access it means
it means yes so it means that there is a
fraction of when when am i wanna write
which one am i 25 so do so yes so let me
exact so let me refer your point when
you have 25 percent of access it means
that 25% of people will have will face a
level of friction of 10 percent on
average and in for gammas and 60 percent
of average of friction on the demand
side on average for Gammage the
remaining 75 percent will be as if their
level of friction is equal to zero okay
so we conditioned on having access this
is your mean now so so first so the
frictions are not constant per se they
are constant for the ones who have
access so as you increase access well
you know change the liquidity on both
side we don't exactly know how given
that it's reduced from so that's why
we're n different control factors
okay so challenge was more intensely the
corollary is that the average age of the
car tends to go down right Justin to be
replaced faster the shift is not
dramatic but it's still you know it's
not in the model but it can you can
think of environmental benefits of
having younger cows on the road they
didn't put it less and when it comes to
changing consumer surplus so here it
goes from an increase in from eight zero
point eight percent to 3 percent to 100
percent of access so to give you a
benchmark the literature converge on the
fact that by suppressing frictions from
secondary markets for to for carousel
leads to an increase in consumer surplus
of around two percent so certainly in
the same zone but in the more optimistic
scenario we were higher sorry with a
higher liquidity you can reach something
like 6% in the very optimistic world so
yeah and it's not huge yeah I mean it's
not obvious X hunty to me that it's
gonna be linear because you have some
unknown realities in the effect of the
rate of depreciation on your value or
the transaction cost on your value which
is a function of usage and that induced
some nonlinearities but before
estimating the parameters I don't think
it's abuse that you these nonlinearities
are not going to play out that much but
it's more about this
okay and the last point I want to make
is is about is about the distributional
effect so just quickly because I'm
running out of time
the here that's the picture of the
increase in the changes in consumer
surplus in the three liquidities in
other dimensions that the baseline low
liquidity high liquidity yeah i'm
showing the increase in consumer surplus
as access increases the freely traded is
an island the blue line represents the
change in consumer surplus for below
medium income household and the red bars
represent the chances for above medium
income household see that consistently
so the level of changes of course is
higher when you have more liquidity but
what's interesting is the contrast shows
that the gains are almost always two to
three times higher for video medium
income households so that's what we see
as one of the most interesting points in
the paper is that these markets in some
sense have the facility by expanding the
choice set of consumers allowing them to
avoid you know the sixth cost of
ownership and and and another process to
make lower-income people better off
primarily okay so that's the the the key
takeaway you know shift away from
ownership james in consumer surplus
which are comparable to what you see in
secondary market but could be louder in
optimistic senile and and distributional
effects which tend to follow below
median income people okay so i can talk
to you more about the extensions or
flying some police experiment when we
were running where we're looking at the
effect of sustaining parking spot
yes or the model is wrong and we
actually put something in the model to
explain reality they're two completely
different like one were miss wanted
something in equilibrium we got this
awesome how come and one says right I I
don't know if the mother can answer that
at this point but I think so in so in
some sense here I'm not distinguishing
between you know what's the what's the
utilization rate at different time of
the day for me all of this is am a
genius at this point so that's clearly
one thing that would answer your
question if I were to like put different
values on usage time at different time
of the day and see like which time of
the day is more valuable and see what
the model predicts by doing that in some
sense it's captured in reduced form in
the well so in some sense it's not
realistic to say that your cow is going
to be rented when you supply your can is
going to put
surely be rented a hundred percent of
the time because of course nobody cares
about having a car during the night most
people don't so it's partially captured
by the fact that we are not pushing that
friction to unrealistic level but even
keeping the parameters in a reasonable
range and looking at what usage
distribution looks like
given the current parameter was still
finding interesting effects so we think
that it's still valuable
now the other forces that would operate
at in the range you're talking about
when you know the competition between
very much so we sort of maybe we're
stuck in like the bad state is that
where you come down or is it there you
know is that what you really believe it
this might take off so everyone's saying
pure car sharing is never gonna happen
they're running this risk of speaking
too soon is that like if you're making a
prediction today in ten five years
there's one these warnings platforms for
ten billion dollars twenty dollars well
when is already worth ten billion
dollars or more it's it's slightly
different but no no it's not about I
don't agree it's it's it's facing it's
but but my point remains which is that
it's facing strong competition so in a
sense here I'm not taking into account
the fact that they are you know I'm
assuming that the outside option is sort
of fixed you would want to you would in
order to make it in order to make her
yeah a good prediction on what you're
asking me I I don't think I can make it
you know I think it's too far out of
sample to really make it with the with
the current machinery that I have I
think that crucially the outside of em
is changing dramatically right now and
so I'm showing you know a piece of the
component of the utility function of the
guy that's not an owner and that has
this new Chinese Choi said that's making
happier but the other component and Matt
Malini is changing full-time and you
know not to make a very prediction I
think I'll need to explain more of that
component okay I mean you can always
talk more later okay so let me delve
into the second paper and in order for
perhaps to keep your attention I'm just
going to give you one minute of
connection between the previous project
and this one because Exxon Tate perhaps
they seem orthogonal but they're not so
here the ideas I've been I've been
showing you like what happens to the
world where you have this to be a
platform and you sort of you know
magically reduce the friction because
you have this great matching algorithm
or you know cities that decide to
subsidize parking spots or things like
that but of course it's sort of
unrealistic to think that that's going
to be enough to completely eradicate
frictions in Tokyo market there's a lot
of other factors like that that matter a
lot for instance just by the
incompleteness of the contract that
takes place you need a lot of trust
between people to make this platform
work to let someone use your car and get
around or to rent your apartment on
Airbnb you you clearly need a massive
amount of trust in the system and in the
person you're transacting with another
example is another company we're
partnering with called blablacar that's
allowing Chow owners to supply a city in
their car when they're traveling so say
from Paris to Berlin
like this and I mean I know the name of
the company sounds funny but it's the
size of Amtrak in terms of volume so to
build such an infrastructure you
actually need a lot of trust so
what I'm trying to get to is that we
want to understand the role of trust in
this platform and in order to do that
with partner with a company called
treaty from which two of our quota are
from their goal is to build the trust
infrastructure for the sharing economy
so they want to centralize all the
digital social capital or actually also
all form of social capital of their
users in one place and allow the users
to then potentially transact on any
platform on which they don't have any
history so think of something like a
credit history to get a loan but for the
digital world so our partnership with
them so their long-term goal is to
actually run economic trust games with
the users and they are actually in the
process of building a platform for us to
do that in the process we've been
starting to look at that data and one
interesting thing about their data is
that they have the result of for 2
million of the 2.9 million of the users
of the result of a five factor
personality test and they also have the
Facebook network of this user so I guess
that's interested in to looking at the
relationship between personality and
social network and that is the topic of
the next paper
ok so just quickly on the motivation let
teach anyone here what I thought that
you mixing it here we're looking more
specifically at homophily
the propensity to to form ties with
people who are similar to you and it
lots of literature on statues former
Chile and here we're more interested in
the homophily in personality traits and
we think it's interesting because it's a
plausible cause for friendship formation
and I think one of the last piece of
evidence that I'll show you I think is a
good it was good spotting evidence for
that
okay so lots of interesting work on on
on the topic of homily and ours we is
the the first to look at a large scale
population and try to measure homophily
in personality traits in in a
large-scale population this is what the
treaty platform looks like this is what
your personality test looks like so I
can do details on that's my me taking
the tests around taking the test and I
recommend all of you to take the test
it's enjoyable this is what it looks
like you have I mean so once you ask to
test to take the this personality test
you have a set of 100 questions for the
other question so you have a set of 100
questions chosen at random that's
divided into sets of 20 question drawn
randomly and so each set of 20 question
I produce a signal towards one of the
Five personality dimension then the
signal is a version that gives you a
score in each of the five dimension so
just why do people take the test so
because ever they enjoy knowing their
personality or they are recommended by
their friends to actually take the test
so there is a bit of a selection effect
here cuz that's my speculation
so you and self question like this took
to another people at parties okay so we
so we actually select a sample from the
twenty data set and the way we do it was
originally in order to run the the trust
game I mentioned to you so let me
describe how we run it how we how we
selected the two data sets so we we
started by randomly selecting a set of
treaty users for which we had
personality data so these are the the
black nodes here so from this user we
then search for all the friend of that
user on Facebook and the ones that are
treaty users
we then iterated and find all of her
friend among her friend so that's for
level one among her friend we are not
level two and again we looked for all
the friends of the treaty user in level
two so every time we have someone that's
not the treaty user in the set of
friends that we find in this procedure
we cannot actually access his friends
information so we have to stop here but
for 20 users we can keep going so we
kept going until level 3
so overall or that assets consist of the
something procedure that I described
repeated many times that gives us so so
every time we repeat this procedure we
gather for all the notes for which it
said it's available the personality
tests across the five dimensions and so
that gives us a set of more than 178,000
users for which we have personality
tests and five hundred more than 550,000
edges between them in addition we have a
set of more than 25 million non-user
friends and almost 60 million edges
between them so that allows us to
compute for each pair so for each pair
of users like this one this pair here if
the two users are on on the platform and
I've taken the personality test that can
exactly compute the number of common
friends that they have on Facebook okay
so there are several results in the
paper let me just focus on two of them
at the first for the first one we want
to test whether or not there is
homophily
in personality traits so for that we're
going to use two comparison group on the
Left panel what we're doing is we're
comparing the set of friends to a set of
100 random sample of randomly selected
people so in each of this 100 random
sample what I'm doing is I'm just
forming pairs of users drawn at random
and I'm computing assets
of pairs of people selected at random
and I'm computing the average
personality distance for that random
sample number one and I'm repeating it
for 100 random sample and that gives me
the box in red here so here what I'm
plotting is for each personality trait
the blue dot corresponds to the average
person edge distance between friends and
that I'm normalizing at zero and the red
box represents the distribution of the
average distance across the random
sample that I just described so the
distribution of the average personality
distance across this random sample yes
so here on average the personality
distance for friends is something like
20 19 or 20 so so on in one dimension
your test is going to be something like
60 or 70 on average as a node so when
you look at what's the average
difference between scores for friends
pairs on average is something like 20
and also my absence video yeah
absolutely so this is the distance among
friends and this is the distance among a
set of 100 random sample of people taken
at random so what I'm saying is that the
average distance in this set of randomly
drawn sample is larger than four
different so that's drawing that's
drawing people at random here I'm
repeating the operation but that by rif
resurfacing the edges instead of just
drawing people at random so I I just
reshuffle all the edges in that allows
me to preserve the the degree
distribution in the in the random sample
we see that the homophily
result remains and so there's going to
go quickly and say that we wanted to go
little one step deeper and try to see if
that result is the basis of mirela of
network formation and so what we get
interested in is by looking at how this
distance varies with the fraction of
shared friends for each pair so here I'm
looking at I'm just looking at the set
of friends pairs each of these panel
represents a personality trait so let's
look at the first one for now
what I'm showing here is see five points
the corresponds to the correspond to
five Burkett of the the fraction of
shared friends between pairs so the
first Burkett is looking at observation
for which the fractional share friends
is between zero and five percent the
next Burkett's five to ten percent ten
to fifteen percent fifteen to twenty n
above twenty percent in each of this
Birkett i averaged the absolute
difference in personality score and that
gives me the shape that we observe here
for agreeableness and conscientiousness
emotional stability extraversion and
open yeah very very point is it
meaningful significance I don't think
it's huge but I think that the I think
that the trend is showing us something
about a directional effect that's
interesting I'm going to get to in a
second so that's for the friends we
observe that there is a statistically
significant decrease in distance as
percentage of common friends increases
so you just wanna so when I condition on
the news for age and and the city I live
in in the in just a basic logistic
regression for homophily here the result
remains when I include companies and
school some coefficient becomes
insignificant but the sample is also
much smaller and there may be a
selection effect in to showing that you
have that you've been to some companies
it's interesting cuz it disappears for
like extradition which might and an
openness I think so perhaps it means
that you actually you know choosing to
display your company because you're open
and that's sort of what you're capturing
but we can talk about this more after
all it's almost
okay so what I really want to show is
this that's now when I look at all the
pairs of non friends in my samples well
there is actually 42 million
combinations of pairs which are not
friends but share at least one friend in
common so I look at that big set and I
do the same conditioning that I just
explained previously I divide I bucket
in five and I look at the average
distance in this light buckets and what
you observe is that at least for trait
agreeableness conscientiousness
extraversion and openness the average
distance in personality between non
friends tends to increase with the
fraction of share friends so if you now
if you now tend to should I try to tie
that to material network formation and
you want to think of network formation
simply as something that combines your
preference bias for someone that's
similar to you perhaps and matching
opportunities then this is perhaps we
see this as evidence that you you need
these two features in order to explain
the patterns that we see here so here we
so if you if you want for instance to
proxy meeting opportunities by the
fraction of shared friends then you see
that there is a positive correlation
between meeting opportunities and
personality distance or so and
personality similarity so more meeting
opportunities increase when personality
similarity increases okay so it's it
sort of rules out the possibility that
you know the matching process is
exogenous since you observe this
positive correlation
okay and on the other hand what you
observe for the non-friends is that as
meeting opportunity increases for non
friends to still not want to be friends
that facility distance has to increase
to compensate the fact that they are
more likely to meet and as a result they
must really dislike each other more and
more in order to create a link that's
that's it basically so that's just the
regression to show the slopes of the the
same evidence that I just mentioned so
we we see evidence of former video
across the five trait on the basis form
a lot of network formation the next step
is to actually use these data make pairs
of users play trust games look at how
the outcome of the trust game varies
with embeddedness of the degree or with
the degree of embeddedness of a pair and
perhaps also test whether there is
homophily in trustworthiness of nodes
and how it also varies with embeddedness
so we can talk about this more after
after the talk
