the normal camera roll but in addition
the full set of shots is saved in case

flip back through previous blinks by
swiping in the shots from the left by
pressing the three dots in the upper

and for example mail the image to a
friend your camera roll holds all your
saved shots from blink and from other
camera lenses the shots from blink allow
you to return to blink to see the full
captured series to select a new frame if
desired you should be aware that if you
delete the rich media object the next
time you try to open a shot and blink it
will be gone blink provides a simple way
