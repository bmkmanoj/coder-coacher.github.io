hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
thank you for coming my name is Amy
Draves and I'm pleased to welcome Jordan
elenberg to the Microsoft Research
visiting speaker series Jordans here to
discuss his book how not to be wrong in
which he tells us how to use math to
extend our common sense and to see
through to the true meaning of
information we often take for granted he
is a professor at the University of
wisconsin-madison and lectures around
the world on his research in number
theory he has been featured on The Today
Show and NPR and his writing has
appeared in numerous publications
including the wired the New York Times
and The Washington Post he is the author
of the slate column do the math please
join me in giving him a very warm
welcome well thanks so much it's great
to be here this is my first visit to
Microsoft Research so on the way here
actually I was I was chatting with the
fellow next to me on the airplane as one
does and he said like well what are you
traveling for I said well I'm talking
and giving talks about a book I wrote he
said what's the book about I said it's
about math and then he said so what
makes your book different from all those
other books by those math guys and um
well I hadn't really been expecting the
conversation to take an aggressive turn
so early so so I pretended to fall
asleep as one does and and while I was
pretending to sleep I thought about what
I should have said to this guy who is
now somewhere else so I will maybe also
sort of say it to you I mean one thing
that I tried to do in this book how not
to be wrong which you kind of can't do
in a more standard journalistic 1200
word at a time format is to really trace
out all the crazy connections
between all the parts of math the way it
is many things but it's also one thing
everything together in a big network
which i think is for people who do math
is so much one of the characteristic
features of the subject its underlying
unity what this means is that the book
kind of goes all over the place and is
about a lot of different things so to
kind of talk about the book project in a
short talk is not really possible I
would have to say sort of like 10
seconds about a lot of different things
so maybe just for the first slide I'll
just say some of the things I won't talk
about in this talk but we can talk about
it after if you if you want to the
Laffer curve and taxation the triumph of
mediocrity which is sort of an old
school piece of business physics that
people were interested in the 30s this
sort of questionable nature of public
opinion the existence of God there's
actually a lot of that in the book sort
of more than I expected there to be when
I started writing it the soup you get
into when you start thinking about
negative numbers and their proportions
of false assumptions of linearity of the
Supreme Court David Hilbert Jeter those
three are sort of all one thing that are
connected and I could have put sort of
the theory of umpiring in there too
which is sort of the glue that draws
that together um but I figured that in
this context it was probably better just
to tell one story and so that's what I'm
gonna do
and even this story I'll sort of only
tell part of it
so the story I want to tell has to do
with the lottery and I think if I click
on this it's not gonna play a movie but
I'm just gonna check what happens if I
click on it okay this box is a still
picture too actually
it's not the truth so this is a picture
of the drawing from a lottery called the
Massachusetts cash windfall really the
only reason to play the movie is because
it's good to sort of enjoy the kind of
comedy Boston accents that you hear when
you hear the drawing of the math lottery
but yo those of you who been in
Massachusetts can just imagine it um so
what this is a picture of is actually
the very last cash windfall drawing that
took place in
you arey of 2012 and the point of the
story is to talk about why this was the
very last time the cash windfall was
played and the mathematical notion they
are trying to explicate with this
particular story is the notion of
expected value so let me quickly sort of
either tell or remind you about that so
how does the lottery work we all know a
ticket costs a certain amount and you
have a small chance of winning a big
prize in this game having the prize is
sort of not so big just so we don't have
to have large numbers on the board
maybe there's a 1 in 200 chance that
you'll win $300 how do we think about
how this lottery works well if you play
once probably you'll get nothing maybe
you'll get a large prize but if you play
a lot and people who play the lottery
often do play a lot let's say you play a
thousand times let's let you play every
day for about three years
well if you have a one in two chance
hundred chance of winning you'll
probably win about five times out of
those thousand plays which means that
you'll take home about $1,500 and one
way to think of that is if you played a
thousand times and won $1,500
you've won about a buck fifty per ticket
so this kind of relatively
unobjectionable computation underlies
what we mean when we talk about expected
value the expected value is simply the
amount you expect to win per ticket but
I want to point out this is one of these
moments that occurs again and again
where the mathematical use of a word
sort of pulls away from the ordinary
English use something that causes sort
of so much trouble when we speak with
civilians right about mathematics that
the expected value is not at all the
value you expect the ticket to have as
the notation might suggest you don't
expect the ticket to be worth a dollar
fifty indeed the ticket cannot be worth
the dollar fifty that's not even a
possible value the ticket can have it's
either worth nothing or it's worth three
hundred dollars so somehow if we could
go back to the
of mathematical notation we would
probably call this something more like
average value because that's really what
it represents it represents the average
over many plays whether it's many plays
by a single person over a long period of
time or many plays by many many many
players at a sing at a single time for a
single drawing and in particular let me
remark on the sort of fundamental
inequality going on here a dollar-fifty
is less than two dollars that's
important
two dollars is how much you are charged
for the ticket and a dollar fifty is on
average how much you're gonna win and
the and the expected value is less than
the cost and lotteries are usually like
this let me explain why because I may
say well maybe I don't care about the
average I'm not buying maybe I'm not
buying a thousand tickets maybe I'm only
buying one but the state does care about
the average right because the state is
placing lots of those lottery bets on
the other side thousands upon thousands
and if the state is on average handing
out a dollar 50 for each two dollars it
takes in then the state is making money
which is after all the point of the
lottery a lottery which on average gave
money from the state to the players
would not be doing what a lottery is
supposed to do which is raise revenue so
let me show you it this is very typical
of real-life lotteries let me show you
the prize matrix for a real lottery um
and this is sort of the basic prize
structure for Massachusetts cash
windfall the game we started with and
what these numbers literally are don't
doesn't matter so much I just wanted to
show you that I did look them up and
what you can see what you can check is
that the expected value of this $2
ticket I mean you would be delighted if
it were a dollar 50 it's in fact much
less it's about 80 cents so this is what
you would call a pretty bad play for the
player and a pretty good play for the
state so here's the situation
Massachusetts had this lottery the
jackpot
probability was set quite low nobody won
for a year people were getting
demoralized and depressed people were
not playing and that's bad if you're the
state I mean if you really can't take
their money if they don't play
so the state decided to change the rules
here's the rule and then introduced a
thing called the roll down which worked
like this they said well the jackpot is
getting bigger and bigger maybe that
should be enticing but nobody wins
people get depressed and demoralized
instead let's say when the jackpot hits
a certain threshold and it goes over two
million dollars there's gonna be a roll
down that means if nobody wins the
jackpot instead of money just kind of
piling into the pot that money rolls
down to enrich the lower tier prizes to
make them worth more money those prizes
that you actually might feel you have a
much better chance of winning when you
look back for a second you know for
instance this match four out of six
which you have a one and eight hundred
chance in winning a prize like that
maybe you've never won but you probably
know somebody who's won it if you know a
lot of people who play the lottery
that's sort of somehow within the realm
of realistic possibility so this was
Massachusetts's plan to make a lottery
that seemed like a better deal for the
player and it worked it worked too well
because what Massachusetts had done and
it vertically is made a lottery which
actually was a good deal for the player
which is not so let me show you what the
windfall playoff payoff matrix looked
like on February 7th 2005 so so it
looked like this now four out of six
prize which used to be worth a hundred
and fifty dollars on a normal non roll
down day on this day with the extra
enrichment of all that jackpot money was
worth almost twenty five hundred dollars
so that's pretty good if you have a one
and eight hundred chance of making about
twenty four hundred dollars
that is three dollars worth of expected
value right there for your two dollar
ticket and in fact the expected value of
the two dollar ticket on the roll down
day um was about five and a half dollars
so this I mean so good now you're
allowed to get out and check your phones
and see if any of these games are
currently being played they're not I
checked so why do I know the exact value
of the payoffs on this particular day
February 7th 2005 it's because I got
them from the following document which
is probably a little hard to read here
but it's not so important that you can
read it let me just tell you what it is
this
is a 27 page report from Gregory W
Sullivan who is the Inspector General of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
arriving to the state treasurer to
explain just what the heck had happened
with their lottery game and I have to
say it's kind of an amazing story and
I'll tell a part of it today it is this
is definitely the only state fiscal
oversight document written by a
municipal bureaucrat which will make you
ask to somebody have the movie rights to
this it's really pretty amazing and what
happened well you can kind of imagine
what happened what happened is that
pretty quickly after the introduction to
this game which they had borrowed from
it they'd borrowed this game from a game
in Michigan which I called win also
called windfall which had closed down
pretty easily enough for the
introduction of this game people started
to catch on to what this game actually
was so let me tell you a little bit
about the sort of main characters um the
main group I write about as a group of
players called random strategies and
these are a group of MIT undergraduates
led by a fellow called James Harvey who
by an incredible stroke of good luck was
in his senior year writing an
independent study project about the
expected value of lottery games when
this game was launched in January 2005
so as sort of part of his project he was
like well let me compute it for each
game offered by the state of
Massachusetts and then you know
presumably his pencil fell out of his
hand and well yeah and he got a bunch of
friends together which at MIT you can
get a bunch of friends together to who
can compute expected value uh
and these guys got together and started
making large bets so in fact the reason
that we know the payoffs for that exact
date February 7th 2005 is that that was
the day where James Harvey and Euron Lou
about fourteen thousand dollars worth of
lottery tickets at a star market in
Cambridge right by MIT which was their
first big play another group was the
group led by a guy called jerry selbee
he was a retired engineer from Michigan
he sort of had about thirty of his
family members in on this um I actually
mentioned Michigan a minute ago do you
guys remember oh I
why did I mention it so that yeah so
this was a guy this was like the veteran
this guy had been doing the same thing
in Michigan for two years until they
closed down the game and then I mean you
could imagine his incredulity and joy
when six months later he read that
another state was opening the same game
and immediately he and his wife got in
their car and drove to Deerfield
Massachusetts in the corner of the state
which i think is geographically the
closest kin Massachusetts convenience
store to the state of Michigan and they
start applying orders no there was a
whole another group called the dr. John
lottery club of like biomedical
researchers who bought a lot of tickets
down in Quincy so all of these guys were
playing this game like mad until rather
late in the game on a typical roll down
day about 80 to 90% of all the tickets
being purchased in the lottery or being
purchased by a member of one of these
three groups so so each each group was
typically making plays of about 200,000
tickets at a time so what's the end is a
bit anti-climatic the end of this story
looks kind of like this it looks like a
front-page story in The Boston Globe
explaining what was going on with the
Massachusetts state lottery this is
called a game with a windfall for a
knowing few and as soon as this story
runs the game doesn't end immediately
but basically the game is up because for
this to work it does actually require
that people are playing not on the roll
down days it requires that the sort of
general public has some competence in
the game running a lottery is in some
sense a very psychological enterprise
you have to convince people to play and
once people get the sense that the
lottery is somehow not quite on the
level then it's all over so the last
drawing I showed you takes place just a
few months after this expose by the
Boston Globe takes place so that's the
basic story I tell did someone were to
tell in the book and actually maybe I
ought to say one thing it was amazing
that happened I was talking about this
stuff in a bookstore in Palo Alto
gosh I guess just two nights ago
and you Ron Lou came to the book store
and I met him that was I mean you don't
often get a chance for like a character
in your book to like show up at their
reading and it was very weird it would
be like if somebody from Narnia like
came up and was like well let me tell
you how it really went down um so that
was extremely amazing so um so anyway
yes they are real people I can now
verify it from from my eyesight anyway
let me what I want to talk about is two
mathematical puzzles that this story
presents us with one is an easy answer
one is a more complicated and
mathematically richer answer so so
puzzle one is how could anybody possibly
get away with this I mean remember this
state lottery knows who wins right
because they have to pay so they know
that like oh interesting like a thousand
winning tickets were like sold of the
same store and that happened last time
too and also the time before that I mean
this is not it somehow it doesn't seem
to take Sherlock Holmes to sort of
figure out that something non-normal is
going on in the play of the lottery but
this puzzle which sounds hard actually
has an easy answer so the answer is that
the state did figure it out and I think
it's quite safe to say that the state
knew almost from the very beginning
exactly what was going on with this
lottery in fact one reason we know that
is that we know that James Harvey went
to the state lottery office immediately
upon doing this computation and said hey
so given the way this lottery is
structured my plan is to get as many
people to loan me money as I can and
then by tens or hundreds of thousands of
tickets and make lots of money is that
legal
because you know you guys probably know
kids who went to MIT or some of you went
to MIT these are kind of good like
rule-abiding good student types of
people right um so okay maybe the NYT
people disagree with that assessment
anyway well okay this guy was like that
anyway and we don't actually know what
happened in this conversation on the
lottery side but it must have been
something like go ahead and knock
yourself out because a week later he and
his friends make their first play um so
that puzzle creates a sub puzzle if the
state knew about it all the time
why did they allow it to go on like what
kind of casino allows a player to come
in and beat the house week after week
for
period of seven years and then they're
taking by the way about three and a half
million dollars in winnings from the
state over the course of this whole
thing well I will explain this with a
very sophisticated diagram that looks
like this see let me explain how the
lottery looks from the viewpoint of this
state a $2.00 ticket is sold and
Massachusetts takes 80 cents out and
that's the state's revenue from the
lottery ticket and that 80 cents is
gonna go to pay police officers and fun
schools and pay the salaries of State
University math professors and other
absolutely critical functions of state
government that's what and the other
dollar in 20 cents that is going to go
back in prizes the state doesn't keep
that so what that means is that the
state doesn't care who wins doesn't
matter
the state only cares how many people
play the game if these guys are coming
in and buying hundreds of thousands of
extra tickets that is a win for the
state so one way to think of it is that
the flow of money here is not really
from Massachusetts to random strategies
it's from the other players to random
strategies with Massachusetts taking a
cut at every stage so so really I think
the way this was played out in the
newspapers in the globe in another place
is when this was being revealed was that
random strategies and the other big
betters were somehow beating the house
but what were they actually doing they
had found a bet that had a positive
expected value and they were making it
again and again and again they were
making it in such large volume that they
were very reliably winning money so if
that's what you're doing then you are
the house bat see random strategies was
and the regular lottery players were
like the players at the casino so who is
Massachusetts in this scenario who's the
state well I think the easiest way to
say it is that the state is the state I
mean here's another very sophisticated
picture which I think is a pretty much
an exact analogy if Brandon strategies
is the house and the better and the
letter Craig Euler lottery players are
like players well what is the state
the state kind of takes puts its hand
out and collects a certain percentage of
each transaction and that's what states
are good at states don't like to gamble
states like to collect taxes and that in
essence is what Massachusetts was doing
they had sort of you could think of what
they were doing with this game is sort
of licensing a virtual casino and then
collecting a tax on each bet so in the
end the Inspector General estimated that
Massachusetts drew about an extra I
think in total they drew about one
hundred and twenty million dollars in
revenue from this game over its lifespan
and I think it's fair to say that if you
walk away with one hundred and twenty
million dollars you were not the one
getting scammed so that's one puzzle
which I think and as I say I think the
answer is pretty simple I couldn't quite
get if I were a real reporter I probably
would have I mean I called the
Massachusetts lottery PR people and they
said of course we didn't know any of
this was going on
obviously that's alive and if I were a
real reporter I could probably prove
that but I'm not a real reporter I'm a
math professor
so all this report that they say that's
not true but it is true so here's the
other puzzle okay so there ax is
actually a difference between random
strategies and the other two teams and
it's the reason why I focus on random
strategies in in the book and it's
because they actually did do something
rather differently than the other teams
the other teams used what's called the
Quick Pick machine which I don't know if
you guys know there are you go out of
lottery players who plays lottery
oh my god a lot of Liars work here um
okay I'm gonna pretend that you guys
don't know what the Quick Pick machine
is and tell you that it is a machine
that will just print out a random ticket
for you with random numbers which if
you're gonna defy 200,000 tickets is an
extreme convenience and labor-saving
device but the guys from random
strategies did not do this they filled
out their tickets themselves by hand
200,000 tickets why that's the puzzle
especially because if you know how
expected value works you know that the
expected value of every ticket is
exactly the same so that the expected
value of 200,000 tickets it doesn't
matter which tickets they are the
expected value just is what it is so how
could it have possibly been worth their
while to UM
take the incredibly tedious task on of
filling out all these tickets by hand
that's the puzzle so I'm gonna take the
rest of the time and just talk about the
answer to that question and something
that we do in math and we're trying to
understand something it's kind of
mysterious is we take a problem the
bases us and try to replace it with
something much smaller and simpler
simpler hopefully when we do that we
don't throw out the features we're
actually interested in hopefully we keep
them but on a smaller scale so what I'm
gonna talk about is a much smaller
lottery which for reasons I was unable
to figure out is often called the
Transylvanian lottery um and in this
lottery instead of 46 different numbers
like in the like in the cash windfall
there's only seven different numbers and
instead of pulling six balls out of the
cage if you do in cash windfall you only
pull three and that reduces the total
number of possible jackpot combinations
to a very small manageable number in
facts so small that have written them
all on this board here are all the ways
the thirty five ways of choosing three
numbers out of seven so for the binomial
theorem fans that is the binomial
coefficient called 7 choose 3 or 35 and
let me also kind of simplify the prize
structure of this game so that we can
kind of see how to think about it in the
Transylvanian lottery there's only two
kinds of prizes there's the jackpot
that's what you get if you um if you
pick if you hit all three numbers and if
you only hit two out of the three you
get a lesser prize let's call it deuce
to remind it to the number two so for
instance if the jackpot winning
combination is 137 if the net if your
ticket says 137 then you have the
jackpot right you have it exactly right
if it says one two seven you have a
deuce and if you have one four five that
overlaps the only one place with the
winning ticket and so you get nothing
so this is how this lottery works um so
what do we do if we're making a big play
in this game we don't have we don't have
to buy 200,000 tickets to make a big
play and the rather small Transylvanian
lottery in fact
just to sort of set ideas let's say a
big player just buy seven tickets so let
me show you what it would look like um
so here's a competition I think I won't
do this on the screen but I will just
tell you that the expected number of
deuces if you buy seven tickets is it's
it's actually 2.4 it's between two and
three and if you look at what happens if
you choose 7 tickets at random and see
how many of these deuce prizes you
expect to win here's what it looks like
and so you can see just as you might
expect the biggest probably the most
likely outcomes are that you get either
2 or you get 3 um but you know you might
get completely shut out it's not that
likely and you might actually do great
and happen to have like lots more deuces
among your among your 7 tickets so what
I want to show you now is a different
way of choosing the 7 tickets one that
is not at all random but one that has
chosen quite carefully so here's my 7
tickets these are the 7 tickets I buy
when I play a Transylvanian lottery and
maybe just to sort of show you what is
special about these um this will be like
the audience participation proportionate
portion of the program if one of you
guys can be the cage and give me like a
random set of 3 numbers between 1 and 7
that would be great you can just shout
it out I don't care where it comes from
okay I gotta get somebody else's chance
one two seven I heard one two seven okay
so let's look and see how I did
if the DAC what cousin 27 okay I look I
hope it when the jackpot no I didn't
okay too bad out amount of luck but
let's see I do have that one two three
so I got a deuce from that and I have a
two four seven so I'm gonna get a deuce
there and I have one six seven I get a
deuce from there and then I think
everything else is a no Preiser right so
I got three deuces okay now I not now
another four five six okay once again I
fail to win the jackpot I see a one four
five let's see if you guys can count as
fast as me um I see a three four six
that's another juice and two five six
ok that's a deuce - and then I think
that's it okay anybody else we're not
gonna do that for that long we got to do
a few to get the idea you guys in the
nines if it was a eight I would
understand but it's Leon um anybody else
one five six I had one five six okay so
I've got a deuce with a one four five
and I've got a deuce - the one six seven
and I have Oh - five six as a deuce
again for that one and then I think
that's it okay so what happened here you
guys through our three random numbers
and each time I got three deuces and
that's no coincidence in fact there's
something quite remarkable about this
set of numbers it has the property that
no matter what numbers are drawn there's
only two things that can happen either I
win the jackpot that's certainly
possible if it's one of my seven members
that it's drawn but if it's any of the
other 28 numbers I get exactly three
deuces now why is that good
let me explain from a financial point of
view why that's good then I'll explain
from a geometric point of view what's
going on um the reason it's good from a
financial point of view is that by
choosing these number
I've instituted what's called a hedge
I've hedged away my risk the expected
value doesn't change and yet I've
eliminated the possibility that I will
get either zero one or two deuces either
I get the jackpot or I get three deuces
now for the expected value to get the
same if I get rid of my risk it means I
have to give something up at the top
right it means I give away the
possibility of really making a lot of
money on each play but in this kind of
game in this kind of context that is
usually considered a good given options
with the same expected value if that
expected value is positive you usually
want to diminish your risk and the
reason that you want to UM well imagine
if you if your business model is that
you are asking everybody in your MIT
dorm to give you all the money they have
and you're gonna go buy lottery tickets
with it if you lose all that money and
then you come back and say but
statistically speaking we're likely to
come out ahead in the long run if you
give me more money that is sort of
preczewski illogical reasons like not
such a winning play so if you're sort of
playing with somebody else's money if
you're relying on borrowing it's really
quite a good thing to hedge away the
risk if you can and this is sort of the
key to the puzzle by choosing the
numbers yourself by not allowing it to
do randomly the expected value is the
same but you can make the risk
completely go away now let me show you
why it works with a picture because it
comes from a somewhat an unexpected
source so so what is this it looks like
a triangle but I what I want to say is
that this is not a triangle this is the
plane okay what do I mean by that maybe
it's better to say it is a plane but
it's a funny kind of plane it's a plane
with only seven points they are marked
and numbered here it's a plane which has
only seven points and also which has
only seven lines most of them looked
like lines on the on the page but one of
them does not one of them is this little
circle thing um but I'm just going to
kind of aggressively say that those
seven
members those black circles are points
and all those little curves have drawn
our lines and then you will note the
seven tickets I bought precisely
correspond to the seven lines so like
here is one two three along the bottom
and that's one of my tickets here is one
six seven which is another one of my
tickets this circular one is two five
six which is one of my tickets and if
you went through each one and looked at
what points were on it there's three
points on each line and then looked at
the seven tickets I'd bought you would
see that they exactly matched
okay well anybody could draw a picture
why do I say this is the plane because
to a modern geometry
geometry is defined by axioms in other
words we say what are points what are
lines well points are things which
behave the way points behave and lines
are behave in the way that lines behave
so in particular why do I see these
things are points and lines well what
are the rules of points of lines it is
that any two points are contained in a
single line and any two lines intersect
in a single point and if you sort of
contemplate this for a while you could
check it exhaustively if you wanted to
you will see that those things are
literally true if I choose any two
points in this diagram there is a unique
line between them in other words they
behave just as lines are supposed to
behave and if you choose any two lines
in this diagram there is a single point
where they meet now by the way that is
actually not exactly the way that lines
behave in our usual plane geometry
what's the difference very did we see
the subtle difference
yeah in regular geometry like we learned
in the ninth grade
we don't say any two lines intersect in
a unique point we say any two lines
intersect and at most one point if
they're parallel they intersect in zero
points otherwise they intersect in
exactly one point okay so that's kind of
disgusting right rules should not have
exceptions rules are much nicer if
they're like literal rules so this
geometry is in fact much better than
Euclid's original one and it's example
of what's called a projective geometry
so this is where in the book I kind of
veer off into talking about Florentine
painting and how people they're sort of
started to understand that when you
paint a picture lines that are in real
life parallel on the painting actually
meet at a point called the vanishing
point these guys as much as I love math
the painters were sort of ahead of us on
this point and understood much better
how to make it geometry in which every
pair of lines met and there was no such
thing as parallel lines and that's the
kind of geometry this geometry is so and
in fact maybe I'll just mention that
then it sort of takes an even farther
Corsa field which I won't talk about in
this talk but it talks about the
relationship of all this stuff to the
dawn of information theory and error
correcting codes and sphere packing
which I mentioned just in order to say
that I get to talk about the work of a
colleague of mine Henry Cohen who is it
the other campus of Microsoft Research
over in New England who is like one of
the world's champion spear Packers I'm
sure a lot of you guys know him so Henry
appears in this book and actually I talk
to him a lot in the course of writing
this chapter so what is the geometry
have to do with the magical lottery
properties I just said well why is it
that I can guarantee that I got three
deuces no matter what the jackpot
numbers was I think it was last million
won five six I think that's what it was
one five six let's look at it here's one
here is five and here's six how did I
know I was gonna win exactly three of
those prizes well I wonder the question
is whom am I gotta get a deuce from the
one and a six do I have a ticket with a
one and a six
I do because there's a line through one
and
six and that's a ticket I have do I have
a ticket with a five and a six I do
because there's a unique line through
those two two points and that's ticket I
have and the same for one and two
through one in which one didn't I say
one in five so the fact that through any
two points there's a unique line is
exactly the same as the fact that for
any two numbers on the jackpot I have
that ticket that guarantees me a deuce
so it's precisely this geometric
property that that gives this particular
choice of tickets it's wonderful feature
and all this and so that same table I
showed you before in the case of this
choice of seven tickets looks completely
different it's so that you have an
eighty percent chance of getting three
deuces and if you don't you're
guaranteed the jackpot so you absolutely
cannot lose and that's because of I
guess I have a slide for this this is
exactly because of the comment that I
made about every two lines intersecting
at a single point and every two points
contained in a single line so this was
for the simple problem not for the vo
cash windfall what about the actual cash
windfall
unfortunately I mean it's not so easy to
make a geometry that exactly matches six
balls out of forty six choices but so I
wrote these guys I was like did you do
something like this and they wouldn't
quite tell me I was able to make contact
with them but they were like well we had
a math guy like he had an algorithm we
don't know if he wants to talk to you
but I blah blah blah so I got kind of
annoyed and then I got kind of obsessed
with like trying to figure out what
these guys did and in the end I came to
I came across a paper from 1976 by a guy
called rhf denistoun in the field known
as combinatorial designs and using this
very beautiful construction of his I was
able to cook up a way of buying about
two hundred and twenty thousand tickets
which gave you a near guarantee that you
would win five out of these five hundred
six prizes so it had the expected value
that all of these that any choice is
this many tickets would have but it
reduces the risk of losing almost to
zero so I don't know if this particular
combinatorial design
is what they used or if they used
something like this at all but if they
didn't I think they should have done so
I'll stop there this is a picture of the
book although I guess you guys can see
it behind you so you don't need to and
I'll take questions thank you very much
so the question I'm sorry doing that is
like this sort of the beginning of the
theory of combinatorial designs in that
particular picture is called the Fano
plane so it was from a guy called Gino
Fano from the end of the 19th century
who was he was one of the first people
to really think about geometry in this
axiomatic way it's a point of view we
sort of think of as associated with
Hilbert but a Fano is one of the first
where and I there's a quote in a book
it's in Italian I can't rember it in
English either but it basically says he
sort of very forcefully says like well
when I say a point in a line I mean
things that are bei the axioms and we
have to sort of free ourselves from this
tyranny of thinking about what things
look like on the page and work in this
sort of completely abstract realm of
like which things obey the rules of
points and lines and that was what
enable him to make this this kind of
progress so for the fans of finite
fields in the room and I'm sure there
are some another way to describe this
thing it is that it's the projective
plane over the finite field of two
elements that's what we would call it
today I'm not sure of faunal himself
thought of it that way but that's the
way a modern kind of number theorist or
geometry would would refer to it yeah in
the back what surprised me the most I
mean I knew that I liked to go on and on
but I didn't really know and understand
how much because when you start to
research this stuff everything connects
to something else and you're like oh my
god this is crazy how can I not talk
about this so I submitted a proposal
when I sold this book originally that
had 18 chapters and then at some point I
had written three of them and I had
about 300 pages and so I had to have
kind of a hard conversation with penguin
where I said do you more want an
eighteen hundred page book that you'll
get like seven years from now
or do you more want me just to write
like five of these chapters and they I
think thankfully for everyone involved
with their good commercial instincts
said we just want you to write five of
the chapters and that will be fine so
that's um so yeah I mean when you sort
of go into the history and go into the
connections between the different parts
of math you just fall down like
infinitely many rabbit holes and then
inside each of those infinitely many
rabbit holes like like another exciting
rabbit like running away down another
corridor and so I think that's what I
found surprising I mean it's a lot of
stuff this is a good example of
something that I didn't even know this
story when I proposed the book I sort of
came across it while I was doing
something else and I was like oh my god
I have to write like 75 pages about this
yeah I understand where you were going
with the story but what's the broader
message of your book well I think the
broader message of the book is that for
people who have been trained to think of
mathematics as this kind of separate
system right that takes place in its own
world that doesn't hook up with the
ordinary things that we do I think it's
a very wrong way to think of it like I
want to show how mathematical thinking
is it's not separate it's tied up with
all the other kinds of thinking that we
do it's not something we another way to
say this is not something we do instead
of thinking it's sort of a formalized
and strengthened version of our thinking
so I cuz I'll come back again and again
to explaining something that to me as
part of mathematics I'll certainly
explain it mathematically and do
computations in blah-de-blah but in the
end it's common sense it's but it's a
strengthened version of common sense
oh so I mean I it's like picking from
your children I'll just say one thing
that's tremendously exciting especially
for somebody like me who comes from
number theory is what's going on in like
machine learning and what you might call
the new statistics because this is an
area where you know if you do number
theory you're working in an area that
people have been mining for literally
2,000 years right it's a very old
subject there's a huge learning curve
right
everything that's easy has been done
already if you have an idea you get
excited about you tell somebody and
they're like oh that's great but people
try this in 1930 you know this happens a
lot in number theory in machine learning
you talk to the cheap one it's
tremendously exciting it's a brand new
field that's being created under your
feet as you go everything is up for
grabs including like what the field
should be called what it's about who
should be doing it etc etc and when you
have an idea and you tell the people
they'll say like oh that's a good idea
but somebody did it like six months ago
and I think for somebody who works in a
very old field like me
there's a wonderful appeal to that kind
of stuff and I think just the fact that
it's a field that we don't know what
it's gonna look like five years from now
ten years ago I think is tremendously
exciting
yeah on the back when I was looking up
the book online there was at a glance
I'd like the freakonomics of math were
you influenced by fine this thing that
said that this could be distributed
outside Microsoft and yet maybe I should
though it's somewhat risky to me to
reveal that I have not actually read
that book yet I'm building my own book
as the Freakonomics of math let me
defend myself for doing that um so while
I haven't read Freakonomics EDD I've
read a lot of their columns and like
their articles and stuff like that that
make up the book and what those guys
have done and not just them by the way
but Paul Krugman and other sort of
outward facing economists as well it's
not just that they've written their own
books they've taken ideas which
previously were kind of inside the
academic silo of economics and they have
made them so popular that they become
part of the common discourse right the
people now it's ordinary to read the
paper and read something about
incentives or read something about
diminishing returns or something like
that and you read that not just in the
business section or not just in
something that is an economics column
but anywhere in the newspaper right I
think all of us and I'm just one person
doing this but all of us who are in the
project and outward facing mathematics
want to take some of these mathematical
notions like expected value like
regression to the mean
like linearity like like formalism like
some of these things I talked about in
the book some of the big themes of the
book things that all my petitions sort
of know what they mean and know the sort
of breadth of their explanatory force
and kind of make it safe and normal for
people who are not mathematicians and
not writing in the science section of
the paper to use those notions in
everyday life so I think that's that's
the sense in which I think my project is
the same kind of project as the
freakanomics project yeah weird kind of
game of telephone with British
newspapers where it somehow came to be
common knowledge that apparently I'm a
expert in airport studies so what this
is refers to a section of the book right
about a famous old dictum of The
Economist George Stigler who said that
if you never miss an airplane you're
spending too much time in the airport um
I'll stand by that but what's being
expressed there am I allowed to write on
this actually can't do this it's just
this picture here's the picture this is
everything you need to know okay there
it is that's the explanation now it's
home so so what does that mean it means
that in terms of your sort of the
overall benefit of your strategy if you
leave in the morning for a flight that's
a night
you're clearly wasting a lot of your own
time right there's such a thing as
arriving too early and there's such a
thing as arriving too late or you're
essentially certain to miss your flight
so somehow the optimum is somewhere in
between where there's some nonzero
chance of missing your flight I mean it
might be small but it's not zero and
that's that's exactly what Stigler is
saying but I mean I think somehow that
got translated to the people thinking I
was gonna say like here is the exact
number down to the minute and obviously
that's gonna vary depending on your
personality depending on context
actually one thing I learned from what
people said about that is that there are
people who actually love hanging out at
the airport I didn't know that I thought
that had negative utility for everyone
but apparently there are people who are
like but then you get to shop with the
duty-free shop the duty-free shop is
terrible compared to a regular shop I
don't really understand but I've learned
that a lot of people it's like the
highlight of their week to like go to
the duty-free shop and so so yeah that's
that's all that's all that I mean it's
it's the same thing I say in the book is
as you know if your government doesn't
waste any money you're spending too much
money fighting government waste
it's like um yeah I talked a bit about
Bush versus Gore some of you in the room
are too young to remember this
terrifyingly enough so there were these
two guys who wanted to be President
anyway um so actually I think that would
have been a great moment for
mathematicians to stand up and say that
that question doesn't really have an
answer we don't we I said we really
cannot know who got more votes I think
that's fair to say
and so I write about that in in a book
as an example of the fundamental
formalism of our legal system and I
think it would have been if I mean that
people were probably had more pressing
things to worry about but if it's been
considered an opportunity for math
education people it would have been a
nice time to sort of stand up and say
this is a formalist moment where we
accept that we don't actually know who
got more votes and we say there's a
procedure and whatever the procedure
says that's who's president but we don't
pretend that somebody one or somebody
lost in the sense of like actually got
more votes so that's why I talked about
Derek Jeter and you know the the sort of
famous dictum of bill Klem the great
national league umpire who said of the
question of like you know do you ever
miss a bara strike he said it ain't
nothing until I call it know I'm the
prime fires decision makes reality in
the same way that our legal system for
better or for worse this Supreme Court
decision creates the reality it doesn't
it doesn't observe reality yeah the
probability of you're running into a
subject from your book some other
problem actually I made it when I told
the story I made it sound like you just
showed up to make the story a little
better but if you're gonna press me on
it yes I emailed him to say I was gonna
be in ballad oh yeah well does your
power of mathematical thinking so one
thing I tried you know one thing I tried
to do in the book I'm I think of course
out on the world all of us who work in
quantitative fields feel that in general
the world's not quantitatively inclined
enough right we can't help but the other
way at the same time there is kind of on
the other side a danger of what you
might call math supremacy and feeling
like in the end we'll sort of achieve
some kind of apotheosis where we can
just like sort of sit and compute about
stuff instead of thinking about stuff
and I think it's to the extent that's a
danger it's important to push back on it
and sort of talk about the limits and I
do that
I mean that actually especially comes up
in the part about real in the parts
about religion or there's like such a
long tradition of people kind of
desperately and wistfully hoping that
mathematics will help them find the way
out of the conundrums of faith and I
think every attempt like that has
completely like fallen down and failed
like I think that is not a question
about which math gives an answer one way
or the other I mean lots of people have
said that it did at least on my
assessment all those attempts are
failures and I think that's sort of one
place in the book which is return to
several times where you see that we have
to have math with us all the time but
not only math yeah what so my really bad
experience with math it's only after
getting out of school I have an 8 year
old son so I'm and I don't want him to
have the same challenges that I had when
I was a kid
curious to know what your thoughts are
on math education yes and I talked about
that a little bit directly in the book
but here's what I would say here's one
thing that makes it so hard I think when
I started out teaching and learning how
to teach I was like I'm gonna find out
the best way to do this and do it right
cuz that's how we approach a lot of
problems that we have to attack and over
the years what I've come to feel is that
one of the fundamental challenges of
teaching is that kids are really
different from each other like really
different and there is not a best way so
sort of something that we do that's
gonna engage one population of kids is
gonna completely bore another and so
what you hated in school there were
probably other kids who liked and
something that would have worked well
for you probably would have turned off
somebody else and so I think as teachers
the best that we can try to do is to
kind of broadcast on all channels and
do things in a lot of different ways to
maximize the chance that like each
student finds that thing that hooks into
them that thing that enables them to
engage with the mathematics I mean I
think it's a phenomenally hard challenge
and I think I mean one reads my hedges
because as somebody who teaches in
university our teaching conditions are
so completely different from somebody
who's teaching eight-year-olds they are
under the constraints of knowing that
their students are going to be taking
like a test that has high stakes for
both them and for the teacher and for
the principal and for the school so it's
easy for me to say like oh they should
do this and they should do that but
they're under very serious constraints
and I think well maybe one thing that's
not talked about enough we talk a lot
about what the teachers should do but in
a world in which the teachers actions
are so highly constrained by the tests I
think it's important to remember that
the people who write the tests have a
massive amount of responsibility on
their shoulders in that system to create
tests the tests what we want to test I
mean that I mean that's one thing I
think that does matter I'm gonna talk
about it I'll take more I mean boy that
really depends on the eight and nine
year old I I mean I think when I was
that age I feel like the the Bible and
the Torah and the Quran of my life was
girl Asher Bock which I did not
understand but I think what's amazing
about that book is that it has so many
different parts of so many different
levels of difficulty but all of its deep
the easier parts and the difficult parts
so I feel like at least for me that was
like a huge portal into like what
mathematics really was and when I was
nine I probably just read the parts with
the talking animals and then like each
time but I would cut it was fascinating
and each time I would come back to it
and each time like we'd more and each
time get more of the parts that I
couldn't so I would say that's not
particularly number theory but I would
say that book and then of course the
Martin Gardner books I mean like nobody
has even though those books are 50 years
old like nobody has really
what he did in the way of math
exposition and there's like God knows
how many there's like 25 volumes of his
scientific American columns I actually
just bought two of them for my
eight-year-olds I'll report back as to
whether he likes that oh thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
