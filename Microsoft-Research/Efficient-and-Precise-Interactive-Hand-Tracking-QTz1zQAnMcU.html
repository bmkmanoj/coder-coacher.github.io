that unencumbered fully articulated 3d
hand tracking will open the door to a
new class of user interface such a
technology will let users feel a visual
connection with their virtual hand and a
metaphor of direct physical interaction
with the virtual world will free
interaction designers to give us new
user interfaces represent a robust
efficient long and short range hand
tracker which while just another step
towards this goal has allowed us to
prototype new experiences which help us
to envision this radically new future
from direct analog input to physical
interactions that come close to a haptic
experience our paper introduces the
algorithmic tools required to deliver
such state-of-the-art
accuracy and efficiency our system takes
3d points directly from the depth sensor
and fits a smooth surface model to the
data using the Levenberg algorithm for
energy minimization we now slow the
sequence down to see each Levenberg
iteration we see that unlike ICP our
algorithm updates both correspondences
in blue and posed in concert meaning
that three to four iterations are
sufficient for accurate tracking
reinitialize our proposals in every
frame mean that we can quickly recover
from tracking failures we compare
quantitatively to other trackers on
standard test sequences and our accuracy
exceeds or matches state-of-the-art like
the h track system from tagless a key
itaú comparing qualitatively to their
work we see that on high-end hardware
both systems cope well with low
occlusion and struggle with fists
our reinitialize errs allow for slightly
quickly recovery from tracking failure
our true advantage over age track is in
greater efficiency stemming in part from
faster convergence joint optimization
yields over ICP this is despite the use
of a more detailed smooth surface model
rather than just a collection of
cylinders further efficiency comes from
massively subsampling the data which
surprisingly yields very little impact
on accuracy this allows us to run the
tracker on just a lightweight tablet
with his quest for efficiency it may
appear surprising to insist on a smooth
surface model but the smoothness of the
model is necessary to allow the use of
the Levenberg algorithm robust
performance requires a strong
reinitialize ER to complement the
tracking component our work has reduced
but not eliminated the limitations that
hand trackers have been struggling with
since 1993 occlusion segmentation
failure and noisy data nonetheless we
believe the components we described will
form an important part of future
real-time tracking systems we conclude
with the collection of experiences our
primary user interaction paradigm is
direct physical manipulation of virtual
user interface elements such as buttons
dials sliders anything the designer
feels might leverage the users
real-world experience even without
haptic feedback this is a compelling
experience and users report a real sense
of ownership of their virtual hand the
use of paper-thin elements provide proxy
optics that further embed this illusion
this metaphor makes it simple to
implement a computer keyboard or piano
less physical concepts like laser
fingers and pointing and clicking are
also surprisingly easy to pick up direct
analog input is also useful here the
hand position and orientation controller
spaceship while other prototypes have
mapped the user thumbs to a game
controller thumb stick in this
two-handed interaction the sub-dominant
hand holds a pallet while the dominant
hand controls both position and brush
size as analog inputs the final sequence
is of a video game created by a team of
just three master students using a unity
plugin built on this technology the user
is huge
a giant character whose hands interact
with the world to help the game
characters achieve their goals
to conclude we believe that our
introduction of smooth surface modeling
and joint optimization of both hand pose
and correspondences will prove to be a
key enabler to future hand tracking
based user interfaces</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
