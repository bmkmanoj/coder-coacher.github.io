you
hello everybody welcome it is my
pleasure today to introduce Colleen she
Styles shields i should say from
Northwestern University and it's my
pleasure to have her and her colleague
Steven here today to talk about the very
very fascinating work they're doing
doing mobile behavioral interventions
she is associated with the Feinberg
School of Medicine and also another
Center for behavioral technologies that
she will tell you about anyway her work
is very complementary to the work we've
been doing in this area and I'm super
happy she's here so take it away calling
thank you okay thank you very much Mary
I'm absolutely thrilled to be here so I
as well as being from the Feinberg
School of Medicine I'm also from the
Center for behavioral intervention
technologies and I come from this with a
background in social work as well as
clinical psychology so aside from just
being thrilled to be here in general I'm
really excited for hopeful hopefully
good discussions that come afterwards
given the varied expertise in this room
and beyond so yeah today I'm we talking
a little bit about a different way to
improve behavioral intervention
technologies and that's through
harnessing more human features of the
apps so to start off I'm going to start
off with the very obvious problem and
that is the pervasive nature of mental
health problems in a given year nineteen
percent of the US population will meet
criteria for a mental health disorder
which translates to roughly 58 million
adults in need of mental health services
a year and to put this into perspective
21 to 30 million per year that's
depression alone it's a fair number of
people however out of that roughly 58
million people only twenty one percent
are receiving adequate care now
surprisingly given the number of
undergrads you find on a college campus
that say that their psych majors the
issue of pervasive mental health is for
further compounded by the we simply
don't have enough behavioral change
professionals in the field to meet this
need of 58 million people you're
requiring treatment we actually have
currently about half of what we need
which is around 300,000 further their
access bear
years beyond the number in our workforce
so for example time constraints there's
a lot of people who work full-time have
childcare have a commute so maybe
they've got 30 minutes on their lunch
break and that's really all they can
give lack of access or geography
conveniently there's a lot of therapists
in Seattle there are a lot of therapists
in Chicago but unfortunately a lot of
places in our country there aren't a lot
of therapists in some areas further
costs not only the cost of going to
therapy because insurance doesn't cover
a lot but costs of maybe childcare
transportation a lot of hidden costs and
transportation as well so I actually see
a family at the University of Chicago
right now that takes about two buses
across an hour and a half to two hours
each way to come and see me each week
and Chicago does not have winters like
Seattle so not only are they waiting for
two buses but they're waiting for two
buses and very bitter cold I don't think
I could actually overcome that barrier
and I'm impressed that they do and
finally there are symptoms inherent in
certain conditions that really are going
to interfere with maintenance and
initiation so depression for example we
expect people with depression to have
low motivation to have things that
aren't really feeling that fun for them
so it's already kind of hard to get them
out the door to get to these things so
taken together changes in treatment
delivery are necessary to reach more
people and overcome these barriers cue
the entrance of behavioral intervention
technologies which I will hereafter
referred to as bits so bits are
applications that use technology such as
mobile phones computers tablets and
sensors to support behaviors that
improve health mental health and overall
well-being now I say bits rather than am
health or e health because I'm really
focusing on the technologies that are
focused on behavioural change
specifically and not broader
technologies and health so that's why
I'm kind of sectioning out bits from the
overall umbrella on health and e-health
and as the title may indicate bits or a
major focus of my lab the Center for
behavioral intervention technologies or
see vets now today and be focusing on
bits delivered through smartphones and I
chose this focus for a few reasons so
smart phones are rapidly ink
using and computing capacity while
dropping in costs they also overcome a
variety of disparities so for example
ethnic minorities are more likely than
Caucasians to own a smartphone to access
the web via phone or to download health
apps apps in general so for this reason
and more they're forecasted to be the
dominant platform for communications AB
and web access so it's probably a good
idea if we figure out how and why bits
work on them so what do we know so far
well good news and bad news I'm someone
who likes to get the bad news out the
way first so let's jump in well there
are a lot of health apps and many of
them are geared towards mental health
they're really not getting downloaded
they're really skewed to a very small
number and further that if they are
downloaded they're really not getting
used so in 2014 a group looked at a
commercial diet app of roughly 200,000
apps downloads excuse me and
eighty-eight point 86.4 were never used
eleven percent were tried a few times
and 2.6 use it 10 times or more now the
2.6 these were people who are already
engaged in diet tracking so really not
the people we're having trouble really
the people that they're trying to target
to help them track their diet
additionally if you think about
treatments for depression for instance
something that happens less than 10
times is probably not going to have a
huge intervention punch and especially
is going to give you a lot to monitor so
that two point six of 10 times or more
is a really really big problem because
that means that people are not getting
the dosage they're not getting their
treatment they're likely not going to
get better just general house at what
was the first parts artistics different
than statistic for just random apps mr.
so our people are more or less using
behavioral change ads so again if you'll
take just for thousands so randoms a set
of 40,000
you again you'll see some some kind of
long tail distribution of of usage wait
do you know if it's similar to what you
see here is it better worse just I think
that's a great question and to be honest
I don't think I'm well informed enough
in the literature of the overall usage
of apps across the board but what I can
say is from the health apps I and
specifically the mental health appt side
that this study is pretty representative
that like the the tail office it's just
terrible so I wish I could speak to the
broader community and how that looks
across like entertainment apps I'm going
to do that after this talk I'm sure and
check that out so thank you um okay so
this is the bad news good news I get to
work with a bunch of scary smart people
who are part of a larger community of
very very smart people that are trying
to figure multiple ways of getting to
this problem of how it can get people to
use the apps more get the treatment get
the dosage so as a psychologist I am
personally interested in addressing this
problem in seeing how relationships may
be able to help people use bits more so
the solution boils down to two main
approaches the first one is to harness
human connection with helping
professionals whether or connected
health for instance so whether that's a
known person or an unknown person the
users being connected with secondly we
can harness the human connection that
might be seen within the interactions
with the app so let's first discuss the
rule of human relationships with beds in
apps so in 2011 more and colleagues
proposed the support of accountability
model to provide a framework to what the
evidence was saying and the evidence was
saying that adherence to bits is
benefited by human support the human
support provided by a helping
professional which I'll call a coach for
right now enhances adherence to
prescribe behaviors in the bed through a
few ways so first the coach must be seen
as demonstrating behaviors consistent
with bond so liking trust respect and
was also be seen as someone that's
benevolent and having the necessary
expertise for their role further the
coach must complete very specific
behaviors
so for instance framing the relationship
is one with reciprocity so the patient
can expect very specific benefits from
the coach if they both do what they
agreed to do and what is agreed upon
must be done so collaboratively defining
very clear goals and expectations from
the start and that you know these goals
are clear to the point that the patient
also really gets why they're happening
and how they're related to what their
overall treatment goal is and finally
it's it's got to be clear that
performance monitoring will occur and
it's not to wag a finger if someone
really doesn't do what they're supposed
to do it so that the coach can really
help the user to use the bit to its full
potential so it's clear from the
beginning that the coach is going to
kind of see what the user puts into the
bed so taken together the the ideas if
they're seeing a certain way and they
performing certain actions
accountability will increase now the
supportive accountability model predicts
that adherence as it hands to these
support variables provided by the coach
however this relationship to adherence
is believed to be mediated by the users
motivation so if a user is really high
motivation they probably need less
communication from their coach but if
flow they probably need a lot more now
the tricky thing is conditions like
depression we expect that people are
gonna start with a low motivation and
hopefully with symptom improvement get
to a higher motivation but if you have
any experience with treating mental
health disorders you know that it's
really not a linear relationship from
this step to this step it's a lot more
of a tango going out of two steps
forward one step back so this mediation
really needs to be monitored carefully
based on where the motivation is that
that communication can adjust
appropriately so that the overall
adherence improves okay so to understand
this idea a little bit butter let's look
at a couple of ways this has been put
into place so taking examples from
treating depression the most common
treatment for depression is actually
through antidepressant medication as
most people go to their physician for
medication primary care is there
therefore the de facto treatment site
for the treatment of depression but it
has really bad outcomes so only twenty
percent are typically symptom free after
eight months of treatment
and that's not really good average now
the reason this happens is usually
attributed to poor adherence from the
patients they're really not taking the
medications the way they were prescribed
to when they were prescribed to
additionally physicians really have this
communication barrier where they do not
follow up to optimize the dose and
they're missing a lot of information
from the patient so a target for
harnessing support of accountability in
the treatment of depression in primary
care is the existing helping
relationship between a patient and their
physician for this purpose see bits is
developed medlink which is designed to
increase adherence and accountability
for people with depression initiating a
new antidepressant medication it does
this by bolstering the reciprocity in
the existing relationship between the
patient and the physician and since it's
an already existing relationship we
start with the assumption that the bond
and some trust in the expertise is
already there but will be really
bolstered by increasing communication
and transparency between the two now the
meddling system does a lot of really
cool things but I'm going to be keeping
it kind of a higher level as a poet to
what supports the supportive
accountability model so on the patient
end they're provided a medlink app and a
cellular ly enabled pillbox which
detects if their daily dose of
medication has been taken and one now
the data from the pillbox as well as
data from weekly assessments that are
conducted through the app provides
information to the patient about if and
one it might be recommended they reach
out to the provider additionally it's
made very clear to them what data their
provider will be getting from this
entire system and that's something a
usability testing that patients were
really responsive to because they they
noted a lot of failure points in the
relationship so when they get into the
office they kind of don't really
remember what the major problems were
with their minds when they are at home
or they give really inaccurate data or
just the experience that a lot of us
have had you go into your primary care
doctors office and it's very clear they
have a very short amount of time to be
with you and that's kind of hard to
overcome sometimes that feeling of no no
no please please sit and wait and listen
to all my problems so they were really
excited that their physicians would get
this data and no it was accurate without
them really having to do that themselves
now on the physician side the data is
collected and combined into this
position information from which you see
here and includes depression scores over
time side effects information as well as
adherence now Mary canine do they do
that every day every week mm-hmm every
week and we adjust the phq to the one
week time frame as well so it's also not
collecting two weeks of information
every week so the information so the
depression scores over time the side
effects the adherence these are all
decision points that would really help
the physician to figure out what contact
they want to have with their patient if
they want to change those if they need
to provide some psychoeducation about
common side effects for instance and how
long they might expect that to be this
is really helpful information but
usually is something the position just
doesn't have especially if the patient
isn't calling to schedule an appointment
in the first place so with the
information that both parties have the
expectation about each role becomes much
more explicit there's a lot more
communication and there's a lot more
follow-up of what each side is doing
sure pt9 are you eat and then assume
outside of this particular questionnaire
good question so the weekly
questionnaire includes the phq-9 and
then they get the prize and if necessary
the FIP sir as well so we get over all
information about what domains of side
effects are having and then what impact
it's having as well so we can track that
change as well cuz it's it's expected
that in the first four weeks you're
going to get some side effects going
thus far it's been okay we've tried to
streamline it as much as possible um and
that's why and forgive me I want to say
that the phipps or is the optional one
based on how they answer the prize so if
the side effects aren't too impairing
their just taking two rather short ones
and we've built into the assessment
model that based on how the answer they
get specific didactic content afterwards
so we kind of tried to note that as a
benefit to the patient that like the
information you're giving is now
going to go to your physician but like
you're also going to get some real time
feedback about it so so far so good that
people are answering it we also are
benefited from the fact that in a
research lab we have research assistants
that are also following up pretty
carefully so this isn't this isn't real
world yet we'd like it to be but still
too early the beauty of research
assistant so they'll follow up make sure
things are answered so applying this
model to this problem sounds pretty good
right I'm painting a nice picture well
what is the data tell us so far so in an
ongoing field trial of med blank all
patients were taking their meds to the
first four weeks which is one of our
assessment time points the average
adherence was eighty-four percent with
five taking every day two missing but
once a week and one person missing more
than once a week now the exciting thing
about that one person is because of the
data we were getting through the app we
know that they were not totally being
adherent more so because of their side
effects and the reason that's exciting
is because if that's something that's
communicated to their physician that's a
really adjustable problem whether
through psychoeducation or just playing
with the meds a little bit so
eighty-four percent in school it be a be
right like how's that sound well
compared to what usually is happening at
Primary Care within the first four weeks
only about forty percent are still
taking their meds so yes this is the
field trial yes it's eight people but
we're pretty excited about that be so
far additionally the depression severity
is improving likely because they're
getting the treatment and follow-up
that's really recommended for their
depression and a further reflection of
this is that the communication and
follow up between the patients and
physicians is so much higher than is
typically seen in the first four weeks
so seven of our eight patients had some
type of physician follow-up so 6 office
visits for phone calls and two messages
through the EMR system and again this
that this level of communication is
really unheard of in primary care
between the physician and patient so
we're pretty excited now
again we'll learn a lot more when the
randomized control trial starts which is
pretty soon but this is exciting initial
field field data that the supportive
accountability model of connecting a
patient with a known provider it seems
to be helping you sit in adherence which
therefore helps overall treatment goals
but what about harnessing supportive
accountability without having a known
person to hook them up with which is
usually what we're dealing with well to
examine that will consider the other way
of treating depression which is therapy
so the therapy with the greatest
evidence base and the treatment of
depression is cognitive behavioral
therapy or CBT and as the name suggests
CBT targets depression through
interventions related to changing
cognitions and behavior to ultimately
impact mood now bits therefore take
intervention principles from CBT and
attempt to change make changes in
thoughts and behaviors over time however
if this is happening face-to-face a
person be paired with a therapist and
that would be the known provider but the
bit is sort of taking the role of the
therapist so what human support can be
there for harness well that's where the
term coach comes back in and that's
where we're harnessing support with an
unknown person that's new to the bit
user so coaching for bits to become
common due to improved adherence
associated with coach involvement which
really started being noticed in
web-based bits so the coaching user they
meet over the phone there's no
face-to-face interaction whatsoever and
then have weekly 5 to 15 minute sorry
minute phone calls that can be replaced
by messaging after a certain point or
messaging concur with the phone calls as
well now the coaches role is to use the
support of accountability model to
increase adherence and help the user to
use the bit in the best way possible for
them to get the treatment so as coaches
are not actually therapists this also
increases generalizability in practice
because it really increases the number
of people who might be able to fill this
role which is one of the barriers we're
trying to target we just don't have
enough behavioural change specialists so
it's exciting that overcomes this
barrier and has positive outcomes the
other thing we're starting to notice in
the data is that
having this expectation that there's
going to be this phone call or this
message once a week really helps
establishing some usage patterns similar
to how you might you know scrounge and
do your homework right before a class
people are really logging in to the bit
to use it immediately before or after
their coaching call and what we've
noticed is the most successful users are
the ones that get sort of into this
pattern people who maybe even do like a
Friday Saturday Sunday pattern and the
coaching contact is really increasing
the accountability to kind of get them
into a pattern even if it's just around
that coaching call well so right now
they're technically technically right
now the coaches that we are using our
therapist but we are working to increase
this model that it could just be be a
level people that are very trained in
the bit so they have that expertise
which is part of the model but you don't
necessarily do cbt it's really the bit
that's going to be the cpt great
questions so the first call is usually a
little bit longer it's a little bit more
of a walkthrough and getting some
history gathering but otherwise kind of
going back sorry to the model it's the
calls usually start off by the coach
acknowledging like what they notice in
terms of the usage say use like a
thought tracker the coach might make a
comment of like oh I really saw that the
thought tracker was used really well
this weekend like you really using those
principles or yeah you were using the
thought tracker and I'm a little
confused about so the data you were
putting in and I want to make sure that
this is really a helpful tool for you so
following the model it starts off with
really that the expertise and the
accountability and kind of showing what
each side has done and what gold what
work they've done towards their goals
but then there's a little bit of the
bond as well you know how are you doing
how are things going and then the unless
there's any explicit questions then it's
kind of the goal setting the next week
because it's really trying to teach them
certain skills from cbt so you know what
skills that you're really going to
practice important to use with the bit
in
life this week the difference like if
without this app but having the
therapist calling in in a same frequency
will that achieve the same result or
does the app which actually finds the
real users really matter because if
you're just the calling to ask him hey
have you take the pill he probably won't
tell you a lie right i mean i think it's
it's interesting and that's a lot of the
questions like going back to our
muddling cap it there's a lot of
information they want relate in a
certain way but they said that it's
easier sometimes to tell a nap then a
human calling and checking in so yeah
it's a different okay did I get to get
to your question okay okay moving back
okay so another thing that we've noticed
is that when we create bits without
coaching there seems to be a request for
in the user feedback we receive
particularly around the guidance in
using the bit effectively so we've
gotten responses like you know I'd
really like more leading to help walk
you through the features really know
when I should be using it or i'd like
more discussion questions or
encouragement of how to use and I could
really use more instruction so people
kind of want that extra human support to
help them use the tool the way it was
designed to and give them that in court
encouragement and support additionally
when coaching is provided bond is
usually very often noted as well as
improved confidence in using the bit to
its full potential so we get things like
it's really nice to talk to the coaches
having that interaction is helpful I was
able to read through the notes from the
coaching call to figure out feature
functions later on my own and this is
really the key to we want people to feel
empowered to have the information that
you know I know how to use this right
and I can do this on my own in real life
mm-hmm right it's to coach them to use
the app yeah so as much of our coaching
data so far has been related to web
based interventions I also want to
provide a snapshot of what we've seen so
far in our coach taps so we have an app
called mobilize which we did an
eight-week pilot for in the last year
with a sample of eight and mobilize has
didactic content through text video and
audio interactive tools notifications
and feedback and through the eight-week
trial we had six participants complete
all eight weeks again six out of eight
you kind of go out but I keep thinking
back to that two-point-six percent that
use the health app more than ten times
so this is a different ratio than we
were expecting based on what the data
was already giving us and further it
goes back to if the support of
accountability model is really
bolstering the use then people are
actually getting a higher dosage of
treatment and that seems to be impacting
the depression so we had significant
scores in every measure depression we
had at the pre and post
again it's only eight people we're going
to do much larger trials but so far so
good so the takeaway here appears to be
that human support has some real
benefits bolstering bits with human
support with a known person like a
primary care physician or an unknown
person like a coach harness is
supportive accountability through bond
and legitimacy to increase explicit
accountability on both parts this seems
to increase use in adherence which means
participants are getting a higher dosage
of treatment which appears to be
benefiting their depression which is
really our goal in giving out these bits
again I'm going to set the the stars of
my presentation or actual see bits
people's that's why maybe it's not quite
a great quality picture but wanted to
mention that on the slide okay so now
we're going to shift gears a little bit
so the second way of improving adherence
and use of bits delivered through apps
is through design them in very specific
social ways so before i get to
explaining what that means let me back
up and briefly explain what led to this
idea and why we think it's important so
we're actually going to back up to me
being a wide I 22 year-old fresh out of
undergrad and starting my first first
clinical internship and the first time I
sat down with a client and really felt
this strong mutual connection internally
I was like wow this is a really cool
feeling and I need to find out how to
make this happen more well that really
cool feeling is a lot better known as
therapeutic alliance therapeutic
alliance was defined by borden in the
70s as the relational bond formed
between a therapist and client through
collaborative work mutual trust and
establishing and reaching treatment
goals now usually this construct is
broken down into their goal agreement
task agreement and bond now these
probably sound like familiar constructs
based on the support of accountability
model we were just talking about and
that's actually not a coincidence
because beyond feeling cool therapeutic
alliance is really an important factor
in mental health treatment so for
example and see
BTW which we discussed a few minutes ago
which has the strongest evidence base
for the treatment of depression
therapeutic alliance is given this title
of a critical nonspecific factor so what
that means is the level of therapeutic
alliance that is found between the
therapist and client when they're doing
therapy is an important predictor of how
well the therapy does regardless of
really what is set in the room so it
their vehicle lines is not if you picked
up a cbt book they mentioned that it's
great because it's this important credit
critical nonspecific factor but it's not
one of the specific change tactics of
CBT it's not targeting the cognitions
it's not targeted targeting behavior
it's simply the feeling between the
person and their therapist and again
it's kind of broken down to are we
really agreeing on my overall goals for
treatment are we really agreeing on the
tasks that are going to get us there and
do I really feel like I like this person
and this person respects me that's
really I mean strangely it took us a
really long time to figure this out
bored and discovered this in the 70s and
as you know for it's been around a lot
longer so we kind of came to realize
that sometimes how the person feels
about the therapist is actually much
more important than what the therapist
is saying so okay therapeutic alliance
is a big deal so more exciting because
I'm someone who's interested in both
telehealth and bit work recent findings
also indicate that therapeutic alliance
can be effectively established without
visual cues so in fact when we compared
therapeutic alliance ratings for 162
people who were randomized to face to
face CBT to 163 people who are
randomized to telephone CB cbt never
laid eyes on their therapist never saw a
picture of their therapist well we found
that there were no significant
differences in readings of therapeutic
alliance from both the therapist and
client perspective of both treatments
and at these similar readings were
consistent across treatment duration now
the even more exciting thing is that
without those visual cues the people who
are in the telephone administered CBT
their level of therapeutic alliance was
just as important as predicting how well
they would do in their treatment as it
was for the face-to-face folks so I get
like this is the stuff that I geeked out
about because I get really excited about
the human connection and the fact that
you can take someone I could call
someone in Utah for instance and never
lay eyes on them never see a picture of
them and they could feel just as
connected and feel like we're just on
task with the goals and tap goals and
tasks as I would with someone who is
down the street from me in Chicago and
coming into an office so really exciting
at the same time that we were making
these out finding these outcomes in
telehealth I was also conducting
usability testing for a medlin gap now
despite me sitting down next to each
participant that came in and really
asking you know how well the app is
working and how well it's meeting their
needs based on how we designed it their
word choices were really interesting so
I got a lot of oh look it totally knew
what I was thinking or I feel like this
just knows me and what I didn't get a
remember from my doctor they really
never said anything about the designers
or see bits or even me I didn't design
it but I was the human they're
representing that it was a lot more
about the apps choices and behaviors
which kind of struck me so I started
feeling more like I was getting
information about a being rather than an
amp and it led me to two questions first
do people have sort of a social response
to technology and if so is there a way
that we can harness that and build a
relationship that similar to therapeutic
alliance to increase the use and
outcomes well those questions let me
straight to those two men Byron Reeves
and Clifford Nass who in 1996 literally
wrote the book on the money studies
their group had conducted regarding a
phenomenon referred to as a computers as
social actors or casa paradigm now I
imagine a lot of you are probably
familiar with this work I however was
brand new to it so bear with me as I
walk you through my thought process a
little bit Casa holds that people treat
computing technology as social actors
and conform to the same social behavior
say word with other people even though
they would think it unreasonable be
polite for example two piece of
machinery so to give an example of this
can I ask for two brave volunteers for a
very quick poll those two hands went up
first who wants to go first okay okay um
how am i doing with the presentation so
far oh thank you thank you how am i
doing great right cool thank you all
right um glad to hear it that's kind of
feedback I enjoy getting um however it's
likely that there was some social
influence going on here one it made me
feel good which I appreciate but also
made it less likely that would burst
into tears in front of everyone which
makes everyone in the room a lot more
comfortable but it's likely that i had i
left the room and someone else had
walked in and said you know how was
Colleen doing that we'd see a little bit
more variance in the responses um a
little bit more like okay or she talks
kind of fast she's got a Midwest accent
um instead of the the great feedback i
just got thank you and it's not that you
were lying it's more you're being polite
which is something that we're really
culturally normed to do and in fact
social psych has found this that when a
human asked a person about herself i'll
go back to the user will give more
positive responses than when a different
human ask the same questions and because
people are less honest when a human
asked about herself the answers will be
more homogenous than when a different
human ask the same questions well it
turns out that this applies to computers
so to evaluate this people with computer
experience were brought into a lab until
that they'd be given a tutorial on a
computer and then after the tutorial
receive some type of an evaluative test
and then because the program was being a
valuer in development they would then
evaluate how the computer did in the
tutorial so people were brought in they
sat down at computer 1 and computer 1
gave them 20 facts
such as according to a Harris Poll
thirty percent of all american teenagers
kiss on the first date scandalous I know
um and then people were asked to rate in
a Likert scale how much information they
felt they knew about that fact and based
on that there have led to believe that
the computer would give them special fax
after that but really gave out run the
same info on the same order afterwards
people then completed the test of how
well they understood the facts and then
computer one told the person how they
did based on how they answer the test
and then computer once said by the way I
think I did a great job please evaluate
me so half the samples date on computer
1 and evaluated it and half a sample
walked 3 feet over and rated on an
identical computer will call computer
too so those that stayed on computer 1
rated it as significantly more friendly
significantly more confident and the
answers had significantly less variance
now every single subject was too briefed
afterwards and asked you know would you
ever change your answers to make a
computer feel better very confidently
everyone said no that's silly I would
definitely not do that so the castle
researchers put this out into the world
got a lot of feedback a lot of concern
about confounders so very briefly i'll
go through a couple there's I could talk
up here all day about it um so they they
replicated the study and had instead of
people going to computer to die half the
sample the other half the sample went
down the hall and answered paper and
pencil questionnaires same thing they
then replicated this again and instead
of computer one delivering all this
information via text it had a specific
voice and part of the sample state at
computer 1 and rated that voice and how
well it did part switched over to
computer to which had a different voice
to give the ratings and another part
again to the paper and pencil same thing
be a text or audio people were changing
their answers to be a little bit nicer
to the computer so this research and
many many other studies conducted by
cast researchers has been conducted
using a methodology
gee that simply take social psychology
findings looks for the word human or
person and replaces it with whatever
computing technology they want to test
out so for example the what we just went
through would be when a computer ask the
user about itself the user will give
more positive responses and when a
different computer ass-kissing questions
and because people are less honest when
a computer asks about itself the answers
will be more homogenous than when a
different computer asks the same
questions this methodology has been
effective even though participants
frequently described like the polite to
computer group that they really think
it's weird to follow social norms of the
with pieces of technology now this group
explains this mismatch is basically an
evolutionary problem technologies gone
so much faster than our brains that our
default is to be social it's sort of
like when you watch a scary movie you
get really freaked out but you're not in
danger and neither the actors except for
you know some career choices but that's
what they link it to now casa isn't the
only social attribution to computing
technology theory but it is the most
cited for this phenomenon you may also
heard of it as the media equation or
other things listed at the bottom of the
screen Casa has been demonstrated using
the methodology we just discussed in
over a hundred studies for computers and
this work is expanded to many other
types of computing technology and
character characteristics of it such as
voices now it is of note that this
phenomenon seems particular to computing
technology so for instance we don't
really have social interactions with
their dishwasher and we don't really
hold other pieces of technology
responsible for instance for anger
inducing situations you don't really get
mad at your car when you're in traffic
but you do get mad at your computer when
you're going to email you really don't
want so there's something about the
computing factor that brings out the
social nature that technology in general
doesn't yes someone's that easy there
are difference between different age
group so I might imagine that you know
we are old enough set that we grew up
with our computers and develop our
social skills without computers and then
maybe kind of use computer in the same
way we use humans where is my son is
used to communicate
device and might have different
interaction is this something that has
been studied yes and I'm actually about
to get to that so if I don't fully
address that please bring it back up
again okay so perfect timing Casa
demonstrates that people make the social
attributions but beyond the evolutionary
explanation they don't really have the
data to explain you know more of why
this happens and under what
circumstances it could be promoted which
is what i'm interested in with this
whole therapeutic alliance idea so
another theory that developed out of
moderators of Casa that started be
identified such as computer experience
is the computing technology continuum of
perspective or see TCP now see TCP
conceptualizes a continuum in regards to
how technology is viewed and the
continuum is anchored by a locally
simplex perspective that view technology
as you know a machine it's programmed
controllable and alterable by humans and
the other end is a globally complex
perspective which view technology as an
autonomous entity that's capable of
exerting subtype of control or influence
on a person's life now their hypothesis
and research findings really indicate
that most people are somewhere in the
middle of that however the ctc p and
casa literature provide us a lot of
insight into characteristics of both the
technology and user that can really
start to shift where someone is on that
spectrum which is something i really
want to do so again i was really excited
to find this so very quickly because
again this might be old hat to a lot of
people in this room some tech
characteristics they've noticed so
improvement on tasks and improvement in
social attributions things like distance
so think people remember things a lot
better if something on the screen is a
lot closer so an agent happens to be
suddenly this close on the screen now
fine line because much like in real life
if someone got really close and your
face to explain something it also could
creep you out so a lot of these have a
lot of fine line instances additionally
flattery and praise from a computer even
if unwarranted really increase the
the feelings of likeability and social
pneus towards it politeness goes a long
way additionally expertise if a
computing technology that's going to do
some type of didactic or tutorial at the
beginning establishes its expertise
people will remember that task better
and they will do better out in the
future and perform it more quickly than
if it's believed the technology is more
of a generalist additionally putting
people on teams that seems in having
that camaraderie with the technology
really bolsters that feeling of like I'm
having the social interaction with this
thing and we're all in it together there
are a lot of things they've also found
might interfere with it so people do not
like being criticized in general but
this goes with computing technology as
well specifically if it's unwarranted
they really lose their credibility if
you get criticized and you really
shouldn't have been additionally
boastfulness goes are really badly
informing that social cue so which is an
interesting findings if you want to
really establish that the computer is an
expert it needs to not be braggy about
it and there's a lot of things that
depend so gender a voice really changes
how people attribute different social
characteristics and how they might
perform different voices really aren't
loop together different personalities
are prescribed to them and even the
present so Clippy in microsoft word
they've been found that if clippies in
the corner really not doing anything and
we assume the user really isn't noticing
them women actually have some social
inhibition when they're performing tasks
when they're being observed by that
agent so that's good to know depending
on what what type of thing you're going
to be building so some user characters
have come out women have been found
across the board to be more social
towards computing technology and make
more attributions additionally higher
levels of education also seems to be
impacting that you move more towards a
simplex end of the model and context of
you so for example I'm in Seattle and I
have no sense of direction and I've
never been here before in a context like
that I might actually atribute
intelligence to my app because it knows
where I am and I don't however I might
see it as intelligent when I'm at home
and I know exactly where I am and then
there's a lot of psychosocial things
which is a psychologist I'm really
interested in because these are factors
that we're hoping to change and have the
bit respond to as people change so
people with social anxiety anxiety and
depression are incredibly comorbid so
it's important to know this so social
anxiety those people are more likely to
be much more honest to computing
technologies and also have more social
attributions to them so they're really
building that relationship and telling
them more things and they would to a
human people who are more neurotic
people who really view their locus of
control as external and outside of them
which again is very common for
depression or have lower self-esteem or
lower self-efficacy really plays up how
much social attributions they're making
so again it's very excited to stumble
upon this literature because a lot of it
turned out to be very applicable to
mental health and what we're trying to
design for bits so aside from being very
exciting and telling us a lot how can we
actually apply these findings to bits to
increase the attributions and possibly
the relational factors to bits and users
over time well we can start from what we
already know in terms of developing bits
so given that current psychological
theoretical models that are efficacious
and face to face treatments really
haven't been sufficient to inform the
design and development of bits more and
schouler and colleagues proposed the bit
model to provide a framework for this
need so I'm going to present a very high
level overview of this but highly
recommend the paper and Jamie or
speaking to dr. Schuler afterwards if
you have more questions about it but in
developing a bit this model breaks down
the theoretical aspects and
instantiation through the 4 w's and
how's one needs to figure out to design
a bit so the theoretical includes you
know the why so really why you want to
make this bit what are your clinical
aims to get people to get out and do
things to improve the depression like
really what are you trying to do and how
much do they need to engage with it to
get that clinical aim and the conceptual
how so what changed strategies you're
going to decide so for cbt a lot of
times people do kind of go the
route of either the cognitive change the
behavioral change like what tactics are
going to use to get to the why that you
want now what I'm actually much more
interested in is the instantiation side
now if we're think about social
attributions why the instantiation not
the theoretical well that goes back to
that whole critical nonspecific factor
thing in therapeutic alliance so we know
that therapeutic alliance impacts how
well someone does without actually being
the specific change tactics it's really
more of the intangible feel that's
established and that's why I much more
interested in the instantiation side and
kind of what's being expressed their to
the user so any instantiation side
questions we want to consider like what
so the what is what elements are you
going to engage with with your user so
like are you can have messaging what
type of information delivery mechanisms
are going to use will there be logging
those types of things as well as a
technical how which really gets to the
characteristics of the bit so what
mediums for delivery are you choosing
like text versus audio versus video and
then finally the when which includes the
workflow which if you think about a bit
that's going to have to be around for a
while people have to interact with it
for a while to really enact that change
and the workflows really important of
what they're getting one so the social
attributions literature provides bit
developers with design implications for
the instantiation of bits so for example
to answer the what of a bit I might want
to develop developers might consider
some of the following from the Casa and
see TCP literature so if things are like
more when they give praise even if it's
unwarranted I might design a bit that
has a lot of positive reinforcement and
praise to notifications or banners on
home screens or if there's any bishan on
tasks when females are observed by
agents then I really want to make sure
that agents do not feel present when
they're going to be conducting certain
tasks or learning new tasks if there's a
positive bias if they're evaluate on the
same platform I'm really going to want
to watch launch assessments and
evaluations in a different app or
platform especially for mental health
we're really tracking how those
assessments are changing over time we
want to make sure it's as accurate as
possible if it's great that they dem
straight intelligence then my feedback
reports of visualization I'm probably
get some get from some passive data
collection or do some analytics provide
information that aren't directly
resulting from user inputs so the bit
kind of knows some stuff without being
told for the house so male and masculine
voices are perceived as friendlier and
more influential I might therefore
decide that my introduction information
will be delivered via a masculine voice
audio if experts are believed and liked
more and more information is retained
I'm really make sure that the user knows
expertise of my bit but if it's less lut
itz liked last when it praises itself
then I don't want it to be boastful
about this and if it's like most when
bit personality adapts to the users
personality then I'm going to do some
tailored information delivery and some
messaging styles to match the user
personality and for the when again if
we're going to do the intelligence and
probably can come up with some really
interesting algorithms like when a
certain behavior is noticed a certain
element is launched or making sure that
it's an event-based progression rule
because that seems more targeted and
plan than an open format if it's
important that they demonstrate emotions
and caring then maybe I'm gonna set
something it's going to launch a
notification one noticing or noting
concern or caring when it notices
something that's different about the
pattern or if it's liked more when it
demonstrates that it's acting out a plan
then there's gonna be really clearly
defined frequency of deployment
progressions the use really feels like
the bit has a plan of where they're
going that's kind of getting into the
goal and task agreement aspect of it
like we've got a plan we're in this
together this is how we're getting there
now these design considerations work the
lens of the bit model and a social
attributions literature informs the
ultimate design of the bed okay so we've
got that but what we need is a framework
for understanding and conceptualizing
this research so we can generate
hypotheses and evaluate them further our
understanding of social attributions and
the impact on bits doesn't stop at the
creation of the bit so to better
understand the effect through usage
we've developed the social attributions
to bits model now we've already covered
the
lying piece oh I haven't used this once
the design piece in purple but beyond
that we know that bit developers who
have considered their intended users
when making decisions however we really
actually get to pick out who uses our
orbits they usually don't fit in that
well-defined box that we make for them
of what we expect so therefore the
variability of intensity of expected
user characteristics for those who use a
bit will inform the ultimate level so
this is the information we went through
this does that that's informed by the
literature which goes into the ultimate
design of the bed but then really what
the users the actual users versus the
intended users bring to the table these
two together will create the social
attributions to a bit initially now it's
expected that much like a relation of
therapeutic relationship these levels
will change over time and particularly
considering that we want the user to
have improved symptoms that's a change
that we hope will happen but we also
expect that the bit itself will change
based on the responses and machine
learning that we incorporate within it
so the first half of the model is really
the initial and then we expect there to
be some change much like there is in
therapy that reinforces that and whole
tamale that leads to changes in usage
and outcome which again is the ultimate
goal if people use us more and get the
dosages they need hopefully they start
feeling better right which is also we've
definitely also seen that that when
people are doing pretty well there is
less use it's problematic for our
research but if that's something that we
find like in therapy when someone starts
doing better you go to bi-weekly
sessions and then you go to monthly
sessions and then it's kind of like okay
you're good you got the stuff so if that
is if the bit is developed in a way that
they have that social relationship with
it where they feel like it is there and
they've got that safety net that they
can go back to then maybe that lowering
and usage over time is actually really
reflective of what we want and expect
from face-to-face treatment always room
to get out of their face as they get
better okay and then read
and we're still here yeah but where we
will always have new users this Thank
You percent is over years hmm oh cool
but if you're measuring success of your
app great more or less usage isn't
necessarily the metric the rectums
saying whether it's useful or not right
ultimately we yeah we want to see that
the depression scores went down that's
the magic we want exactly and so far
we've seen with the really short term
bits where is four to eight weeks well
yeah ideally we'd like someone to hold
on for 48 weeks but a lot of times that
doesn't happen in those short times it
really is there seems to be a little bit
of a dosage effect because at the
beginning is really when you're going to
get the big punch so how long this arrow
goes in time is yet to be defined ok so
the takeaway from the second step of
harnessing the human side of apps is
that we know that people make social
attributes attributions to computing
technology the literature is there to
show us this but we can take this
information and use it to inform our
design decisions to work towards
improving use and adherence for apps for
better outcomes now in the future we'd
like to continue to explore and refine
both models so both a supportive
accountability model and harnessing the
social attributions to bits now a few
field trials are underway or recently
wrapped up some of which we've seen
today and some larger RCTs are coming
where we're hoping again to really focus
on some of this but one specific future
project we have is hoping to incorporate
both of those so I got an F 31 which is
a training research training grant from
the National Institute of Health and
that was to complete a project that the
first part is a usability phase in the
second part is a small pilot trial so I
will be taking elements of apps designed
more for behavioral activations the be
part of CBT and cognitive therapy the
sea part of CBT which we really don't
have much data on how those work up
against each other in an app which is
very interesting because they're really
the go tues for treating depression so
in usability testing I'm hoping to kind
of Franken
Steyn the most usable app that we can
make for both of those and those designs
will ultimately inform the apps that
will be tested in a small pilot trial so
we'll see how the BA and CT apps go
against each other and against a control
group now coaching will be involved in
the trial so that will further help
refine us refine and understand the
support of accountability model but
we're also hoping to track the social
attribution levels throughout treatment
and start really testing this theory out
and seeing how it works ok I'm getting
towards the end of time and happily i'm
at my thank you stick i'm at my
thank-you page we're not all my names
are popping up which is a fun thing that
happens when you're in front of a lot of
people on camera but ultimately i'd like
to very quickly thanks ebit and the many
many people that contributed to this
work as well as acknowledged some
funding from the National Institute of
Mental Health and most importantly thank
you all for being here and taking time
out of your day to be a part of this
talk I didn't have any questions pop up
here so yeah I'm excited to see a hand
have you also done any sort of deeper
researchers studying in to game design
it specifically you know even for mobile
apps they have us to do after to it he
will come back and back and have you
have you done any sort of looking into
the why certain things are sticky and
how that might be applied to this area I
have it too much by it so I'm really
excited you brought that up I i would
like to look into the stickiness a bit
more yeah I mean that's a whole field
unto itself but I mean they really are
very sort of awful about how they're
engaging their users and giving them
rewards along the way you know keep them
going yeah definitely very cool thank
you any other questions
all right let's take kelly thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
