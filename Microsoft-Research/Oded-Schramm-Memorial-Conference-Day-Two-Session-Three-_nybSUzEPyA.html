session is going to be a professor Mario
ball from the University of Michigan as
with many of the people we've been
hearing from Mario's one of our dudes
co-authors they worked on hyperbolic
geometry I Mary's going to talk to us
about trans-boundary extremely lame yeah
thanks well we all enjoyed these little
anecdotes about the debt so let me at
just another one so when I first came to
Seattle visiting here after that had
moved from the Weitzman Institute to
Microsoft I asked them well so is their
big change in your life now you know
what are you doing what's different is
it all well nothing much has changed I
have a boss now and sometimes I have to
pretend that I understand what my
treatment is talking about so yeah as it
was already mentioned I have John one
joint paper with the debt and our
collaboration actually also started
during a hike so it was over well for
conference and well I think this was one
of the features about debt that I like
very much so you give them a couple of
definitions and if he gets interested in
the problem he immediately starts
thinking about it and this is also what
we did in our collaboration so it was
about a metric geometry which is a
little office or main area interest but
you know I told him a couple of basic
things and then well we immediately
starting started working today I don't
want to talk about our joint work I
rather want to talk about something that
I consider one of the most important
original ideas of a debt in the field of
conformal geometry and a classical
uniform ization namely our this concept
of trans-boundary length so I should
remind you that before odette switch to
probability he wrote a sequence of very
important papers well encircle packings
we've heard this but also in well
conformal geometry and a classical
uniform ization in particular there was
a series of very important papers
jointly with here and there think it's
fair to say that these papers I would
say are the most important contributions
to this general area let's say in the
last 50 years or so okay so there are
many papers and of course I don't have
the time to talk about them all they
just picked one a little gem that I
think is the most important religion
yeah I forget in this area and that's
the concept of what he called
trans-boundary extremal length so this
appeared in 1995 in a paper published in
the Israel journal the concept is a
little technical so in order to give you
full appreciation of this very simple
but clever idea i first have to talk
about a classical modulus and extreme
lengths so start let me start with some
basic definitions so so we on the
Riemann sphere and we have a couple of a
path so think of these paths as wires
like this and what you would like to do
is you would like to put a mass
distribution on the Riemann sphere in
such a way that whenever you integrate
along one of these paths the the the the
path integral over this distribution
picks up at least length one okay so if
this is the case for some non negative
density then I want to call it
admissible for other path family so the
modulus of the path family is now simply
the infimum of the l2 norms overall
admissible densities right so some of
you want to spread out this density Rho
in an efficient way so that whenever you
travel along curve here the the curve
picks up length 1 rolling one but you
want to do it in such a way that the l2
norm the total l2 norm
of the density as as small as possible
and that's called the modulus of the
curve family well there's a little bit
of a controversy here in this area
whether what should consider this
quantity the modulus or rather it's
reciprocal and work with that so the
reciprocal is called the extremal length
here so actually or debt-like extremely
length but I consider this as a little
bit of a heretic view so I rather work
with modules nope to convince you in a
second that actually modulus is slightly
better concept in though extremal length
has a somewhat more geometric or touch
to it okay so so the most important
property of modulus is its conformal
invariance so if you have a if you have
a region so if your curve sit in some
regional megha and you have a conformal
met apply to this region well then you
get some image Kerr family that I call
just f of gamma so f of gamma just
consists of all compositions of your
conformal map with the pants in the
family right imma be so paranoid fries
pants and well one can show simply by
essentially applying the transformation
formula that the modulus of the image
curve family is equal to the modules of
the original curve family so this
conformal invariance of modulus is very
useful to explain certain properties
that we all know for example one of the
things that you all know from basic
complex analysis is that if you have to
an you lie let's say one with inner
radius 1 the other way with inner radius
r and then one with inner radius one
outer radius R prime well and they're
only a confirm Lee equivalent if r is
equal to r prime okay this can very
nicely be explained by this conformal
invariance modulus namely if you look at
the curve family that connects the inner
to the outer boundary then this modulus
of this curve family gamma is just well
too
pi over log are all right so because of
conformal invariance of the modulus so
if you have this situation well that
necessarily are has to be equal to our
prime so this quantity allows us to
immediately explain or such effects well
another effect of the same type is if
you have two rectangles and you have a
control map between two rectangles so
that vertices go to vertices well and we
all know that this can only work if the
side ratio is the same right so if you
have a confirm lap like this with a
property that vertices go to vertices
well then necessarily a prime over B
prime is equal to a over B and this
again can be explained by modulus
because so you can interpret this
quantity a over B here just is the
modulus of the pair family that connects
or the sites in a rectangle like this
all right so if you call this per family
gamma then you get the modulus of this
curve family oh well the reason why I
think modulus is slightly better than
extreme length is this sub additive ax t
property that I wrote down here so if
you have a comfortable collection of
curves and your throw them together then
some other modulus behaves like an outer
measure on the family of curves and of
course you can write down the same
quantity with extreme lengths but then
the the interpretation is a little more
contrived right so so I think this is
the main reason one why should one by
one should actually work with modulus
and not with extreme lengths well their
various monotonicity properties and I
didn't write them down right maybe with
extreme lengths you can some of them
some of them can be interpreted
interpreted in a better way one
intuition that you should have about
modulus is that the modules of a curve
family is a little bit like electrical
conductivity if you consider
paths in your heavenly sys yeah so then
some of the monotonicity properties that
you can easily prove are very obvious in
this interpretation namely your very
very long y as well then the
conductivity should be small and that's
the same with modulus so if you have
long curves and your pear family then
typically the module is very smart if
you have many curves in your path family
well then the the modulus becomes large
right exactly the same is with
conductivity and if you think of this
interpretation then some of these
equations that are on the board here
become very intuitive so remember if i
have a rectangle like this and i look at
this a pair family that connects
opposite sides like this then i told you
that the modulus this curve family is a
over B and this ratio can easily
explained by this interpretation right
because if you make a larger get more
curves and this is why is the numerator
here we make be large in the curves
become longer and this is why be is in
the denominator okay oh there's a
special feature of modulus in the plane
that is different from modulus and
higher dimensions or the the definition
of modules actually works in all
dimensions or even in a general metric
spaces if you have some a base
underlying basement measure but this
property that i caught a reciprocity
here is a special feature of the planar
their various versions are to formulate
it so i formulated it some are in the
simplest possible context namely for
moduli that come from quadrilaterals in
a similar way as this modulus that comes
from a rectangle so quadrilateral is by
definition just a well a closed Jordan
region with four marked vertices on the
boundary and well this gives you a
subdivision of this Jordan curve and let
me just denote the sides by a b c and d
ok and what you can do then you can
consider to a path families you namely
the one the the path family that
connects or
a to c and the one that connects b to d
and it turns out that these modular I
related namely one is the reciprocal of
the other the way to prove this is
actually to map the quadrilateral here
to a rectangle like this and for the
rectangle case it's obvious by by this
equation right if you take the the other
the other modulus that you get from this
rectangle well then you get exactly the
opposite ratio here well if you want to
apply this concept of modulus in
conformal geometry then of course you
have to relate it to geometric
properties right this is simply this is
roughly the game that you play so you
have a map between two regions a
conformal map and somehow you want to
say something about the geometric
properties of this map and you know that
this modulus is preserved quantity so if
you can related somehow to geometric
properties of some let's say continua in
the region well then you get some
information on the map and the nice
thing about modulus is that it relates
to geometric quantities so well let me
introduce some notation here so we have
a regional megha and in this region
Omega we have two continuous or to a
compact connected set consisting more of
a consisting of more than one point and
we would like to look at this curve
family that connects these two
continuous inside the region this curve
family I call or gamma well e f oh
meghan so it turns out that modulus is
related to what i call the relative
distance of these two continuous so the
relative distance of two continuous just
the distance of them re scaled by the
smaller diameter and one can actually
show that you always get an upper bound
of this type him so the modulus of this
curve family well I guess there's a typo
here should be gamma of game of EF
this is controlled by the reciprocal of
the relative distance up to a function
so this notation here means up to a
monotonic function unfortunately then
that causes a big problem in these
control mapping problems you don't get
an inequality in the other direction so
you cannot guarantee that the modulus is
a uniformly large if you have some
control some control on the relative
distance of two continua this is true if
the region actually is the whole Riemann
sphere but for general regions it's not
true and intuitively this is kind of
clear because think of a general region
well you will have a bunch of holes here
and if you have these holes then you're
forced to go around the obstacle so you
get less and less or pads and your
family so it's clear that you cannot
expect any kind of uniform bound okay so
that that's a big problem so modulus is
unfortunately not bounded below by a
quantity that just depends on the
relative distance transponder extremal
length solves this problem so transfer
boundary extreme lengths the
trans-boundary modulus is a quantity you
do get this uniform lower bound and that
is why this concept is so important
useful okay but before i come to the
definition of trans-boundary modulus let
me tell you a little bit about extremal
densities okay so what is an extreme low
density well in the definition of
modulus with this concept of an
admissible density they call and density
extreme oh well if it realizes the
smallest possible a to nome that i can
get for an admissible density ok so you
can prove the existence of such extreme
identities in fairly general situations
and you also get uniqueness because it's
easy to see that if you have a bunch of
admissible densities forgiving care
family well then the any convex
combinations of them is also admissible
and this L to functional is strict
convex right from from this you
immediately get some uniqueness
statement for extremal identity
densities if they exist so more precise
you get uniqueness almost everywhere up
two sets of measure zero so let me tell
you two instances about these two
situations where you can say something
about extremal densities the first one
is again has to do with these
quadrilaterals that I talked a moment
ago so if you have a quadrilateral with
these marked sides a b c d and you look
at this curve family that connects a a
to c well then the extremal density is
actually the derivative of the absolute
value of the derivative of a conformal
map that map's the quadrilateral to a
rectangle well with the right
normalization I guess the right
normalization is that this side length
you should be one and of course corner
should go two corners okay a similar
result also holds in the multi Lee
connected situation so suppose we have
the same picture but now we have a bunch
of holes here and again you can ask
yourself well what's the extremal
density for the path family that stays
inside the region but avoids the holes
and this is actually very interesting it
turns out that the extremal density
comes from a conformal map of this
quadrilateral to a rectangle with slits
removed you know so the extremal density
is again just the absolute value of the
derivative of the conformal map well
maybe I should push this a little higher
here where you have slits like this
removed
and that's actually very useful if you
want to map an arbitrary a region to
some kind of a normal domain and well
there's a classical theorem that
actually goes back more than hundred
years to the times of Hilbert so to get
an argument to show that every region
whatever the connectivity can be
connected to what we now call a slit
region in the region with slits are
removed in a similar way like this and
from what I just told you it very easy
to understand why this is not so hard to
prove because you have a natural
extremal problem whose solution actually
is related to the conformal map right so
so one way to approve this effect about
uniform is a shins of arbitrary domains
by suit domains is just to look at your
domain and you use a picture like this
then you know consider the modulus of
this path family here look at the
extremal row and then well try to cook
up the map actually from the role now
that that's one venue well there's a
famous problem that is more than 100
years old in this area that is still
unsolved and that's a cubist carcinomas
problem and well it uses as normalizing
regions the so-called circle domains so
by definition a circle domain is just a
domain in the Riemann sphere whose
complementary components around disks
and curve in 1908 asked whether every
region and the plane is actually
conformal equivalent to one of these
circles circle domains or domain you
have holds it around disks and he
actually proved this in 9024 the finally
connected a case you know that's a very
important and useful uniform ization
theorem if you have a finitely connected
domain so if you only had finitely many
holes in your domains if you have a
situation like this well then there's a
conformal map onto something that looks
like this way all these
boundaries here are just circles one big
advance in this area is the theorem to
hear and odette from the early 90's
namely they showed this in the case that
you actually have countably many
components and that was a big progress
in the area and the original proof
actually was by using ideas from circle
packings but later on no debt actually
found a different proof by using well
this trans-boundary extremely
transplant-related i will introduce in a
moment but before i do this let us think
why this problem is so hard well the
reason for this is that this some
unknown natural extremal problem that
you can solve into solution would
somehow be related to a conformal map
onto such a circle domain so i think the
main observation of the debt made is
that if you change the geometry of these
holes to slightly different shapes
actually then you do get some extremal
problem that is very natural the shapes
that occur in these pictures actually
squeeze ok and that has to do now with
this what i call the fence boundary
modulus so if you see the definition for
the first time it's a little technical
but let me try to explain it may be on
this other board so so again you have a
domain and you have a you have a bunch
of holes so i guess i called them k j
they could be even countably many but
let's not make things too complicated
here let's give it the main Omega you
know with these complementary components
and you have a pet family the path
family is actually allowed to travel
through these holes here what you would
like to do is you would again like to
associate a quantity to this path family
that is very similar to classical
modulus and again you will have some
continuous a density here this row that
actually lives on the region but then
you have extra terms and that's the main
point these extra terms actually live on
the holes right so you so you assigned
to
each of these holes here discrete
quantity Rho of one row to row 3 and so
on and now the admissibility condition
is essentially the obvious thing so you
integrate your curve here along this
continuous part of the density this is
this term here in addition to this you
pick up a row from each of the holes
that you meet ok and if this sum it's
great to equal one then you call well
this density consisting of a continuous
and discrete part admissible as in some
sense this is so sometimes though the
curse you can travel through hole by
paying a flat rate so flat tax you rate
it doesn't matter you know that you hit
the hole several times if you use it
once well you pay your road I and 12 it
goes into this admissible T condition
like this and well then again you try to
look at a certain infimum and it's kind
of clear what you want to infamous you
want to infamous the analog of the l2 no
Mia right so just the l2 norm of the
continuous part plus well the natural
some that comes out of the discrete part
the funny thing is this quantity even
though it uses things that are not in
the domain is still conformally
invariant under maps of the domain that
makes it actually so useful so this is
this conformal invariant actually odette
formulated it a little differently so he
well he introduced some quotient space
we actually punched the hole to one
point but let me not do this like this
let me do a little simpler so this
control invariant here says that if you
have any homeomorphism on the sphere
that is conformal on the domain so no
require much soever on the Holts then
you actually do get this conformal
invariance of trans-boundary modulus the
proof is almost a triviality so for the
continuous part you do it again the same
transformation formula as you did for
classical modulus and well the other
thing that you use is that some are in
any confirm map these holes are somehow
shuffled around even though the map is
not defined all right I mean to make
this rigorous you can talk about
the end compactification or something
like this but it's essentially clear
that you just shuffle around these two
screen this these discrete weights and
well then you get this invariance well
I'm running out of time so let me
quickly say or what you can do that with
this and some are you get some intuition
of what is going on if you just look at
the extremal densities namely if you
again have some quadrilateral so mark
corners you have some holes here if you
look at the pear family that connects
all the sides of the quadrilateral the
other they are allowed to actually hit
the holes then the extremal density here
of the trans-boundary density has a
continuous part which is again just the
derivative the absolute value of the
derivative of a conformal map onto a
rectangle with the squares removed and
the discrete parts are just the side
length of the squares alright so the
extremal Rogge's here correspond to the
side length of the Jade or square ok and
once once you see this I mean then then
you know that this this is very useful
for some conformal mapping problems now
let me just give you one quick theorem
that would it approved using this
concept that has to do with well what he
called fat sets &amp;amp; Co fat or regions so
what is a fat set so fat set is a set
with the property that if you place any
point in the set and you look at the
ball centered at this point of a radius
whose diameter is not too large let's
say oh well less than the diameter of
the set and then the percentage that you
see here that is eaten by the
intersection of the ball and the set is
fixed for every every such ball right so
this is what I
Tao so if you look at the ratio of the
area of the intersection to the RF the
whole ball well and you get this fixed
percentage towel and well a coed region
now it's just the region who is
complementary components are fit in the
sense or are just Singleton's okay so
this is a model that called a cool fed
region and the important thing about
transponder transponder modulus now is
that in contrast to classical modulus
you do get uniform lower bounds for
moduli of path families connecting to
continue adjust depending on the
relative distance of this continuum and
this somehow allows you to play the
usual game I mean you use the conformal
invariance you have lower bounds of of
the of the modules for path families and
your source domain well if upper bounds
in your target and you can use this to
your advantage to for example prove this
theorem that is due to a debt if you
have every any covet domain then you can
actually confirm Lee a map it to a
circle domain that's a very nice theorem
so what this essentially says is that
well if you want a soft curve is
conjecture it doesn't really matter
whether your map to a circle domain or
for example to domain whose
complimentary components are squares
right because squares are also uniformly
fit so you can essentially choose your
favorite domain and solve the problem
there so yeah I think I stopped
well that's a difficult story are
essentially somehow you lose all control
so regularly had some unity uniform
continuity in the map alright and then
you could just go from the finite case
by some limiting argument to the
infinite case I'm in the case of
infinitely many connected components but
unfortunately you don't have these so
the whole game really is to get this
type of control and you can get such a
control in the in the case we have
countably many connected components
there this kind of naive approach works
but in the general case unfortunately
doesn't join me in thanking it's a great
pleasure to introduce Greg Lawler from
the University of Chicago Greg is a long
time and very distinguished contributor
to probability theory and in the context
of this conference of course some of the
some of the Odette's most famous and
most groundbreaking work was done in
collaboration with Greg and with bendlin
Greg is going to speak to us today about
something different from what's in the
program its benefit is a SRAM lisner
evolution okay our thank you very much
I'm very happy to have invitation here
like many people in this room my
personal research has been changed
greatly by the insights of Odette rom
and I'd like to focus on some of the
ideas that would have done that it
particularly influenced me and that's
this beautiful object which we now call
the trommel order evolution we've
already had an introduction to this in
ventolin stocks i'm i'm assuming that
talk as a prerequisite to this talk and
we're going to build from there so if to
recall what Oh dad did was looking at
scaling limits of various things
particularly loop race walk at the time
and what he did was he said said thought
supposed to conformably invariant limit
that satisfies a certain markov property
we know it should satisfy what would it
have to be and as we've now learned he
then rediscovered the Lord nor equation
went down to learn her equation then
figured out basically that it would have
to be the Lord equation with a Brownian
motion input and that's part of his
original paper in the from the Israel
journal that Vettel had talked about so
if there's a limit heat up for an
equation like this I read it a little
bit differently than normally done I'm
in the upper half plane so disease in
the upper half plane I didn't write that
there I should say that there was also
not station of Oded that for a lot of
the properties although most of the
learner equations written in the disk or
the compliment of the desk and the
complex variables literature is actually
easier for a lot of the properties to
actually look at it in the upper half
plane in a particular the place on
kernel which basically drives the
learner equation is easier in the upper
half plank so you basically have this
equation in the upper half plane where
GT is a funk function ah UT is a
function on the real line in this case a
continuous function on the real line and
a is a parameter we can play with now
the way oh dead and most of the joy they
totally make a equal to and they do more
variance variation here but just because
the way right I tend to make this a
Brownian motion of variance one and very
very this doesn't make it's just a
constant of linear time change doesn't
make any difference but if you see a
wherever you see A's in this talk a is
equal to 2 / kappa and that's consistent
so you just see if you ever see it there
but the question is now if you know it's
got to satisfy this well does other
things to satisfy this well if I stick
in any continuous function here then
this equation has a well-defined
solution up to a certain time and it's
not too difficult a little bit of work
to show that in fact if for any time T
the solution of this will actually be a
conformal map from the from sub sub
domain of some unbounded sub domain of
the complex plane to the complex plane
with a certain boundary behavior at
infinity it looks like the identity at
infinity the next term the constant term
is zero and then there's another term
which is one over Z that a is the same
as this a it comes from the right here
then you have Corrections oops well
there should be a team that's that's
type of there should be a times T thank
you it should be but the question is but
just because we have this unbounded
domain HT that doesn't necessarily mean
that it comes from occur so the question
is that I'm going to deal with is the
day some of the basic questions does
there exist a curve gamma such that HT
is the unbounded component of age so
river that Oded really was looking at
random curves so this should be coming
from a curve but it's not so we've
obvious to see what's happening with
that curve is the curve simple IE
non-self intersecting does it stay in up
in the upper does it stay in the upper
half plane which is really those are
really turn out to be essentially
equivalent questions and finally what's
the house Dorf dimension of this curve
is it actually going to be fractal
curves the main paper of Oh dad's not
going to work on is actually is a paper
of Odin and Stefan and I actually thanks
Jeff on for not speaking about this
which means i can speak about this but
the main thing is basic properties of
SLE now it was finally published in 2005
the earlier versions of this i actually
once talked to Stefan in time he told
how much I liked the paper but I really
have her struggling with it thought
basic properties of SLE was kind of the
wrong title but now now that i think
about it now i think it's the right
title and these really are basic
properties of SL leaves so i even agree
with the title of this paper so let's
talk about existence of the path and I
didn't draw any pic
here's this have a simple simple picture
here so this is what we're thinking the
curve should look like so that's
assuming it was a curve GT is mapping
the curve back to the upper half plane
and this point gamma T should be mapping
to this point use of T which is the use
of tea in the equation so if I want an
equation for gamma T since that should
be mapping there though so UT should
just be GT inverse or if i write ft four
GT inverse ft of UT should be gamma T so
there we go that's the curve gamma T
equals GT inverse the only problem is
that when you have rough boundaries for
come for a conformal Maps these things
may not exist this could be a very off
hand could be very very rough and in
fact one can actually find out that
there are the solutions to the lower
equation might not come from curves let
me just go back to the equation so
here's there's the equation up there
this is dying okay well look at the
equation up there the behavior that
equation does depend on use of tea and
there's various work in the
deterministic world that means of a
marshal stuff on Rhoda Joan Lind and
some other people as well I'm sorry if
I'm but if you what happens with this
equation if you look at it you've never
seen it very quickly what happens is
this this slit here tends to grow in
time in time T this slit tends to grow
about delta T what's called brownie and
scaling so if I just fixed a growing
point there this will grow at about
delta T so what keeps us from being a
curve is that this starts moving faster
than its growing in this direction when
this thing moves square root delta T or
more in a certain direction then you
might be in trouble and that tells you
to some extent that the natural border
line for this would be you tease that
are hurled or continuous of order one
half and in fact if
if you t up here were holder continuous
avoid or a half then you can actually
show that if a is large enough this
actually had gives you a simple curve
that's actually what they show the
various points what they showed but
there are examples of hurls or
continuous functions order one half and
small ways such as you don't have them
now the Brownian motion path use of T is
not holder continuous of order one half
but in some sense it's randomly holder
continuous of order one half it's like
its holder continuous of order one half
but the constant is random on different
scales so you can sort of think of it as
question so it's not clear there whether
or not it's going to exist but but if
it's going to I would like to do that so
how do we try to prove this well we just
approximate will let gamma n of T Park
summated by instead of evaluating UT at
UT plus i times n that's well defined
just move it up a little bit here it's
certainly defined there and then just
take the limit ok so the question is can
you show this limit exists and then once
you show the limit exists can you give
balance on gamma s minus gamma T to show
that you actually get a continuous curve
well if you just think about say gamma t
minus gamma entity is just less by side
if I go along here and take its image
over here and get the light there all i
have to do is look at the derivative of
the map so thank you that's a good
chairman
ok so to get this to be more precise but
i should say is that if this integral is
finite is integral is finite then i'll
be able to define gamma t source if
that's true if this integral is infant
is infinite that i may not be able to
define a limiting value guarantee but
you actually get this thing so there's
the quantity to start estimating so if
one can show that this derivative is
such that it's bound and say less than Y
to the Delta minus 1 for some Delta
bigger than 0 then in fact we get this
actually this is almost true
deterministically deterministically you
basically get y to the minus 1 that's
the worst that you can get however y to
the minus 1 is not good enough to make
this integral ah converge so you need
something better than that ok now
there's a technical difficulty point
that if you're doing for dealing with
very wild use of teas that you would
have to do you have to do this for every
possible value of T but for Brownian
motion we have this approximate holder
continuity and basically with the holder
continuity that says I don't have to
take every T I have to take just maybe
if I'm if I'm taking n here that I only
have to do n squared values they're
introduced ah ten years ago I knew do
very little about say complex variables
too but it comes to come to could formal
maps now I found out how much you can do
with just a couple of tools so no the
distortion theorem another one Kirby
one-quarter theorem know the burling
estimates you hardly need nor anything
else that's that's you know what you
need to know those okay so that's it won
t and now what happens if you do other
teas well now we just basically ah do
here eh
triangle inequality fine china so if I'm
doing so FS hat is just as well k you
can just use go up here so that's the
approximation a task the approximation
of tea and we just split it into two
pieces because we have we have s as
appearing to places so we just take one
of the esses and one of the other
essence and as it turns out if I so if I
fix a point and I want to vary s and T
that's no problem this difference in
this derivative is of the order of this
for the for S&amp;amp;T small I'm not going to
go through proof I'd say this is just
deterministically from the learner
equation from the differential equation
holds for every path and now if I want
to compare ft I epsilon phi epsilon plus
us die epsilon plus UT so this is with
the same function but two different
points that's what the distortion
estimates are which cruise and when you
do that and now if I use the holder
continuity I get this so basically this
sort of this difference is okay and so
we get sort of this only just so just
jump so if I'm taking gamma s minus
gamma T there are well there are three
terms here but basically the gamma NS
minus gamma NT turns out not to take too
much work so it's mainly the gamma s
minus gamma and ask MN t minus gamma T
those are the ones that have to be
handled and to handle this by this is
basically can I handle the derivative so
how do I get estimates of this
derivative and now so so far we haven't
used any probability at all except for
the modulus of continuity of Brownian
motion so now what I need to do is look
at this function
and also feeling in the road and trauma
paper they showed and this is actually
not difficult views the fact that just
deterministically this function which is
an inverse has the same distribution as
a learner equation with reversed I more
alert or equations in the reverse
direction so this is the same equation
we had before except we have a minus
sign in the denominator so when I want
to take moments of this it's the same
thing as taking moments of this so how
do I do this well there's a few
different equivalent ways of finding
moments you can either write you talk
about writing second order differential
equations or things like that I prefer
now to talk about in terms of what's the
appropriate martingale or local
martingale so in this particular case if
I take that empty of ZB HT Prime
languages ok they to lambda that's just
the imaginary part of the image signs
and minus R don't you think do too much
about this but it's just a computation
that if I choose these parameters
correctly with respect to each other
like I choose are to be whatever I want
choose the then in fact this is a
martingale it's and it's this is Ito's
formula it's just an application to
vitos formula and therefore the expected
value of this let's just say let's take
Z to be I the expected value of this is
one well if I didn't worry about
correlations here this is the reverse
flow this the image of this grows like T
to the one half and if things don't see
you very much and I stay to the middle
and dont and dont hug they've done don't
hug the boundary that should be of order
1 so this guy should be order 1 times T
to the zete over 2 times that and you
actually get this estimate and that's
actually giving you the moment that you
want ah let me just say this isn't true
always does you have to put some
restrictions on r and this calculor
hood but going to go through the
calculations but i'll just say once you
have this this estimate is good enough
to prove existence of the curve for
kappa not equal to 8 and this is
essentially the proof in the road ashram
paper for Kaffee equals 8 what I've done
here is not good enough to do things the
exists as the curve follow separately
from work this is a joint paper but like
many of the results in joint papers this
really should have the S circled on it
as a SRAM result these so if you talk
about for cap equals 8 the existing figs
how to prove that SLE kappa really
approaches SLE 8 or the the uniform
spanning tree approaches SLE eights
officially closely to derive this is
okay so we know if now I know it's
pretty it's true for cap e equals 8 I do
okay well actually when you do this you
also get a guess for what the holder
continuity is and in fact that's now a
theorem and I like to say in fact you
can actually find what the whole the
continuity of gamma is let's say 40 away
from 0 T equals 0 is different and
there's the formula it actually turns
out to be not particularly nice but in
some sense that's because this this
capacity parameterization of the curve
is not very natural but there is one
thing if you just want to plug it in to
note for yourself is that you have a it
is holder continuous with a positive
number if cap is not equal to 8 if k is
equal to 8 in fact it's now a theorem
that the curve is not holder continuous
of any Alpha bigger than 0 now an open
problem i think still open is to find a
different proof for cap equals 8 which
follows this line of fool but is much
more careful it handles all the
logarithms correctly but we will talk
about that okay but that gives the curve
okay so that's the existence of the
curve now I want to talk about the
dimension of the curve let me and this
is just a note
asian uh I've defined it so I'm going to
find good formal radius actually just
for convenience I can do one half
conformal radio survivor simply
connected domain D and a point W in it
this will be one half f prime of 0 where
f is the map from the unit disk in 2d
from taking 02 w the factor one half is
just is giant it's i like gamma of the
half plane and I to be one that's
actually looks lon sorry so it's wrong
but the reason to put this is a
conformal radius turns out to be
something more interesting or easier to
deal with than distance from w to the
boundary there are actually comparable
quantities so in many ways i really want
to look about the distance from a point
to the boundary but it's comparable to
this conformal radius that's the curvy
one corner theorem let me just um i've
also going to give some formulas i just
want to give some notation so if i have
a simply connected domain and i have two
boundary points i can talk about the
argument of a point w with respect in on
the inside with respect to those two
points and it's just the argument that
you would get if you map map it to the
upper half plane and i'm actually s will
be the sign of the argument so if it's a
if it's in the upper half plane and i've
got a point i'm just looking at the sine
of the angle of the point and brother
domains the conformally version is ok so
that's just notation ok actually well
make believe it maybe I'll do this ok uh
we first might ask the question do we
hit w ok it would ask for does this
curve actually hit w well what you do is
in that case we're learning whether
something hits w you take the learner
equation but you change the
parameterization so that it's
parameterised by this conformal radius
which decreases or we can call this the
radial parameterization it's actually
the parameterization of radial SLE
you look at it and see what happens to
this angle you get an equation like this
so this is the angle at w some point on
the inside and now as we see what
happens ah this is a now a fairly simple
differential equation ko-tah attached
and theta till it looks like more or
less 1 over theta tilde the question is
what happens does this reach the origin
if I I'm going to hit a point then as I
get close to that point the angle keeps
fluctuating however if I miss a point
then this thing disappears and it turns
out using this you can see that for
Kappa bigger than or equal to 8 the SLE
curve actually hits points just for SLE
per capita less than eight SLE does not
hit points and this equation also in
this guy actually goes back 20 dad's
first paper for capital S&amp;amp;H you can
actually use this equation to determine
whether the curve goes to the right or
the left of W I won't prove it here but
you've been something a per capita less
or equal to four you actually get that
the paths are simple for Kappa between
four and eight they're not simple but I
won't do that because i want to discuss
a little bit about the fractal dimension
so how do you determine a dimension of
occur i mean the the well after i work
out SLE and this was very new it was
very hard to work I I had techniques to
work with Brownian motions but SLE what
you're doing is you're you're looking at
the evolution of a curve by measuring
its effect on points away from the curve
not by the curve itself there's not an
equation on the curve itself so how do
you find like what's the fractal
dimension of the curve well if I want to
find out the fractal dimension you I you
might as well how many balls or radius
epsilon dar needed to cover a curve if
I'm gonna know how many balls of rays
epsilon are needed what i can do is i
take a particular point w and ask what's
the probability that the curve gets
within distance
upsilon of W and at least your wrist
achill e in terms of expectations that
should behave like epsilon to the two
minus D where D here denotes the fractal
dimension of the curve since this is
distance I could replace the distance
and this is really the problem with the
conformal radius what's the probability
that a formal radius looks like that so
how do you compute this well let's think
with the suppose there were a function
which I think it was a greens function
think of this roughly as being what's
the probability that the that an SLE in
the domain D from z1 to Z to gets close
to W so the probability that the
distance is less than epsilon should
look like epsilon the two minus D times
this thing this sort of greens function
which has to do with domain well there's
a certain scaling rule but just because
the way absolutely we have this epsilon
here if I take a conformal
transformation this epsilon to the two
minus D means that this thing should
conform like this to transform like this
and the other fact which is basically
very simple idea if I'm looking at this
point right here and I think just think
what's the probability i get to that
point well the you ask what's the
probability i get to this point given
i've seen the curve so far well as i
move this curve the probability game
they're given the curve so far should be
a martingale or at least a local
martingale I'm not worried about that
distinction so and what's appropriate
and once I've gotten this far well here
now my new domain is d minus gamma 0 T
this really should be but if this is
right if gamma is a simple curve little
more complicated game is not a simple
curve basically look at the domain I'm
in right now we're now going from gamma
t to z 2 what's that and that needs to
be a local martingale so that plugs in
Ito's formula and if you just plug into
Ito's formula you actually get and this
is done
from that the dimension has to be 1 plus
cap over 8 and you actually get the
greens function as well they didn't use
that term this function can be can be
found in their paper and it's just the
formal radius to a power times the sine
to a power signs are so positive power
and so this actually finds the beautiful
result is that four dimensions between
one and two house fourth dimension
strictly between one and two there's
only one value of Kappa that corresponds
to it so it's a one-to-one relationship
between dimension and Kappa up until it
until we saturate a kappa p equals 8 ah
ok maybe I run those short time I can I
just say you can improve on this and
actually show that the probability that
but it may be able I will skip that
because I want to say a little bit about
this slide so one beautiful thing but
disadvantage of this is that it's
focusing on one point is giving 11 point
estimates there's another question bout
second moment estimates so for those
know about to mentioned what Stefan and
Oded showed in their paper was they gave
an upper bound for the highest orac
dimension and gave good heuristics for
the lower bound but did not prove the
lower bound to prove the lower bound
there's a standard technique for proving
the lower bound which in this case
requires a certain second moment
estimate ah this was not done invited by
a Stefano noted but it was done later by
von sampa Farah now I will say that this
is much harder to prove and it's kind of
unnatural and if they and well I'll just
say there were some missed there were
some problems with early versions of
this paper vessel and I in order just to
give a little credit I do think Oded was
one of the people responsible to put it
in in helping to get this thing to but
it's now it's now published by fire and
this certainly is correct on there's
another there's another alternative
proof which can be given using their
verse learner flow with virgins second
post so we actually have that the health
store if dimension is um is like that
and actually maybe I'll maybe actually
maybe I will skip tax I'm nearing
nearing the end let me just emphasize
again here how what was very unnatural
to me ten years when Oded was first
doing this and was by the time Oded has
shown this to me or the Vendela to me
Oded already had some experience with
this how you show something about a
curve by looking at what happens away
from the curve in the but I've given
colloquy on SL Lee the question I always
get at the end is what about three
dimensions i-i'm not risen so what you
can do in this curve this equation
really has two things in it one is true
for three dimensions and that is that if
you if you want to observe a curve you
can actually look at a point away from
it and see the effect of that point away
from it and make it a a differentiable
smooth function of that that's doable
however what's also true in here is in
two dimensions is you have conformal
invariance of all these harmonic
functions and that's not true in 32
minutes so that this really combines
both of them when you do this okay I
think like I've used up my time here
thank you good we have time for
questions
what about four dimensions yes so what
problem in three dimensions all right I
found after the long I work on this art
I file already that the same exists I'm
even to them in team that this curve let
you discuss is even the non-empty set so
high dimensions I think it is possible
way from work out the details but we
gotta be disgusted if the dark continues
driving terms and tool image that create
nothing I higher dimension so you have a
flow that is exactly the analog of the
river equation so things flow down in an
upper crease but mostly it's not for
couple moments well of course not so it
floats are sort of the natural the
natural thing it's in each slice it
suits isn't that Horror Show to control
metrics in three dimensions know if I
can comment on your comment just to
explain my final comment when I what I
call the learner equation or the
delivery but is a weaker thing than
which you are probably saying so like
for two dimensions the Lord der equation
is something is for the flow of
conformal maps but you but you can think
of it as two steps one is a flow on the
potential that's going on and the other
is the piece that makes it a conformal
map and if you're only looking at the
part on the potential without mapping at
any place that's actually what I was
talking about little earner sir the
hitting probability should take a report
ok I think we're I think coffees here so
please join me in thanking both speakers
