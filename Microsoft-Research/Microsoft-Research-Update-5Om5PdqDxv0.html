when I saw the slide that lowland put up
with my picture to realize that I'm
wearing exactly the same tie this year
though I war in Japan last year when
they took that picture now my wife would
be horrified to realize that I never
changed my ties but felt honestly I
didn't remember that and I just picked
the tie for this occasion now I think
perhaps that's a metaphor for the the
way that microsoft research itself has
functioned over the last 19 years we've
had myself research is unique in I think
within certainly the industrial research
world in that over a very long time now
nearly two decades we've had exactly the
same mission statement exactly the same
way of thinking about what we're doing
in the same approach to doing it during
that period of time we've also had the
same person running it that whole time
that was me but it's always been our
mission to do fundamental basic research
much in the same way that you in the
university environment do basic research
our first mission is to move the state
of the art forward in the areas that we
do work and and that's always been true
and it is not really it there's nothing
in that statement that talks about
Microsoft meet our goal is to move the
state of the art forward and the reason
that we believe that's important is
because if we don't do that then I don't
think we're that valuable to the
corporation so that's why that's always
been our most important mission now when
we have great ideas when the ideas work
then we work very hard to move those
ideas into use and that's really the
second part of our mission statement we
try to work very hard
it our ideas and our technologies into
products when they work when they make
sense ultimately our goal is really to
ensure that not just microsoft products
have a future but that the field of
computer science continues to thrive and
continues to be an important part of our
economy now over the years the
organization's grown fairly dramatically
today we have over 850 PhD researchers
around the world working in the United
States in our Redmond facility in
Mountain View in our new Microsoft new
Inca New England lab in the Boston area
we also have groups in Cambridge England
in Beijing which is actually Beijing is
our second largest basic research group
and Bangalore and then we also have a
number of sort of joint research
activities with other organizations
around the world we have a joint
research lab in Paris with inria we we
work closely with University of
Barcelona barstow a supercomputer center
work closely with the University of
treads hole in the systems and
computational biology center there so
we're very much you're participating in
this in this global environment we
organized historically like a university
in fact those of you who've heard me
speak before know that were organized a
lot like Carnegie Mellon University was
organized back in the mid-1980s when I
was a professor there so we're very flat
welding obviously we're large so it
can't be completely flat but we're
relatively flat organization we believe
in critical mass research groups we
don't want to have just one or two
researchers at any given area we want to
make sure we have enough people in each
area to really be able to push the state
of the art we believe in
gressive Lee publishing our work and and
that's an important part of how we
believe we stay at the state of the art
we believe it's important to subject our
research in our researchers to the peer
review process and to compete
intellectually with the top people
around the world in the academic
community and for us that's both the way
that we make sure that we are working at
the state of the art and that a
researchers are working at the state of
the art but it's also the way that we
helped move the state of the art forward
working with our colleagues in the
academic community as Nolan mentioned
we've always had our interactions with
university research organizations as a
critical component of what we do and how
we think about what we do so if you look
back over the last 19 years since
Microsoft Research was started over
fifteen percent of all the money
Microsoft's that on basic research has
in fact gone to universities and
university research organizations and
that's been in the form of things like
fellowships and research grants
laboratory grants faculty fellowships
things of that nature really for us it's
important that we do that because we
feel that it's important that the field
is healthy in order for us to be healthy
and Lola mention our emphasis on
visitors and interns again this is one
of both one of the ways that we make
sure that our research continues to be
fresh and continues to operate this day
of the art but it is also a way that we
work with you and we communicate with
people in the university environments
because if if people are constantly
moving in and out of Microsoft Research
you know then they get to know each
other and they get to be able to
interact and we maintain those
interactions over a long period of time
now I mentioned that you know we are
number one mission is moving the Stadio
forward now obviously you don't really
measure that in publications per se but
it's important to realize that today
Microsoft Research is one
the major publishers of basic research
in the field and in fact in many of the
top conferences we are the dominant
publisher of basic research we also work
closely with professional societies such
as the ACM and the I Triple E we take
very seriously the fact that we work
with that we participate and are
involved in the journal process in the
peer review process at national research
agencies and things of that sort we have
great team some of them will be talking
today certainly one of the more
celebrated teams in the field of
computer science and again I think
that's been a testament the fact that
we've been able to assemble this group
is a testament to the approach that
we've taken which is to put basic
research first and foremost in in our
mission I mentioned that we drive
technologies into our product and there
it's again you know I mentioned our
mission statement is first to move this
day of the aisle forward but then we
need to have an impact we need to be
able to make the world better to change
the world in a significant way and so
when we have ideas you know we work
closely with that product teams to move
those ideas out and you know people
often will ask me you know how do you do
that we would what is technology
transfer at Microsoft and really what I
say typically is that it's a full
contact sport I mean almost anything you
can imagine doing we do we hold special
events with our product teams things we
call mine sports we have researchers
that work directly with in product teams
we have people from product teams that
work directly with us we try hard to
find a way to get ideas from one person
to another within the company and and we
don't ever think that there's only one
way to do that we're always looking for
new ways to make that happen with a
special team of people we call program
managers whose full-time job is in fact
to do technology transfer and they work
with the power teams they work with the
research teams
they find opportunities and they bring
teams together I think that's been an
important part of the success that we've
had over the years now you know any time
you list you know technologies that have
been transferred into our product you
wind up with a big list and it's hard to
really understand I think the key thing
to realize is that without microsoft
research without the investment in long
term basic research that we began to
make 19 years ago the company that you
see today in microsoft wouldn't be here
I mean just look at what Microsoft has
done over the last 10 years as a company
we've added more than 30 billion dollars
in revenue over the last 10 years we've
added six I think seven new
billion-dollar products during that
period of time we've entered entirely
new markets such as the game console
business that we're in with the xbox
we've changed the way that Microsoft
does its business and the nature of our
businesses now these are things that
without the investments that we've made
in basic research we really wouldn't
have been able to do as a company and I
think that's in some sense you know the
way to think about technology transfer
now when when people think about basic
research you know especially when you
hear when you talk to reporters where
you we talk to people that are outside
of our field there's often a
misunderstanding about what basic
research is and what it does and the
world that basic research plays whether
it's in our society or whether it's in a
company like Microsoft a lot of times
people look out at the the output that
they see from basic research
and they say oh I understand there's
technologies that come out of basic
research so maybe when we think about
basic research we should say it's you're
creating all these this intellectual
property we're creating all of these
technologies you know and that's the
output of basic research and that's why
we should be doing basic research so
that people will look at it that way
other people will say hey you know I
know why you should have a basic
research organization it's to solve
problems I mean every everybody has
problems you get a lot of smart people
together you know they can solve
problems for you and certainly a basic
research organization does create
intellectual property we do have great
people that are good at solving problems
so those things are true sometimes
people also say well I know it's it's
just that be an early warning system
it's to tell the society or to tell the
corporation that that there's some new
thing coming out or there's some change
and we need to be able to have that
early warning system and that's true too
I me as a as a research organization we
often see technologies coming down the
line you know and it's important that we
communicate you know the changes that we
see you know to the businesses and to
the political leaders so that they can
try to make the adjustments necessary to
survive those changes but I would argue
that ultimately the reason to do basic
research isn't really any any of these
things per se right it's not just the
notion that we create intellectual
property it's not just a notion that we
solve problems it's not just being an
early warning system it's something much
more than that much more compelling and
that is survival I think the reason that
societies and the reason that
corporations need to invest in long-term
basic research
to survive if you go back to the
writings of Van of your Bush who one of
the people was very influential in the
creation of the national science
foundation in the United States in the
late 1940s the early 1950s I mean he
makes that point very strongly you know
I mean he was looking at it from a
society societal perspective but what he
was saying was that you know if there's
a new war remember what the country was
just coming out of a war if there's a
disease if there's a famine we need to
make investments in basic research and
in the people that do that work so that
we can change rapidly when change is
required your fur company that means if
we have a new competitor where there's a
new technology where there's a new
business model the company needs to
change rapidly we need to adjust and the
ones that do survive and the ones that
don't disappear and in our field most of
the companies that were around when
Microsoft Research was started back in
nineteen ninety-one aren't around
anymore most of the companies that were
like Microsoft in those days have
disappeared where they changed in
unrecognizable ways and i think it's a
it's a statement about microsoft and
it's the first sight to create a basic
research group that we decided 19 years
ago to make those investments and
because of those investments at critical
points in the company's history we've
been able to change or adapt or solve
critical problems that were important to
the corporation's growth and it isn't
just because we're doing things that the
company believes in is because we're
doing things that move the Stadio
forward in fact so many times in the
history of Microsoft Research we
not in fact we were doing research that
no one in the company besides us really
believed in right we attacked areas we
solve problems we looked at technologies
that at the time they were done there
was no business that the company had
there was no problem that we were trying
to solve that that was associated with
that and yet at critical points in our
hat in our past we've brought technology
bear that changed the future of the
company I think that's why you invest in
basic research so that when change is
needed when change is required for
survival you're able to do that and as I
said I think that there's a classic
mistake that people make when they think
about basic research and they think that
that these things are the output of a
basic research group the technology
transfer is what you're trying to get
from a basic research that that's that's
its output you know or your problem
solving or currently warning or whatever
it is and those are not the output of a
basic research organization those are
those are really this in some sense the
byproducts of well done basic research
the output of basic research is research
the output of a research organization is
are the ideas and the technologies that
move the state of the art forward that's
what microsoft research has been doing
now for 19 years and hopefully that's
what will continue to do for the next 19
years or 20 years or however long you
know we're around because I think that's
the critical value that we bring and
frankly it's the value that you in the
university environments bring to the
broader society that we're in thank you
very much
so I'd like to work I everywhere again
to Shanghai to Asia for the faculty
summit 2010 06 week for the update on
microsoft research so our usual our next
15 minutes to give you a quick update on
what's happening in the lab here at MSR
Asia in the last two years so we set the
part of the MSR microsoft research so we
carry out this mission which would we
just say and on the advanced that the
state of VR and also technology transfer
here just some number two to show you
what we have what will be done in the
last 12 years and specifically last two
years we contribute to the microsoft
microsoft research on those academic
performance and I think the particularly
we actually gather a few are based paper
and so not just about the we of course
we made you also alone into a top
conference and then when you get the
base paper off on this tough conference
and journal really you have you really
are verified material can do some base
of the best research and many of and I
think it almost are a lot of those
research paper academic achievement we
actually we cannot done without the
partnership with with you and most of
these paper we done with our intern and
professor our partnership in the
asia-pacific academic field and we I
have very strong team and there were of
course you you know lodis the universal
relation external research team and I
have a sweet deputy and each one helped
me to manage a critical area in the
computer science area in computer
science fields and binding go who it's
one of the deputy who helped me to
manage the multimedia activities and
where he ma help me to manage all the
search data mining activities and food
help me I'm very good he joined us last
year so almost
years helped me to manage all the system
networking but area and I think the
earth network we are actually actively
participate in the faculty some event
and hitting some section and I think
look forward to have a quick discussion
with you on the others our respective
areas Microsoft's vision for the future
I think now it's pretty pretty sure in a
whole industry we call three screens
plus a cow basic three squeeze two
really a metaphor right we talk about pc
screen mobile smartphone screen and also
the TV screen but it's really represent
your working environment and then also
you are 24 by 7 mobile device the
personal device we see you and also at
the 10 may experience at home it's
actually combi morning if you can't it's
actually menu screen but really it's you
work your life and also you are
everything I mean 24 by 7 and and I
think it's very obvious today it's about
cry and the cloud you really need both I
think the device we actually going we
are we need more we're going to have
more smart device devices and then has a
cloud service which give you the
pervasive at advantage and the service
from the crowd and and I would you will
hear a lot of technology for microsoft
research in the next two days and here i
just used some shortages to demonstrate
a couple technology we are doing in the
asia lab and start with Xbox Kinect and
we actually apart to launcher officially
verify as we speak in us and a few
country and very soon this experience we
actually carry over to the over the
world that the first time we really
provide a really the console free the
user experience roller came in and this
is really we start in the camry
entertainment are feel but very soon you
can expect i think i solved
we call nature use interface experience
we as you carry over to other screen are
the experience to and let me show you
the first the video of this real can
actually been played in the world
you
in the
s boss hoss
xbox play
Oh
in tracking and so you can actually play
it again with you own a natural gesture
without a joystick or controller and you
can see a lot of this can join our the
Ken title we are about to actually do
this formerly this is we showed that
this video actually is a demo than a
certain stage demonstration section in
the e street down in the gym and a lot
of this can you see the kids player
playing with a tiger and use the natural
gesture and to come to the tiger the
tiger will react and also some tensing
also some arabic or thai even tai chi
type of game in series or nature to
really do a result carry some artificial
devices and and then to allow the
technology and i think of the particular
in the new e section tomorrow you are
here some in-depth are the technology
presentation and hope to have a good
discussion with all of you i'm sure some
of you working on those those area for
many many years it's really so
refreshing to see those technology
become reality and actually in in a
consumer game in which is one of the
most challenging area because the
customer really expect a very robust and
new your time are performers for those
cutting-edge technology and I think by
working with the Microsoft product
together we we are so great we can
contribute you have to see those stuffed
become reality and I think it just like
I say as we are speaking those devices
it's about to anyone can't you just go
to the store to buy those device and
then say create those games and no one
mentioned the evasion inherited Roger we
are doing with the partner around the
asia-pacific region we are very very
exciting I think this is the this
involve the real opportunity for us to
working on a computer i saw way I T to
contribute to the humanity and to help
to preserve and to preserve also helpful
our distance or decent and the
high-resolution multimedia presentation
of those the very treasured our cultural
human cultural heritage or natural
heritage sites and and we have we
actually also a specific workshop and
some of you many of you hol Wizards for
this workshop and again the core
technology will be discussed throughout
the are the faculty some me today and
tomorrow and I want to show you one
particular one without recently this is
the we also have the kike pixel camera
which is cinco Chaka actually take the
morning one gigapixel of the whatever
image we take in the program solve
europe into one the cave is very
difficult one of the days even though
they're trying to take a high-resolution
digital archive of the more than
thousands cave in the one that very
remote area but because the lighting and
also the cave is now really afraid for
all of repenting it is really very
tedious and a traditional way you take a
multiple shah abdul stitching together
and i want to show you some of the t we
took our the couple months ago and we
are going to do more for all the caves
and this is the first time we actually
can take a simple shot of the image and
which resolution never been done before
and allow you to do to not born an
archive also for the future multimedia
presentation so let me show you a quick
video okay wait
so these to show you the first of your
traditional way you need to take a
multi-port ER and a different position
now you can take a single shot to cover
a much bigger gone and this is the new
york camera you work and this is one
particular in the 46 k and we take we
take we with one position we still take
multiple sharp at this time we take a
five different shop to focus on
different function of that particular
location and the one you just see that
there the carefree to the convex you
actually can take you take the shot you
you actually can see you now you can
zoom in any portion of this thing go
shop in the past particular one you have
the buddha statue in front of a real
painting for you to actually get the
high resolution shop use for that
particular angle you actually need to do
a lot of men you work but now as you can
see we just take a we just take a single
position shot and we we can actually
view in those resolutions which never be
done before on different region and it's
just wandering along us solve the this
particular shot and then we can actually
do more now you can see we can go into
this particular poodles sleeve and also
the hands and I think wheels by doing
this resolution we can verify the the
cave actually people has bigger to kept
quite neatly we don't see any insect is
it inserts are in there and you know nor
any ends or whatever other insects
they're so and we are again we are going
to do more hopefully we have more to
show you in the future so we we are you
Asia in Beijing in China for the last 12
years and when we when we first come
here we come here for Talon also the
majority the Asia traditionally has been
focused on education and particularly in
size and particular focus our size'
engineering
and those we are very clear 12 years
past fear the two we still still a lot
of smart kids want to educate into
science and and the engineering and we
could do more to promote computer
science and science engineering as a
whole and also today because the
emerging of the different regional Asia
I think now we've become the Asia become
biggest market for a lot of the even
this cutting-edge technology like the
computer industry and the internet and
we really to the first time in the
history we really have opportunity while
we are in no way for Asia we also have
an opportunity to innovate for whole
word the same time and during my last
slide the success of Microsoft Research
Asia in the last 12 years we cannot
doubt without the partnership with our
academic partners and I really want to
be here to sex our old partner for your
support and the partnership and will
continue look forward to conduct forward
to continuing our working with you and
from the new partner I'm sure where's a
new friend new new new friends here and
we certainly are going we are looking
forward to exploring the new
collaboration and partnership arterials
with you so that's all for our the
update of a micro Sol research and thank
you oh and please enjoy the conference
