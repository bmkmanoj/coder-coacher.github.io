our next presenter is Alex James that's
me I won't take a minute you'd stay
thank you whew Alex James ah look at a
swing wow I need a better picture so at
Microsoft we sent something called kudos
to our peers to recognize their help and
to help us the advance our own agenda I
mean for you know cross good
collaboration and I send you a kudos
lastly I think but it's like you usually
when they receive cronin gmail and
unless the recipient tell everybody
nobody knows I want to publicly say
thank you Alex for helping us and then
walk out of this collaboration Oh
database environmental informatics
framework and here's a physical kudo a
first-half paradigm book signed by Tony
Hale VP oh come on this is the book that
you know we're inspired by the things
that in here about data intensive
science thank you thank you very much
well I don't know that okay there's this
uh there's this show in England cool
this is your life but they come out with
a book and then like go through
everything I feel a little bit like that
but um I wasn't expecting that at all so
um can you flick this like the QQ yeah
to and vga okay so hi everyone my name
is Alex I'm a program manager on the
OData team and today I'm going to talk
to you about vo data protocol or the
open data protocol and here's kind of
the overview of what we're going to talk
about today I'm going to give you a
quick introduction to 0 data i'm sure a
lot of you have already heard about it
or can know a little bit about it
because i know young and I have been
talking about it for quite a while then
I'm going to give you a kind of
real will demo of I've got yarn gave me
some a CSV file with a whole load of
element data in it ok so like it brought
me back to my chemistry classes when I
used to be at school and stuff and
that's like ok so there's the periodic
table and I'm going to take that CSV and
just kind of turn it into a no data feed
ok so that's that's kind of like a real
world demo now there are probably better
ways to do this but it's kind of just
showing you what you get if you do that
then I'm going to once we've done that
which is probably going to be the bulk
of the talk we will do a quick
introduction to odata v3 which is the
updated version of the protocol with a
whole set of new features which actually
really help in e-science I think so and
then we'll do a wrap-up and then if
there's any questions we can we can go
into that so what is 0 data imagine I
have a data source somewhere this is a
little database diet you know a little
icon there but that could be any data
source and I want to get it out for some
consumer of that data if I put a no data
service on the top of that thing then I
have immediately enabled HTTP access to
that data so the most predominant way of
accessing and talking across a network
today is HTTP so odata works natively
with HTTP but better than that I have
reach across a whole plethora of devices
and platforms so I can get my data from
from the biggest mainframe computer
sitting in some box somewhere chucking
on data all the way down to the smallest
most you know tiny little handheld
device a mobile phone or something like
that and across all sorts of different
platforms as well so i can i can go from
say iOS Windows Phone dotnet PHP any of
the programming languages that people
are familiar with JavaScript so that's
that's pretty cool Oh data has this I
don't know if you can read this because
it's quite small in the fonts a little
bit funny but that's his metadata in
there on two lines so not only do you
expose the data
you actually tell people what the data
is about which is kind of useful like
it's not not great when you kind of hit
a data feed and it just got this great
big CSV file and you're like well what
does column 55 mean it's got some random
string in it but you don't know what it
is and you don't know how to interpret
it so we have we have metadata as well
we support multiple formats we support
Adam and Jason and Adam for those who
don't know that was kind of like RSS was
this format that came out for doing
blogging right and then someone came
along and said well you know RSS it's
got all these problems so they came out
and produced Adam and then which is kind
of an evolution of our SS it's a little
bit better and and then and then they
said and then they kind of got to this
point where they realized okay Adam is
great for kind of consuming a feed of
data but what if I want to update that
fee and that's where another standard
came out called out and pub which is a
publishing protocol which builds on Adam
and allows you to manipulate it and it's
actually kind of the fundam one of the
sort of foundations of the OData
protocols we kind of leverage the ideas
in there and then took them a little bit
further and made them better for not
sort of kind of news article style data
but actually for just data in general so
we've got this Adam and then we also got
Jason of course and Jason is fantastic
if you are targeting any kind of HTML
kind of client write JavaScript can just
consume that so easily it's it's a joke
you don't need a parser like it's all in
the in the libraries and the browsers
that you use today odata defines a set
of clear semantics on top of the data
that's exposed so we you know if you do
a get request to some URL which is a
part of a no data service you are
attempting to retrieve retrieve a
resource it's pretty much what you would
expect with standard HTTP but the other
verbs are kind of lined up with HTTP
standards as well so in this case the
second example there says post two
elements what that's saying is hey I've
got this collection of elements and I
want to post a new element so like I've
made a great big discovery I found this
new element i'm going to post it up for
the elements collection delete well
maybe we can't find an element anymore
so we just want to remove it no one can
find that and put is what would be okay
that element with some data that we have
about that has changed we want to update
it now you can do kind of two types of
two times of update you can do a put
which is kind of full replace semantics
that means whatever was there but
previously I'm replacing the whole thing
so if I don't provide you a value that
means it should be null essentially or
you can do kind of patch semantics which
is there's an there's another verb that
we allow which is patch so new it's a
relatively recent HTTP standard which
means I'm only anything that I'm not
providing should be left with its
original value we also have a series of
uri conventions so if the metadata told
me that elements was a collection of
element objects and each of those
element objects had a relationship to a
collection of compounds that you could
you know that will involve that element
then then our conventions say that you
know if you identify a particular
element in this case hydrogen then if
you went / compounds you'd be getting
all the compounds related to hydrogen so
there are a series of conventions that
Oh data Matt well not mandates but
suggests okay and we you know we're
doing some things with the protocol to
make those more discoverable we also
have a query language so from the
metadata I know that each element has a
type so I can now filter the elements
and say well only I'm only interested in
the elements which are noble gases okay
now we have a query a query language
which covers not just filtering you can
also narrow the number of properties
that you want for each of your elements
so for example if I'm if I know that
elements have ten properties let's say
in my particular data source and I'm
only interested in like the name and the
symbol then I can just select those two
columns using a dollar Select operator
you can also do ordering and order by
and top and skips
you can you do paging if you need to you
can cut up for example you can skip the
first 100 records and maybe get the next
nine something it's up to you so what
does this mean it means that odata
builds upon standard HTTP verbs which is
pretty important and so you know we're
using the verb the correct verb in the
correct at the correct time so if you
want to retrieve some data we're using
get that's pretty obvious if you if you
want to update some data you can do
patch or put you want to delete data
it's a delete so pretty much what you
would expect from HTTP we also leverage
standard HTTP status codes so if you're
familiar with the HT DB standard you'll
know that like if I try and address a
resource and that resources and there I
should get a 404 response and that's
what we do that's what o data says you
should do we use standard HTTP headers
so we talked about the fact that Oh data
supports 22 formats well imagine that
you are a client that needs the results
to the report to a query in Jason the
way we do that is we use the standard
approach that HTTP does for that so
exactly the same thing that your browser
would do which is to add an accept
header to the request that says I accept
applications / Jason and so then the the
server would say okay I'm going to
format my results in Jason so good we
talked about the standard formats we
also have kind of like the standard
interactions if we're dealing with the
collection and you do a post that
implies you're inserting into that
collection if you if you have a not if
you have a single item you do a delete
that implies i'm deleting an item on top
of that though we add a flexible query
language and metadata and those kind of
those are kind of the two things which
make it better for data alright so why
would you use o data so you know some if
you've got some data you need to expose
there are all sorts of alternatives that
you could use you know imagine you went
off and tried to create a custom REST
API where is everybody know what rest me
good probably know because anybody know
what rest me
okay so rest is this idea of
representational state transfer and the
basic I'd the one that seems to resonate
the most right now is this idea of you
know I the URLs identify resources and
when I and then I operate on those
resources using approaching standard
verbs and so we you could go ahead and
create a custom rest api for something a
little bit like what facebook and
twitter have done the problem is it's
like the honeypot effect right the only
way that people are going to know how to
talk to your services if your data is
compelling enough that they're prepared
to invest in you know learning your
custom api so you know good luck with
that so so what do what is owed a to
give you then so number one is it simple
like if you want to consume a no data
exposed bio data in javascript it's
trivial okay if you want to get it into
excel there's a plug into excel that
does that and that's actually good think
that's going to be mainstream at some
point we extract the data store so it
doesn't really matter what data you
actually have so long as you can look at
it through a lens of o data okay so you
could have a triple store under the hood
if you're familiar with rdf for example
and you could expose that with o data
too if you wanted interoperability would
say Excel we support arbitrary data
access and this is kind of a key one if
you went ahead and created a soap style
you know service that people could
interact with the get data the problem
with that is that you have to think in
advance and you have to know in advance
what people are going to want when
they're talking to your data source
they're like oh they're going to want to
get elements by type so i'll create a um
you know soap method which allows me to
get the elements by type but then you
know it goes out into production and
you've got this data source out there
and then some the first thing you get is
a call from someone says no no I want
the elements by atomic weight range or
something and you can't that's where Oh
data it comes in
small query language means it's suited
to dealing with data now perhaps the
most important one or the one that I
think is the most valuable fro data is
that we have actually have an ecosystem
of platforms and devices and language
which many languages means as soon as
you publish your data as o data anybody
anybody on any of those platforms or
devices and in any of the languages that
o data supports which is a broad range
can now talk to your data source and and
as a side effect of that kind of broad
range of things there's actually a load
of big big adopters right so SharePoint
SI p is your C Microsoft CRM sequel its
sequel itself these are just some of the
examples of people that are pushing
their data out using o data which means
you know there's a there's a crowd of
developers out there that know how to
deal with o data and you can kind of
leverage that yeah
okay there you go
which services did you say sorry okay
yes yeah okay so the question is how do
we add rizzo data relate to the other
offerings that that Microsoft has for
rest services so I think it's fair to
say that Microsoft is slowly moving a
lot of its services 20 data and there's
you know if you look at that list there
that that includes a lot of them already
and so o data is becoming sort of like a
de facto standard for the way we expose
data it's not it's not an official
standard it's just the de facto at this
point inside Microsoft so you'll see
more and more people doing that
no I'm not I'm not going that far cuz
like people there are good reasons
sometimes to use a particular library or
a particular API maybe Oh data doesn't
support some of the things that they
need or you need in that particular
scenario so it's kind of a case-by-case
basis let's let's maybe we can talk
offline about that so there's a there's
lots of different ways of producing Oh
data today with we know with Microsoft
with the Microsoft stack with external
third parties there's actually examples
of for example what's the correct word
for this content content management
systems a number of content management
systems now expose their data through
through data but here's kind of three
that I kind of want to talk about today
the bottom one their data Explorer Assad
is going to be talking this afternoon i
believe about data Explorer and that
actually is a really great way to kind
of take random data sources and kind of
compose them together and produce kind
of what's the right word here i'm
looking for looking for the word what's
that well mashups yes but it's almost
like ah now aggregated is good too these
are good words these are good words what
is it what is it that a that someone who
owns an art gallery does what do they do
they what's the right word curation so
like maybe I want to curate my data
right like I've got I'm pulling together
this data mashing it up and I'm pushing
it out and that's the data that I think
is going to be interesting to to my
people okay so so data Explorer is great
for that kind of thing mashup curation
and so on
maybe you you know you kind of like do
as part of that is part of exposing the
data you're actually removing some of
the inconsistencies in that data some of
the holes in the data because you know
when you're consuming data part of the
problem is dealing with that Duty data
right Oh data loop is a new library that
we've been working on that actually is
now part of is actually used in the in
the end insolite in the guts of WCF data
services and it's a low-level API for
manipulating and and consuming o data
payloads okay so you can use that to
create a feed if you want it it's not
it's it's a lot of work actually but
it's it gives you the kind of the most
control that you could possibly have
okay then the one that I want to really
focus on today is WCF data services
which is where that was originally
called astoria it became a do net data
services and then now it's WCF data
services so we went through the same
kind of naming journey as the Orinoco /
dream insight / whatever team as well
and that thing supports kind of three
primary models of three things that it
can sort of expose it can expose
relational databases by using the entity
framework so if the entity framework has
a connector for the relational database
you can expose that through WCF data
services as Oh data we also have a
connector for just like dot net classes
of writing dotnet classes and I want to
expose the data in those classes act to
act to the web I can do that with what
we call our reflection provider and then
finally you can write a custom data
provider that's a little bit more work
it's basically a set of interfaces that
are already implemented for you here and
here that you can implement yourself and
if you do that you get sort of access to
you can access an almost any data source
at that point so you could create a
custom data provider that they may be
exposes RDF triples or something okay so
let's go ahead and actually try creating
a no data no data thing what I've got
here is a an XL oh it's actually a CS
v file that yarn gave me and as I said
it's just some elements and you can see
I've got a number of different columns
and I just want and the reason why the
split here is I wanted to kind of show
some of the characteristics of the data
because I what I want to do is I want to
get this into a database so that I can
maybe turn it into part of the bigger
model or maybe and support you know
better queries across this thing I don't
want people to just have to pull down
the CSV file every time they want to
know about oxygen right that's
unfortunate that's what that's where our
data would come in you can actually
issue a query and say I just want to
know about oxygen but if we look at this
if I'm going to model that as a table
you know what would I do I look at this
and I can can see here that you know it
looks as if every row in that table has
a number a name a symbol and atomic
weight but I can't say the same thing
about melting point boiling point
density crust and so on so that implies
some things about the database
constraints so if I look at so what I
did then is I went off and created a
database table called elements and if I
have a look at the design for this thing
you can see here I've actually made the
symbol the primary key that's unlikely
to change the name of the symbol for the
element is unlikely to change in this
example I've got a name a number I've
got melting points and so forth and I've
marked some of them as with allowing
nulls because we are data just doesn't
have that information I've also gone
often and if you look at this I've said
this is a decimal 18 for and what that
actually means is it supports four for
four decimal places okay and the reason
why I picked that is because when i was
looking at this data that's the maximum
number of decimal places i have in my
data so I'm kind of matching my data
source with what I'm storing in the
database but once I've done that if I
run a little query over the top of us
I've got no data in the database right
now the next step that I've had is I
created a little project and you can see
here I've got I've got a what this is an
entity framework model okay and this
entity framework model I just generated
there straight off the database and I
can show you how easy that is by adding
a new one I'm not going to use the new
one but you'll get to see the experience
so I crow head and create a an entity
frame and a do net entity data model and
I'm going to say that's actually the
entity framework ok and I'm going to say
let's call this test let's choose a
number which I know I never will have
done before random number there and I'll
generate it from the database and I will
choose this chemicals database which is
where I got it from and I'm going to
give this another name it next now it's
going off to the database looking at the
tables that are in there and gives me an
option to choose which ones I want so I
want just elements I don't want my
backup that's just in case anything goes
wrong right like I'm prepared that's my
famous last words right touch wood so I
do that and now I've got another thing
which looks exactly the same ok so that
just shows how easy it is to create this
thing right I don't need that though I'm
going to I'm going to delete it if you
look under the hood here you can see
that this thing has gone or had gone
ahead and generated two things it's gone
ahead and generated a context which
called chemistry entities that is kind
of acting as my data source so I think
of this as a kind of a strongly typed
database ok and it's that thing has got
some properties on it it's got this
thing called elements which is what I'm
going to interact with to create new
element entries in that table and along
with along with that it went ahead and
created this element class too
so that's one of these entities down
here and you can see it's got a whole
lot of stuff in here to do with co gian
which most of the time you would never
see but it means that i have a class
that i can interact with that represents
an element and now what I did was I went
ahead and wrote some code that simply
creates a new greats a new copy of that
that database that sort of essentially
that database right it's not creating a
new copy but creating a connection to it
right then I said okay well I'm going to
I'm going to go and open the file okay
and I'm running in the bin debug
directory so I had to kind of thought up
a couple of levels to get to the
elements CSV file then I open that as a
stream with a stream reader and that
really just means I'm completely i want
to read it as characters instead of
fights okay and the reason why I want to
read it as characters is because i want
to just read lines because i know this
is a comma-separated file the first
thing i do is i just go ahead and skip
the header row here right I don't care
about that I know what I'm dealing with
I just want to read the data and then I
wrote a little method to go and read all
the lines from that as an enumeration so
I can enumerate through the lines in
that file and for each of the lines that
I come across I call a method here
called create an element for that line
and if we look at the way that code
works it's pretty simple stuff I take
the line I split it on commas because
it's comma separated right and then I
and then I pull the different property
names of the element object from the
different parts of that the different
you know elements in the array that got
generated and you can see you know some
of these things need to be there like I
need to be able to parse the atomic
weight that's because in the database I
said that's not nullable okay every row
in that in that in that CSV higher had
an atomic weight so I better be able to
turn it into a decimal then some of them
though like the melting point I've
some code here which says well you know
if you can't convert that to a decimal
give it to me as null because I'll put
it into the databases now so I've got so
I got all this data I can turn it
converted the line of the file into an
element and and then what I'm doing with
that is I'm adding it to my to my
database I'm adding it to this
collection called elements and so the
entity framework is kind of remembering
what you're doing here okay and then
finally I right at the end I go save
changes now this code works because I've
only got 109 rose right entity framework
would not be useful for dealing with
like you know a million rows you
wouldn't attempt this you'd either have
to split it up or you'd use a different
way to get the csv file into the
database now there are lots of easier
ways to get CSV data into a database but
I did it this way because i'm going to
leverage this entity framework contacts
in the future okay so it's kind of like
this this is kind of killing two birds
with one stone so now if I oops I just
bring this up again I should just be
able to debug this now Oh lovely oh yes
this is a bug I've seen before what's
happened here is I'm trying to open a
file which is already open so it doesn't
like that so I need to close my excel
file don't save any changes there and we
will let's restart oops
now I've got my rose in my database and
we can see that by rerunning this query
there we go you can see they're ordered
by symbol because that was the primary
key i chose so I've got my data in there
now okay so how do I now so that's kind
of step one get that data somewhere
where I can easily expose it step 2 I've
got this website project that's
essentially an empty project I've
cheated a little bit i put one file in
there but i'll show you why later so
trust me this is kind of like i created
an empty website okay the only things
i've done is i've added added a
reference to my other project okay so
that's so that i can gain access to this
guy because i'm going to use this when I
expose my o data the way I the way I do
that is right click on here so I want to
add a new item and I want a WCF data
service and i'm going to call this
chemistry service and what this does the
chemistry service is a stand-in for a no
data service okay and it asks me hey
what's your data source now this is
where you know as I said previously
you've got kind of lots of options with
WCF data services the easiest one is to
use the entity framework that's what
we've got we've got a chemistry entities
which we can use and it came from the
data loader service so that's why I had
to kind of use data loader so this is
saying hey crater create a no data
service using that data source start so
far so so far this wouldn't actually do
it if I ran this code it wouldn't
actually do anything because when you're
doing this you have to kind of
explicitly just decide what you want to
expose so I'll go ahead and do that what
I want to do
ropes
I want to set an access rule that says a
my entity sets because this is kind of
like I don't care I don't want people
modifying the data through this service
I just want them to be able to read it
in this particular example I'm just
going to say all read that means every
collection of data that you have in that
in that data source I want to expose it
as read now you can you can go through
and individually call out that the
things you want we don't really have
time for that the other thing I want to
do is set an entity's panty set page
size limit and again you can do this per
set or you can do it you know for every
set so I'm sending it to 10 now typical
what this actually does is it says hey
if a request comes in from a client to
get data don't give them everything give
them a subset because you know often the
person is not wanting everything so like
when i hit a service and unless I'm
rendering it in a UI I didn't really
want four hundred thousand rows in your
database so I just wanted the first
hundred okay so in this example it's a
good idea to put page size limits in we
typically recommend something between
100 and 100 and 500 as a good size but
because we've only got 100 100 9 rows
I'm going to put that down to 10 just so
we can see this in action with that in
place I should just be able to run my
code now
and there's my odata service up and
running now what if you hit the root of
the service you get an atom pub an atom
pub service document which tells you
what's available but this thing's kind
of really pretty bare-bones it only says
that there's a feed called elements it
doesn't tell you anything about it got a
metadata is kind of the thing I was
talking about previously that tells me a
little bit more right this thing tells
me that I've got a an entity set called
elements that's of the type element and
and then I can look at this thing and go
ah here's what an element has and you
can see that the key of an element is
its symbol and a symbol is a string and
and I like it's got a boil it's got a an
atomic weight and that's a decimal and
it's accurate to four decimal points and
so so that's kind of cool so with that
in with that knowledge i can now
actually start making requests and you
can see here i just hit elements and if
I kind of close all these are you'll see
that it should have only returned the
first ten and what it's done is it's put
in the next link there that says hey if
you want more of the data just go and
follow that link instead so I could I
could just cut and paste this guy put it
up here and then I get the next ten okay
I can also ask some more interesting
questions I know that the primary key or
the key of of the elements is the symbol
so if I wanted gold and I know the
symbol for gold and I can just pull back
gold and if I wanted to know the atomic
weight of gold I can pull that back to
right so like I'm now I've got the
ability to kind of worried my service I
can also do some more interesting things
to I can say hey I want to do a filter
here and let's say i want to say i want
all the elements let's start with where
the name starts with and say 'he
I only got one but you can imagine that
i can write queries hear that pull back
just the data i'm interested okay and I
can also do projections so I can filter
the data i'm interested in jet well not
filter i can narrow what I'm interested
in so i don't get all those pieces of
data i don't care about the boiling
point and the density all i care about
is the name the symbol and let's say the
year of discovery and now that's all the
data that's returned ok so this is I'm
showing you this with Adam but I've
actually got another example in here
I've got this little HTML file which
uses jQuery so that means it probably
wants to use JSON to get the same thing
and it's just pulling that data down
very simple and it follows the next link
and I can just see all my data and the
code for that if you're interested is
very simple
standard a bit of a standard bit of HTML
code so I've just got a div where I'm
going to put my results I've got a
button you'll get results I've got some
anchors which I've got a class on them
called intercept so anytime any clicks
that anchor I'm going to intercept it
and do this instead I'm going to just
pull the href out and get the data from
that href I've got a function which
actually goes and gets data and all it
does is it cause the jason the built in
jquery get jason method and takes the
URL issues a request pulls the data down
and puts it into a table and then if
there's a next link so if there's one of
these guys it creates an anchor which
says more and then it puts the class on
intercept so that whenever that thing
gets clicked my other event handler gets
fired and and that's pretty much it and
then you know the first time you click
get results it just calls you know hide
the get results button so you can't
click it again and then it and then it
just goes and gets the starting point
and pretty simple code every job a bj
query programmer in the world could
write this code right that well that's a
big bold statement but let's say every
competent jquery programmer in the world
could write this code ok so that's
that's my quick demo of creating and
exposing a no data service let's go back
to the presentation how much we've got
we've got about four minutes so this is
going to be quick so some new things in
0 data v3 the first one that I think
this audience is going to be very happy
about is spatial we have now got spatial
types so you don't don't have to model
your spatial types in you know in random
ways right there's a standard way to do
it you've got some o data originally
shipped with the load of primitive types
integers bullion's decimals that kind of
thing datetime we now add two new
hierarchies of primitive types geography
and geometry and they you know they both
have like point and line string and
although all the things that you'd
probably used to
I'm not an expert in that but I can
point you at the people who are so if
you want to know let me know but in this
particular example i'm imagining I've
got a no data service which exposes
catchment areas and I want to you know
pull back all the catchment areas that
are close to some location and solo so
what it's saying is that i'm calling the
geo distance function and i'm saying a
the location of the catchment area the
distance from that and this geography
point is less than something right i may
have got some of this format wrong but
you know you i can put you at the guys
who know what's going on another thing
we've added his actions and functions so
actions are things that are kind of side
effect thing but fall outside the norm
or the kind of the uniform interface of
0 data which is like insert a single
item get-get are not a single item will
get a collection of item update a single
item delete a single item this might
allows you to do more interesting things
so for example here i'm saying catchment
area 5 has got a new days worth of
telemetry data or something right and
it's actually stored in this csv file
and i want you to go ahead and process
that and put it into the database so
that people can query it again later
okay likewise on the other side action
funk that's actions that kind of side
affecting they change the data source
functions on the other hand allow you to
modify the kind of the URL structure for
queries they allow you to change how you
query the system so I you know I added a
function here called which meets some
criteria right it could be any name
there and that thing could take
parameters and it and that the idea is
that it gets it gets composed directly
into the into the URL allowing you to
take any uro data URL and then compose
the function call with that these two
are pretty exciting I think as well so
any and all this the first one here is
saying I want to get all the catchment
areas which had any temperature greater
than 110 degrees in whatever you know in
some time period
like depending on how much data we've
got right the next example is saying I
want all the catchment areas where all
of the temperatures were less than you
know below zero right so these are kind
of two new things which just increase
the query ability of the old data stack
we've also added some other things
better inheritance support support for
patch prefer if you've got any questions
about these things just come up and ask
me go look at that I think I was pretty
close to being dead on time so in terms
of a conclusion you can see I think that
using o data is a great way to kind of
take that data which you maybe you got
in a CSV file or some random data source
and expose it to the web and let anybody
consumer Excel clients JavaScript
applications windows phone iOS anything
v2 another thing we just we didn't spend
a lot of time on this but v3 of o data
is much better for a science we've got
spatial stuff we've got actions and
functions which allow you to do some
things which are a little bit outside
the norm but provide the extra power you
need and then of course perhaps the most
important thing is that when you cite
when you use o data you're getting into
an ecosystem of tools and things which
will make it so that anybody can connect
to your data got a series of links here
oh dear dog is where you can find out
about how o data is changing we do most
of our most of our design out in public
so that's pretty good we've got the
environmental informatics framework
which yarn and and down have worked on
and that's that's suppose that's very
cool WCF data services that's what I was
just showing you before and then and
then a whole list of other things don't
worry about copying these down I'm sure
yarn will share the deck at some point
any questions
with Alex no questions this always
happens it's like stunned silence I know
we're all here like for the beautiful
glorious theta visualization tools those
are always what this is this is more
low-level this is kind of like this is
kind of like where the rubber hits the
road right hmm yeah absolutely so do you
want to take that one might because you
the question was do we use this with
sequel as your oh here okay I know
you're the expert in this though so the
question is can I use o data with sequel
Azure and the answer is yes absolutely
Alex showed vanity framework exposing a
model on top of regular sequel server on
Prem sequel server and then built a no
data service over that you can do
exactly the same thing using sequel
Azure and you can expose your own custom
model we also for a while had in C
closure of labs prototype of a product
that would automatically expose odata on
top of your cycle as your database so as
you modify this I closure database
modify the structure of it whatever you
exposed through the user that you would
provision for yo data service would
automatically be exposed as no data
service and if you guys have interest in
that I'd be happy to talk to you about
that as well any other questions yep
okay um do you do you know this yeah
this is a good question for that there
was actually a question earlier about
rest interface to storage and windows
storage and the windows a juror table
storage rest interface actually is a no
data interface they actually use WCF
data services
in order to expose it and they write
what we call a custom provider so when
you're using that rest interface whether
you know it or not you're actually using
o data thank you i'm all photographers
waiting outside so that's keep talking
as we follow jaya outside and then let's
