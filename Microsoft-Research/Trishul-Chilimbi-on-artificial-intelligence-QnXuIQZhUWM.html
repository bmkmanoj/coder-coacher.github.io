getting AI ready for everyday use how
does how does Project Adam how is that
useful to us I think the possibilities
are are immense and so let me just mean
an outline a few maybe so so one thing
that you know Peter is thought would be
very useful and I agree with them it's
like you know you walk around with a
cell phone take a photograph of what
you're eating and it tells you the
calorie content the nutritional value
and you might decide based on that it's
like wow those fries a way to you know
eat less of them things like I'm just
wondering in my backyard and I might
look at a plant and say well I'm curious
what is that you know tell me what it is
and then more future looking is like you
know if you could take an image of
something and describe a scene it could
really help blind people you know what's
going on around you just kind of
describe things around it and I think
the ultimate goal is to use this to help
machines understand represent and
explain the world around us and
understand us and so putting those two
things together you can think you know
the ultimate goal is like you know your
best personal assistant that's always
around with you because you carry all
these devices but now these devices know
you they know the world around you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
