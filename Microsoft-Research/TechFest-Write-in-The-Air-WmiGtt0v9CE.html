next to me is lei ma and lay you've
created a program called right in the
air tell me tell me about what that is
yeah well the this is this demo is just
to show you a fantasy scientific a
fantasy life for how people can interact
you with the machine without a keyboard
and most and our work is which i'll
present in you later is that when I
writing the character with a year and
the machine can recognize the character
you are writing your intended to write
and recognize the result it can provide
the user a new generation of experience
so essentially you're gonna you know
draw a letter in the air and the webcam
is going to recognize what that letter
is yeah yeah we can we can recognize the
the numerical digits the English letters
and each nation is the asian languages
such as such Chinese Japanese and Korean
that's amazing and now what sort of what
where do you see this being used in the
future and like what sort of homes and
devices are going to be connected with
it well we're thinking about two
scenarios which reason which would be
very important to Microsoft the first
days the interactive game when you play
down the xbox and I think it's a when
you when you watch the internet TV and
when the TV connect to the internet you
may want to input some queries to find
interesting videos on the internet yeah
let's take a look at it right in the air
okay first we all play the game I'll
watch that television you just need to
grab whatever object you can see I
holder the app or Apple here and now you
can put the Apple on the screen and the
the machine can recognize the object and
the way you move the object to the the
the tracking pointer will follow the the
object and then you can rest the
character you want
here I all right to the the Chinese
letter for the microsoft okay is the
tool Chinese lighter the first is the
mac macro so it recognizes the the apple
sort of as a pen or pencil yeah you
can't sink is a can of paint and you can
see the first this character is the
creator answer and the macro and the
second character is the softer and we
can see you're catching the characters
mostly and this is the correct one over
here on the on the left-hand side of the
screen is that just a representation of
what you've just drawn replay the
trajectory you are writing in the air
and when you're right to the input a
query in the search box and you can
start searching and you can see the the
first one is about Microsoft Chinese web
page yeah max off to China but it also
recognizes English letters correct yeah
yeah I can show you the English dieter
please do and now could you could the
ball could any of these objects be used
okay okay expected okay first you'll
kill you need to lock on the object and
you can't see the object and Malacca and
I was right to the Microsoft Research
Asia the first the capital later this is
m/s Microsoft Research major
this is a correct answer and you can
search the Microsoft Research Asia and
you can see the msi msi yeah very cool
and now do you need to use an object
such as this to be the pen can you just
use your finger yeah but currently well
it's um k away we are doing the
technology because the screen so small
finger give we will not see clearly so
we need to use the big one where your
play the game you your distance you from
the television maybe about your one mom
you're not normally this close to your
television screen use a finger if we're
will not recognize the correctly and
because balls are fun yeah yeah yeah
thank you very much and is there a
website can people sort of go and learn
more about this if they choose to oh
well research I think I use the eye to
the research thought microsoft com stash
Asia your case your friends dad oh god
why well thank you very much this is
awesome congratulations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
