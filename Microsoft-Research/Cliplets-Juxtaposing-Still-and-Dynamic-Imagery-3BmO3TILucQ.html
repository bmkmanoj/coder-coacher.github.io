researcher and Microsoft Research and
today I'm going to talk to you about our
research project on creating clip 'lets
so clip le'ts are a type of imagery that
sits between a still image and a video
and they allow you to capture a moment
in time as opposed to an instant in time
and tell a little bit more of a
narrative we enable people to do that
using computer vision and computer
graphics techniques let me describe to
you and show you what a clip late' is
and how you can create one so on the
left here we have a handheld video and
the camera is shaking around and you'd
see there's a lot of clutter from people
moving in the background on the right
we've created a clip lit from this and
we're now focusing attention on just one
object and the motion of that object so
we can tell a little bit more of a
narrative and convey this particular
thing that's going on in the scene so
let me show you how you would create
this clip lit with our tool so this is
our clip lit app that we've created what
it does is it allows you to map the
input time to the output time the clip
light so there's a time n bar and a time
out bar and a selection tool so to
create a clip --let our tool enables you
to select objects so in this case I'm
going to select this fountain that we
want to loop I'm going to adjust the
input and output points from where this
video will come from from the clip and
then when I hit play it will render the
clip lit and in the background it's
doing segmenting and compositing and a
number of automatic fixes to make the
clip loop seamlessly and now you'll see
it's done and in the player it's just
playing this nice repeating loop of the
water fountain so let me show you a
couple other results on the left here we
have another looping type of texture
these are also known as cinemagraphs
online on the right we've created
something that's a little bit more
narrative so here there is an initial
state and an ending
State but there's also a progression in
time so it tells a little bit more of a
story and then here we have a
progression through time and it's more
like a still image that kind of comes to
life for a little while and then goes
back to being a still image so that's
our research project on creating clip
'lets where we explore the space of
imagery between still images and videos
and allow you to capture and convey
moments in time and tell short
narratives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
