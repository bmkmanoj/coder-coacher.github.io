you
alright thank you all for coming we're
delighted today to have Meryl Alpert
from the University of Southern
California Merrill has done work on a
lot of different topics and hopefully
somebody will get the chance to meet
with her later and talk about her full
range of work today she's going to talk
to us about work from her dissertation
about youth with disabilities and their
use of tablets and apps so I'll hand it
over to you thank you hi like Nancy
wonderfully said I'm Meryl Alpher and
I'm a PhD candidate in communication at
the Annenberg School for Communication
and journalism at the University of
Southern California and I'd like to
thank everybody here at Microsoft
Research New England especially the
social media collective for having me
here today and all the guests from all
these other groups that are and here at
Boston that are here as well and so my
talk today is entitled making a
difference one app at a time ? is
important and disability distinction and
domestic access in my work I study the
social and cultural implications of new
media and communication technologies
particularly using an ethnographic and
historical approach to understand the
role that communication technologies
play and have played historically in
everyday life and within this I focus
primarily on on three areas in my work
so mobile communication disability in
digital media and kids and families
technology use and during my time at
annenberg I've focused on each of these
areas individually but the direction
that I see my work going in the future
is really at the underexplored use a
little thing here nexus of all three of
these so in my talk today I'm going to
be drawing early on two pieces of
writing so one being my first book
Digital youth with disabilities which is
published in November by MIT press and
actually is now going into a second
printing which I'm super excited about
yeah and so the impetus behind this book
was that researchers over the past
decade have been focusing on the digital
media and technology use among
historically marginalized youth so
researchers like Microsoft's own Mary
gray and Danah Boyd and but youth with
disabilities have primarily remained
outside of that range of research and
but actually when you think about it you
youth with disabilities they compose
thirteen percent of all of us students
so a pretty sizable population that's
not only really excluded from you know
this just focus on on casual media use
but a lot of other sort of research on
media and technology in general so my
talk also is going to you know I'm going
to cover some of my dissertation here so
entitled home screen home which is a
play on the home screen and home sweet
home sort of a nostalgic notion thinking
about our infrastructures of what what
construct our home and and it dealt
specifically into one group of youth
with disabilities those with significant
communication impairments studying how
their their parents manage their use of
communication technologies at home and
particularly the apple ipad so by way of
introduction to this population we're
going to pull a little bit from the
headlines I see some nods here do people
notice have people come across this this
article in The New York Times cool so
it's from last October entitled to
Surrey with love how one boy with autism
became BFF with Apple Sri so in the
article Judith Newman who's a parenting
blogger for the New York Times describes
how Sri the interactive assistant that
comes bundled with the Apple iPhone
motivates her autistic son Gus to
communicate and Newman rights she says
Gus speaks as if he has marbles in his
mouth but he wants to get the right
response from Sri he must enunciate
clearly so it's motivating and so Surrey
and other voice assistance like
Microsoft's Cortana often form and I was
like I was like I was like ever thought
I was like must say this because I don't
want it to be like over-the-top Apple oh
so as researchers like Charlton and Kate
have talked about people form intimate
relationships with these interactive
agents and for Gus actually his bond
with Sri is forged precisely because she
reliably and consistently holds
information about his very specific
interest so as you can see here turtles
and airplanes that's what guess is
really super into and and and actually
Newman claims that you know talking with
sarah is actually improving his
communication
her for the better so Newman isn't alone
among parents more generally in
suggesting that order at ordinary
interactive media might motivate
children with significant difficulty
speaking to talk so for example when i
interviewed nelson and these are all
going to be pseudonyms for the rest of
my talk here and certain nelson is the
father of Stephanie who's a ten-year-old
minimally speaking autistic girl he said
that this putt the popular talking tom
app I'd heard people are familiar with
with talking tom and but that talking
tom motivates autistic children because
it's a creature that repeats everything
they say and has the patience to listen
and using her turd voice Nelson said
that you know with her voice she makes a
kitten meow she makes him jump up on the
ceiling she makes him fart she knocks
him down and Marissa echoing the new
york times article said this is me this
is a captivating quote she said that
hearing Marissa used this app was the
first time we really hear her voice it's
a phrase that she told me but there's
always a but that's always but and so
while Gus and Stephanie might be using
interactive media in very similar ways
their backgrounds couldn't be more
different so Gus's mother is a white Ivy
educated tech-savvy parenting columnist
for the world's most premier newspaper
arguably Stephanie's mother is a Latina
immigrant from Mexico who told me that
she didn't quite feel comfortable with
technology that Jim said you know their
home computer printer but like it was
too much technology for her to master
Gus attends learning spring which is a
state of the art school for autistic
children in Manhattan Stephanie's
parents though on the other hand feel
that they receive little support from
public school professionals and therapy
providers and actually when Marissa was
telling one of her therapists about how
she was with Stephanie she was using a
talking tom map and it was helping them
out she was treated condescendingly and
actually even accused of lying and
Marissa told me that the therapist had
said to her ah mrs. Hernandez I love how
you try to understand your daughter and
maybe I don't understand but you made
that up
you know truth here so for me this
convergence and divergence between the
experiences of Gus and Stephanie between
their families their experiences with
technology and the social institutions
that are regulating that technology that
encapsulates the core research question
that's driving my talk here today so how
do class and culture shape domestic
technology use among youth with
disabilities and their families so what
I found is that new media and mobile
technologies can be powerful tools with
youth with communication impairments
with them youth and families have the
potential to develop voice and assert
more control over their lives but to
borrow the phrasing of Sonia Livingstone
in Leah lever the social meanings
derived from and the social consequences
of these technologies vary among more
and less privileged families I'm also
going to unpack what i mean by
privileged in the context of my talk
because contrary to popular claims that
technology is a universal equalizer for
individuals with disabilities I argue in
my dissertation that parents ability to
mobilize social economic and
particularly cultural capital shapes the
extent to which all youth with
disabilities not just those who are
privileged can speak and truly be heard
so in the talk that follows I'm going to
step back first and give you a rough
sketch just you know what are the
technologies that individuals with
significant speech impairments are using
to promote their communication and what
are some newer entries into this market
that are disrupting it next I'll give a
more detailed overview of my
dissertation project laying out my
theoretical application of cultural
capital and my means of studying it then
I'll dive into one component of parents
understandings of their children's use
of the iPad their understanding of what
it meant for the technology to give
their child a voice following that I'm
going to discuss some practical
applications for for policymakers for
practitioners and the tech industry and
then I'm going to discuss some
theoretical and empirical directions
that I see developing out of this work
so for some of these overviews so many
non speaking
are minimally speaking individuals use
technologies that are commonly referred
to as augmentative and alternative
communication devices or AAC devices
that's how refer to it for the rest of
the talk and so they augment other forms
of communication that individuals
already have at their disposal so not so
nonverbal communication or non lexical
sounds so laughter not exactly a spoken
word and also then is an alternative to
a person's embodied oral speech
production so that's where this AAC
comes from and it's difficult to get
exact statistics on you know how many
people are using these technologies but
the American speech-language-hearing
association estimates that there are at
least two million people in the US so
whether by birth or something that
happens later in life like having a
stroke perhaps that impacts their
ability to produce beach now in this
configuration AAC covers a wide range of
practices including American Sign
Language is actually incorporated into
the definition of AAC so again it's
something that extends human speech
production and also a variety of
materials and to me it's always really
what I loved when I encountered this
body of literature is that they'd
already you know the conception
conceptualization of technology as being
something that's more than just digital
is very much baked into their conception
of well what's the sort of spectrum of
low mid high tech ways tools to augment
communication so so that the top is a oh
yes yeah focus on speech production as
opposed to say vision replacement or you
know audio we're planning is it because
you think technology has made
particularly large leaps in that area
where is it just one example that's sort
of a model for the other areas serve me
I i I'd had a sort of a trajectory of
different disabilities that I've been
interested over the course of my
research so rail was one area that I was
really interested in in reaction to
touch screen devices and how good is a
touchscreen device if it only has one
smooth texture when you need to read
something with bumps and and then for me
I think circling back to communication
studies with commute
sciences and disorders to me I saw this
natural bridge there that wasn't being
connected and so that's why I sort of
redirected to thinking and I'll get into
it about how I see these as being mobile
technologies even though they're not
seeing necessarily in that way from the
vantage point of communication scholars
cool so so covers these range of devices
so most famous AAC user right I always
like I have to say oh and somebody's
like well what kind of you know
technology you're talking about it like
do you know Stephen Hawking do you know
the technology he uses well that's kind
of what I'm talking about here so
Hawking's device costs thousands and
thousands of dollars your average sort
of range for these devices is you know
5,000 6,000 7,000 sort of basic model
but there's now new entry point here
tablet computers and they're disrupting
this market I talked to lots of
different speech therapists parents
everybody's like game has changed new
new paradigm here and they're equipped
then with apps that that mimic the
software that is on dedicated AAC
devices and I should say that this app
and that's kind of the focus of my study
here I kind of picked one up to focus on
pro quo is only available on Apple
devices not available windows or android
or anything like that so what you might
realize so this is one app on this
device you can also put lots of other
thing on these tablets besides just
these AAC apps so and in fact actually a
survey of people there's a survey done
and it should say it's by the people who
were the creators are proloquo2go so
there's they have a sort of a hat in
this in this race but surveyed people
ninety percent of people said that
besides having this app on their Apple
device they used other apps besides this
one and so I think to understand this we
have to we have to think about families
as purchasers of technology so does it
chart here that maps so just between two
thousand eleven and two thousand
thirteen among families with kids eight
and under ownership of tablet computers
jumped from eight percent of these
families to forty percent and actually
approximately seventy percent of people
who are who owned these devices to use
for AAC seventy percent said that it was
through a family purchase that they
acquired it in the first place there's
an awareness and a among this population
to to using this technology and for its
part actually Apple has taken advantage
of of this phenomenon in their own
marketing so this is actually as part of
a video that they put out for their app
developers sort of inspirational
motivating and and it features a
proloquo2go user and his family and the
with the tagline being making a
difference one app at a time hence the
the title of this talk however oh yes oh
you there you're about to get to my next
you can wait wait one minute um so
another explanation for why why this
might be so popular for families to be
purchasing neoliberal logics where
there's a lack of public funding for
them in the first place and so school
districts are highly uneven in providing
them and third-party insurance providers
generally do not cover them and they and
they give a couple reasons so one
fearing the fragility of the device and
medical liability risks and then also
put the potential for fraud and resale
so they're sort of thing that's out
there and so yes it should be noted you
know how much does this app if you're
going to buy it out of pocket how much
does it cost so guessing game how much
do you think this app costs you should
be CEO of Microsoft so I got a range
here so it's a two hundred twenty
dollars so yeah almost almost right on
the button they're witches almost as
expensive as your base ipad mini so for
me then considering you know to Bexar so
considering these these structural
limitations combined with these
opportunities in mobile communication
I wanted to study well then this
difference that these apps are making
what does that look like and what does
that look like a cross family's
different socioeconomic status mm-hmm if
you're gonna get to its fine do you have
a comment on why it's that expensive is
there a reason um just like opportunity
so 11 least you know looking at what
they've said of why it's so expensive
one of it being that sixty dollars of
each of each sale goes to apple with
another thing is just the deal audience
like if you're like an affirmation you
you get the audience the number of users
that are going to buy it is so much
limited so you're only here instead of
quantity you have to be man and
opportunity that's right you know if
you're a parent or when these child's
that's maybe an hour of a speech there
at this time one hour right from this
thing your kiddo play with all the time
yea verily you compared this to kind of
the cost of hawkings device but do you
know what the cost of the comparison is
to a cost of like a paper pecks system
picture exchange system which i think is
what is mimicking yeah so with that it's
it doesn't even and eivin either or so a
lot of families start with pecs yeah and
then progress up to this right but you
have an idea of the cost of like a pex
of paper pecks kit um I don't have that
I know it's in like the hundred then
there's always the thing with that
there's always things that they add on
it's like oh if you can buy the thing
and then there's a special folder and
there's the special it's all part of
this larger ecosystem of the ways that
parents there's a vulnerability for
buying things that you think will help
and there's always new things that can
potentially help yeah yeah okay so so
for me then there's also this broader
question that I'm asking so you know
beyond just this one app beyond this one
piece of software one piece of hardware
one population I'm thinking here and
more generally how does this fit into
the ways that we think about how
contemporary parents are making sense of
technological and cultural shifts in
family media use overall so now to get
sort of into the meat of the
dissertation so theoretically the way
that I'm organizing and the study is
through understandings of pierre
bourdieu's notion of capital
first mainly focusing on cultural
capital but I'm going to do a little
overview here right now plenty of you
are very familiar with this but
everybody else want to do a quick review
here so we're juicier eyes that capital
is something that structures our social
world and that it makes certain
opportunities more possible and and that
is what we kind of broadly considered to
be a privilege and it comes in these
different forms so economic capital is
how we may be generally think about
capital as as monetary value in culture
and social capital being the value of
our human relationships and our networks
cultural capital is a little more
intangible it's sort of the perks that
you get of being the member of a more
elite social class that makes one
distinct from a member of somebody who
might be considered a member of a lower
less elite social class there's three
forms of this as well it's embodied
objectified and institutionalized
cultural capital so embodied cultural
capital r is the learned ways of using
one's mind and using one's body so one
example being the accent or the dialect
that a person speaks with objectified
cultural capital are the items and goods
that sort of denote status so you might
think oh the kind of person who always
gets you know the latest iPad the latest
latest whatever device it has a lot of
them but that's what there's a sense of
status that comes along with being
somebody who acquires and amasses most
contemporary technologies
institutionalized cultural capital are
markers of official recognition so it
might be the degree that one went holds
or the terminology that only somebody
who has that kind of a degree would hold
as well that is itself a marker of a
certain kind of recognition now would
you applied his theory of cultural
capital primarily to schools and i want
to say specifically french ones because
that sort of shades what would you is
writing about to begin with and arguing
that school plays the most significant
role in reinforcing class relations so
shifting men though to an american focus
and so net laro a sociologist had
focused on will in US schools how does
all play out and and she focuses on
parental participation in children's
schooling finding that that social class
shapes the cultural resources that
parents have to appear as if there are a
good parent to other parents and
teachers and like one idea i had as well
you know some teachers might look down
upon a parent who sends their kids with
you know to school with Lunchables for
lunch you know those like processed meat
and cheese like rounds with the crackers
whatever but then and think about that
parent in a certain way versus thinking
about a parent who sends their child
like organic tofu slices and like a
whole foods packaged whatever like
there's a value assigned to those
choices and that that reinforces these
distinctions between already has a sense
of middle class upper middle class
structure that's built into the values
and the goals we're recently that when
laro that was only focusing there on the
mainstream classrooms well then how does
this play out in special education is it
any different is similar and so Colin
young Dean sociologists looked at that
as well and found that yes that upper
and middle-class parents there's a
there's a structure a shin that happens
but a lot of it has to do with the
language of special education and if
anybody has experience with a special
education system but it's a gauntlet it
is daunting there's a lot of terminology
and a lot of ways of there's a lot of
performance that goes on whether it's
how to speak about the latest therapies
or whether it has to do with em there's
these meetings they're called
individualized education plan IEP
meetings and there are rules and there
were rules that take a lot of time to
learn whether it's you know do you bring
somebody who's a third party to sit in
and and mitigate between different you
know people who are there because it's
also like a whole group of school
representatives and one parent a lot of
power dynamics that are tricky they're
switching out into thinking about
cultural capital and technology so
Jonathan Stern has you know has thought
about you know how do we think about
technology as a strategic research site
it's a way to understand society there's
a way to understand how we structure our
social practices that kind of create
what we think of as technology how we
have we social at our social actions
create this sense of what technology is
and then in a similar vein Ellen ciders
combining some of your Jew in larose
work on cultural capital and education
in relation to technology and she's
focused on the ways that schools tend to
promote then middle and upper-middle
class his use of technologies the way
that the experiences that they already
have at home how school is reinforcing
those same uses and so then when you
have kids who do not have the same
opportunities to use technology in those
ways than you are reinforcing structural
inequality and she calls that the home
technology divide so with my
dissertation then I'm really trying to
to link these areas together to be able
to understand well what is the role
event of cultural capital in shaping
home media use among students with
disabilities in its potential way of
reinforcing social inequality mm-hmm so
imagine that even 10 years ago
irrespective of technology there is a
huge gap between parents with more
resources with children with
disabilities because they know how to
navigate the bureaucracy better they
have more resources and obviously
they're great needs so do you have a
sense if so this basically the baseline
is a huge gap between kids with
disabilities for my parents with higher
socioeconomic status on so you have a
care sense with technology has now the
white and visca so I'm gonna argue that
it's widened I'm gonna argue that
there's more to know and and less
resources to be considered somebody who
knows a lot about it and that there are
certain parents here who those
distinctions become Creek knology
doesn't it's for technology it depends
on how we're defining technology we're
type defining it as books and we're
defining is the internet for defining it
as social you know people as technology
groups as technology so I guess it
depends in that respect but there's a
significant and distinction that at
least through these technologies that
are that is happening
mhm feel free to address this later but
um as so in my research on financial
jersey there is there are findings that
sort of poor people learn the financial
issues associated with being poor so how
to navigate the welfare system how to
navigate check cashing places and really
how to make do in a variety of different
ways and then I don't have a miracle
background for this other than my own
experience as a high school teacher but
it at the time it was accepted knowledge
to me that low-income and non-white
students were disproportionately
identified as having special needs and
so I'm curious about how in your work
the ability to navigate the IEP process
and special education system is a
cultural capital associated a form of
cultural capital associated with black
privilege so that's what Colin Ondine is
really getting out right there wonderful
book distinguishing disabilities and
it's a University of Chicago Press
that's out there and both interesting
actually is it it depends on the
disability in terms of those you know
we're too emotional disturbance and
learning disabilities yes there is a far
greater percentage of youth of color
males of color will be hispanic latino
and black males that are
disproportionate there's also related to
the district or shin it rates of youth
with disabilities who are and then
incarcerated or that are sent to a
juvenile delinquent you know for like
one violation versus like other students
and so these different relationships but
for example like autism there's a major
underdiagnosis among youth of color so
it also very much depends on the
specific disability thank you what did
you have something due to at No
so so for my dissertation how did I go
about finding some finding this out so I
employed to different qualitative
methods so participant observation and
semi-structured depth interviews so my
primary site of participant observation
were families homes and and so I to do
this I accompanied two different speech
pathologists who in the Los Angeles area
and again pseudonyms Rachel and Karen
and had they were training parents at
home on how to use proloquo2go and the
ipad with their child and it was through
a pub a center called the rossmore
center which is a nonprofit that
operates under contract with the
California Department of Developmental
Services these are public services that
the families are getting and and so
besides the sort of in-home session and
I want to say to that in terms of
participation I perfect I kind of kept
an insider outsider status in during
these sessions so I didn't participate
in the sense that I was not training
parents I was not forming any official
medical that would also violate all
sorts of I you know I RB rules to be
doing that but I did like whenever we'd
have a session I would meet a Rachel or
Karen outside of the of their of the
home I would I would enter with them I
would leave with them i would take notes
throughout when when rachel took notes i
would also take notes as well i tried to
sort of and yeah there's a reason that i
was there but there was also a sense
that i identified as being with us see I
didn't identify his being with Ross more
I wanted to show them I was engaged but
also a sense that I was not biased or
that I wasn't working exactly with
Rachel that I was a separate entity from
her because I was also going to come
back and do interviews and I didn't want
them to feel as if and I was officially
an extension of the rossmoor centrex
again major huge IRB violations of all
sorts of medical conflict so it was this
balance and sometimes I think I did it
better than other times and you kind of
you know you know those things when you
when you come across them so I could
talk about more of that later and so and
then I also tried to hang out with Ross
more parents in other ways so besides
just these home spaces I was also really
interested in so which parents are
involved and in what way
so I went to workshops where brass were
offered to train parents and how to use
proloquo2go and I also went to local
assistive technology conferences where
they invited parent if you want if
you're a parent you want to learn more
hey come to this local conference it's
$25 or something and we have some free
vouchers if necessary and and then I
also went to meetings where there were
AAC young AAC users so that have an
opportunity for them to speak with one
another using their device it was like a
little hangout group and then parents
would come and sometimes just sit around
sit in the back and chat while they were
kid was taking part in this process so I
recruited a lot of my interviewees from
that rossmore pool and serves the
central los angeles area so you had sort
of a swath because you can know Los
Angeles sort of between Koreatown for
Central Los Angeles glendale burbank
sort of that sort of eastern side of Los
Angeles and but it wasn't getting enough
parents really to talk to so I had to
you know some additional recruitment
means so I had to get creative when to
you know Facebook groups parent
listservs I I think i emailed every
single assistive technology special
education lead in all of the Greater Los
Angeles area if they could pass along my
flyer and then also just perfect you any
other professional referrals and for
parents to qualify for the study so
their child needed to use pro quo have a
developmental disability and but the kid
needed to be between the ages of 3 and
13 and I wanted to make this sort of
explicit because as somebody who does
work on kids in media and technology
that can seem like a pretty massive age
recovering you know kids who are in
elementary school kids you're nearing in
the middle school years but it has some
explanations for why so so one is that
we need to think about and this is this
is sort of a larger shift but thinking
about the ways uncoupling biological age
and developmental age one example being
so there were you know kids who were 12
and 13 in my study whose favorite media
character was Elmo preschool media
character you know it's it's not the
same exact mapping on to one to one with
this and there's also a legal basis also
for
by 3 to 13 so 3 is the age at which ones
assistive technology use their services
your acquisition of technologies is
managed by your local school district
that's the time in which that
infrastructure steps in 14 so i stopped
at 13 and 14 is with the age at which
this if it's federally mandated by the
individuals and get the acronym right um
the individuals with Disabilities
Education Act the IDE a mandates that
you start planning for your child's
transition to adulthood so that so
there's a boundary there between what is
the sense of childhood that is federally
you know bounded at least so I chose 3
to 13 and to do that with which will
support here so so in all I spent time
with the parents of 20 children and I
found some really clear distinctions and
what I'll refer to you know throughout
the talk as more and less privileged
families and when I fast forward through
some of these clay it where can I rent a
little tight here but mothers who were
college-educated versus mothers who had
some or less college and parents were
both fluent in English and sometimes
just one parent who's fluent in English
and that second that acquisition of
English was a second language um
household income you know 100 K or more
and we stood in the Los Angeles area the
cook so this combined household income I
want to say so 50k or less and that also
range down to 20 with families who were
you know everybody was not employed or
refugees fleeing different and in stable
areas in the world where they were we're
not making any any income yet and we're
privileged families families owned the
iPad less privileged families the school
tended to own it again price point here
and that also related to families who
saw this iPad as being something that's
easily replaced oh you buy one you can
buy another if the kid Chuck's it across
the room which sometimes happened and
and then then families then who this
there was the school and iPad there was
this fear of oh well I signed my name on
a piece of paper that says I am now
responsible for this if I take it
outside of just the school just the
school bus just my home
them there's all these other variables
that I can control that if something
happens to it I have to pay for it there
was this not this fear not this thought
of user replaceable at all in fact what
is the cost of replacement very much on
people's minds a lot of hand-me-down
technology a lot of cascading oh we got
the new iPad here's the old one um and
then just a lot of trade-offs whether it
was you know what financial sacrifices
do people make and then also a lot of
people who got tech done got some of
this stuff through grants and so in each
of my district 8 dissertation chapters
identify in one set of meanings that
parents were how they conceptualize the
ipad and and voice was this really
really present theme that came out and
and I want to just like point out here
that Microsoft has had some interest in
in these you know voice giving
technologies as it's been phrased this
is a screenshot from the superbowl
commercial from last year and super bowl
and user steve gleason former NFL player
who has ALS and and and to me there's a
sense that this obscures a lot of stuff
and one thing it obscures is the ways
that privilege is built into these
systems so both in the sense when I say
built that it's programmed into the very
software and it's embedded into the
socio-technical practices as well and
there were two key distinctions and in
the ways that class and culture played
out in these conceptions of voice so the
Preferences that people had for the
voices that came out of it and then the
name that people use to call this this
thing that gives voice this is like this
is in the sex part is kind of the fun
and fun part so there's already fun but
so these are the 21 surveys like one
most fun part so this is these are all
the 21 voice options that you get that
can if you want to speak using this app
here your choices 21 of them okay so of
these 14 are marked in some manner as
being male and a little creature male
specialty adult the theo de um will gets
to have a lot of feelings well gets to
feel sad happy gets to be up close he
gets to be a far he gets to be regular
will
um yeah seven that are marked in some
manner is female so two to one ratio the
faction of autistic students at amaila
is actually much higher than sixty six
percent no we can talk though about
diagnosis rates and whether that's
actually reflective of something that is
biologically political to the diagnosis
that is itself masking potentially
something as well so something to think
about and 18 of these are marked in some
manner is being white and I looked up so
they have some videos online of oh who
did we use to record these voices so
like this you know these genuine child
voices josh and ella white children
three that are marked in some manner as
being non-white might notice this ultra
problematic song hip-hop male adult it's
all yeah and and then within this like
gap of stuff and there is no adult
female of color who has a voice option
in this whole system not a single to
speak US English so in my study these op
these these options and lack of options
made a real difference so families we're
privileged families particularly the
parents of white boys said that they can
more easily identify their child in the
voices that came out of the technology
so when I asked Perry and more
privileged mom how she chose the voice
for her son Corey she said oh I just
found the voice that just sounded most
like a human little boy you know that's
the one I found and they could also
envision the voice maturing along with
their child and so Donna said the 01 Sam
gets to that age then we'll switch the
voice to a more mature voice less
privileged parents though parents of
non-white girls had more difficulty in
thinking that the voice of how
represented their child
so for example Beatrice Beatrice is a
ten-year-old working class latina girl
with cerebral palsy and epilepsy and she
lives in a one bedroom apartment with
her parents David and Paul are
immigrants from Mexico and there and her
older sister and Beatrice uses an iPad
that the school has provided her and the
school chose the voice that Beatrice
would use and her father David said oh
this voice I really love it because it's
not according to her is the phrase at
Hughes and he unpacked that some more
for me and because the voice sounded
robotic sounded Anglo sounded like an
older woman and in fact he wished that
his older daughters voice could be the
voice that came out of the machine
instead of the random person that had
been attached so to me them this
discussion of voice illuminates we're
going to tie back to capital here the
ways in which social and technical
systems can privileged children with the
right kind of embodied cultural capital
so as I mentioned one aspect of embody
cultural capital that's how we speak so
this the system litter privilege the
privileges the literal voices of white
males over non-white females like it's
the most explicitly we want to talk
about voice to me these distinctions in
cultural capital also emerged in the
ways that parents used to talk about
this iPad somewhere privileged parents
tended to call it a voice or a talker
using more prosthetic terms terms of
professionals I also heard use so no
Nina I asked Nina oh why do you call it
that she's like oh I just I heard people
say talker so we just picked that and
but less privileged parents tend to
choose more instrumental terms so the
iPad or the device and I actually I
witness sort of an interaction between
these two so was in one session where
Rachel had asked one mom Oh what you're
less privileged mom Cathy what do you
call this and kathy was like your device
your iPad and Rachel actually told her
not to do that don't call it that call
it the talker so so to me then this is
an example here of institutionalized
cultural o Henry's yeah when you say
that there was a tendency mm-hmm for
those in the less privileged side to
talk about it with
or you know distanced machine like
quality yeah out of those 20 parents
what would you say was the I mean was it
us how'd you code for that what was was
it a strong coding or was it a strong
emphasis or was it very prominent among
like a handful of them how'd you so I
went so yes so I'm marked so anytime
somebody was calling it the voice or
somebody was calling it the talker or
somebody called it wasn't just um the
iPad it was like the black iPad it was
also related to two feet to the cases
that they used on it to like understand
it so exact number and I I would say
there's at least eight we're calling it
the voice in the talker and at least of
those five or six and we're calling it
the iPad and the device and then you
have you sort of in the middle so I'm
talking about more and less privileged
here there's always some space in the
middle where one's resources potentially
depended on if they'd been exposed to
somebody who would like mentored them
through some of this process where they
were exposed to more clinical terms or
more you know packet of information had
spent more time so created that sort of
messy space and so oh so Nina and Donna
and Perry and you know those people over
there and to Beatrice's parents and
Camilla who want to talk about here
which of those parents that were on
there were kind of on that side over
there
do you think that that interaction you
describe what Rachel said don't call it
the iPad collagen did you see them
playing Mormon role of like enforcers of
capital or they were kind of like if you
say it this way like guiding them into
institutionalize Capital Inc when you
show up at the appointment they're gonna
get that are they handing the people
capital or they kind of saying like no
no that's how we call it that it was
awkward there was opportunities that
arose that because they have to maintain
a like they're there to do a job they
only have so much time to do it they're
not trained necessarily this part of it
not trained in how to interact with
parents around media and technology use
so it was moments at which and and i
noticed this that there was a difference
between because these these people were
themselves upper middle class
professionals so they would think when
certain parents were talking about other
stuff they had on the ipad so the
youtube videos or itunes they would
chastise the less they were talking the
Rastas less privileged parents that they
shouldn't be using using it for games
and would mention all this stuff about
Oh like that's so interests that you're
cultivating your child interests using
that technology when they had it among
the more privileged families so when it
was like these moments where these
opportunities came up to talk about
something that that is were those
distinctions emerged so it was this
didn't have the time to like school
people on the outside things it was this
moment where they had was their own
personal biases that came out he's the
reason a the profession is like this no
in terms like the voice of the talker is
that they want to get the kids to use
these names to summer bond with them
yeah you device yeah you've hit kind of
right on i mean that's you know their
main purpose is a clinical purpose so
there-there there-there job you know
they're not paid so much money to do a
lot of other things they're there to
make sure the child's communication
improves so there's a focus there on and
you know it's it's their professional
identity is tied to the use of it as
something that is a voice or a talker
and using it as a medical rights and
i'll get to actually in the next i can
go into the next thing I also part of
that came through is that so you have
parents who have lots of different iPads
and so they can refer to or family
professionals who are used to having
lots of other kinds of devices to you so
you
be like oh this one is the talker this
one is the voice vs other parents who
needed these technologies to do double
duty there was no oh my one thing for
this my one thing for that and you know
one mom I talked to I'm so Sarah the
other one a privilege parents had said
oh well we have like 11 iPads and at
home so so he has that he has his talker
for school he has his talker for home
and I should say the sarah said she'd
said something like oh it's um she said
like oh it's sick it's a lot of money
and Apple devices so she did note she
did have like a reflection over her like
majorly conspicuous consumption of Apple
devices um but so less privileged
parents those two like Camilla that I
had mentioned she didn't have the luxury
of creating this binary and she'd
actually she said that she even
encountered a speech therapist so other
speech therapist so she'd said oh this
other random speech therapist she would
call it for her clients whereas your
voice don't forget your voice bring your
voice and Camilla was like I don't know
how I feel about and and and she
explained some of this ambivalence was
because so her her and her husband
really had an opportunity to spend much
time alone together outside of their
host in any alone time was when the kids
were asleep and even then you know kids
have erratic sleep schedules potentially
not a lot of alone time and Camilla was
saying that you know well if we have
netflix on talons ipad than if we go out
and the kids can be occupied by watching
netflix besides just using it for this
and they had more ownership over it
because they had gotten their ipad
through a grant so it wasn't Ted to
schools administration of these iPads
and i should say like on the school
iPads they could they could they could
do all these other things like use the
internet but school had locked it down
you couldn't you could not use it for
anything else besides just these apps so
then to me then this is all so then this
layer of objectified cultural capital so
there's this sense here that you know if
you are a parent who is using this ipad
as a way for your child to speak and you
know if you're using it for lots of
other things you know you're just doing
it wrong that was sort of the sense that
that professionals had bestowed upon
these potential uses so then you know to
summarize sort of my dissertation
overall here and to move into you know
where I see this all going so the
cultural meanings that pair
associated with the ipad and proloquo2go
for example when it meant to give their
child a voice differed across class with
additional considerations here for
culture and gender and ethnicity unless
privileged parents associate in meetings
with the technology in ways they were
often out of sync with how school
systems and therapy providers
characterized it and all of the parent I
would say to all of the parents that I
stick that I spoke with regardless of
their circumstances wanted the best for
their child everybody had those same
intentions but parents who can more
readily mobilize capital were distinctly
advantaged within these systems and then
the notion then so of this home
technology divide that cider has written
about to me I think we need to think
about if we're going to be talking about
youth more broadly and that's inclusive
of youth with disabilities that we need
to think about how assistive
technologies fit into our construction
of this home technology divide so and
there's a lot about there's number of
applications for this was going to get
into three here and that various
stakeholders can apply so one being that
there needs to be there needs to be an
inspection of how are these insurance
policies and school district policies
inherently biased against families who
are lower income who have lower lower
status and that you know parents who can
afford to work around the system our
advantage versus parents who are tied to
the whims of school districts who rarely
have their child's best interests in
mind and our farm were concerned about
protecting their investment in
technology for clinicians therapists and
teachers again the sense of class bias
in their own relationship to technology
with the purpose of technology is right
and wrong uses and to understand because
otherwise there's this extra saying that
like how is this distance widening
there's this extra layer of potential
distancing between themselves and these
families and then you know going back to
these voices there needs to be a way in
which we can think about how how can
these voices potentially sound as if
they they are encompass amor youth that
are potentially using these devices
and and I am oh yes just one what's the
history of this Appetit start with only
two voices and who always it a they
already started would like these 20
voices know there was an original set
and these voices there's a group so it's
not just pro quo developing there's a
company called the acapella group and
they they serve them with these voices
and they've also developed additional
voices using collaborations with pro
loco so it's expanded over the years as
well as I didn't just come with the set
so for example and there was like
there's there's two voices there that
kind of a bright spot that are bilingual
voices those just came available on
proloquo2go in December um so so that's
four years to proko came at doesn't 10
it's a whole four years there between
the launch of it and that so definitely
not baked into the DNA of these
technologies and but I am there's I'm oh
yes do people find that you use voiced
similar to the kids voice that actually
significantly improves the kids progress
so that that's a great question about
the that's not there's not a lot of work
that is done on the the particularity
zuv we rates of encouraged use but I do
know that it's not as if I want to say
that people always choose a voice that
exactly sounds like like them and
there's a sense of identity play with
these technologies to sew and you know
some speech therapist that I talk to you
know putting some of these voices on as
part of a costume just somebody had
dressed up like a like a monster or
whatever and there's like a bad guy
voice so you can like put the use the
bad guy voice for that purpose so
there's an interchange there and then
also even just one parent I talk to you
picked there was a voice that they in
their childhood picked purely because of
the name of the voice not because of the
sound that came out because the name was
the name of their cousin and they like
thought it kind of sounded like oh it's
just like your cousin Liam like it's the
Liam voice so these purposes of what
motivates people and what relationships
they find with these two voices it's
sometimes it's about the voice quality
and sometimes it's
instead it's about their own it's just
like identity is complicated identity
has multiple layers and sometimes these
voices fit and accommodate those
multiple layers and sometimes for
certain populations they're less apt to
do that and soooo so to go in like
bright spot in with all of this
researches there's there I know there's
some research that's going on down the
street and at Northeastern actually
their communication Sciences Department
on crowdsourcing so making these voices
more diverse by taking a sample of
people who were like here I'm donating
my voice so that you can use them in
combination with other voices to make
more diverse voices the problem with
that though is that takes a lot of time
investment and you have to have like I
think it's an apple device or something
to be able to use the app to submit your
voice so there's like a given take their
I'm like how how well equipped it is
necessarily but there's any
crowdsourcing voices as a potential for
four instead of all the engineering work
that goes into it and so in my ongoing
and future work then um there was one
event that happened that couldn't shake
it was sort of this not I couldn't untie
and that is spurring that I think the
next stage of my work so I had been
conducting a follow-up interview with
Beatrice's family and her father David
showed me something he said she never
had a password on that ipad they put it
there yesterday and today again so I
cannot see so the the ipad had come home
from school newly suddenly passcode
protected and they had it notified the
family and they hadn't shared the code
with them either and bute risen taken
the ipad and you know press some buttons
a couple times kids get curious with it
locked this screen came up i pad is
disabled try again in its at 60 minutes
at first and that's me awkwardly
hovering over at taking a photo at 54
minutes in sad thing also is that even
when i left the interview that countdown
still and and so my initial reaction to
this was outraged I was like you have to
you know oh go to the school you have to
let you know they have to fix this
whatever and I realized that that was
reflective of my own class privilege in
this whole process it was it is this one
moment
I had to really that's that was really
my breaking point into how his class
really established in this because David
explained to me that you know he said
I'm always afraid that if we go against
the school district they may take
measures against Beatrice like disliking
her there was a risk to challenging
something like this so I was struck then
how the iPad yes was disabled in this
situation but how the district had
disabled Beatrice in her use of the
technology at the same time so Beatrice
is also free to transport the mobile
device back and forth between home and
school and yet Beatrice's communicative
agency was immobilized by as soon as she
entered her own home so for now you know
I did a lot of reading on you know on
mobile technology on on different sorts
of levels of inequality and I needed to
find a term for it and this is the term
that I've come up with networked in
mobility so this fluid relationship
between mobility and mobility and a
simultaneity of the same sort of act
immobilizing and mobilizing as well and
and so so I see it yes is this way to
understand the simultaneous action and
the way that I see it it reconfigures
some of our existing focuses on the
social and cultural aspects of mobility
and immobility in media and
communication studies in mobility
studies and in critical disability
studies as well drawing on all three of
those different areas and expanding the
so much mobile communication research is
about phones and and that that that is
no longer amenable to the state of
mobile communication and mobile
technologies iPads Internet of Things
wearables and to me this I'm thinking of
it in terms of more than just the phone
in my conception of networked and
mobility I'm also thinking of it as more
than just spatial abilities so a lot of
times as a focus I know we're talking
about networked images networked
mobility we're talking peeler thinking
about Geographics and thinking about
geographic landscape and spatial but I'm
thinking here too this is an influence
here by the work of a Kara Wallace here
and thinking about mobility as economic
mobility a social mobility and then
so for me also bodily mobility as well
as a factor in this and and then also
considering you know users who might you
know with disabilities who might have
different relationships to mobile
technologies and that they are outside
necessarily we think of as like
normative practices so for example using
one to speak and to have a conversation
with somebody face-to-face but you are
using the technology to have a voice to
face voice to voice communication act
and so so then in the coming years then
this guy by guiding research question is
to part here so what does network to
mobility mean for different populations
and how do individuals understand and
articulate to their networked immobility
and for me the focus here is on
individuals disabilities you fit
disabilities as well so a number of
projects at various stages that I'd love
to talk to people about I know we're
running out of time so I'm just going to
you breeze through infrastructural
issues interviewing some people from a
very large school district in Los
Angeles and I won't say which one about
some issues that they're facing on the
prehistory so this is really cool part
so you might think oh mobile devices AAC
devices now they are converging no no no
no no back in the 1970s and 1980s Texas
Instruments cannon cannon made their own
AAC devices I really like to think about
I have a piece coming out in the I
Triple E annals of the history of
computing that starts to get into some
of this but I have a lot more archival
work to do on how our how our
expectations about about our bodies
baked into actually the whole legacy of
the way that we conceive of mobile
communication technologies and back up
to a little bit so how so what are how
are all these other apps use besides
proloquo2go how are not speaking
individuals using facebook using a new
other social networking sites as ways to
communicate and then bigger a project
here interested in new media use among
youth on the autism spectrum who are
often characterized as being tech savvy
but at the same time as you can get from
my talk what issues of class and gender
are totally you know buried underneath a
kind of a conceptualization and I think
I'm you know when i leave time for a
little bit for questions here and
but yeah these devices are are socially
shape they're just like other mobile
communication technologies they are they
are also they also have social
consequences for how we live our lives
and and they were award parents who can
then more easily effectively mobilize
capital and for me I really want to
focus here on what are the intricate
ways that cultural capital works and
this broader role of networked
immobility and have a couple quotes who
that was going to go through but I'm
going to skip over them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
