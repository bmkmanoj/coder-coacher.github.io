in advice to a young scientist is to get
yourself into an environment where you
might encounter and collaborate with
true geniuses and by that I mean it
quite literally that there are some
people whose work we immensely respect
they have wonderful heuristics for how
to conduct research how to look at a
problem space and find the real problem
how to elegantly prune out those avenues
I was talking about how to evaluate
whether an idea is a good one in
addition they are great idea generators
as well as being formulators and pruners
they're great idea generators I was
remarking to someone today that we Bend
this tendril project first expert system
project that we did at Stanford we'd
have a table full of people which were
some computer scientists and later Berg
and some of the chemists we were
collaborating with including yet another
genius Karl geraci who was head of the
mass spectrometry lab Bodhi who's also
the inventor of the birth control pill
and later Berg would just sit there and
spout out ideas like it was a firework
show and ninety-nine out of a hundred of
those ideas in this is a weekly meeting
ninety-nine out of a hundred of those
ideas were not great ideas that we could
use one out of a hundred would keep us
busy for the next three months and that
was fantastic
so if you're a young person and you have
a chance to mingle around the faculty or
the researchers at Microsoft Research or
any other place you might be
try to sense that out who are those
people who are there there is a
qualitative difference between a very
fine professor and researcher and one of
these geniuses there's really a big
difference that's all so if you're
interested in AI that's a wonderful
thing to reflect about that is as you
get involved deeply with these people
you begin to study like how is it that
he's so much smarter than I am you know
I thought I'm really good but wow what
did how did he get that idea and that
gives you some ideas about what next to
do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
