application I know of that allows you to
create rich presentations within an
environment that is already rich with
data there's really nothing else that
allows you to so fluidly put together
your own view of an exploration of the
night sky and different objects and then
share it in a completely seamless manner
it is a environment for storytelling
these guided tours could have narration
they can put in music you can insert
graphics in zoom into objects and switch
between anything that's it's already in
the world wide telescope database or you
can bring in additional images that are
outside the world wide telescope help
tell the story the possibilities of
creating stories with a system like this
are endless because the information is
so much at hand what the world wide
telescope will enable us to do when we
tell stories of the sky is to start with
what people know and really the universe
is very foreign place we have so many
incredible crazy things out there that
people aren't used to seeing people can
curate other people's trajectories
through this space and teachers can add
to that other kids can it when a kid can
come in and actually make this beautiful
video that is in some ways a lot better
than what they even see on a science
show on TV it gives them this sense of
accomplishment and and ability to share
that wonder it will encourage the
creation of communities of interest
around astronomy you have the
opportunity to take all these places in
the sky and you know weave them together
in this mesh in this story and then
share the story with your friends and
you know build community is around just
plain storytelling one of the things
we're hoping for is a specific community
or
education where educators will be able
to create and share tours not only with
their other peer teachers within their
own school but with the other teachers
all around the country and perhaps
worldwide things that educators can do
is create lesson plans within worldwide
telescope putting together problems of
things that students could find and
learn from and do research and then go
off and have the students themselves go
research and explore within the world
wide telescope and put together a
presentations and then produce tours and
share them this generation is really
into content creation and they're not
happy just looking at stuff for playing
things like to make their own things and
world wide telescope really gives them a
way to make their own content</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
