lectures freely available
you
we're very happy to have again yanko
grabner from university of california
davis giving his second lecture here and
this time the topic is snowflakes I give
it up you know more general audience
that I'm used to leave on madison AR
gurney microphone oh yeah oh yeah some
art students at davis and they actually
managed to take notes by sketching the
snowflakes very quickly as i was talking
so there is some amazing skill that
people skills that people have anyway so
this is like before the movie starts a
little slide show ok
okay so also another advantage of this
work is that one could make Christmas
cards this is what I did for last year
also this was used for for Christmas
cards by our university by american
mathematical society and so on and so
forth so this work is in high demand
unfortunately I wasn't ever able to make
any money of that I got once an offer
from an air conditioning company but
then I asked him how much you're willing
to pay and they never heard from them
again so arrive exactly they could tell
I wasn't serious anyway the so this will
be really a fun talk all right I
apologize if you're you know if the word
theorem and proof is going to be sorely
missing from this talk but that's how
it's going to be so what we're going to
talk are two things really so when
mathematicians think of snowflakes we
often think about some curves that are
general it recursively and give you some
fractal they have some fractal structure
or we think about snowflakes as real
objects that fall from the sky in winter
and we will talk about both starting
with a little bit of history from the
beginning i should say this is joint
work with david Griffith it's the
summary that I'm giving today is from
like 55 or sell papers with him i also
want to always thank give special thanks
to ken lib rekt who is at Caltech and
who is the world's foremost expert on
snow crystals and you will see many of
his photographs another photographs that
we use are done by electron microscopy
at a department of agriculture
sure laboratory in Maryland they call it
electron microscopy units no snow page
and they use a different method to
photograph snowflakes they first coat
them with gold dust so they're not
transparent right snowflakes of course
by nature I made of ice so they're
completely transparent so if you see a
structure and the snowflake is a
three-dimensional object typically don't
know whether it is snowflake whether the
structure is on the outside or on the
inside so that is that was useful very
useful to us in in that way okay so
these are some of the first published
pictures of snot legs this one leaves a
bit to be desired by today's standards
but nevertheless the the study of
snowflake is credited the beginning of
the study of snowflake is credited of
course to a Chinese scholar hun young
but in the West really the first the
first well pictorial description such as
it is is credited to allows Magnus in
16th century the first real picture you
know pictures of snowflakes that really
do look like real snowflakes are due to
Robert Hooke in 17th century in you know
who of course you have to deal with
microscopes and obviously looked at them
because they're actually quite good
probably well you can you can you can
there is yeah you can with the naked eye
yes you can yeah if you have a good
eyesight you can but yeah I mean there
yeah there it sits much trickier
especially I mean you can see the
hexagonal symmetry but to see this you
know kind of more refined structure is
much more difficult okay of course the
most famous early treatise on snowflakes
is by Johannes Kepler who wrote a
treatise on the 6th cornered snowflake
and also was thinking about
why why this hexagonal symmetry and you
know was putting forth the theory that
this is due to crystal structure of ice
this is a you know an amazing really
insight for somebody who had no idea
really about molecules or atoms or
anything like that so it's also Johannes
Kepler was a deeply deeply religious
person so he was you know a bit
struggling with that clearly sorry yes
yes if he thought all the living beings
are have souls but snowflakes kind of
not although this took some thought for
him to conclude all right so another so
I don't know this is not typically well
known so in his eye I think the book is
called treatise on the general method or
something like that a philosophical work
by Rene descarte had a few appendices
one of his famous work on geometry all
right another was on material material
logie it's called lomita and well he
wrote this a paragraph that you don't
really need to read I can just tell you
it's very difficult to understand what
he's trying to say he is obviously
trying to imagine how the snowflake grew
to be so intricate and that's probably
true because they get tossed around a
lot that's what he thought all right so
yeah so that I you know that actually is
the point of view that prevailed up
until very recently and I claim this
doesn't make any sense its explanation
alright so if we fast-forward a bit to
the late nineteenth and early twentieth
century the first person who tried a
systematic classification of snowflakes
was actually an amateur scientist a
Vermont farmer called Wilson mentally
who tinker
the camera and the microscope to create
very many images of snowflakes that he
collected when they fell down and he
published several books which are still
in print on so those are kind of
classical books on snow crystals the
first scientist who seriously study
snowflakes which was Luke Ichiro nakaya
who was a nuclear physicist who
apparently couldn't get grants to
support his laboratory and decided that
he was going to you know study
snowflakes instead he was the first one
to be able to actually grow artificial
snow flakes in the laboratory so we also
grow artificial snow flakes but in a
whole different level alright so so he
wrote that's he is the writer of the
duck duck elastic about snowflakes this
book snow crystals natural and
artificial 1954 alright so let's let's
talk a bit about mathematical
idealization so as I said before when
one says snowflakes in a mathematic
stock usually one is prepared to see a
study of objects that look like this
alright so this is a snowflake in
you know more than 100 years ago
introduced more than 100 years ago and
it's just introduced by you know adding
a bump a triangular bump on it every
straight line and starting with a
hexagon adding a triangular bump or with
the triangle and adding a triangular
bump and then continuing that until in
the limit you get a fractal curve
alright so this this the flow snake is
it's called it's this call flow snake
because it has the opposite construction
instead of adding a bump you cut you
know you cut inside on any straight line
is the starter hexagon make a cut make a
card maker cut and so on alright so then
you end up with something very similar
the this spent of like a
is you know you do this did you start
the initial Pentagon and then do this
incision so it's very similar and then
this consists of six Pentagon's you do
this incisions and so on up to up to the
final picture which looks like that so
see they all have this infinite
construction recursive construction and
the bureau of some sort of fractal limit
and inappropriate sense a completely
different way of creating a kind of
snowflake pictures look much less like a
snowflake in popular you know in popular
mine is by diffusion limited aggregation
a famous process started in the 1980s
and of which is still there's many open
problems for probabilities to work on so
what you do is you start with a single
up if you wish frozen particle at the
origin and you just at every point once
you have an aggregate of frozen
particles you start a random walk far
away and you let it diffuse and then
when it reaches a neighborhood of an
already frozen particle it sticks all
right so this is a process very
difficult to understand you may be many
of you know the opposite process which
is called the internal diffusion limited
aggregation where the particles kind of
originated the centre and move outwards
and stick when they hit an unoccupied
side that is a much simpler picture
because it's actually instead of making
less and rest a regular structure they
create more and more regular structure
alright so we'll return to this theme
later on with an end sander yeah no I
don't think so this is too early for him
and he really that's possible I forgot
actually could be could be alright okay
so I actually don't know that could be
could be Edwin
it's kind of not in his line but it
could be yeah yeah could be could be all
right so this is our work that we did is
really a successor of a small and
obscure paper by one of the pioneers of
the field of complexity and chaos Norman
Packard who wrote up you know just maybe
five six page paper in 1984 where he
proposed two months for self lake growth
one is a variant of the diffusion
limited aggregation as I just described
and another is a class of cellular
automata on a triangular lattice tea and
that's the triangular lattice for those
of you who don't know it I presume many
of you do we're basically you just add
occupied points to a set of already
occupied points occupied it would be the
same as frozen here and the rule is I'll
introduce give you you compute maceo
movies with the rules later but they're
only simply that point looks an
unoccupied point looks at its six point
neighborhood as drawn in this picture
and you know counts how many already
occupied neighbors it has and depending
on that it decides whether to become
occupied or not next time right and
basically he observed that if you for
sure become occupied when you see
exactly one occupied site but for sure
do not become occupied when you see
exactly too occupied sides then this
growth kind of favors the tips so you
you know you create as you will see some
sort of structures with which look like
snowflakes so and that he thought that
you know this is true for real snowflake
stood that the growth kind of fire
favors the tips so I should say that
then this was developed a bit by writer
recently about seven years ago and of
course the seller automaton approach was
popularized by Wolfram in his book and
various papers where he thought this is
the last
snowflakes it is a monitoring process in
the sense that you add more and more
occupied points nothing dies nothing
dies in that sense is monotone but it's
not monitoring the sense that if you add
one more occupied point somewhere you're
going to always get more occupied point
so occupied points don't necessarily
help you as you will see all right so
here is PR pictures from the Packard's
paper they don't look like they're going
to win any Christmas card contest just
yet but it turns out that this is
actually very promising idea is
demonstrated by writer all right this is
for for a person who's seen a lot of
snowflakes this is a promising picture
but is not quite right this very way
there is not too much branching also
it's two dimensional all right so here
is I mean it's at the very beginning
kind of the seller automaton looks a bit
better than them then the dla so this is
the writers this is a Packard cellular
automaton and this is a picture of real
snowflake from Lee Brooks collection so
they look a bit similar right for for
reasons that will see later why okay so
when we do simulations and you know
during today's talk I'll always it's
very fortunate since they don't make
computer screen where the pixels are
arranged in a triangular fashion they
would be nice for this sort of thing but
they don't exist so you have to kind of
deform that lattice a bit and it's very
fortunately you can actually do it all
right so the usual rectangular lattice
with the added diagonal connection is
actually the same as the triangular
lattice by deformation you see that
write a linear deformation all right so
so let's let me just explain the
notation the notation for you i'm not
going to go into any detail so these are
the Packard's cellular automata that i
was describing before so hex one is so
it's their day or dare monotone we call
them
they solidify so once all good by the
site your minds occupied forever and you
have so you have you write x1 if the
only way for a site to join the crystal
if it is exactly one already occupied
side and 135 if it sees one three or
five one three four and one four five
six all right so these are called
occupation numbers so let's look at some
let's look at some movies all right
which we have okay so this is X 1 okay
so let's see what it does so from a
single occupied site and you just use
this role that you look in your
neighborhood of six points and whenever
you see exactly one occupied site you
you become occupied so you see you see
what happens so this kind of alternates
between you know between this kind of
fractal boundary and full hexagon so if
you want the full symmetry of the
triangular lattice you have to deform it
a bit in your mind or think that you're
watching this from the side all right so
so in between this which looks kind of
this has fractal boundary and then it
creates a full hexagon and then new new
nuclei sprouts from the from the corners
and so on so this you should also know
that if you look at this picture little
closer of course not all points become
occupied there is some sort of density
of you know occupied points so let's
look at another picture another another
rule 146 so 1456 I'm sorry 1456 so it
looks very similar right the you know
the kind of macroscopic picture looks
from from from far away looks very
similar but if you look if you zoom in
you will see that all sides become
occupied so it's the conjecture you
would make that you
every point eventually becomes occupied
so remember that conjecture right so in
this particular rule so let's just want
your edit let's just look at two other
movies where you change the neighborhood
a bit so instead of hexagonal
neighborhood you use box neighborhood
which is instead of six points arranging
hexagonal pattern you look at the
nearest eight points and exactly one
rule let's see what happens so similar
picture except you know except a
different geometry right however let's
just look so this this rule if you start
with a different initial set also
creates this sort of regular periodic
periodic pattern so okay so these are
the movies just to remember later as we
discuss the results okay so so first
time this is one of my favorite quotes
all right of course this packet rules
were widely known i am stephen lee lee
who is a science writer very well known
science writer wrote a book artificial
life in 1992 and in which he said an
elementary school child could look at
any of the gorgeous pictures of computer
screens in Packard's collection and
instantly identified as a snowflake so
why is that funny well that's funny to
me because people don't most people have
never seen a snowflake right they want a
real snowflake what they would did you
know they have seen snowflakes in
christmas christmas ornaments like this
which they call snowflakes or you know
the ones which you cut from papers and
so on and they may have nothing to
whatsoever to do with real snowflakes
like this one for example which has
eight fold symmetry which no snuggling
ever has all right so so they would
instantly identify it as an iconic of
snowflake rather than a real snowflake
so this this Packard snowflakes have the
nice virtue that you can actually prove
theorems about them and the reason you
can prove theorems is because if you
look at the points that become occupied
as soon as they possibly could alright
so those are the black points here in
this picture are points that are
occupied as soon as they possibly could
there occupied a delay edge of the light
cone if you wish all right so the the
these are the points that the dynamics
can possibly theoretically influence at
time T and at that time they become
occupied so they create this sort of
what we call additive web so they are
they really run an additive dynamics of
the time that I was discussing in my
previous talk and the boundaries here
are impenetrable all right so they
divide the space into regions which
don't communicate with each other and
this creates naturally renewal structure
and that renewal structure is enough
values of the renewal theorem is enough
to prove that the density for all of
these rules that the density exists so
it's a well-defined number you know you
can imagine the definition it's a
natural definition so so the density is
a well-defined number and it's
independent of the initial seed all
right in all these Packard's snowflakes
and this is this is surprising because
unlike unlike stochastic and like random
system cellular automata very rarely
used memory of their initial states
right so for example I've shown you a
picture of a different rule the with the
different neighborhood which does not
lose memory with the initial state
because it has two different densities
from two different initial states and
you can also you know the renewal
theorem actually allows you to to
estimate or in some cases compute
exactly the density values and here are
the numbers note that so this was the
rule for which we conjectured that it
every point eventually becomes occupied
the asset because that's the very close
but not quite one and one could prove
that however you know if you look at
this role on this screen you'll never
see the first unoccupied permanently
unoccupied point because that one
happens at time about 10 to the ninth so
it's about about time a billion the
first pixel that never feels in occurs
so you'd never see this unless you
analyze this rule mathematically even
you know there exist programs which
could simulate this for 40 this long but
you know I mean display is the problem
where would you look so so since you
don't have the screen this big it's very
difficult to see anyway this if you want
an open problem is so for for some of
these rules you can you can show that
that exists but you you know they have
for example these two it we don't know
whether does these are equal though we
suspect they're not these are these are
rigorous results all right so see within
plus or minus all right so this is
actually rigorous all all all here is
rigorous so therefore we cannot
rigorously exclude the possibility that
these two are not equal although they
probably or not okay so let me just the
next slide kind of tells you that
Packard snowflakes are not going to be
very good yes when you say very 1456
yeah actually Justin one yes you
actually have a bound very very very bad
bound there is one very bad to join
berry sync to write down yes less than 1
it says anything like 10 to the minus
not know it's even even smaller than
that yeah I some something something in
the order of 10 to the minus 10 or 12 or
something like them all right yeah yeah
away from what you have very sensitive
when you say they are the same like a 1
CN 1 c-ya this this yeah this this is on
c4 yeah I so these are this these are
all proved all right all the estimates
are rigorous Andy qualities are rigorous
all right does this this this we don't
know whether they're different and 140
145 would be the new me than I used on
yeah it tells you how you're at points
so 146 do you mean no Megan how you stop
you get you get 10gb yeah as soon as
through 145 it seems that is the scene
is 14 yeah as long as as long as it's a
finite finite seed of occupied sighs
yeah for any finite seed the density is
the same yes yes you're not going to see
yeah yeah if you find a seat where the
different where the density differs yes
or two different seats right all right
so the next slide will tell you that
Packard snowflakes are really not that
good to simulate real snow flakes
because they're extremely sensitive to
random perturbations so this is actually
related to the open problem i mentioned
three weeks ago so if you so let's say
you become occupied for sure if you see
exactly one occupied side but if you see
to you flip a coin with a very small
probability p and if it comes out
successful if the flip is successful you
become occupied and you will see that
you see that fractal shapes completely
disappear and your generate just a
regular growth now it is true that many
snowflakes are just plain old hexagons
but you know obviously that's not all to
the story so all there is to the story
so you have to start over from the
beginning if you think about modeling
real growth growth of real self legs so
in order to do that let's familiarize
ourselves a little bit
with the real self legs so these are
this is a sample of Bentleys photographs
so the one thing you observe well first
of all you you observe that sure there's
no place which kind of have a familiar
branching pattern that we see but also
there are lots of plates all right so
they kind of snowflakes kind of exhibit
this tension between branching and as
they call this is a real word that they
use faceting alright so they create this
sort of regularly shaped facets and also
the other thing that you observe is
those you know another technical word
hieroglyphs patterns that you see on
snowflakes alright that you know you
want to know how these are formed all
right they're called these are called
the ridges these are called ribs all
right so it's all this terminology that
one learns so okay so here is the main
scientific puzzle about snowflake so the
fact is that I mean the what snowflakes
do really is I mean the main accepted
explanation about how they grow is that
they do grow by diffusion so they're
somewhere in the cloud and the particles
in the clouds just diffuse so they
perform they endlessly wander around and
they stick upon encountering the crystal
somehow so how do they stick you know
they basically stick with some
probability when they get a point on the
crystal so how do they stick is a really
unknown alright it's really a known to
the extent that this picture that I'm
going to explain in a second is not
explained at all so clearly the rule the
rule about how they attach how do you
know the the water vapor molecules
attached and by the way so there's not
the important thing is that the growth
is directly the snowflake form by by
vapor directly freezing there is no
intermediate liquid stage alright so
the way the vapor molecules attached is
it depends on the temperature and
depends on the atmospheric pressure all
right and here is how you know how it
depends on the tent how it how the
growth depends on the temperature so for
very low temperatures you see snowflakes
which are basically flood the snowflakes
that we used to see right you know nice
hexagonal plates with some branching you
ain't then you increase the temperature
2-5 to this is minus 15 degrees
centigrade you increase the temperature
to minus 5 degrees centigrade you see
certainly something that no school child
would ever identify the snowflake right
you see a three-dimensional pencils
basically all right so they grow almost
exclusively in the third dimension and
then you increase temperature to minus 2
degrees centigrade so even a bit more
and it so it's not like Stern to be you
know smaller but still basically the
same shape is at the beginning so
there's this double phase transition
that is a real pro I mean I don't know
if mathematical modeling could I ever
resolve this but it's a real physical
puzzle about you know what temperature
actually governs to make this difference
we are any phenomenon where if you're
very close to the phase transition point
things are more complex uh well
certainly we see that in in our model
but II I I mean yeah I suppose I you
know I would suppose that all the most
interesting snowflakes actually live on
the borderline you know that's that that
that's what I suppose so all that you
see on pictures are actually very close
to the boundary certainly we see that in
our mathematical model you'll see you
know you'll see what I mean anyway these
are pictures from firmly Brecht again so
they he uses photoshop a lot to make
them look nice because if you see I also
saw them when he you know after he just
takes a picture and they don't look like
much because they are transparent so you
have to enhance the edge and early
shading and so on all right so you use
use of course--i the same message as we
saw from Bentley's pictures all right
lots of branching but also lots of
plates so there is a tension there these
are you know one of his successes was
that they were on stamps in 2007 well
for a new year of 2007 obviously a lot
of graphical manipulation here because
they look like they're made of shiny
metal here all right so okay so let's
think about modeling a bit so how would
the mathematician approach modeling of
snowflakes well so we already know that
basically the snowflakes formed by vapor
diffusing around it and and then
attaching and the parameters that govern
the growth are temperature availability
of vapor what a vapor density and
atmospheric pressure so the diffusion is
clear i mean you know everybody knows
how to model diffusion either you know
by differential equations or by random
walks it's not that's not difficult but
the attachment of detachment are not
understood so this is what you do when
you don't understand something you just
introduce few pair of parameters and you
vary them until you get wood until you
see what you want it to see right so
tunable parameters so that's it that's
idea number one idea number two is well
you have 10 to the 15 to 10 to the 18
water molecules in a snowflake and so in
order to be on the snowflakes one
molecule at a time you'll have to allow
them to diffuse and that's a lot of
computation time and resources maybe
nowadays actually totally doable all
right but still it's you know it's a
hassle this is a lot of variables ok so
maybe impossible I should rather say
impractical all right so well then you
say okay so I can model I can diffuse
molecules by random odd but
also I can you know just make them obey
the heat equation so i can use pd models
but then there is a problem there too
because snowflakes are hardly irregular
objects so it's certain that any PDA
model will encounter an array of
instabilities and you'll have numerical
problem solving come continuing the
evolution pastels instabilities alright
so basically the idea is that you can
try something in between called the
mesoscopic model where you divide the
space into a units of essentially
diameter of 1 micrometer which which
would make you know it should make this
many water molecules so you know you the
crystal will be made out of these units
and there will be exact prism hexagonal
prisms as you will see and the final
crystal will have ten to a thousand
times larger diameter which corresponds
to about the real sizes love like okay
so this is your typical mesoscopic unit
is a prism like this and it has so it's
arranged in one in the two-dimensional
direction is arranged a triangular
lattice and it also has vertical
neighbors like this so every prism
centered at a point there has six
horizontal neighbors into vertical
neighbors alright so the lattice is
triangular lattice cross Z and also so
the you know the does not this is the
the blue structure here is a small
crystal which is consist of this missus
copic unit is drawn and these are
boundary a boundary prisms alright and
the numbers here tell you how many
neighbors they have in each direction so
this one on top because one neighbor in
vertical direction and no name
in the horizontal direction this one has
two neighbors in the horizontal
direction one in vertical this one this
one has three in the horizontal and
they're in vertical and so on all right
so the idea is that that's just the idea
is that these prisms when when they are
away from the crystal what happens is
they just exchanged mass by diffusion
with their neighbors when they're close
to the crystal they also contain
partially frozen mass all right and when
that partially frozen may succeed some
threshold they join right so the
threshold for joining depends however on
the boundary arrangement as in the
picture so it's easier it's it's going
to be easier to join if you are in kind
of a concave part of the crystal than
when you are on a convex part of the
crystal so this creates a basic tension
in the growth of a snowflake because the
the tips of the snowflake will be
favored because they extend further into
an you know virgin territory old paper
all right so they kind of will you know
they look like they will be able to grow
faster on the other hand the water vapor
that gets into a concave part of the
crystal will have an easier time to
attach all right so so in that in that
that's a regular raised eight like
regular rising force all right so the
the fact that the concave parts given
have an easier time catching the vapor
and the fact that the tip see further
into the vapor creates opposite effects
all right so so and then you you know I
mean this in some sort of fairly out
this way after you made all these things
you can you create you know you all of
these units I can just go to the next
slide oh h h of this unit contains two
fields one is the diffusion field and
mesoscopic units mesoscopic prisms away
from the crystal only contains diffusion
field which only exchanges mess with
with with with the neighborhood on the
boundary like the thread prisms you also
have a you know a frozen field which
kind of exchanges with the diffusing
feel that just means though they're
basically the this just models the fact
that particles just attach with certain
probability not for sure alright so this
you can model with just exchanged
between the frozen and diffusing field
and then after the crystal is it that
just every everything freezes and
nothing ever happens after that so there
is no detachment although in reality
there probably is the all all of these
kappa mu and beta can depend on the
number of neighbors if you want but
mostly this one really all right so
sometimes you need a little bit of you
you know if you want to fill but i think
it's really just enough if you make this
threshold to depend on alright so just
quickly connections to partial
differential equations so this algorithm
is a discrete version of a three
boundary problem in partial differential
equations which is called a stefan
problem which is a you know a heat
equation right with with with the
boundary that also changes with time so
you is the macroscopic density so you is
a zero on the boundary alright and the
boundary moves according to the gradient
of the density right there so that if
you've ever seen this this is this is
how it is so you can think of saying
this w this function w which can be a
very complicated function so depends on
the direction and depends on the
gradient there so can be you know a very
complicated function and presumably
determines everything except we don't
know how to prove that such an equation
has a unique solution
or has a solution at all so as I said so
under diffusion scaling this you know
this morally should converge to that
equation although that's not proved by
the way the as it is in the internal DLA
the opposite process where you have
molecules detaching in a certain way so
basically the snowflake melts all right
or all the ice there is intubated so the
ice gradually turns into vapor on the
boundary so a work of a PDE expert in
one came from UCLA shows you know she
has the entire theory based on viscosity
solutions about evolution but it really
is much easier because that doesn't
create any new instabilities instead it
regular eise's the crystal so all right
another way is to introduce some
regulars regularizing terms which is
well I mean it's also also has some
successes all right so let me show you
so now I've described alone let me show
you some pictures we originally start
with to the amount to the models so just
for one reason I'm going to quickly
review some pictures from 2d models so
these these are some pictures all right
so you see that they look a bit like
real snowflakes here so the 2d
simulations are of course much faster
plus you can also draw the diffusion
field about snow around the snowflake so
the more darker the more darker pixels
here mean thicker clouds all right so
see the snow play kind of exhaust
there's this aura around it which means
that there are almost no particles here
but as you go further they're more and
they have to diffuse in order to it all
right attached so of course it's a
problem because the particles cannot you
know kind of attached in the middle here
it's a two-dimensional model but
nevertheless all right it creates this
sort of branching is what we call
branching instability is also known in
the applied math is mulling Skurka
instability so you see this is a
snowflake grown in the lab and this is
our two-dimensional model there is
really this is not a surprise
something like this would happen so it
starts as a regular hexagons and then
these Middle's of the sides kind of fall
behind and then they fall further and
further behind also the tip instability
is we call it very similar thing from
comparison with the picture from a paper
so this tells you that this diffusion
picture is somehow you know a good
direction to thinking okay so but it's
not it's not the ultimate because
snowflakes actually are
three-dimensional objects as we will see
so so that therefore we start thinking
about the through the three-dimensional
model that I described so now let me
just tell you a few things about the so
this is very difficult to program you
know I spent many months doing just
programming and in particular a one
interesting thing is how you're going to
visualize this and so I just use the
matlab of three-dimensional
visualization for basic information but
if you want to create really attractive
picture you have to use something else
so the day the snowflakes really will
look like ice and the best method in my
opinion is called ray tracing so what
that is is it's a computer graphics
method where the pig you have some
source of light and the the program
traces how the light light beams buzz
around your object there is amazingly a
very good free program to do that which
if you ever need 3d visualization I
highly highly recommend it's called
pov-ray persistence of vision it's used
for all the more attractive pictures if
you will see so let me so this next the
few next slides are comparisons between
real snowflakes and output of our mobile
all right so our mall has several
parameters and we if we adjusted those
parameters using intuition that we
develop
by watching a lot of movies to make
pictures which look a lot like pictures
of real snowflakes so these are you know
real three-dimensional columns that are
in the interim that are formed in the
intermediate temperature regime and
these are very easy to generate with our
model alright so as soon as the mall has
preference to growth in the Z direction
it's going to create either this picture
this picture alright so see there
there's this whole inside because well
because that's how the diffusion
organizes itself so one the one thing
that we learned is the diffusion is
actually very difficult to understand
what it does all right those of you who
studied random walk for those zeros to
the random hugs is not going to be a
huge surprise so the random walk does
conditioned on you know not doing
something complicated is sometimes very
difficult to understand alright so so
many people just plainly didn't believe
that the diffusion could do just
diffusion could do something like that
but as a matter of fact if you're a
problem is that's easy to believe
alright so these are an actor on
microscopic picture see there they
create non transparent objects alright
so and so these are called columns and
one can easily create a you'll see in
the movie of similar-looking columns and
these are her called exploding tips all
right let's no flick which kind of
creates arms and then some white
widening at the end right just regular
that right so these are snowflakes which
you know one usually identify the
snowflakes you should also know that we
have these hieroglyphs like you on top
these ridges on top are pretty prominent
as they are in real snow flakes right
here they're a little muted actually but
you can still see them of course you
know in one takes pictures of real
snowflakes is it's a question as to
since the snow blankets been sitting
there whether it's not partially melted
and so
so there are all these problems with you
know actually knowing Wilson but you
know what is a real snow plugin autism
or I played so I already said that you
know snowflakes also create kind of
regular looking combination of plates
and here you see two examples and two
real snowflakes alright also with this
kind of X hexagon on top which you can
also see right so you see this this
snowflake is no almost no structure
outside and ours also is almost no
structure outside because going to rich
structure inside which of course you can
see just star so basically arms with no
branching okay so let's see let's see
you you know a few time I'm serious if
you wish as the snowflake developed so
this snowflake starts as a small hexagon
and eventually develops into this again
notice the you know the plates but also
the branches so start to small hexagon
then creates this ridges first all right
then continuous continuous and then
eventually it has a branching
instability much like you've seen before
and then eventually it ends up there as
an instability that we observe for the
first time that we didn't know that
exists is called the sandwich
instability when the snow flake starts
as usual but then it eventually thickens
alright it eventually thickens and it
kind of creates two plates and all the
interesting structure is between those
two planes right there are very common
in nature as you know is that microscopy
demonstrates so you see this and this
are kind of this time alright let me
just show you a few rape crisis and then
I'll show you a few movies you're also
in the slideshow at the beginning of the
talk I showed you that so so here here
of course you don't see this these are
all all the structure here is inside
alright so they
are you know you have to know that from
the if I just show you this you wouldn't
know whether these ridges here and these
ribs are outside or inside okay so these
are two three dimensional cases so this
you've already seen this is the column
this is not like never observed in
nature and how do you think we call it
butterfly butterfly of course impossible
to resist impossible to resist that word
all right if it ever exist you know if I
if you ever seen it in the winter please
let me know this would be a huge success
but you will see you see that this would
have a really hard time not just falling
apart should be extremely brittle right
so at least falling apart when it hits
the ground so anyway there we see no
reason normal why this shouldn't exist
grow like this but it should be very
brittle indeed so everything you know
every little bump should just be strong
so let's just say a few things about
advantages and disadvantages of the
model so it's fairly simply conceptually
fairly simple model based on simple
mechanisms it exhibits you know
realistic phenomena it has lots of
parameters which are proud which are
clearly not independent because the real
snowflakes depend on very few parameters
but so you use some tuning is necessary
also you know sublimation means you know
snowflakes in the ice evaporates at the
same time it grows possibly it's not
implemented so 3d simulations are also
snow so far but we're working on that
okay so a few conclusions before I show
you the movies which will be very soon
so one of the puzzles of the snowflake
is symmetric complexity so the
snowflakes look symmetric but not
completely symmetric so the question is
if this is partially at least a random
process how could they look similar
at all and you'll see in a movie an
explanation so another thing is that
there is a you don't need a substantial
preference for growth in one of the
directions to make snowflake
predominantly growing one or the other
direction just a few percentage is
enough yeah so morphology changes so as
the cart in that quote I had at the
beginning of the talk said snowflakes
are probably so diverse because they
move around a lot that's almost
certainly not true because at least if
you accept the diffusion picture because
if the snowflake moves around a lot your
diffusion is a slow process alright it's
a square root of T process right in time
T the snowflake grows by the extent of
spirit of T so if the snow like were to
move around a lot it would basically
always encounter virgin virgin vapor
around it there would be no diffusion
picture with a nicely arranged cloud of
particles which is which has low density
on the boundary and high-density away it
would all be high density so you would
have to change your model completely if
you accept the descarte of point of view
alright also one very interesting from a
mathematical perspective a question is
whether actually the PD model even if
you could prove everything whether it
would actually be better than the
mesoscopic model it is possible that
they're on them you know up to the
mesoscopic level the processes are
completely different than they are on
the macroscopic level it's quite
possible this is our greatest success
right now we didn't win any prizes but
this is better okay we are four jurors
right and we've been paid the greatest
compliment to four jurors ever so LA
Times published an article about
snowflakes real snowflakes about how
many times so in in atmosphere the you
have to start a snowflake with some
impurity
alright usually it starts with some
impurity like a piece of dust or a
bacteria and bacterias are quite common
in the Centers of snowflakes except not
this one because this is one of our
snowflakes taken without permission but
nevertheless we were very pleased
alright no big Theory outside okay no no
they don't say that anything you see all
right so anyway as I said so I'm also
collaborating with an artist who likes
to make enormous pictures of this which
are featured in the exhibitions but for
for the conclusion let me show you a few
movies so which I made so this is um
this is a two-dimensional simulation
which is oops this doesn't work let me
show you again oh I should press pause
I'm sorry in this media player not used
to it so this is a two-dimensional
simulation you see you know vapor around
it and exhausted vapor in the middle if
you look at this picture but you know I
should say that before but if you look
at this picture for one half of a second
then look away you will think this is a
completely symmetric object alright then
of course if you look at this picture
more you'll see it's not alright so it's
not completely symmetric this branch is
not the same as this branch furthermore
these branches yet different but you
will see that even branches which are
far away are strangely similar alright
so this is this is actually a random
picture so there is some randomness in
the process but even branches that are
far away are are strangely similar
alright so you see this configuration
here and you also see it here despite
the fact that these two don't
communicate in any way whatsoever
is in the two-dimensional case the
randomness basically is just a you you
introduce a random amount of mass in the
diffusion from the third dimension you
constantly so this random field actually
this gray here has actually random
fluctuations in it all right that's
where the randomness is okay so so you
can do this you can do this naturally in
two dimensions and so you see that you
know there is obviously there is some
there you know there must be some sort
of stable stable objects that are stable
you know under random perturbations and
are also attracted you know are
effective by the dynamics so the
dynamics is attracted to a few of the of
the arrangements of these side branches
like that so I cannot make a more
rigorous statement than that this is not
really understood what's going on but at
least the picture says that this is
actually possible in the models too all
right so the the others are the others
are three-dimensional there is no
randomness as of yet because we exploit
symmetry a lot so just see your movies
so you see that how the bread the ridges
have developed and branching instability
and so on and then next picture all
right so next picture is one of our
biggest snowflakes so you see how the
again ridges developed also there that
is too small to see here but they're on
either side of the ridge there are
little canals which we call flumes okay
so so some of these side branches are
actually kind of sandwich plates others
are not this is very common in in
snowflakes like this which are just you
know they're did this is really about
let me stop here so the previous picture
was kind of borderline
just the parameters were chosen just on
the boundary between the snowflake
starting to grow in the third dimension
that's why the picture was so
interesting this picture is because in
this particular case the parameters are
chosen so the picture is a very large
preference from growing horizontally all
right and in this case you invariably
get the sandwich instability and the
sandwich plate of this time all right so
all the interesting structure is inside
except that you have varied these very
fast processes occurring on top every
none of that including circles
completely completely surprising so you
have this sort of in you know yeah
circles appearing on top so this is an
example of a column I write the
preference for growth in the third
dimension and then when you see the
background chain changing I change the
parameters so that now there is a
preference for growth in the horizontal
direction all right you can you get
capped columns without that no no no
without changing the parameters we can
we could not get a cat kept column so
the cap columns are almost certainly the
result of a changing environment indeed
all right so so that's what it is that's
how the cap column forms and yeah we
could never get it otherwise so anyway
the fact that this column looks very
very much like columns in nature kept
columns in nature kind of almost
explains it so here is a picture where
the environment doesn't change but
nevertheless there is in the middle of
evolution something happens having to do
with how the fusion field about here
organizes itself so this not like looked
like a typical snowflake but all of a
sudden started thickening and you have
no more although you have a lot of
structure inside you have no no more
structure on the outside right so this
is all
starts growing very very slowly as you
see so that's it thank you very much
questions yes to damage movie yeah yeah
symmetry right right right so felt
really like a real same thing in three
dimension yeah we almost certainly you
can we just haven't done that yet
because it requires a lot more
programming than yeah yeah yeah we have
not done that so the question of
randomness in the three-dimensional in
the three-dimensional simulation is a
future work it's a very natural next
step but you know it takes time so you
know what you do is you either sit down
and prove theorems or you sit down and
program for several months and you know
one has to find the balance between the
two but yeah I mean it's it's definitely
that's a very natural next step I mean I
would be shocked if something very
similar doesn't happen all right of
course you have to introduce reminisce
in a different fashion the way we did in
two-dimensional case doesn't really make
sense so instead of varying mass it
perhaps better to varying the the
diffusion speed or something like that
random randomly varying the EAJA
randomly varying the diffusion speed
which would kind of correspond to
fluctuations in temperature right and
you could I guess you could also have
the diffusion itself being random I mean
the rate is the same
I mean diffusion is a model for lots of
molecules exclusively which way to go oh
yeah I mean you know in a microscopic
model you mean in a mesoscopic model I
don't know how to do that yeah yeah but
yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean there there
are several natural ways to introduce
randomness and they should be all
roughly equivalent I mean that's the
expectation but yeah yeah yeah yeah
right exactly exactly yes so how many
parameters about about yeah so adopt the
geometry see the geometry is kind of
complicated right so the result of a
complicated geometries you know
complicated set of parameters well a
large set of parameters so then the real
question is you know in order to get
most of the interesting phenomena
approximately what is the dimension of
the space of parameters that you need
it's not it's not more than about three
or four what you need is you need the
parameter which covers the preference
for growing vertically rather than
horizontally and you need a parameter
which governs the the you know the kind
of the advantage concave sides have
those are those are basically that you
know the two basic parameters and then
you need one or two just to deal with
small details but yeah so it's not at
the end the set of parameters is not
that big that that determine the
majority of the of the phenomena that
I've shown you if you want the nicest
possible pictures then of course it's
filled with all of them until you're
happy but if you really just want a you
know the basic the basic phenomenology
is yeah
yeah exactly exactly the for example
what we typically do we choose a set of
parameters and then we vary the vapor
density which is also a parameter of
course and you see how the picture
changes with that right that that you
can at least understand what it does all
right so yeah so that's yeah I would say
you need basically you need a parameter
if you really want the basic phenomena
you need a parameter that that tells you
the preference for horizontal or
vertical growth that tells you the the
advantage that the concave sides have
and the vapor density so if you bury
those three or find more or less those
are the first the first one to vary is
it possible to make movies in the lab
there are but of course those are you
cannot if the snow like it's floating
around in the air you basically cannot
do that there is no technology even in
the lab all right so of course in nature
it's completely impossible but even in
the lab that's very difficult you have
to fix it somehow so it doesn't grow so
then it's a question is whether the fact
that the snowflake is fixed influence is
the way you know the way it grows so
yeah so that's that's they're all made
so there at the tip of a needle or on
the rabbit hair classically yeah yeah
yeah they are there similar yes yes yes
actually one of one of the pictures I
shown you is of this type
let's see where oh here so see this is
grown on the tip of a that one was grown
on a tip of something that's from the
lab it's not it's an actual artificial
stuff like all right actually the in
order to make sure that it starts they
often also introduce some electricity so
some static charge would help but the
particles to stick so that that is all I
mean some would consider that cheating
some wouldn't that's that's what they do
they have all sorts of tricks since the
snowflakes are actually quite tricky to
grow this is you know nakiya was the
first to solve that problem and lebryk
does this a bit but it's very tricky
requires a lot of time and equipment and
fiddling and having the right
temperature and having the right up flow
of air so then just don't all the fall
down instantly and all that so yeah so
it's very tricky impurities are also a
problem not too many not the few you
know it's it's a big deal not too many
people are actually able to do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
