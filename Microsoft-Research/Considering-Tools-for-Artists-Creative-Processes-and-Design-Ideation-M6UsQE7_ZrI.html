you
hi everybody I am Michael gone pesky I'm
here from the University nodding I'm
gonna be talking about basically what I
do and some of my work which should be
which should be really good first off
that's um that's my name that's me and
I'm going to first off start by
introducing basically what it is that I
do and what sort of projects I tend to
work on I'm a practice led design
researcher who basically basically looks
at the ways that people use technology
and and in particular I look at the way
that people kind of incorporate
technologies into creative processes and
practices now by that you mean by that i
mean how people use technology to make
things there there are lots of different
ways that there are lots of different
types of creative process and practice
you've got process through designers i
tend to do some some interventions
looking at how how technologies might be
developed to support design practice
which i'll be touching on inside of this
through a through a description of a
cards based methodology that i put
together well methodology might be too
strong aboard technique let's say i also
in the past i've looked at how
photographers use creative process
through a set of jura set of hardware
based interventions where i started
designing homemade digital cameras using
hacked scanner backs which was a really
fun project that I worked on for a few
years but wouldn't be talking about here
is my thesis project where I basically
started doing some research looking at a
really simple question what I was
looking at was I start I started
thinking about artists and creative
process and I asked myself how can how
can we a sort of HCI based designers
human-computer interaction specialists
how can we better design tools and
technologies to support the process
activities of professional artists and
again by process activities I mean the
thing is the artist to do in order to
make their artwork the sort of the steps
that lead from idea to art so I start
again i decided that i was going to
address this problem through practice
i'm a practice lead researcher on my
background previous to my studies of HCI
are in our in design practice in arts
practice and i figured that the best way
to go about looking at how we might be
able to better support artists practices
by designing and implementing exemplar
artists tool what i do is I'd make an
example artists tool figure out what
worked and what didn't work over that
process and use that as my bench
work for figuring out the best ways to
engage with artists so started we're all
good designers start with when you're
when you're looking at technologies and
specific user groups I started by
considering the user and ask myself okay
who's an artist now the immediate ounce
of answers is very simple and artists to
someone who creates art but then that
implies a certain correlative what is
art and all the sudden I've gone from a
very simple question describing the
artist to a very complex one now it sits
well outside of the usual scope of HCI
discourse and at most HCI artists
engagements tend to rely more on cassat
lee understood or outdated models of art
and that's to be expected by tacit Lee
understood and say yeah we know who
artists are but your conception of an
artist might be different from your
conception of our artists might be
different yours or outdated models of
art by which I mean ones that sort of
place the emphasis of what is or isn't
are on the type of physical
manifestation so sort of like artist
painting artist sculpture art is art is
some particular use of type of media and
to me they seemed like these seemed like
descriptions of artistic practice that
perhaps could perhaps getting a bit of
clarity on how these work could be
potentially useful for for the overall
problem ahead after all I mean HC this
might be a relatively new ground for HCI
but artists historians philosophers
they've been debating this from
millennia some of the oldest history
texts that we have deal with deal with
issues of what is art some of the oldest
philosophy that we have deals with the
same at questions so as a means of
clarifying my understanding of the
artist as my user I conducted a bit of
research into the philosophy of art and
I'm going to be talking about that a
little bit and two degree this is going
to step a little bit far outside outside
of the field of standard talks about HCI
but it's going to come back into into
relevance so you'll have to bear with a
little bit of a little bit of a
description of our theory a little a
little sort of art theory primer dealing
with some matters of contemporary art
right now so start talking about that
now what I'll get you these two video
these little it'll get interesting
there's there's pictures coming up
alright so HCI is the discipline
sometimes has a little bit of trouble
distinguishing art from not art and a
perfect example of that is inside of a
lot of the literature H you find a
certain conflation of the fields Art and
Design now as somebody who studied
designed and as as somebody who works as
a dime practitioner examining the
tensions between art and design is a big
part of your undergraduate studies
certainly it's a big part of your master
studies definitely and if you ask any
artist or any designer there are very
different types of activities so what we
have here is a problem of artistic
identification we need to be able to
point and say that's art that's not art
that's the core of sort of a lot of
contemporary art art theory it's not a
problem that's unique to HCI or design
research or or research things it's also
a hefty philosophical problem and it's
one that goes back for quite a bit and
now i'm going to introduce fit a theory
here where in 1964 it's sort of that the
dawn of pop art it's in New York City
philosopher arthur dent oh he was that
he was at Columbia University went to go
and see an exhibition of Andy Warhol and
he found himself directly confronted
with this issue of artistic
identification so he walks into the
exhibition and in the exhibition observe
a ground bacon breaking piece of pop art
he sees a series of brillo brand soap
box though just like this they're
stacked up inside of the gallery people
are people are it's the talk of the town
in terms of in terms of the New York art
scene at the time and what dento
observed was that these boxes are in all
physical respects they were absolutely
identical to the to the very same boxes
that he found displayed in the shop
window around the corner he goes around
the corner and he sees these brillo
boxes they are materially they're
formally they're physically exactly the
same as the boxes that are up in the
gallery so he starts asking himself what
makes Andy Warhol's boxes artworks and
what makes the ones in the shop window
Jess soap boxes and he explored this in
a kind of groundbreaking essay called
the art world n64 and what would it what
he realized was that these artworks were
physically identical there was no sort
of there is no tangible difference
between the two
so if that's the case any kind of
realized he's an analytic philosophers
so basically they deal with concepts
like people in geometry deal with proofs
its its formal logic its direct
connections and any reasons that the
distinction between art and non art
isn't related to material property but
it's related to critical context and he
posited that sort of any recognition of
an artwork or distinction between what's
not are and what is art requires some
critical model deciding what's art you
can't you can't say what art is you
can't say something's art or not are
unless you already have an idea of what
art is I know it's a bit heavy for this
early in the morning and by thinking
about that you realized that these
theories are fundamentally are
historical in nature because they all
involve some degree of comparison
between an artwork and an idea of an
artwork that's based in other artworks
that you see philosophy definitely is
not a early morning subject so because
of this you pointed out two things that
they were very interesting is that first
off since the body of critical theory
that lets you sort of figure out whether
something's are or not art is
historically determined its first off
culturally defined as an history gets
passed on by people secondly it's fluid
it changes from time to time to time as
things change what's art changes over
time and he he referred to the societal
embodiment of the artistic
understandings and theories that makes
make make this possible as the art world
these are sort of the the idea is
transmitted by galleries by by museums
by universities by cultural institutions
by histories he talked about the
embodiment that as an art world and it's
through engagement with this art world
that things become art and honored so
it's not whether it looks like something
it's not whether it's pretty it's not
whether it's got anything to do with
with it with its aesthetic properties
and he furthermore introduced an idea
called the style matrix as a way of
explaining how this worked critically in
practice as a way of understanding how
these multiple meanings of our might
interrelate because there's not just one
meaning of art there's many and they
change over time so so he started asking
how does that happen and he figured that
any way that you can understand an
artwork you can consider it as a sort of
stylistic predicate by predicated
something that kind of implies its
opposite you end up with a continuum at
some you've got art of this type art of
that type I'm going to give a couple of
examples to make that a bit easier so
you can you might understand art as
expressive or its correlative non
expressive in nature so that's two ways
of understanding art that form a
predicate another one might understand
describe art is being representative or
non representative in nature so that's
so that's that's another predicate with
these two predicates we actually have
four ways of understanding the identity
and merit of something that might be an
artwork you could have representative
our non-representative non expressive
art you could have expressive
non-representative art or any
combination of the two so what he did
was he put together style matrix where
you have to to the people understandings
of a given artwork or whether or not it
might or might not be in artwork with P
being the number of predicates supported
by the history of art so what this says
is this actually turns into kind of an
almost mathematical proof of showing how
as our history evolves and new ways of
understanding art get added to the
matrix art itself changes and grows and
now this is groundbreaking because
because previous to this every time that
somebody came up with a new idea for how
or it might work you had to go back and
rewrite the entire history of art
whereas Dan to his model the art world
was inclusive and flexible in a way that
previous models hadn't been but and this
is the important bit and this is where
it starts to come back to HCI danto
noted that well while all the predicate
SAR theoretically equally valid in
practice different subsets of the art
world place different values on each and
if we think about this you can
definitely see it you've got the sort of
um the way I like to think about it is
you've got sort of the experimental art
that goes on experimental contemporary
art world in the way that you'll find in
sort of in London and Hackney happening
there versus the Americans Southwest
start painting painting seen that paint
sort of pictures of landscapes cows
horses these sorts of things they've
both got their their distinct sets of
ideas as to what makes art valid or not
in their own views express the weights
that they give to different sort of
stylistic aspects of the work tend to be
very different and what's nice about
this is that this this distinguishes art
from being something that's linked to
aesthetic property and turns it to
something that's linked to social and
historical context and taken as a whole
dantas views and and there are some
similar views you've got um you've got
Plus for Bruce tikki who actually
explicitly places the people rather than
the history at the identity of art
you've got Becker's who's very
interesting you took a sociological
perspective of Dontos work and you can
you can take these theories of how it
works in this sort of culturally defined
and historically design sense and called
them institutional perspectives so what
I decided to do was that as a grounding
introduction to my research I decided to
adopt a loose inst institutional
understanding of art and that's loose
and the aesthetic philosophy term were
sort of a misplaced comma changes a
complete meaning of an argument I
decided to take a loose interest
institutional end of a understanding of
art as a means of framing my preliminary
understanding of artists and artists and
this this gave me a number of advantages
when I started to when i started to
start to approach artists from a
research perspective first off it
provided me a really useful means of
distinguishing art making from other
similar but distinct activities
art-making were things that related with
the critical context of the art world in
some way explicitly by the people who
are making it versus design which may
use a lot of the same techniques you may
do a lot of the same activities you may
even get similar outcomes but the
intention is different from the
intention of the artist and that in that
VAT set that set up a very clear way of
distinguishing artists from other types
of practice second it highlighted the
need to consider artists activities in a
broader socio professional and evaluate
ori context so so when you're looking at
what artists do you don't just look at
what they do in terms of individual
creativity or craft or expression you
also look at their engagement with their
their particular focal subsets of the
art world you look at the ways that they
you look at the ways that they engage
with galleries you look at the ways that
they engage with critical theory along
with with material craft as a means of
figuring out what why they're doing what
they're doing and the acknowledgement of
the fact that the art world's both
social and fragmented that there are
subsets of the art world that exists
highlighted actually affect that up
until now when you look at HCI research
it actually tends to deal with a very
limited subset of our to start making
first off it tends to deal with techno
centric artists and by techno centric in
the sense i'm talking about artists who
make work that either incorporates
technology in the final form and that it
lives on a screen it's got projections
it's got computer controlled media or
else you deal with artists that deal
with technology as a critical theme
so artists that are actually making
commentary on technology now it's of
course to be expected that these are the
sorts of artists at HCI researchers tend
to engage with I mean we're dealing with
technology artists that work with us
tend to be artists that also work with
technology as an explicit in sort of
central focus of their work but it also
highlights a group that artists Ted that
HCI tends not to deal with in that
outside of techno centric artists
there's there's a real version inside of
HCI towards the owner of professional
contemporary gallery focused fine
artists like sort of the artists that
you'll find when you go to when you pick
up a copy of art form but those tend not
to be the artists that we see when we
start dealing with HCI in the artist so
I decided to examine the practices of a
group of these underrepresented artists
I'd set up myself I said I'd set myself
up a nice critical grounding in terms of
how I was going to approach artists and
now I need just a little bit of
practical work so i decided i was going
to deal with a group of non tech
eccentric gallery focused professional
file artists and i basically hit
contacts i started i started putting the
word out and I'd assembled a small group
of early mid career and established
artists to work with this test subjects
for a while to start to back this kind
of critical in these critical insights
that I've got from hitting the books
with real-world insights that i got from
looking at what artists do and the
artists that it picked up were these are
a bit of the works to give you an idea
as to the sorts of artists i was working
with one of them was Polly Applebaum who
does these that these are beautiful
these are actually hand cut small sort
of died pieces of fabric that she
arranged a--'s and patterns on the
ground that's another one of her works
Juan fronting Eve who builds these sort
of mechanical things these are actually
flip books you know the alarm clocks
that have the numbers that flip over he
makes those but he hand paints
animations on them they flip over
another example of his work is this is
um do you know the snake toys that you
had when your kid this is that done too
ridiculous scales he would go into the
gallery every morning and rearrange them
another artists that I worked with sin
to Tantra who focuses on surface and
wall as a potential vehicle for at work
this is all hand painted again that's
another piece that she did she did the
ceiling piece there Alison Vieira who
deals a sort of um who deals with
sips of archaeology who works a bit less
approachable than the previous ones but
she deals with architectural
architectural material and sort of
conceptions of space in the passage of
time these are actually massive blocks
of plaster that she put together and
I'll recast rumbek who does some who did
who did smaller scale work she worked
both of wire and also with clay as a
material looking at the the materiality
of the form so if these are all plastic
artists these are all artists to you
wouldn't think these are technologically
focused artists when you look at them
and over the course of a year I got to
know these artists in their studio
practices using a variety of methods I
conducted multiple observational studio
visits with each artist where I'd go in
and sort of be a fly on the wall sit and
watch them as they as they went through
there as I went through their daily
routines in the studio I attended lots
of their exhibitions and insisted in the
installation of their work in some cases
as a means of getting it getting some
better ideas as to how they how they did
what they did I conducted full
literature review portfolio reviews
beach and this is something that I
thought I thought was very important
looking at what they wrote about their
own work how they actually critically
positioned there working getting to know
their bodies of work as a cohesive whole
I thought was very important and I
conducted extended semi-structured
interviews with each of the artists
after going through these after going
through the previous the previous
research endeavors to basically get
their take on why they did what they did
and I maintained ongoing dialogues with
each artist over the over the court over
the course of that year and by the end
of the year I domestic huge amount of
information concerning what they did in
the studio all day first off one bit
that I thought was very interesting was
that all the artists devoted significant
time to research activities of a variety
of sorts so you think that artists just
sit around contemplating the muse and
making things all day no a huge part of
it was actually research orientated this
included traditional literature based
research and something that I found
interesting was that each one of these
artists had a massive personal library
of source texts that were specific to
their practices technical research was
extraordinarily common figuring out how
to make things material process material
technique that now this this would take
place everything from getting machinist
tech books textbooks fun to me if who
did the flip books actually took a watch
makers course as a means of figuring out
how to build small mechanic mechanical
devices and a bit that was very artist
specific i thought was situated research
where artists would put themselves into
the way of in
operation sort of to the point where
we're Vieira who did the large plaster
pieces she actually ended up working on
archaeological digs in Greece as a means
of getting sort of inspiration about
about the materiality of classical Greek
Greek sculpture that she was creating
working in relation to they also
conducted professional research which
would be dealing with them where where
can I get an exhibition what residences
are available how can I start how can I
start creating new works how can i how
can I get funding to get these works
done that I have an idea for now now
after the research one thing that was
interesting was that drawing was
absolutely universal amongst these
artists all of them spent significant
time drawing even though only Viera
created drawings that were intended to
be artworks they all felt that drawing
was extraordinarily important to the
formation of their work as a whole now a
lot of these drawings were actually
practical drawings they were diagrams
using drawing as thinking sort of um
sort of sketching out problems making
diagrams to solve technical problems
making making sketches to solve to sell
formal problems that they might that
they might encounter in their work but
they also created contemplative drawings
which were similar but these were
drawings that they'd make to work out
conceptual or critical concerns or
visual concerns like an interesting
thing that I remember is that fontan Eve
showed me a sketchbook and he devoted
about four hours per day to drawing he
showed me one of his sketchbooks where
it was actually a single shape that
repeated over and over and over and over
again and it was interesting and it felt
like he was obsessing until you looked
at his work that he did concurrently
with it and that shape appeared in all
of his sculptural forms so even though
he wasn't making drawing his artworks
they were definitely informing the
artworks and another issue that all of
the artists had is a constant concerned
aspect of the work was documentation
both of their finished work and also the
process was a constant very very highly
considered aspect of their work sort of
the idea being that they'd need to
document their work but they on the one
hand they want their photographs to look
good on the other hand they wanted them
they wanted the focal point to be the
artwork did not the photograph it's a
very very subtle tension but a very
important one to them so they didn't
want the photographs to look too good to
look too polished now after these after
these sort of subsidiary things the Met
the most important aspect to all of them
was in studio material explorations now
they'd call them different things and in
studio material explorations as my term
for what was going on they they'd call
it messing around a lot of them called
it studio time it's it's being in the
studio all day every day working on
stuff they create studies prototype
artworks and models as means of building
artistic understandings as a means of
informing what their work might be and
this was considered an absolute
necessity and it was something that that
required rigid routine so it's not just
something that they did when they had an
idea for a project this is something
that they that they did at least four
days a week for for an entire day this
was this was a massive part part of
their working routine and and the
slowness of this that sort of that time
consuming aspect of this material
practice they saw is extremely valuable
because it allowed for the gradual
building of insight like um remember
apple bombs works with the smoke the
thousands of small cut pieces of fabric
she insisted that cutting them by hand
was essential to the process because she
said that that's when she figured out
what the final form was going to be the
hand cutting the hand dying was actually
what made it made it possible for her to
get her ideas that gave her the time to
let things can illuminate and they
observed that in particular in Apple
bombs case but for all the artists that
this was this was actually very
artistically relevant this is where the
meaning of their work came from the time
it took to make it and last and another
another issue that they all saw is being
very important was a situational aspects
of their work and that in that with for
these sorts of artists they're all
somewhat sculptural in their practices
the relationship between the work in its
environment was actually was oftentimes
essential to the miso Apple bombs pieces
on the floor vieras kind of um kind of
plaster plaster sculptures Fontanilla is
kind of kind of snake sculpture the
relationship between the work in the
space that the work was in was what made
the work now not all the art that works
are like this um vieira if pointed out
that that she had some work so that were
her know Matt works and these were ones
that she'd she'd be able to put mainly
in group shows where you have less kind
of autonomy in terms in turn and
discretion in terms of your relationship
with the curator and
and another this this brings it into the
idea of exhibitions as we start talking
about curators and that the exhibition
provided the overall structure for
activity for all the artists like a bunt
and even pointed out that yeah I just
spend all my time messing around and
playing with things unless I had a
deadline to work too so so the
exhibitions provided the overall kind of
activity structure for the artists as
they're working in as they're working
and this brings it into the idea of how
exhibitions work and these were these
are interesting because it's a highly
nuanced and very tacit we understood
there's no book that you can get that
says how an art world exhibition
functions but alongside of the contracts
that say you will deliver this work by
this date there were really nuanced in
tacit Lee interested protocols
describing how how work gets into the
gallery things like things like well if
you have a solo exhibition you have
there's an expectation if you have a
solo exhibition that better be brand new
work that nobody's ever seen before and
if not end where it whereas in a group
exhibition you might be able to show
something that you shown somewhere else
things along these lines not stated but
but very much understood and and to go
along with this a bit that made it more
interesting was all the artists entry
point it out that their social and
professional lives are coupled to the
point of being indistinguishable sort of
in in the art world your social life is
your professional life and vice versa
and this doesn't just mean that you hang
around with other artists but it meant
but it meant you also hang around with
the curators art handlers art dealers
people on these lines and and something
that something that was pointed out that
I thought was interesting was that
careers tend to progress in tendon and
collectively like I'm one of the artists
called that it can current rise an
agency where as you progress as an
artist your friends their curators are
also equally progressing and and and and
they sort of build they sort of lift
each other's careers concurrently which
I which I found fascinating so after
year at this huge amount of
observational data and I could keep
gathering it and gathering and gathering
it but I needed to make something so i
reconsidered my original goal which was
to design a tool to wade an assist
professional artists and their
professional activities or in their
processing activities that was too many
professionals and one sentence and it's
an interesting project brief but I
thought but I thought it was a little
bit vague so what I did was I've worked
with a card-based ideation technique
I've been developing as a means of
exploring my own process as a design
as a means of adding some specificity to
the problem while still keeping to the
spirit of the original project brief so
I had this I had this vague project
brief to design a tool to aid
professional artists in their process
activities that could be pretty much
anything so with the original problem in
mind i formulated a set of project
specific suits relevant to the original
design and here i'm gonna list three of
them one suit was around activity what
sort of activities are there doing one
suit was our own context and one suit
was around types of technologies that
might be able to available be developed
and here these are these are a few ideas
so the activity suit I chose sort of
cards to go into these suits you've got
drawing activity you've got material
exploration one bit that didn't focus on
was all of the artists had particular
collection behaviors where they collect
images which was fascinating survivor
digitally or physically they all had
massive archives of collected images and
the way as they looked at him was
interesting they had model making
activities sort of building things and
there was technical research another
suit was context so inside of this
you've got professional context
practical practical things like the
practical drawings the practical model
making problem-solving sort of issues
you've got the kind of combined socio
professional context that they work
inside of you've got the idea of
creative contemplation and you've got
the situatedness of work these are these
are sort various contexts that might be
applicable and you've got technologies
sort of platforms that I might want to
develop inside it this was more on my
side but I based it on the technologies
of artists already that I'd already
observed present inside of the studio
figured cameras laptops tablets phones
and video were ubiquitous amongst all
the artists that I was dealing with so I
made cards for all these and then I
dealt the cards into a three-by-three
grid and what's interesting about these
is that each one of these rows inside of
the grid suggests a project brief that
fits the terms in my original project
brief but adds some specificity so I can
take my idea of design a technology to
support artists process activities and
say I could say design a technology
using a laptop to support artists
drawing active process based drawing
activities in a professional context or
i could say design a model make it up
design a technology to support model
making activities that uses laptop and
fo
this is on the situated aspects of work
all of these things sort of meet the
terms of that original that
original project brief that I described
but they had a level of specificity and
some really concrete boundaries to push
against and as a designer having those
kind of concrete concrete rules and kind
of boundaries to push against is what to
me what leads to good design and I felt
that these rows and columns using this
card based technique started to suggest
to more specific avenues for design
activity again in particular the idea of
dealing with situated context laptops
and model making or professional context
laptops and drawings really highlighted
some things that come out inside of the
interviews that I thought that I thought
could be worked with now the state of
the state of the professional art world
the the final world that these artists
were engaged and dictated that they
needed to work in relation to an
international network of galleries and
venues quite frankly there's not enough
galleries in even in New York and London
some of these artists were based in New
York others were based in London they
were split between the two that
paradoxically the New York the New York
artists tended to be represented in
London having a gallery representation
and for fine arts is like having an
agent as a as an actor that your gallery
representative is who promotes you and
produce it and basically produces your
work all of this all of this work ended
up taking place inside of an
international context and there's an
expectation that new shows result in new
works particularly with solo exhibitions
so the fact that when you take that in
combination with the fact that the
situated in situational aspects of the
artists works means that they're
creating new work for spaces that they
have no access to this presents a
problem that that HCI is actually very
well equipped to solve there in that
their current means of understanding
these faces so you're an artist in New
York you get an exhibition in London
you've gotta create work to respond to a
gallery space that you've never seen
that you have no access to unless you
want to hop on a plane and fly across
the world to see it and then go back
which just isn't really an option so the
way that this tends to be dealt with now
is you get a floor plan image emailed to
you by the gallery rep and your work in
relation to that now anybody who's
worked with floorplan images knows that
first off what file format you're going
to get them in particularly when you're
dealing with non architectural gallery
reps there
out architects their gallery
representatives could be anything from
I'd seen some that like drawings on a
napkin to CAD files you've got no
standard you've got no standard image
format you've got no standard fidelity
and all in all it's it's a horrible way
to understand the space so what I what I
figured was how can we maybe design a
technology to support to support artists
in building these visualizations to help
them create their situated works by
aiding in physical and virtual model
making I might find a way to work inside
of this existing problem and make
something that solves it so this is a
direction to myself not to you and now
I'm going to switch over from the
PowerPoint a black background white
slides presentation to a demo of the
software that I developed as a means of
addressing this because as I as I framed
that reformulate a problem i figured
that designing a tool that that might
allow artists to engage with this could
work quite well so i put together this
application where what you've got is a
gallery floor plan this is this is a
sort of image that artists would end up
getting email to them and what i did was
i wrote a quick bit of software that
lets you load this load in the image
this is just a JPEG laid over floor
image and it's got some very simple
drawing tools that let you start to
trace out the walls in the image now
manually tracing this is interesting
first off because as we're dealing with
kind of um as we're dealing with source
imagery that's from a variety of
different sources there's no guarantee
as as to how this might be able to be
automated there's also no guarantee as
to what features might or might not be
sailing into the artist so I put
together a tool that very quickly and
easily lets you start to trace the walls
you can see I'm just sketching out a few
of them I'll leave some of them untraced
for time it's quite simple and intuitive
to use it lets you adjust the height of
the walls and it lets you set a model
scale because the goal of this is that
it it puts together a kit to help you
design foam core model so lets you set
the scale of the model here the
thickness of the foam core board that
you're going to use their and very
quickly it lets you switch over from
your 2d representation to a
representation of the model itself that
that that might be able to be built so
this is this is one way of sort of
starting to visualize that gallery in a
different sort of way it also lets you
switch over to now this is something
that all right then you know actually
this is a funny thing is that one of one
of the bits that was interesting about
it is is that this figure is the stock
figure that ships with I ended up after
going through a few different ways of
potentially using this I i made a
javascript implementation i made a
couple of homebrew implementations using
WebGL and that and eventually ended up
works witching over to the unity engine
this is a stock unity character now I
wanted to switch it out to a figure that
fit into the art world context a bit
better find somebody who looked a bit
like one of the artists the problem is
is that tracking down a rigged character
model that looks like a normal person
who might be inside of a gallery is
extraordinarily difficult I mean if you
want to barbarian with a broadsword or
fighting robot models like that or a
dime a dozen to find for free but to get
actually a rigged character model that
looks like a normal person whisk was
beyond my means as a PhD student
actually yeah yeah you know that would
be easier now see at the time the beards
hadn't quite taken off I could pop beard
on him and it would be yep this this is
another feature that was like oh forgot
about that the lower walls feature so
you could actually get them inside of
the space but what you've got now is
you've got a you've got a situation
where this actually the ability to do
these kind of virtual walkthroughs in
the gallery provides sort of a situated
way of understanding what that space
might be like to inhabit in a way that
looking at the floor plane itself the
relationship between the floor plan and
the person gives you a very different
perspective on how that space might
function hi to the avatars always
actually
kobe vertical their simulation yeah one
of my one of my point bees and it's
interesting because the the inclusion of
the figure and also the inclusion of
when you switch over to this view which
is representation of a scale model of
the space I included a handprint there
that as you adjust the scale of the
model so say you made that model as a 1
100 scale model your hand would be that
big in relationship to it as you change
the scale of the model the handprint
changes change the size accordingly but
the in a perfect world that would be
configurable to the user so that would
actually be your height and the reason
why is is that something that I noticed
in my interviews this is a kind of a
tangent that came in from the interviews
with the artist is that every time that
they described the physical size of
anything they use themselves as the
frame of reference so when Vieira
described those those big plaster column
she was talking about before I'd seen
the work she said oh this is um there
are three times bigger than me or it's
as big as my arm and every time that
size was discovered they used an
egocentric frame of reference and I
thought that that was fascinating so I
wanted to build that in so to answer
your question a perfect world the height
of the artist the artist stand and would
be your hype to afford giving you a
better understanding of the size of the
space as of right now it's kind of the
average on the average height of a
person but 1.8 meters something like
this mmm so-so but the wall height can
be can be adjusted now something else
that was interesting was um was it's one
thing to have the the virtual
representation of the space but given
the tactility of the artist space and
also the idea that you understand things
physically different than you understand
them on screen I wanted to have a
physical output for this what i did was
i built an exporter that lets you let me
just
get to the desk coat and I'll call it
demo when you click export I'll quit
that for now now when I go to the
desktop I've got this demo folder which
actually has printable and exportable
templates that export directly to
illustrator that you can print out using
your printer you can tile it and this is
exporting to illustrator because
illustrator was the universal software
package that the artists were familiar
with that was what that was what they
used to do these things you can export
that and you can also export each one of
the individual walls that made up the
the document itself had an original
numbered and scalable document that can
be printed out glued to foam core card
and used to very quickly construct a
physical model of the space itself they
are sent photographs of the space
sometimes but sometimes photographs of
the space actually end up being more
problematic and the reason why is is
that anybody who's sort of like gone to
and this is something that the artisan
talked about is that is that any time
that you get photographs of the space if
you think about it the way that you get
sort of Realtors photos or state agent
photos photographs of the space tend to
accentuate the details of the space
rather than give a conception of the
physical dimensions of the space oh
absolutely absolutely and that's
something that I think would be
fantastic the idea the idea from a
technological standpoint in particular
taking things like photographs and
dynamically calculating the geometry of
the space based on photographs I think
would be a really interesting take it
was technologically outside of outside
of the scope of this but I yeah I think
that's a good point
pretty incredible it's a fund set up
makes the position so i guess if I some
time to the momentum so it's all sheriff
eNOS by sharing can be a club I also
this make sense yeah yeah sort of sort
of sort of a sort of a shared basically
repository of gallery I did you know and
that came but that came about when I
started to move out when it when I
started with my deployment of the system
itself I'd move dad I'd tested it with
the original artist this is Fontanilla
sort of using the system to build a
model of a gallery that he had an
upcoming exhibition inside of but but
but when I started to do my
presentations I I started to move the
scope outside of practicing artists into
related figures and and the people who
are actually really interested miss were
curators thinking that oh I wish that I
had kits like this that I could just
send out to artists that I work with or
I wish that i could i wish that i could
basically have an on-demand laser
cutting service to ship out very quickly
and easily a model of my gallery to say
to two artists who might be working
inside of my space yeah certainly so so
so so so in addition to in addition to
these sorts of presentations i also
started presenting with curators
architects and galleries architects were
interested they architects were
interested because they liked the
quickness that you could move from 2d to
3d so so so they immediately pointed out
the flaws and modeling architecture with
the system such as this stuff like
varying level floor heights well heights
sort of a like curved surfaces that they
found Browns live and it was great to
talk with architects on that but they
also liked the rapidity of switching
between 2d and 3d now now the curators
actually thought it was fantastic the
curators focused more on the on-screen
representation because they saw it as a
way of very very easily dealing with
something that they're professionally
less equipped to deal with which is
visualizing space and object and that
artists tend to have fairly decent
spatial understandings it gets drilled
into you an art school and it gets
drilled into you by spending all day
every day working with material objects
curators tend to deal more thematically
so the idea so the idea of dealing with
them so the idea of actually very really
readily being able to visualize spaces
that they have access to was useful to
them and something that the curators
actually also pointed out from
dealing with Museum Studies people said
did um I did some presentations with the
Harvard history of science department
with it what they were really interested
in was he was the potential ability to
hang shows in these galleries so not
just visualizing the space but
visualizing a show in the space sort of
what will this print look like in our
gallery what will and also the didactic
but that the didactic potentials of that
sort of sort of how might you use a
system like this to teach people how to
curate yeah and end the idea the idea
behind this is that I think that there's
an interesting chunk of research because
first off it puts together a first off
it puts together a system that's
interesting it's artist specific but a
lot of what I learned from it are things
that are that are actually very
applicable both in a broader art world
context and also in a broader
professional context because I can see
that sort of the idea of sort of having
the the quickness of 2d visual
representative virtual representation to
3d physical representation could have
potential inclusive could do anything
from sort of order your own doll house
using a similar sort of system and
web-based system where you sketch out
the floor plan of your house and get a
dollhouse shipped to your house for kids
you could you could also use it in the
aforementioned beds dealing with issues
of curation you could use it on
potentially with with all sorts of ways
where you might be where you might want
to visualize people in physical spaces
at very very short notice using abstract
source material no it's also interesting
with it is that for of with the research
is that for other art related projects
inside of HCI the focusing on the
institutional perspectives of art that I
introduced it with I think are very
interesting in a broader context dealing
with not just process specific ways of
understanding art but also considering
our NHC eyes relationship as a whole and
and because because it provides a
grounded critical frame of reference and
also when the artists are very familiar
with so it's sort of the part part and
parcel of what was interesting about the
original research in institutional
theory was that all of the artists were
very familiar with that and that was
something that allowed me to dig a lot
deeper into their practices and get a
lot closer to the why they did what they
did by engaging with the theory that
they were comfortable with then going at
it blind what would have allowed me to
do and and
yeah sorry finish excellent and um and
and Leslie the card based ideation
methodology or technique you can't call
the methodology yet the card based
ideation technique I think is something
that that that's very useful from from a
much broader design practice perspective
and that and that what it does is it
lets you abstract there's this tendency
when you're a designer to go down
towards the first idea that that grabs
your interest and really push it but but
but your first idea is very seldom your
best of you and and by going through the
sort of more holistic approach to
dealing with design problems that the
card base technique suggested you end up
exploring your put your your source
material a lot more thoroughly and a lot
deeper than you would if you just sort
of looked over your notes and then went
down the avenue of your first impulse so
so I think that I think that that as a
potential way of executing design
projects is applicable both inside of an
art context but also in a much broader
context but I think that it feels like
time for Q&amp;amp;A is time because I yeah hey
Lou knock that off from your
presentation you catch a point now at
the end where you actually have a tool
which isn't necessarily just for
artisans I mean you can imagine this for
set designers our stage designers or you
know for design rather than are so I'm
wondering how you come that come through
that path and then end up with something
that really isn't necessarily about mark
anymore horse out there well I think it
is because it's not about making artwork
itself it's about supporting artists and
that's and they're in there and they're
different things because because an
interesting thing about it is that is
that the one area where the artist has
done with it had very little problems
with is they had very they they
indicated they had very little need for
things to help them conceive their
artwork or deal with the artistic with
the co defiled artistic content of their
work wasn't so much of what they had a
problem with what they had a problem
with were the logistical concerns that
actually that that and the hoops that
they'd have to
jump through in order to get their
artwork made so things so things like
not being able to visualize a space like
like like Viera pointed out the one who
did the big plaster pieces she'd pointed
out that when she gets to the time of
actually installing her work her primary
concerns are things like is the fault as
a floor going to fall through inside of
this gallery will it fit through the
door these sorts of things were actually
that the things that she found
extraordinarily problematic so for
example you know the company employees
use the ipad 2 produces artwork and some
some artists would be more embracing of
changing their techniques to adapt to
existing technological tools and others
visibly oh absolutely absolutely I mean
I mean a thing that's interesting about
Hockney though is that is that if you
look at his work as if you take it back
further hop news work works inside of a
palette that's very conducive to
projective light displays sort of things
like the iPad in that and that hockey's
work the way that he works at primary
colors he tends to work inside of a
gamut that's very that's very conducive
to the sorts of work that you do inside
of an iPad in it and it also fits in
thematically with what he does he skis
get he said he's always had sort of a
very kind of populists means of
producing his work which is what which
is quite interesting but there are lots
of artists where that might not
necessarily be the case and and and the
other side of things that I thought was
interesting was that even though none of
these artists kind of used technology in
the final forms of their work technology
was almost ubiquitous throughout their
studio they all used laptops they all
use digital cameras as a means of
producing their work they all used um
they all they all conducted studies
using cameras and videos and kind of
scraping internet sites like them like
Applebaum actually uses ebay as a
primary research material looking at
patterns in fabric looking at clothes
than looking at sort of artifacts sort
of sort of reusing technology in this
interesting way and to me these are the
interesting these are the interesting
aspects less the less the david
hockney's kind of artwork having
technology in the final form and more
how can we make technologies to support
the things that lead up to what might be
a nun technological form they the
technology support the the technology
support and inform the critical
activities that lead up to the making of
the work
so for me the idea that you might have
an application like this that can
actually that can actually help
pre-visualize a space that much better
and allow the sort of the non-technical
aspects to to shine a bit better to me I
think is a really valid outcome sorry
yeah so it's a really interesting
product talk that so let's talk of two
hearts we both which would fit in your
own ways outside but the stuff that you
came up with at the end I think it is is
really addressing mode and just go back
to have a special I think it's kind of
interesting to extend beyond your
original ideas of supporting artists to
leave more generally notice that seems
please call think one worm struggling
where I think it is the kind of massive
sort of theoretical foundations that you
had and then go to this varies of a
practical solution both of them
interesting I just I don't get how one
it really informed and the other I I
just wonder what you can talk a little
bit about what why I know you tried to
do that at the end but I'm just not
convinced that that early stuff
necessarily gets into that later maybe
oh absolutely yeah the UM the
preliminary stuff you mean that you mean
their discussion of the art world
concept yeah yeah baby well what's
interesting to me about the art world
concept is that is that there's there's
ways of thinking about our where you can
think about it purely in terms of its
expressive content and purely in terms
of kind of the artist editor sort of as
the primary sort of focus in that in
that and that artworks come purely from
sort of the the mind and kind of vision
of the artist and get manifest in some
sort of way and then the world just
deals with it but but from a
professional context that's not really
the way that it works and what's
interesting is that this model of the
art world kind of takes away the
individualism of the artist and situates
them in kind of a broader in a broader
social context in a broader professional
context and to me that opens up avenues
of exploring how artists work with each
other and work with kind of existing
systems existing social systems and
existing structures in a way that I'm in
a way that's not immediately apparent if
you focus on the
have the artist as kind of a primary
creative creative practitioner enacted
to the exclusion of their relationships
with the galleries because because this
problem that I focused the problem that
I that ended up working on was actually
a problem about the relationships
between artists and their profession the
international rivÃ¨re profession and
their relationships with galleries and
gallerists and that's an art world
problem that's not a that's not a
problem that's about individual practice
that's a problem about practice in a
broader social and professional context
and to me that the art world model is
interesting because it sort of
reinforces the importance of that that
broader context both from a critical
perspective but also from a practical
perspective he's no more questions with
us to the iteration of thesis design you
learn the interviews we're going to get
one question is on a different topic I
think you want to go over there is
version of enalapril yes I've got
questioner not all need to be awesome
yeah I'm curious about the progression
from the cards to the idea because I
understand the cars is a kind of a tool
to take your subject matter and all of
your fieldwork and randomized into a
certain extent push you to generate
ideas that are unexpected my issue then
is that you jump to this to what we then
see is seeing your presentation is a
thing that's very fully formed I'm and
I'm wondering whether there was a
transitional period there where you use
the cards and lots of different ways
develop lots of different ideas and then
gradually said actually this is the
prime primary one or whether this oh
absolutely there were there were there i
had about what I tend to do when I when
I do these sorts of things are there
working on I kind of use a rule of three
when I do it where what I did is I use
the cards methodology and picked three
concepts that started to gravitate
towards me one of them was one of them
was a system for capturing in for
capturing documentation of your studio
practice when you're kind of in the zone
where weirdly to step outside of your
practice you would have to you would
have to start taking pictures and
documented okya menteng the work soy
come up with them with three concepts
using the card system are you sketching
her talk
about point to those three concepts or
oh yeah yeah it's um it's loads of work
with a loads of work with a notebook in
a sketchbook basically drawing is
actually a huge part of my process as
well as the artist here wherewhere when
I come up with ideas for potential
technology is what I tend to do is draw
off-screen interfaces I do one I do i do
chord diagrams of how a system might
work with this one I have mountains of
drawings of sort of foam-core models
drawings of foam-core models are very
strange thing to draw I do not have a
sketchbook with me at the moment
unfortunately I'm kicking myself for not
having a sketchbook with me but yeah I
keep um and what I tend to do is I tend
to keep project specific sketch bugs I
do that on paper for the most part I
find that I find that it's just um it's
just more flexible than keeping digital
sketch books and then in terms of the
development of the project it was a
further iterative set of very specific
research like there was research in
there that was outside the scope of this
says how do you make a foam core model
what's the best way to cut a corner
joint should it be an automated process
or should it be a handmade process these
sorts of things nothing your heart into
Hollis is the compression Trinity kind
of the sketches interesting steps above
then your design solution Richard and
pink important what's the bitten a
little which was fellow compressed in
the presentation young enough time to go
a message yeah I tend to work with them
I tend to really from that side I tend
to work with iterative design where it's
sort if you come up with you you
progressively narrow down the scope of
what you're doing from lots of options
really broad to a specific option than
three iterations around that specific
option gradually getting more specific
and more focused as you go along um they
did do which which was quite good in
particular on the london-based artists
had quite a bit of input in that sent to
tantra the one who did the wall pieces
what was fascinating to me was that she
actually it ended up adopting model
making quite a bit more significantly
inside of a working process as a result
of sort of dialogues over its potential
use over time which is which is
interesting because because she tends to
work on she tends to work architectural
scale she is one who did the big ceiling
piece and the the curved wall panels but
she also armed you know the bridge at
Canary Wharf
 she'd she did the mural that's
across the bridge at Canary Wharf that
was concurrent with this that actually
presented a very interesting project
from a model making perspective that
that I'd collaborated with on in terms
of designing things because it's a very
difficult space to visualize as a 2d
image maker she had to work with a space
that was 2 meters by hundred meters or I
think 150 meters is a massive space to
get the mural onto the bridge so so
she'd actually ended up working with
models as a means of visualizing that
space and figuring out how to construct
her source documents so there's a lot of
back and forth and then there was there
was more critical back and forth with
the other artists the new york-based
ones is that one of the faxes into
missing with light of Jurists furthering
the artists fast for the model to be
situated on Google Earth sleek look out
how my would play across the room during
the days you know interestingly young
Applebaum at the time that this was
going on was working with a piece that
was very heavily she was she was just at
the tail end of a series of work that
was kind of cyclical that dealt with a
place to place sequence so she was
actually very interested in light
because i'm using sequences of material
actually ends up being something where
depending on where the lights hitting
them you get massively different visual
effects from some sort from sort of a
matte color to a really really
reflective color so she was very
interested in sort of directional
lighting which is something that didn't
make it into the final version of it but
but is actually also was Arlie not built
into the Unity game engine you have sort
of you have sort of like I'm you have
basically geographically in time
specific lighting options built built
straight into the engine where you can
say show me what the lights like at
ten-thirty in city center and cambridge
and it'll adjust the light to come from
the right angle yeah good trade-off that
might be an easy problem
the regulation Nazi over list some you
want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
