what we do is anything that involves
taking images from cameras or videos and
converting them into other information
other presentations representation so
our group takes images from cameras from
videos from photos and does cool stuff
with them so we might take your photos
which are blurry photos that you capture
20 years ago and fix them up so you can
recover those memories we could take
video and from the video figure out the
3d structure of what happened in the
scene so you can maybe view it from a
different angle or maybe you can play it
back with different virtual objects in
the scene at the moment we're interested
in the human hand so can we take video
or a Kinect cameras view of the human
hand and convert that in terms of an
animated tool that you can use to
interact with the virtual world it is
fun there's no denying it all right why
is it fun it's the same fun you get you
know from solving a Sudoku or something
you know you have little intellectual
challenge you get over it the great
advantage for us is then when you
overcome the intellectual challenge you
can build a real thing that hundreds of
thousands millions of people will use
each year microsoft research helps
hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
