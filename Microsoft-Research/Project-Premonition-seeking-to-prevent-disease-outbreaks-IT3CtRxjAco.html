monitor infectious agents as they move
across the planet so in the end game we
would like to have a global system
available that detects new infectious
agents and then monitors their movement
as they emerge in this way we can
intervene before they become an epidemic
or before they become an infectious
problem for humans or wildlife the
mosquito is the most dangerous animal on
the planet because it carries so many
pathogens what we want to do is to be
able to catch that mosquito efficiently
at scale and at low cost current
collection technologies are very limited
and present a lot of biases when we do
this in the field now it takes a lot of
effort and money in personnel time the
big challenge is going to be creating
new traps that can collect mosquitoes
that's drone portable and that can be
automated in a very efficient way what
our team will do is take the mosquitoes
and then deep sequencing the results of
that sequencing will be placed through a
series of computational steps that will
detect viruses and will distinguish
between viruses that are known viruses
and those are novel viruses so right now
our ability to analyze these sequences
depends on computer power we're going to
have to expand our computational power
and we're going to have to have to
develop new algorithms that can process
the data much faster what we want to
apply to achieve a goal like this are
our advanced operating systems analysis
tools to find bugs in software before
they're in the wild machine learning and
vision to add complex autonomy into
these drones so that they can make
decisions and then finally cloud
computing and genomics so that we can at
scale analyze the complex data we obtain
I believe in the next five years a
system like this is attainable
