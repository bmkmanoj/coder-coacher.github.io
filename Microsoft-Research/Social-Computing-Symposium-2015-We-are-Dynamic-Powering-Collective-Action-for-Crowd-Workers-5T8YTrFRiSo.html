you
hi everyone I'm near farsala here from
Stanford's HCI Group and today I'm
presenting a project called dynamo as
has come up a few times and the
questions as little labor markets are
growing their opposing new challenges
for us as researchers as workers and as
activists for example how can workers of
these systems organized for higher wages
I think that paid crowdsourcing is a
significant example as well as a very
extreme case of the shifting dynamics of
work it seems that the shift may also be
transforming the requirements for labour
activism but what would like labor
activism look like today I'll talk about
our effort to ask the question how can
we co.design socio-technical systems to
support digital workers social movements
through a year of ethnographic fieldwork
with these mechanical turk workers we
sought to understand the barriers that
worker collectives faced for collective
action there is always a system called
dynamo that is a platform that supports
Mechanical Turk workers communities to
form collectives or publix around issues
and to mobilize dynamo works based on
idea pitches so any worker can come to
the platform and submit a tweet length
idea pitch or an issue people can vote
these issues up or down and can discuss
them on the dynamo forum then when a
idea reaches enough supporters it
evolves into a campaign and people can
take action and track progress since its
deployment on the web in late July 482
turkeys have signed up on dynamo they
have submitted 23 ideas for action and
two of them have turned into campaigns
to take a step back Dino is our effort
to understand the challenges that online
collectives face when they gather not
just to talk but to take action it seems
that the same affordances that make the
internet an ideal place for gathering
also make it easy to dissipate and
unfortunately a majority of collective
efforts online fail we found that to
come
pitfalls that these collectives that
face when they try to act is stalling
that's when they lose momentum and stop
making progress and friction that's when
there are too many critiques and
disagreements within the group that lead
it to flare into acrimony and I'll talk
more about these failure scenarios but
first I want to talk about two efforts
that did succeed on dynamo the first was
an effort to create collectively written
ethical guidelines for research using
Mechanical Turk now this was not easy
imagine that these are large numbers of
workers they know each other only on the
internet and have different online
communities or forums now these people
had to get together and they needed to
reach agreements about the principles
that they agreed would help them and
would protect their work then they had
to write these down make them public and
gather endorsement this effort succeeded
but it required a lot of discussion
organizing and coordination work it's
available online as a 23-page document
that 216 workers and researchers have
signed so far a second effort was a
collective effort to show the world who
turkeys are written from their own
viewpoints its final goal was in a way
to gain public recognition about these
workers in their work now historically
this is a strategy that a lot of labor
movements use especially for work that
is somehow hidden from the public view
like the work that janitors do now
imagine that for online workers this is
even more challenging because these
workers are hidden behind their monitors
and in a way gaining recognition as
human beings with rights is a task in
itself this campaign was very successful
there are letters that turquoise wrote
to Jeff Bezos were published in a lumber
of media outlets like The Guardian The
Daily Beast and two European radio
stations now all these movements were
successful they constantly faced failure
as I mentioned they faced stalling when
the project itself just seemed too hard
to be possible and people stopped making
progress and it faced friction when
there were critiques and disagreements
within the community that they had to
somehow address now we argue that these
two failure scenarios are pitfalls that
are inherent challenges for collectives
that want to act online and there's
somehow linked to avoid stalling you
need to build momentum and act but
acting can backfire if other people
disagree causing friction to address
friction on the other hand may reduce
hope and motivation causing stalling but
what can we do about it we found that
these public's required this thing kinds
of lake labor and organizing and
structuring work what we call the labor
of action we have we've identified and
described five scripts for this labor
that you can read about in our paper and
we argued that the mechanisms that we
use can be replicated to catalyze action
in other online communities we think
that these kinds of labor give lie to
the idea that social software by itself
can produce the conditions for change
and as a research community we can begin
to recognize the laborers the combined
with software to bring about social
change and ask about how we can better
support and recognize these labors
through this project we've taken initial
steps towards understanding the ways to
support dispersed online crowds to act
collectively you can find dynamo but we
are dynamo org thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
