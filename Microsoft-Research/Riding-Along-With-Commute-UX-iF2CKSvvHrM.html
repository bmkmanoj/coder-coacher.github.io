principal architect in speech technology
group in Microsoft Research we're in a
driving simulator lap and I'm going to
demonstrate qui 2x commute X is a nigga
generation in car dialogue system which
allows you to say anything anytime this
is a dialogue system which employs
natural language input and the system
still will be able to understand you
let's see how it works at the beginning
of our trip let's start with listening
to some music play track live for the
party so this was the classic way to
listen to Center speech Kili but we
don't have to specify track album or
artist play Paul Simon so as you can see
the system didn't need the clarification
about the artist play the submarine by
the Beatles and it can even understand
not correctly specified names let's make
some phone calls my bluetooth telephone
is parrot read the system and the
computer knows my address book so i can
ask directly by name call jason
Whitehorn calling Jason my corns a yes
or no yes Jason me white or do you want
to work or home cell calling Jason me
late for that cell
so this was a classic and slightly
painful way to interact with the
Bluetooth phone but our system can
understand and doesn't need this ambigua
shin if the name is unique for example
call Constantine at home calling
constantly evangelize like those at home
but there is even more frequently the
driver needs to respond to some urgent
text messages and it's definitely not
safe while you're driving so we can use
our speech input to do the same message
from one ETA say reply delete call back
or skip replay in 10 minutes and I like
that you want in 10 minutes or a number
from the list yes got it message sent
maybe you notice it but there is some
irregularity in movement of our car and
I'm afraid that we have a flat tire and
because this is a rented car I even
don't know how to open the trail so now
is the time to open that tic owners
manual and to try to figure this out but
instead of this our computer already did
this for us so we can just ask how to
open the trunk and we see the proper
page here but then we need to replace
the flat tire how to replace a flat tire
and we go directly to the page of the
owners manual which it describes how to
replace the flat tire once we have our
flat tire fix it we can continue our
trip and listen to some music
play Norah Jones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
