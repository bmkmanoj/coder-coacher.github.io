you
so it's a pleasure to be here I like to
thank professor Andy l and Han for
organizing this faculty summit I am
going to talk about computational
thinking in the sciences and beyond
given that the theme of this faculty
summit is computing in Sciences some of
the comments I'm going to be making you
some of you who were here two years ago
will have heard them already but i'm
going to use microsoft research examples
to populate my stories on how
computational thinking has already
influenced the research agenda of many
science disciplines i will also update
you on some of the educational efforts
that have been going around the world
including in china on computational
thinking especially in the K through 12
space but also at the college level and
i'm sure those kinds of updates will
interest this particular audience so i'm
going to start with my grand vision and
my grand vision is that computational
thinking will be a fundamental skill
used by everyone in the world by the
middle of the 21st century and by
fundamental skill i mean as fundamental
is reading riting and rithmetic so won't
it be a wonderful if we imagined every
child learning computer science or
computing in there K through 12
education of course this is an
incestuous vision in that computing and
computers will enable the spread of
computational thinking now this vision
has certain implications with respect to
the research agenda of many different
disciplines and that's where I'm going
to focus on the science disciplines
today but computational thinking has
already influenced not just the sciences
and engineering fields but even beyond
the liberal arts humanities Social
Sciences economics and so on but this
vision also has implications with
respect to education and because you are
faculty at many
versity and colleges in the asia-pacific
region it's i'm sure this vision is of
interest to you and in terms of how it
will affect the curricula on your
campuses and the K through 12 curricula
in your countries so in I argue that
already at the graduate level
computational thinking has pervaded in
the ways in which graduate students are
trained for the future I think the
challenge for us in society is what does
this vision of mine imply for the K
through 12 education space I wrote a
3-page article called computational
thinking in 2006 it's a very easy read
it's a little poetic but it's one of
those articles that you read just before
you go to bed to just kind of a light
reading and it is the article that
perhaps has helped me spread my vision
and so for those of you have read it and
have argued for it thank you for that
okay so in the article I talked about I
don't really define computational
thinking I said computational thinking
is an approach to problem-solving
building systems and understanding human
behavior using concepts from computer
science and of course since that article
I've been hounded by everyone you know
to come up with a formal definition of
computational thinking and I think
that's really difficult to do this is
the closest I've come up with and I have
help from the community and trying to
come up with a definition that all of us
in computer science can understand it
still doesn't help people outside of
computer science unfortunately but I
wanted to really focus on the thought
processes computational thinking is what
happens in your head it's the first
thing that happens in your head that
then gets translated into something that
a machine might be able to execute or
human might be able to execute so
computational thinking first and for
more most are the thought processes
involved in first formulating a problem
them and solving it and this is a
problem solving part of computational
thinking problem computational thinking
is an approach to problem solving but in
problem solving especially in computer
science just formulating the problem is
a step forward and so part of what i
mean by thought processes involved in
formulating a problem and expressing its
solution is its to hand two parts of
problem solving what is formulating the
problem and the others solving it and
then i say expressing a solution because
in computer science we pay a lot of
attention to the ways in which we
express the solution in fact you can
argue that many of the designs of many
of the programming languages are
different ways to express our solutions
some languages are better if expressing
certain kinds of solutions than other
languages some languages are met express
higher-level solutions than lower level
solutions and so on and so forth so
expression is quite important and then
it's such a way that a computer and I'm
very careful to say a computer can be a
human or a machine and in fact in this
day and age a computer can be a network
of humans and machines working together
to solve a problem that neither can
solve alone so very careful to include
humans in a computer and then can
effectively carry out the word
effectively of course is critical here
it's not it it is part of what is
inherent to why its computational
thinking and and and not a not just
mathematical thinking for instance so um
I'd like to talk about computational
thinking philosophically as actually
complimenting and combining mathematical
and engineering thinking computational
thinking certainly draws on mathematics
as its foundations because
mathematically
is the foundations of computer science
from the theoretical aspects of computer
science but but in computer science
unlike in mathematics we are actually
constrained by the physics of the
underlying machine that's going to
effectively carry out the solution
whether that machine is a machine that
we're familiar with like a laptop or
mobile device or whether the machine is
a human and in fact its research still
to understand the limitations the
computational limitations of a human
solving problems that's partly a part of
the whole quest in artificial
intelligence for instance but unlike in
mathematics you know we can't for very
easily say for all X P of X um because
usually we are constrained if specially
talking about this kind of machine we
can't there we we end up hitting against
the limits of what that X is in terms of
representation computational thinking
also draws an engineering since our
systems interact with the real world so
any of our computing devices any of the
software that we write in the end is
communicating interacting with either
the physical world or a human being and
so all of our technology interacts with
the real world so it's like any
engineered system like a bridge or a
building or any physical and physical
engineered system it interacts with the
real world and so we have to keep in
mind how a system that we build in
computer science interacts with the real
world but the the beauty of computer
science in or the secret weapon computer
science and contrast to other
engineering disciplines is software
software really is something special to
computer science
it's in software that we can design
worlds that defy the laws of physics and
defy the laws of nature and so it's in
software that we can build worlds that
let us express what how whatever we can
imagine so we are only limited a by our
imagination in the kinds of systems in
the kinds of worlds that we can build in
computer science so that's why this is
awful Asafa chol but that's why i like
to think about computational thinking as
complementing and combining mathematical
and engineering thinking when I talk
about computational thinking I really do
mean those thought processes the ideas
the concepts the abstractions that
computer scientists use on a routine
basis I'm not so focused on the
artifacts that manifests those
abstractions so it's not just the
software in the hardware that touch our
daily lies but it's an approach to to
living approach to problem solving and I
do think that it is for everyone
everywhere just to be a little more
concrete I listing here some sample
classes of computational concepts and
I'm listing these only to say not that
every child has to learn all of these
but I think every child can learn some
of these and I think what's out on the
open right now is to figure out
collectively as a community what does
make sense to teach what concept when
and the reason I list these kinds of
concepts which should be familiar to all
of you is to contrast what i mean by
computational thinking and computer
literacy so there are many courses out
there that teach how to use word and
excel and powerpoint and how to use
search engines like Google or Bing I'm
not talking about that at all i'm also
using the term computational thinking to
contrast what i mean by what i mean with
computer programming computer
programming of course is a skill
that all computer scientists learn and
use routinely but I'm saying that much
beyond computer programming there's more
the computer scientists have to add to
the thinking skills to the reasoning
ability to the logical analysis that we
in computer science do and I especially
don't mean you know a course for
instance that you typically find on a
college campus offered to freshmen
that's called you know introduction to
your favorite programming language 101
that changes from year to year it
changes from decade to decade as
programming languages change and there's
more to computer science than teaching
just computer programming so what I want
to do is take a step back and look from
the research perspective how
computational thinking has already
influenced many different disciplines
and in the spirit of the theme of this
faculty summit I'm going to focus on the
sciences and give you four different
examples to from biology and two from
the social and economic sciences so um I
already gave away my my usual question
but what I'm going to do is look at one
discipline and argue that many different
computational methods have already
influenced the thinking in that
discipline and at this point normally I
say you know what one discipline might
that be but I already gave that away so
it's biology and I think for me when
what happened when it when it was the
sequencing of the human genome I think
it was that breakthrough that when
biologists sort of set up and said hey
maybe computer scientists have something
to bear on the way I as a biologist can
solve problems in biology and it was the
algorithm that really expedited the
sequencing of the human genome and of
course
um the architecture of the arrays of
machines that helped as well but in all
these examples in biology these
different computational methods
processes languages techniques and tools
have one commonality and that is the
these methods languages tools and
techniques all are useful for explaining
the dynamics of processes and for us in
computer science we use these kinds of
tools techniques and methods to explain
explain computational processes and how
they interact whether they're concurrent
processes in an operating system or
processes in a distributed system or a
fault-tolerant kinds of systems where
you have to worry about reliability all
sorts of different tools techniques
languages models that we have invented
in computer science all are ways to
understand the dynamic interactions
between and among processes so for us
this is kind of bread and butter but it
so happens that these kinds of methods
tools techniques and languages can be
used to explain the dynamics of
biological processes and that's the aha
or that's the Dare or that's the hope so
what I want to do is explain in one
example from some work done at microsoft
research on stem cell prediction and
this is very recent work just published
in science of the summer and the idea is
to do stem cell prediction so the
problem is a biological problem and let
me first explain it and then show you
how a computational tool and method or
thinking came to bear to help understand
on stem cell prediction so this starts
with embryonic stem cells and embryonic
stem cells have two properties that make
them special the first is that they're
self renewing which means they divide
indefinitely so they there's always
plenty of them and that's pretty amazing
the second is this notion of
pluripotency which means they can
jennette generate all adult cell types
so a particular stem cell can eventually
evolved into a brain cell or a lung cell
or a kidney cell so we understand that
we don't understand how it happens but
we understand that happens and
interestingly not enough we are also
know that if you take an adult stem cell
stem cell we can actually convert it
into a stem cell so this gives us the
hope of taking an adult cell converting
it into a stem cell and if we can only
make that stem style evolved into a kind
of cell that we want then we have the
hope of addressing a lot of different
diseases and so on so this is the the
grand vision of why one would really
want to understand the behavior of
embryonic stem cells so it turns out
that the biologists already know that a
embryonic stem cell can't reacts to
certain kinds of signals in fact LIF
Chiron and PD two of the three signals
will cause some reaction in the stem
cell in terms of the jeans and the
expression of those jeans and so what we
can do is we can look at the different
combinations of two out of three signals
and see how each of the genes in the
stem cell react and then what we can do
is we
quickly um from what we see in the
experimental observations we can build
this graph where these blue nodes are
genes and these black notes are the
signals and a black line shows a
positive interaction between the jeans
and a red line shows an inhibitory
reaction and it turns out that if you
consider all the different nodes and
lines and signaling signals as inputs
you have 10 to the 43 possible state
machines and when you throw when you
talk to computer scientists they're not
daunted by 10 to the 43 state machines
because we have for instance
verification techniques like model
checking in SAT solvers and so on that
can easily handle large state spaces so
for computer scientists this is this is
a great example of how can we actually
reduce the search space or reduce the
number of plausible state machines if
all we all we had to do was find some
constraints to reduce the number of
possible state machines to just the
plausible ones then we actually have
made some progress and it turns out that
at Microsoft Research we built and
invented a tool called z3 or z3 which is
the best constraint solver in the world
and the computational biologists and
microsoft research on knew about this
xiii tool that our programming languages
and verification researchers built for
completely other reasons and use z3 to
constrain the 10 to the 43 possible
state machines into the plausible ones
and what they use for their constraints
were actually
observations from real experiments that
the biologists have done over the years
so you go through all the literature in
biology look at the experimental
observations and use those to constrain
what state machines few will are really
plausible and so in that that's what
they were able to do and the so the set
of possible models was constrained by
experimentally observed behaviors and
this set was used to make a large number
of predictions non-intuitive predictions
of the response of the network to
genetic perturbations and then these
predictions which were done purely on
these you know state state machines were
experimentally validated with over
seventy percent accuracy which is
unprecedented in this particular area of
biology moreover what they were able to
show is that this state machine is ul on
them on the right is like the colonel
the minimal genes and interactions given
the signals that I mentioned before that
show up in all the plausible models and
this was the new discovery in biology
and this was what was a part of that
nature paper so they're using
off-the-shelf computational techniques
and tools to make new discoveries in
biology and so this is pretty exciting
to me and especially when I am from the
community research community that plays
with tools like Marvel checkers and
theorem provers and constraint solvers
and we hardly you know invent these
things thinking that we're going to
discover biology in in 20 years so it's
pretty pretty exciting for me to see
this application of a constraint solver
in in such a profound way to biology
okay so I argued and just with one
example that one discipline biology has
been influenced and is are influencing
many has been influenced by many
computational methods tools techniques
and languages but let me flip it around
and say and ask you you know what one
computational method has been used by
many different disciplines
this is the interactive part of the talk
don't be shy machine learning so how you
all have heard of machine learning I'm
sure a machine learning to me and this
is already years ago has transformed the
field of statistics this is certainly
true at carnegie mellon where we see the
machine learning department is part of
the school of computer science and the
machine learning department is made up
of faculty from the computer science
department and faculty from the Justice
Department in fact they should be called
the department of statistical machine
learning and I can tell other stories
about how I feel why I feel machine
learning has transformed statistics but
i'm not going to focus on that machine
learning in the sciences has already
been able to be used in astronomy to
make new discoveries like brown dwarfs
and fossil galaxies it's used in
medicine to detect tumors in mammograms
it's used in meter y'all meteorology for
understanding tornado formation it's
used in the neurosciences where you
apply it to a multitude of fMRI scans to
understand what part of your brain
lights up when you're looking at a verb
versus looking at a noun the story I
wanted to tell it's also from Microsoft
Research a different science group where
the aha it's also biology story so this
is machine learning in biology where the
AHA is um that we have been using
machine learning for many years to fight
spam and in fact this very research
group i'm talking about invented a
machine learning algorithm originally to
fight spam it turns out that the the
computational thinking idea here is well
armed spammers mute messages to work
filters so the solution to that is go
after the wink weak link now here's the
aha can we use machine learning to fight
HIV in the way that we can fight spam
and the analogy is that HIV mutates to
avoid attack by the immune system so the
solution is go after the weak link and
what's so amazing and I'm going to talk
a little bit more about this is that the
techniques that I'm going to talk about
actually are able and right now i'm
talking about ongoing work in microsoft
research are able to understand
vulnerable regions the weak link weak
links in HIV so the strategy is to
identify what are called vulnerable
regions in HIV and then if we can
identify these vulnerable regions we can
create a vaccine that directs that
teaches the immune system to target just
those regions and the reason this is
important is as follows this HIV protein
is made up of is made up basically of a
string of amino acids that fold over
each other in 3d and what happens when
the immune system attacks this protein
it the protein is robust in many places
to attack it just mutates and it still
retains the functionality that is so
destructive to humans and so you poke it
and it mutates it's still bad for humans
but there are places that um that
perhaps for instance in this place I'm
showing here with the two loops
intersect or are next to each other
where that's called a vulnerable region
because that's where on if if the immune
system attacks just at that point the
protein will the HIV
protein will will will not mutate in a
way that the immune system it will not
mutate so that it will weaken the it
will so will not weaken the
functionality of the destroying the
human so so then how do we find these
vulnerable regions that's the question
and what they're so what the researchers
that Microsoft did in collaboration with
researchers at Harvard is to realize
that in the world there are some people
who are called controllers who have the
HIV virus but don't get sick and then
there are the normal people who have the
HIV virus but do get sick and so what
you can do is you can look for
differences between where the immune
systems of the controller's attack HIV
versus where the immune systems of the
normal people attack HIV and you can use
lots and lots of data to to help you
look for these differences and what
these researchers did was to actually
use pretty much machine learning
techniques to identify these vulnerable
regional regions and they were able to
identify eight regions of HIV proteins
where controllers were much more likely
to attack so that was step one and that
was tantalizingly tantalizing to the
researchers and in fact they went
further to find more vulnerable regions
they used in silico prediction under
certain assumptions and using the
protein database that's been generated
by the biology community to run
high-energy simulations and then using
this fold X algorithm we're able to
actually identify many more regions
as noted here so these regions here are
also new candidates of vulnerable
regions so the idea then is going back
to the computational thinking is that
finding the weak link and spammer spam
was the metaphor for finding the weak
link in HIV okay so machine learning is
everywhere not just in the sciences the
machine learning is of course used for
detecting credit card spam it's used on
Wall Street for good or bad it's used in
supermarkets where you get recommend you
get coupons when you checkout based on
your previous buying patterns it's used
in all these recommendation systems that
you might be familiar with when you're
going shopping or watching movies and
see even used in sports so right now
there are people who are actually
getting funding from professional sports
agencies to use machine learning and
data analytics to understand how best to
train and coach their athletes
computational thinking of course goes
beyond just the sciences even though
that's the theme of this faculty summit
and I just wanted to hint at a couple of
those examples computational thinking in
the sciences and chemistry physics and
the geosciences but what and in math and
engineering but what I would really
wanted to get to is computational
thinking beyond the sciences where it's
affecting disciplines that are more
social behavioral in nature so in
economics for instance in law and in
health care and the two examples i want
to give again for microsoft research
have to do with computational thinking
in economics and computational thinking
in the social sciences so the one on in
economics has to do with polling so here
i'm going to talk about the difference
between what's called representative
polling and non-representative polling
in in for instance in the United States
when we have a presidential election
normally professional polling companies
use what's called representative
sampling where you take a representation
or you take a sampling of the US
population hoping that you're getting
represented representative sample on and
to be able to predict the winner of the
election and that's an a billion-dollar
business the 2012 presidential election
costs one pulling the professional
polling companies over six billion
dollars over the course of two years and
so the question is does this sampling
this representative sampling polling
method actually give you a good
prediction of who's going to win the
election and some researchers at
Microsoft Research how to cook took a
completely different approach on it's
cheaper faster and more accurate and
counter intuitively it's based on this
notion of non representative sampling
and here they actually pulled Xbox users
um over the period of 45 days on got
many many more respondents than you
would typically get in a representative
sampling on and for each respondent they
were able to collect information about
the age the gender the race the
education level and so on and what they
were able to do is collect a lot of data
and let me show you the data first
because it's collecting the data is just
the first step so here's the the
election in 2012 was Obama vs Romney and
you'll notice that this dotted line that
straight dotted line that goes across is
the final election outcome where Obama
was one and the professional Polar's
over time in this 40 to 45 day period
you can see that that's that thick
dotted line
and they underestimated the final
election outcome and the raw Xbox data
that was collected from the players of
xbox oh that's the raw data this red
line and actually doesn't look very good
does it and the reason is of course this
is just data what you really need to do
is analyze the data approp appropriately
so that it is indicative of what what
how people actually will vote and the
way they do this is through a technique
called post stratification so the idea
is to take an individual and for
instance if the individual in a
representative poll might say a man from
New York so this is a man from New York
but in this particular post ratification
what you do is you you consider this man
from New York you you label the PERT the
the this individuals a man and then also
a person from New York and so then you
have many more bins on in which you can
correlate the different combinations of
men and age and gender and so on and
then aggregate the properties to come up
with what would be a represented
representation of the voters in an
election and so it it is through that
post ratification process that you can
accommodate the fact that your original
input is based on a non representation
non representative sampling of the
population and by the way you should
realize that most like 95 of a percent
of Xbox users are male and there between
the age of like 19 and 29 so it is very
much a non representative sampling but
there were enough women over 65 that
they could actually get some information
get some signal out of those particular
respondents and so after you do this
kind of data analysis
based on the collection based on the
data collection then here's what they
were able to predict and so the
corrected Xbox that's the the post
ratification using also multi regression
and so on line is the one in the thick
red line here and you can see your
towards the end of near the voting day
they were pretty much spot on in who was
going to win and they did better than
the 6.4 billion dollars worth of polling
that had occurred for two years before
the election date this is of course very
just one example of using this
particular technique for predicting
who's going to win the the presidential
election that many other examples since
then this team has done and for instance
in the world cup in a Oscar ceremonies
it's the Hollywood Awards that are given
out every year um and so on and right
now if you're very very interested in
this you can go to what's called the
Microsoft prediction lab and that's
actually a website and and you yourself
can participate in these kinds of polls
and surveys the last point I wanted to
make mention about this kind of work is
it's also very important to be clear
about what kind of question you actually
ask the people you're pulling so it
turns out that for instance it's you get
a better prediction if you ask the
question instead of asking the question
who are you going to vote for if you ask
the question who do you think will win
and that's why this particular team also
uses data not just by asking questions
of individuals but looking at data from
Twitter data from betting pools and so
on
so in fact it's multiple data sources
that this Microsoft prediction lab uses
in order to do their kinds of
predictions ok so that was computational
thinking in economics computational
thinking as I mentioned a beyond the
sciences also has had a influence in
archaeology there was any heritage
project that started in Microsoft
Research Asia here many years ago and
I'm still gone going on there's many
programs now in the United States on
computational journalism master's level
programs digital journalism in fact at
Columbia University the School of
Journalism just hired a couple new
faculty members and they were PhDs in
computer science in the humanities it's
a lot of it is based on big data and
digging into data and understanding
patterns across different disciplines
but also just within a discipline in
history and literature and so on the
example I want to give you is again from
Microsoft Research having to do with the
combination of computational computer
science and anthropology and learning
about krod workers so in this on work
the researcher from Microsoft Research
and her colleagues use a digital studies
to basically produce graphs nodes and
relationships in the nodes and then use
uses anthropology to understand the
kinds of relations on the kinds of nodes
and in this particular work that I'm
going to describe to you what was
interested what they wanted to study was
what is the economic model the incentive
and reward structure for crowd workers
you know and what they concluded was
that the economic model for
understanding crowd workers is not the
perfect competition
all which is what most of our economy is
based on in the perfect competition
model there's a law called law of one
pricing we're equal pay is given for
equal jobs so if you do the same job
you're you know you get the same pay it
turns out that in this study that
perfect the perfect competition model
that doesn't hold in fact the what's
called the imperfect competition model
holds where the loved one pricing does
not hold in this particular case
different Amazon Mechanical Turk errs
might be doing the same job but actually
get paid differently and so it was in
studying and mapping the crowd and
looking at some of the commonalities of
where the crowd workers are for instance
internet access and so on that allow
them to hypothesize that the imperfect
competition model better explains the
economic model for how crowd working
works and then the study I'm citing goes
on to suggest different policy
recommendations for addressing this
imperfect competition so now let me turn
to education and I wanted to say that I
said this already that at the
undergraduate level at the graduate
level we're already seeing a lot of
progress in computational thinking I
think the real challenge is the K
through 12 level and we talked how I
mentioned earlier about the pipeline
going into the earlier stages of the
pipeline I think if we can do that will
see a very different society in the
future so I've asked the question of the
computer science community what is an
effective way of learning and our
teaching computational thinking by or to
the K through 12 space and I think there
are the my analogies is to mathematics
you know somehow by the time you're in
five years old in kindergarten you have
a sense of number
and by the time you're 12 years old or
in seventh grade you have mathematical
sophistication enough to learn algebra
and by the time you're 18 years old or
in 12th grade you have the concepts
behind you and the mathematical
sophistication to learn calculus so
what's the analogy in computer science
you know when is the right time to learn
or teach recursion well you know I or
maybe they're these inherent concepts
that were born with innate concepts that
were born with on those are actually
research questions so and then there's
the course the the challenge of how do
we best integrate the computer the
device in teaching these concepts and
one of the concerns I have with MOOCs is
that which is throwing technology at
something how do we know that this is
actually improving and enhancing our
learning okay but what I wanted to do is
um well here's my short example of
computational thinking in in daily life
so and then I'll talk about the progress
we've made around the world in education
so here is me at this actually me at the
National Science Foundation cafeteria my
second day and what I do is I get a cup
and then I put some milk in end and then
some coffee and then I put some sugar in
and then I put a lid on get a napkin and
leave so you know as a computer
scientist I look at this coffee station
and I I say well what's wrong with this
coffee station what's wrong with this
coffee station let me give you a hint
it's even worse when there's like
someone in your way so as a computer
scientist what what do I think or what
do you think what's the concept that's
going to help me make this cuff this
coffee station more efficient
well I think pipelining so and then I
actually think oh well what are the
minimum stations I need to move to
effect a pipeline is actually actually
the most efficient pipeline and blah
blah blah but of course I'm just at the
cafeteria so in fact if you think about
it you just need to move the lids over
and it's it's not the most efficient
pipeline but it certainly helps so this
is just an example of computational
thinking in daily life it's not that
there's a hard difficult problem that
you're trying to solve but it's a way
that you bring in the concepts you've
learned in computer science to
approaching you know daily routine
activities okay so now when we talked
about the efforts in the United States
in the United Kingdom and China having
to do with computational thinking and in
the United States this is a busy slide
but let me just focus on 22 efforts the
the biggest effort that's happening in
the United States is a revamping of the
Advanced Placement computer science
course that is offered to high school
students and this has been ongoing since
about 2009 oh and the hope is that that
the the plan is at this new AP class in
computer science is actually going to
teach fundamental principles of of
computer science not just programming in
your favorite programming language and
the reason this is such an important
leverage and the United States is that
in the United States to affect any
change at the con k through 12 level
means actually going to 10,000 school
districts one by one and trying to
effect the change because in the United
States the public school system at the K
through 12 level is completely
decentralized and so the one lever we
have is the these AP classes and AP
tests that high school students like to
take in order to get credit get college
credit when they enter a college and so
if we can capture that one point that
attention of theirs then we can affect
some some we
some amount of you know ability to
change high school curriculum in a more
in a simpler way than going to school
district one by one and so that's been
ongoing and at the same time not only do
you want this high school course to
change but you also need the freshman
level college course to change because
you're supposed to be getting college
credit for that course and so
fortunately as this change in the
Advanced Placement curriculum has been
ongoing so have changes across many
colleges and universities in the United
States in terms of adding or changing a
course at the freshman level
specifically for non-majors but often
not even for majors as well and it's
basically computer science concepts for
for non-majors and many many classes now
are our many campus and now are changing
their freshman level course to be more
about computational concepts and not
computer programming in fact the one of
the most popular courses at Harvard
University is exactly this course on a
part of that is due to the instructor
who's very popular but the the students
do vote with their feet so that is
what's going on in the US the kind of
parallel efforts in changing the high
school curriculum for computer science
and the undergraduate freshman level
curriculum especially for non-majors I'm
really impressed with what the United
Kingdom has done and this started
already in 2012 it went in January 2012
this report from the British Royal
Society came out called shutdown or
restart and acknowledged the importance
of computational thinking but more
importantly they already had in the UK a
required computing course and that
required computing course was really
about computing skills on learning Word
and Excel
and so on so fortunately there was
already room in the k-12 curriculum and
what what has happened since 2012 is
replacing the content of that required
computing course with honest-to-goodness
content about computer science and so
very very excited about this computing
at school is school in the UK is K
through 12 in the u.s. there there's an
effort that that started since 2012 on
it's really a grassroots efforts and I'm
really proud to say that one of the
persons behind this effort was a
Microsoft researcher at Cambridge Simon
Peyton Jones and this fall 2014 is the
first roll out of a case or 12 curricula
curricula for that includes
computational thinking teaching
computational thinking concepts at each
grade level so there's a spelled out
curriculum for each level and right now
they're there they're making it happen
and this is just just for England now so
this is pretty it's experimental for the
exciting is pretty new oh and we'll see
what happens but the UK was really of
all the countries around the world was
really the the gutsy lead on this so
what about um in other countries well I
wanted to really focus on what's
happening in China so I guess that's me
on a boat after the faculty summit in
Seattle talking to Professor Google
Liang Chen it was the key influencer of
computational thinking in China and he
was the one who started the first
computer science fundamental course of
computational thinking and what has
happened since then is in 2012 the
Chinese Ministry of Education the m.o.e
announced a program to reform the
computing fundamental courses focusing
on computational thinking
and why this is important is at the time
the this particular course that was
offered had had a couple of problems one
was that in some places what that course
covered was was trying to cover too much
a covered computer history languages
operating systems its kind of throwing
it all into one course and people really
didn't get a deep understanding of some
of the concepts in other variations of
this course it really was about teaching
computer skills like using word and
powerpoint and excel and so on and so
either and many students would take that
course and be really bored because I
knew this stuff already and they didn't
understand the value of and the they
didn't get the appreciation of the depth
of computer science as a field so in any
case is the other thing that so that so
this is happening right right now in
just as i speak with Microsoft Research
Asia's participation we and the m.o.e
are jointly putting forward a program to
sponsor 16 full computational thinking
courses and 100 case studies in the
proposals are due pretty soon or maybe
they're in already and 16 will be chosen
and micro so this is this really shows
the lead of Microsoft Research Asia in
helping revamp the college curriculum in
China and so the hope is to empower 7
million students with computational
thinking ability through these CS
fundamental courses okay so I'm I will
stop there my little three page article
was translated into Chinese and into
French so you can actually read read the
article in in Chinese if you want so I
will just help help me spread the
computational thinking and help me make
computational thinking commonplace
that's my my plea to you thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
