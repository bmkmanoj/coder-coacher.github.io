you
come Eric Brin van from the University
of Utah Eric and I were actually both at
Carnegie Mellon University working on
our PhDs at the same time and Eric's
background is in Hardware in a
synchronous circuits but for the last
few years he's been teaching this very
interesting class at the University of
Utah that brings together technical
gadgets and art students and he's going
to tell us more about that right I to
say Dave debt laughs who's in the
audience was also in our class at CMU so
we've got a little CMU mini reunion
going on well thank you all for coming
that it was you know I sort of mentioned
this class to Rick a couple weeks ago
and he said hey you should come talk
about it i'm really happy to come talk
about because i'm really sort of psyched
about this class so the title the class
is kinetic aren't and embedded systems
and i suspect are you all computer
scientists in the audience are there
some artists in the audience okay so so
the interesting thing about this class i
think is that it it tries to make a
strong connection between this field of
art known as kinetic aren't and embedded
systems which are you know small
embedded computing systems so for those
of you who aren't all that familiar with
kinetic art the way I define kinetic art
at least is art that contains moving
parts so it has motion or it has sound
or it has light as a part of its
artistic purpose so it's not just an
incidental thing the kinetics are part
of the work and these days the kinetic
aspect of a piece of kinetic art is
often mediated through computers so we
use motors we use transducers we use
sensors and then there's some sort of
computing which goes on to mediate all
that now I think this is quite distinct
from computer aren't computer art I
think is something where the computer is
actually in your face it's part of the
art the art looks like a computer and in
my view of the world at least kinetic
art is art that moves that does maybe
mysterious things in response to some
sort of sensor data but the computer is
sort of behind the scenes so there's a
an artist from San Francisco Jim
Campbell who on his website so this
would be moving if we actually have the
videos
he has sort of his formula for computer
art and his formula has a number of
inputs scrolling off on the left that
are then interpreted by some invisible
computing in the middle and cause
something to happen on the output and so
if you go to his website these are
scrolling with all sorts of different
possibilities for inputs and outputs and
I don't think he's a hundred percent
serious but it's actually a pretty good
crystallization of what kinetic art is
its some sort of sensor data on the
input perhaps some sort of invisible
computing munging that data in some way
and then causing something to happen on
the output I shouldn't probably I will
probably need to say much about embedded
systems other than to say I think of
embedded systems as in this context as
small computing systems embedded in
something else somewhat invisibly and we
can think about those as little arm
cores or you know other kinds of little
computing things but basically they're
designed to interact I think of embedded
systems as things that they then as a
first order function of their being they
take sensor data and they can cause
physical things to happen so the idea of
this class this embedded systems in
kinetic art class is to get computer
engineering students and art students
working together in this kinetic art
context my feeling about my engineering
students at Utah and I don't think it's
unique at Utah is that they're pretty
good problem solvers if you give them a
problem they will find a way to solve it
and they're not such good designers they
don't really think about solving the
problem necessarily in a design sense
they don't think about it as sort of
exploring different ways of designing
things and they don't think about it as
a design problem as much as an
engineering problem to solve and so one
of my core interests in this class other
than having a lot of fun is I think it
brings up the fundamental nature of
design in the process of both
engineering and art and it exposes these
differences between what we think of as
engineering design and what the artists
would think of as creative design and
think they're very closely tied but they
if you don't think about if you've never
been exposed to the other side it's kind
of a mystery how it happens and it's
interesting to think about how those how
those intersect so the way the class
works is we get students both from
engineering and from aren't and we make
them work in these interdisciplinary
teams so that the teams have to have
artists and computer engineers on the
teams but the goal is to build art not
to build engineering projects and I
think that's very important because at
least from my point of view from my
engineering students I think art is a
fairly serious thing but it doesn't feel
serious and so I my feeling is that if
you allow the engineers to play in this
art space a little bit they will
potentially be more willing to try weird
things because it's not a serious
engineering problem a bridge is not
going to fall down an airplane is not
going to crash if they get the problem
wrong so maybe they'll explore a little
more and certainly be exposed to the
creative design process in the artist so
this is a little video that you're
probably not going to see that was
produced by the University of youth on
the only reason I wanted to show this
video it it it shows some of the works
that were in a gallery show that
resulted from some projects from the
class but it also has some of the
students talking about what they got out
of the class and it also has a little
bit of my collaborator Paul stout
talking and since he's not here I
thought this would be a good chance of
you to see Paul so you just have to
imagine what goes on here I could play
it on the Mac you
I think the problem is that it just
doesn't know where the video is in the
video is whoops the videos are on my Mac
in a different directory and we could
spend some time sort of looking for it
but if you're really curious about the
video we can play it at the end okay so
at the risk of making this more of an
art history lecture than a technical
lecture I want to just review a little
bit of kinetic art for people who maybe
haven't explored the types of things
that have gone on in kinetic art so I'm
going to do a short survey this is in no
way comprehensive is just a few little
highlights of kinetic art starting with
the avant-garde in the 1920s some small
steps in the 1950s and then the computer
age these days so now I'm gabos a
sculptor from turn of century through
the through you know the 70s one of the
interesting things about this sculpture
can edit construction standing wave it
was built in the in the 20s or in the
early 20s 1919 to 1920 it's basically
just a metal rod with a weight on it
that vibrates when you turn it on it
vibrates and it has this little wave
property so that it has a node up at the
top and it waves the interesting thing
about this is it's the first sculpture
that was consciously titled kinetic art
so kinetic construction standing wave
when it was when it was introduced was
introduced as kinetic art so this is
sort of the first I mean there were
earlier pieces that were kinetic of
course but this is where that phrase
sort of came from and then Marcel
Duchamp did a number of kinetic things
this is something called the rotary
glass plates precision optics it's
basically two glass plates that twirl in
opposite directions and they make an
interesting pattern when they when they
spin so in the 20s the the the data ists
and the constructivists and the
Surrealists were playing around with
these kinds of kinetic constructions
lÃ¡szlÃ³ moholy-nagy is another sculptor
from that same time period he built a
piece that has one of my favorite titles
of all time the light space modulator
this is basically a set of kitchen
implements that he put together and then
they were motorized so that they turned
and rotated and then he lit them from
various angles with spotlights so that
part of the art was the actual
construction the actual piece and part
of the work was the light and space that
was resulting from the reflections and
things like that here's a nice little
video which won't come up but you could
jump on youtube and and see it if you'd
like from the 20 so it's a little grainy
black-and-white video of what this looks
like when it turned its it's got this
wonderful sort of clanking noise when it
turns because it's got kitchen utensils
and pieces of metal sort of turning
around they are the I don't think the
kinetic construction standing wave still
exists but the rotary plates certainly
do although Duchamp was sort of famous
for making works and then having them
disappear and then recreating them later
on so I've actually seen the precision
optics in the Pompidou Center in Paris
but I don't know if it's the one from
the 1920s or whether Duchamp made
another copy because you know his most
famous work of course is the fountain
which is the urinal that's been signed
by the artist and therefore becomes art
and I don't know if you know about this
but this was a this was so the Duchamp
was a member of this of this this group
of artists doing works in in this
tradition they called da da which
basically stands for nothing and you
know shown in New York in the 30s I
think it was he submitted under an
assumed name our mutt a work of art
which was a ceramic urinal turned on the
side and put on a pedestal signed by our
mutt and Duchamp declared that this was
aren't because he said it was so this
was sort of a turning point in the art
world in terms of what Duchamp called
readymades these were things that you
could go to the store and buy and then
declare that them that they would be art
the actual urinal which he called
fountain by the way what's the name of
the work was long since destroyed but
there are now authorized copies that he
made in the 50's andrey signed and
reauthorized so so i don't know if it's
the right that's a long-winded answer
your question but yes these do exist I
saw the light space modulator I can't
remember where it was I think it might
have been in the Whitney Museum in New
York but it's not in the permanent
collection so I don't know where it
resides permanently Alexander Calder of
course did a lot of kinetic stuff in
terms of mobiles but he also did a lot
more sort of direct kinetic things that
had cranks and motors and things like
that that moved around so it wasn't just
the mobiles that were sort of twisting
in the breeze there were all sorts of
other kinetic constructions John tangley
is a swiss artists who built everything
from little kinetic works to these giant
room filled machines that the turn and
crank and puff smoke and in the terms of
the kinetics one of the famous works
that Tom glee bill was something called
Amash to New York which was a machine
that he built in the courtyard of the
met in New York which was supposed to
self-destruct so he built a
self-destructing machine and he turned
it on it was supposed to destroy itself
as an homage to New York turns out the
original amount in New York didn't
really completely self destruct so he
built a second one later on which
actually had detonators in it that
really did destroy it so it destroyed
itself yeah I mean the point of the ol
mansion New York was that the machine
itself was destroying itself while it
was working this video ah rats I was
hoping it would start some of these
videos must be in the same folder this
is one of congolese meta matic
constructions that he made in the 50s
and 60s this is a machine that when
turned on it's a little hard to see
because it's not moving but there's
actually a pad of paper here and there's
a pen and when it turns on it goes
through these jangling movement and it
makes these weird marks on the paper so
it's sort of a sculpture that's also an
automated drawing machine and you made a
series of these meta mattox which i
think are really
wonderful okay so let's jump ahead to
the computer age I mean the computer age
we tend to see works that are mediated
by electronics they use micro processors
or sometimes discrete electrical
components to control things they use
mechanical actuators instead of cranks
so they'll use motors and relays and
solenoids and speakers and buzzers and
lights and LEDs and all sorts of things
many of the artists from this generation
so Jim Campbell is this san
francisco-based artist born 1956 and a
lot of the artists working in kinetics
from that time period sort of my age
tend to have engineering backgrounds
although Jim Campbell is a full-time
artist he makes his living as an artist
he has shows he has a really nice work
in the Fourier of the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art right now so he's a
big guy he's not a little artist but he
has an undergraduate degree in
electrical engineering from MIT so keep
this generation of electrical artists
were trained as engineers and then
decided to use that training to do
something that they found more
interesting Jim Campbell in particular
is quite interested in low resolution
graphics he's interested in how much
information you can get out of something
that has very little information
inherent in the object and so he builds
these these panels of basically very low
resolution displays made out of LEDs
that you would see in this video if the
video came up so we'll show some videos
later on we can you know come around the
mac and i'll show some of these videos
allen wrath is another guy from that
same time period who also has an
undergraduate degree in engineering from
MIT who builds machines that he's built
a number of these machines that have
little tiny CRT screens with little
eyeballs on them and his you know one of
his interests is this notion of having
the machine looking back at you and the
eyes are such a powerful thing to us
humans you know when we see an eye were
attracted to that I and so he has little
constructions that have these little
eyeballs looking at you and that might
move in response to where you're moving
and they're there they're wonderful
little things
kind of creepy in the video when you see
the little eyes moving dani rosen is an
artist from New York who actually
teaches in the Tisch School of the Arts
at NYU and he's built a number of what
he calls physical mirrors so these are
imaging devices that don't have that
don't produce light they're not LEDs
they're not lcds this is one of his one
of the pieces I like a lot it's um it's
his wooden mirror and what this is is a
mirror made of polished wood slats that
have little servo motors behind them and
it turns out that depending on what
angle you have the wooden slat it either
reflects light a light view of that
wooden slat or a dark view of that
wouldn't slant depending on the angle
there's a little teeny camera right in
the middle doing a little bit of image
processing and then controlling the
angle of each one of these little slats
and when you stand in front of this you
get a very low resolution physical image
of your face because these little slots
are then move to to reflect the light
differently this one is the same idea
except it has chrome balls inside a
little honeycomb that either move out or
forward less reflecting more or less
light to make the pixel light or dark
these mirrors are great not only because
it's sort of an interesting image to see
us off but they also make this wonderful
sound it's like the old it's like the
old train signs and the European train
stations they all did they make that
little sign that sound oh the video is
not there Arthur Ganson builds
mechanical constructions all by hand so
he does not really use computer stuff at
all he he's probably the world's leading
builder of wire gears by hand he's got
these amazing little jigs that make
these little wire gears that interlock
and that makes things move and the video
is not coming up Paul stout is my
collaborator at Utah he's a sculptor in
the art department at the University of
Utah builds constructions that involve
microprocessors and control actuators
sort of scituate
ated within the piece as a part of the
object that you're seeing and so he has
a whole series of these little little
nature displays under glass that have
either some sort of so in this in this
case it's a little flower where the
petals are on a little a little hinged
mount and so at certain times mediated
by the controller the little flower
opens up and then closes again but this
work has sort of a very similar thing
except it's now one step even removed
from the mechanical flower it's actually
just an image of the flower on a little
LCD screen say the whole series of these
sort of nature displays rooted in sort
of turn-of-the-century glass displays
you know you see these things in
Victorian houses they have lots of
little birds under glass and things like
that it's sort of the thing that he's
going for and there's lots of others i'm
not going to go through all of them but
you know jack doll Heusen peter vogel
and tim Hawkinson and meredith Pingree
and there's a whole number of artists
who are who are building stuff out of
electronics in this in this general area
of kinetic art so it's not just a little
backwater there's lots of stuff going on
is the point of all this so what about
the class how do I turn this into a
class well we want we very conspicuously
want students from both art and
engineering and that means we're going
to have students who know something
about art and nothing about programming
we're have students who know something
about programming and nothing about art
and so the curriculum has to have pieces
for both of those demographics and so we
think of the class as sort of basic
reactive programming with embedded
systems something that an artist can
understand at least to the point that
they can write a simple program to
receive sensor data make decisions based
on that sensor data and then cause some
action to happen in terms of the art we
talk about formal elements of sculpture
in terms of aesthetics proportion
balance tension that kind of thing and
also just the the practical matter of
how you put things together especially
things that move it turns out that that
building sculptures is hard
but building sculptures that move and
that are robust and reliable and that
could go in a gallery and be there
unattended for two weeks moving without
breaking down is really tricky so these
are sort of interesting challenges from
for the artists in the class because
they may not have built something that
has this requirement that it has to move
reliably without supervision and not
break down I mean we've all seen this
right we go to these go to like a
science museum and half the exhibits
aren't working that day and its really
frustrating so this is a really
important aspect and then the other
thing that I think is really interesting
and missing somewhat from the
traditional computer science curriculum
is this notion of studio based
instruction now what I mean by studio
based instruction is partially the all
getting together in a studio and
building things and trying things aspect
but it's also partly at the core of the
fine arts studio model is this notion of
peer critiques and so at the formative
stage of your project that you're doing
you have a peer critique where you
present what you're doing and you get
critique from the audience and then
again at the end you have a critique it
sounds like an engineering design review
but it's actually very it's it's subtly
but I think importantly different an
engineering design review you present
your design and you expect the people in
the room to sort of pick it apart and
tell you what's wrong with in an
artistic critique certainly has that
aspect to it but it it is more how
should i say more cooperative there is
an aspect to fine art critique that
involves group dynamics sort of sort of
exploring the ideas that you're
presenting and not just the physical
manifestation so and so an engineering
design review might say you know you
know what you really need to use brass
in that linkage and you really need to
think about whether or not you have you
know you need nylon bushings here
because otherwise it's going to break
down whereas an art fine art critique
would be much more interested in the
ideas behind what you're trying to say
and whether you're communicating things
effectively and whether other things you
could do might help communicate what
you're trying to say about this work
so I think this sort of group consensus
group process of understanding the work
is really important and could and could
find its way into more than just this
kinetic our curriculum it could find its
way into programming classes into
hardware design classes and things like
that so one of things that we feel very
very strongly about is in this kind of
class where you have groups of students
working together who are from very
different backgrounds we have artists we
have engineers we we we fight to keep
people from falling into their roles
right we don't want the engineers to
simply be there to build the artists
idea and it's very easy for that role to
happen and so one of the things that
Paul and I have to do and we teach this
course is we have to sort of keep
talking to the group's constantly to
make sure that everybody is trying
everything because we really want the
artists to try some programming and try
some wiring and we want the the computer
scientists to try coming up with some of
their own ideas and and and in
participating in the concepts not just
the physical building we've done this
three times at Utah we have a gallery
show of the results at the end so it's
it's sort of a validating thing from the
art point of view that this is really
something we can show in a gallery it's
not just a class project some other
classes that have come out of this with
a colleague in fort worth texas i did a
high school workshop in Fort Worth this
is last summer where we got high school
kids and we we focus specifically on
building machines that make drawings so
it was sort of a meta thing we wanted we
wanted the the things that they built to
be interesting constructions interesting
pieces of sculpture in their own right
but we wanted them to as a part of their
artistic function to create marks to
create drawings and see what would
happen with that and I'm on sabbatical
from the University of Utah this year
and I'm spending the fall with the DX
arts program at u-dub which is a very
interesting program I'll say a little
bit more about it later on at u-dub
which is very specifically targeted
towards artists who want to make this
kind of technology mediated work
and so I'm sitting in and helping out
with their mechatronic art class which
is just another name for exactly what my
class is we don't use the term
mechatronic at Utah because the
mechanical engineers already took that
turn so they have something else they
mean in it and then this drawing
machines thing has worked out so
interestingly we think that we've got a
couple of drawing machine workshops
coming up aimed at high school teachers
so we'd like to take this model of
injecting some embedded computing into
art classes not I mean there's always
the robot club at a high school that's
sort of an obvious place to inject
embedded computing but the art club is
not necessarily the place where people
think about computing so we want to
inject some computing into the art
curriculum so we have a workshop coming
up at six see in Denver aimed at high
school teachers and it looks like
there's a good chance we'll do exactly
the same thing at siggraph in Anaheim
that's not completely confirmed yet but
it's looking good that will have a
workshop for these high school teachers
at both 16 siggraph so what we're going
to do in these workshops these are short
I mean they're gonna be three our
workshops so it's sort of a rush to the
finish to see what we can do but one of
the things we discovered from the high
school workshop in fort worth is that
with a little bit of help up front to
get people to the point where they can
read a sensor and cause something to
move and then foam core and masking tape
you can actually build some interesting
stuff it's obviously not going to last
very long but in a three-hour workshop
with foam core masking tape and a couple
motors you can actually do some pretty
interesting things we'll see we haven't
tried it in three hours okay so I talked
a little bit about this studio
instruction model and then there's this
idea of creativity and creativity of
course is one of those things that is
really hard to define you know what is
what is more creative than something
else one definition that I kind of like
for creativity is that enhance create
things that are more creative than
others tend to have more potential
solutions identified before the final
solution is agreed upon I don't know if
you agree with that but that's one way
of thinking about whether the process of
coming from Star
to finish has been creative is how many
things did you look at along the way if
you only saw one it's in some sense less
creative another way of thinking about
creativity actually and a way that I was
thinking about approaching this
sabbatical visit to DX arts is the
potential for creative activity seems to
be somehow directly related to how
nervous you are going into it if you're
more nervous going into a situation then
it's not saying it will be creative but
it's a situation where creativity could
happen in a way that it wouldn't happen
if you were not uncomfortable and I was
pretty uncomfortable coming into this
because you know I'm a computer guy and
I'm coming in I'm coming to visit at top
university in a really top program in
art the computer science department
u-dub doesn't even know I'm here yet
because I haven't made it out of the lab
to go talk to the cs people so it's been
great I've just been totally loving it
but I mentioned this before I think the
computer science and engineering
students should have this freedom to
explore stuff that they've never tried
before because they're just making art
hopefully when they come out of it
they'll think of art as a more serious
thing also but but I think this is a
pretty powerful thing so what is our
hardware infrastructure we've been using
the Arduino platform we have a closet
full of sort of supplies we have
potentiometers and passive infrared
motion sensors we have distance sensors
and vibration sensors things like that
we have lots of actuators we've got LEDs
for output we've got servos you know
hobby servos we've got DC motor stepper
motors stepper motor drivers all this
stuff and so we've got all this stuff
that people can use if you haven't seen
one it's not this big about a credit
card sized the Arduino is an open-source
embedded computing platform it is based
on it's a it's a totally wimpy thing I
mean this thing is so puny and
underpowered in some sense and yet it's
so capable at what it's designed to do
which is read sensor data and cause
something to happen on a human time
scale it's based on the 16 megahertz
8-bit micro so it's a beauty
that's just fine and its twenty bucks it
comes in a lot of varieties so you know
you've got the lily pad which is
designed to be sewn into clothing and
then it's sort of a sort of an arms race
in the Arduino world to build it smaller
and smaller and smaller so we have the
Arduino tiny which is the size of a of a
double-wide 24-pin integrated circuit
and then we have this guy up here which
is I don't even know what the name of it
is but that little circle that sort of
encompasses the electronics is the size
of a quarter so this is about that big
and then we have this guy which has a
little USB port sticking out of it so
you can sort of see how big it is
relative to the USB port so there's an
arms race in terms of small there's also
brand new brand spankin new as of like
two weeks ago a new version of the
Arduino that has an arm core on it so if
you were really held back by an 8-bit 16
megahertz micro you can now have an
arduino compatible board that has a
32-bit 84 megahertz micro i don't know
why it's not 100 it's some weird number
so that's what we've been using now I
don't want to give the impression well
hold on and one side so the interest the
software infrastructure for Arduino is
this integrated develop environment
confusingly also called Arduino that
uses a language that they call Arduino
and so you've got this this constant
confusion over whether you're talking
about the board you're talking about the
language you're talking about the IDE
it's basically C and C++ the back the
the back end of this IDE is just GCC of
course that's good and bad right the
programmers can dive into c++ and the
artists are totally confused because
it's C and C++ but it's got a nice set
of predefined stuff for reading sensors
and driving outputs and so even though
it's see which can be confusing you know
all those darn semicolons the artists
come up pretty quickly for basic stuff
well so I was just about to say I don't
want to give the impression that
Microsoft is not playing in this market
so there is this dotnet gadgeteer
platform from a Microsoft which is
programmed using the.net visual basic
platform it has some advantages it's
based on an arm seven core so it's
already more powerful than quite a bit
more powerful than the basic Arduino I
haven't explored this platform very much
because up until fairly recently the
price difference has been noticeable so
the the basics so called spider board up
in the upper right corner is 120 dollars
instead of 20 and the the peripherals
that you can get for the gadgeteer have
a very impressive very cool set of
peripherals that all plug in to those
predefined headers so one of the
wonderful things about gadgeteer is you
don't have to know anything about wiring
you don't have to have proto boards and
wire kits and things like that but it
makes the peripherals a little more
expensive because they're on separate
breakout boards with separate interfaces
that plug directly into this but it
makes them a little more expensive so I
haven't I haven't really played with
this very much that being said there's a
now at $29 version that has a smaller
board and fewer connections but it's a
lot more affordable so I probably should
plan and it's programmed using this
dotnet micro framework which is based on
the visual studio platform now now we
can argue about whether C and C++ or
visual studio is a nicer way of
introducing program to programming to
people
well my experience with this has been
very very limited but i but i hung out
at the microsoft booth at siggraph
couple years ago where they were showing
this stuff off and okay this is a very
small sample size but the guy who was
demoing I said look this is so great I
can start typing this phrase and then it
fills in exactly what I wanted to say
and so he started typing in this little
piece of programming text and the thing
that he really meant to say was like
that long and yet filled it in but I had
no idea what the ten thousand characters
between what he started typing and what
he really wanted to type were and so
since I haven't sat down and played with
it I don't know what all that stuff is
but I'm very comfortable with this very
simple C syntax so I have this ongoing
argument with a guy at Utah who's into
embedded software in particular embedded
software analysis if he does lots of
things like trying to to prove things
about the runtime stack on embedded
software and things like that and i made
this innocuous comment to him that c is
simple so it's easy to learn and he's
been beating me up about it ever since
because c is so subtle and so not simple
when you start really diving into it and
so I've had to go back to him and say
okay what I meant was simple C is simple
and and yeah anyway we can but but yes
there are other there are other
platforms including this gadget to your
platform which is which is quite a bit
more powerful I just haven't played with
it the other nice thing about Arduino is
this open source and so there's a huge
user community out there in some sense
they've got a head start on gadget here
because of the size of the use of the
open source community that's all playing
with it ok so now I'm just going to show
you some examples that have come out of
the class at Utah this is the postcard
advertising our show for the invisible
logic show from 2009 on the right is a
1919 Underwood typewriter that's been
outfitted with pneumatic actuators and
the idea is that this typewriter wood
wood type ranted well
grand vision was there was going to type
something really interesting what
actually happened is it types sort of
random things because because getting
the actuators to work took all their
time but but this had some wonderful
sort of visual and sound effect things
because these pneumatic actuators make a
great sound and there's a compressor in
the back room powering the whole thing
and especially this this giant don't
have my laser this giant actuator on the
carriage return because that had to be
bigger to actually push the carriage
return back so we'd go to kachunk on the
keys and then go when the when the
carriage return came by this is a piece
that was built as a sort of a they
called it the relic and it it presented
itself to the user as this sort of
triangular wooden construction with two
little triangular pieces off to the side
with little handprints on the triangular
pieces owes it was meant to imply that
you should put your hands on this and
what happened is as a giant light bulb
and some other giri things in the middle
and the interesting thing about this is
when you connected the circuit with your
two hands it would light up but if you
connected the circuit with more than one
person it would get brighter and so the
more people you had in the chain the
brighter it would get up to about six
people in the chain and so once you
discovered this you'd sort of try to
recruit people to come and see what this
relic was doing and you'd all join hands
in this chain and see if you could get
the thing to be brighter these were the
angry flowers these had a little light
sensor in the center and little
servo-controlled petals and they would
just have a very gentle movement while
they were sitting there but if you ever
came and looked at them they would get
agitated and start moving very quickly
and then try and get you to go away so
this is some of the users interacting
with the angry flowers these little
drawing robots were little
radio-controlled cars outfitted with
little whiteboard markers moderately
interesting just as little guys moving
around on the whiteboards but what was
really going on is they were connected
to RSS news feeds which were controlling
what direction they were turning and so
and that was controlled by an Arduino
underneath the
the whiteboard that you couldn't see
what they wanted to try and see is
whether NPR looked different than rush
limbaugh so they're going to try and get
some right-wing talk radio and some
liberal radio and use the RSS news feeds
and and and have these two cars with
different colors and see if they look
different turns out they don't actually
look all that different so but it was a
really interesting idea and maybe they
just you know maybe there are other ways
of interpreting that data that can
expose the differences between the the
difference news feeds but this is a more
recent show this one was called
intersect EO which we thought was it
with our limited Latin we think is Latin
for intersection by the course if
someone really speaks Latin they can
probably tell us we didn't conjugate it
properly it also caused lots of people
to tell us that we misspelled things on
our posters so this is a view of the
gallery these are all videos this sum is
a large bicycle chain made of lucite the
user would come and move the chain and
as you move the chain different things
would show up on this message board this
is a what they call the shy picture it
turns out a lot of the students really
get interested in this idea of denial of
experience as part of the artwork and so
the idea of this is that you have this
supposedly interesting thing that you
want to go look at I think they could
have done a better job with interesting
but as you get closer there's a little
distance sensor here and as you get
close enough to actually see it it folds
over so it hides and so you can't
actually ever get close enough to this
to see what's going on this was a box
that had has a rotating set of leaves
it's it's a fairly subtle thing but
surprisingly effective it just at
various intervals it looks like the
leaves are falling within the lit box oh
this you got to see this one we got it
we got to get these videos on this is
just this is just a little eyeball it's
in so it's in a little leather
construction and it's actually a
taxidermy eyeball so it looks really
real and when you get close to it when
you move your hand up to it the eyeball
tracks your hand and moves
with your hand and so it's kind of
freaks people out when they move close
to no no this is just a little there's a
little light sensor right here and
there's little servo back there and as
you as you sort of gesture to it you
shade that little light sensor and it
causes the servo to move it's actually a
very simple mechanism servos hiding
behind you so all you see when you sort
of wave at it is the little eyeball
perks up and watches you oh you got to
see this so this is this is a piece it's
really hard to tell what's going on this
is actually hanging up in the ceiling we
had one of the assignments was to have
the student groups address the theme of
communication in their artwork and so
this is just a little black plexi box 20
feet up in the ceiling and every once in
a while a little arm would come out
holding a piece of paper and just drop
the piece of paper from the ceiling and
so it's sort of float down this
wonderful floaty thing and then you'd
have this pile of paper on the floor
that was the result of this thing
dropping this blank sheet of paper but
it really it was fun to watch so look at
the videos yeah so it basically doesn't
drop stuff until it notices that people
are underneath this it this little white
dab right there is a passive infrared
sensor so it's like you'd have in a
security system and so it basically
conserves its paper by not dropping
stuff if people aren't in the gallery
when it sees some movement it decides to
drop paper and so what's inside there
actually is a scavenged paper drive
mechanism from an old printer combined
with a servo and another servo for the
gripper arm and so the printer the
scavenge piece of the printer is told to
eject a piece of paper that the arm
grabs it and then the other server turns
it and then drops so these are some of
the comments from students in the class
yes I have picked out sort of the better
of the comments I'll tell you some of
the some of the concerns the students
had but at least some of the students
may
can comments I think got what we were
trying to do in terms of understanding
the other the other group the artists
understood a little bit more about
engineering the engineers learned a
little about aren't if nothing else the
engineers learned where the art building
on campus was and the artist learned
where the engineering building on campus
ones this sounds ridiculous but I had to
draw map the first day because the art
building is as far away from engineering
as you can get so engineering Michael
actually knows the Utah campus
engineering is on the far north end of
campus and art is on the far south end
by the stadium we spent half our time in
engineering and half our time in art and
and one at one or two of the negative
comments that I didn't show were pick a
building I'm sick of walking across
campus well the the problem with finding
open grant with finding sort of a
neutral site in the middle is that we
want the facilities that go with either
the art lab or the computer lab right so
the next time we taught the course the
first time we talked the course we tried
to sort of do half and half and the next
time we said you know what we're going
to do some programming upfront in the
engineering building where we're all
going to sit at computers and then the
rest of the semester we're going to be
in the art building we're going to be in
the sculpture lab because there's just
so much physical construction and they
have the wood shop in the metal shop and
the tools and all that stuff and so we
spent more time in the sculpture lab the
second second time we did the cause
this is a one semester course so it's
one semester is yeah basically four
months the the course that I'm
participating in at u-dub index arts
program is a three-quarter sequence so
it's a whole year long which would be
great I mean I can I'm basically
teaching this course as a voluntary
overload I'm not really getting teaching
credit for teaching this course which
was another discussion we can have but
that means that I'm happy to do it one
semester I don't even though I would
love to teach it for the whole year
that's a lot of extra teaching show just
a couple pictures from the Trinity
Valley High School workshop so these are
the high school kids working in the art
lab so we basically just sort of because
it's how it turned out the room that we
had available in july at this high
school in Fort Worth was the art room so
we were in the art room building
computer stuff this particular group of
students doesn't really show off what I
think is the potential to attract a more
diverse set of students because of the
art hook so this is another one of my
one of my sort of evangelistic points is
that I think that by having a grounding
in art a focus on art that we can
attract a more diverse set of students
than just these guys now that being said
at Trinity Valley we got all guys but
it's the first time we've ever tried it
and it was basically the people who who
my collaborator and Fort Worth knew
about to sort of tell them they should
come do this class this is a little
video of andre's drawing machine so this
shows off sort of what you can do with
masking tape and foam core this is a
machine that has basically three hobby
servos one in the middle and one on each
arm and the three servo sort of move and
make little little designs on the paper
very first time this kid had ever
written any program at all and very
first time he'd ever built something
that had electronics behind it he it was
it was just great to see because when he
got his machine working i said okay
great Andre now make an addition make
some works with this and he just jumped
on it he made all these drawings with
different colors and with different you
know orientations of things and he spent
like 20 minutes figuring out where they
should go in the display you know this
one should no no this one should go over
here no I think this one looks better
over here so he really got into it was
just it was just wonderful a group of
three of the older kids in the class you
basically turned it into a robot you
know they they they understood the art
aspect but they really wanted to build a
robot so they built a little drawing
robot that walks around in this box and
makes drawings and then Kenneth he'll
come back
Kenneth decide to get messy and he said
you know I don't want to mess with these
markers I want paint and so he he got
paint brushes involved with his and he
was adding paint to the to the paint
brushes to make his giant work of art
I'll finish up with just a few slides
you know we start a little late and I
don't wanna go too late but I want to
tell you a little bit about this DX arts
program because it is right next door
you done and the instructor James coupe
and the TA Robert to me are the guys who
are involved in this particular class
the X arts at u-dub is a center for
digital arts and experimental media it
is a an independent center that has its
own faculty in its own budget and its
own graduate students but it's not a
department so I believe that all the
faculty members involved have primary
appointments in some official academic
department but it's really it's it's own
Center it has its own chair its own
classes and things like that but I think
it has an amazing amazingly interesting
mission statement to support the
emergence of a new generation of hybrid
artists the other interesting thing
about DXM Ahrendts is that they give the
PhD instead of the MFA now this doesn't
sound like huge stuff but if you're in
the art world forever and ever and ever
the terminal degree in the art world in
the studio art world not some art
history is a whole different thing but
in the studio art room the terminal
degree is the MFA the master of fine
arts and depending on where you go your
MFA is either a two-year or a three-year
program for the MFA and then you go out
and become a working artist there's this
new wave of schools partly I think the
initiation of this was in Europe giving
a PhD in studio art and so there's this
ongoing raging discussion in the art
world of what does it mean to give a PhD
a research degree in studio art what
does that mean what does it mean to do
creative research in studio practice and
what the X arts people say is that the
PhD is this research oriented program of
study requiring substantial commitment
to doing
made of research not just studio
practice and so they write a
dissertation about their PhD project
that presumably I haven't seen one of
these different ation defenses yet but
presumably involves a more reflective
and more research oriented approach to
their studio practice than just
producing work and having a show this is
i would say still quite controversial in
the art world if you come to interview
at an art school and say you have a PhD
in studio art you're going to get
scrutinized by the people who are
interviewing you saying okay do you
think you're better than us kind of
thing but i think it's a very
interesting idea and very good question
i assume it came from the administration
but i don't know the inner workings of
where they get their funding the the
course sequence that i'm sitting in on
at least for the fall is this
mechatronic art sequence and the idea
the mechatronic art sequence is a
systems-based approach to design and
fabrication of functional experimental
art devices so this systems-based
approach is a very important phrase for
this kind of kinetic art stuff systems
art is a general term that impact that
it relates to art that is based on it
sounds ridiculous based on a system so
there's some underlying system that
underlies the artwork that maybe concept
it may be something that is driving the
artwork but it's more than just a pretty
painting it's something that it may be
it may be completely conceptual in
nature there may actually not even be a
physical artifact there are ways of
thinking about systems art that maybe
don't even involve an artifact that just
involve thinking about the system so you
sort have to turn your head around if
you want to think about this systems
approach but in this context they're
talking about the system's approach but
also producing physical experimental art
artifacts based on engineering topics
this is also I think quite important
they think this class is appropriate for
advanced students from DX arts art music
dance
and any other relevant disciplines so
they're hoping that this is very
interdisciplinary so this quarter in the
X arts 471 we have a couple of DX arts
students we have a photography student
we have a student from the museum
curating program and we have an EE
student and we have a mechanical
engineering student and we have someone
else on forgetting from another
different program so it's it's it's
already kind of a natural mix of people
who are interested but from a variety of
disciplines which i think is quite
interesting the quarter is young and
this is you know the quarters III love
quarters the University of Utah has
switched two semesters and I can't
really stand it but but quarters are
quick once you start a quarter you know
boom you're in the middle of it already
their first project in DX arts 471 was
supposed to be somehow site-specific so
the idea of the project was to come up
with something relate pick a site and
make something specific to that site
somehow relating to the site in which
that art was placed this is a piece by
Jared Danielson he basically repurposed
a record player and on the spindle of
the record player is a distance sensor
so it's returning the nearest thing that
it sees and then as the platter turns
the pen in place of the needle is
essentially making a map of the site in
which it's placed by returning what it
sees from that angle and what you see on
this is you'll see some dark lines that
represent sort of the physical space of
the room and then some blips that
represent the people who happen to be
around it at that point in time so I
actually really like this piece because
I'm quite taken by works that that have
emergent properties where you have some
simple motion that over time some larger
connection emerges some larger more
interesting pattern emerges from these
small seemingly unrelated things the
photographer built a camera so the
photographer build a little pinhole
camera that uses Polaroid I didn't
realize you could still buy Polaroid
film but it turns out i guess fuji still
makes it they couldn't sell it in the US
as
polaroid still exists but now that
Polaroids gone Fuji can sell their
instant film in the US who knew so this
camera was something that he cited in
his own studio facing his chair and the
idea is whenever he would sit down in
the chair and be still that the camera
would take a picture of him and I
pinhole camera takes you know 30 seconds
for an exposure and then a little light
at the top would go off when there was a
new picture to come and see and so this
camera would sort of record his actions
in his studio unfortunately I don't have
a they're kind of cool pictures but I
don't have a picture of the picture this
denial of experience is apparently a
strong idea so this student built a
connection between you know the language
processing from MIT world's worst name
for a computer language if you try and
google processing it's just too generic
a verb you just get all it's horrible
it's a great language is based on Java
but it's just it's just the wrong name
for a language but she has this
connection between an Arduino which is
doing some distance sensing so you can
tell which sensors they got first right
they got the distance sensor first so
people started using that and the
processing program basically draws these
sort of little random drawings and it
hums to itself lusting and if you get
too close it starts flashing don't look
don't look and makes the drawing fade
into the background so again as you get
closer to look at it it sort of denies
you the experience of seeing it oh then
we have George George wanted to build a
site specific piece under the aurora
bridge in Fremont and the idea was that
this box would be under the bridge would
have these buttons on it and when you
press the buttons and got your head
close to the box there's a little retro
cassette walkman in here that would play
some some tape that had that had some
content about suicides that have
happened on the aurora bridge and so you
would you would sort of be hugging this
box to press the buttons and you'd hear
this soft text playing about about this
very serious topic under the aurora
bridge
so he cited it under the bridge and then
our lab is actually in fremont it's not
on the uws and so he said okay we have
to go out and see mine because it's not
cited in the lab it's cited under the
bridge and so we all walk down to the
bridge and it's you know three four
blocks away and we got there and it was
all roped off and the police are
standing there saying uh bridge is
closed go around go around and George
said it's not because of a box with
buttons on it is in so turns out the
bomb squad was there already they had
two robots sniffing it they were about
30 seconds away from detonating it
because there was this anonymous box
with buttons placed under the bridge and
nobody knew whose it was so we sort of
all decided that this was a success in
some weird way but they shut down the
bridge they had the robots out they had
the bomb squad as far as we know george
hasn't actually been cited with anything
but they were still trying to decide if
there's anything this was just a weaker
week ago it was on the news it was on
kiro 7 i think is where we got this
picture yeah so I mean what could go
wrong a cardboard box with buttons and a
red box full of electronics under a
bridge yeah okay so so that's it so so I
think I mean in my mind I think this
embedded systems and kinetic art is
really interesting collaboration I'm
quite interested in how technology and
arts find a way to work together you
know at Utah we have a brand-new very
popular program that is supposed to be
all about collaboration which is really
all about video games and I think video
games are great they're really
interesting but I don't consider it fine
art and I think there's there's a
there's a conversation that can happen
in a broader sense of fine arts and
technology that I think is very
interesting I think this design thinking
notion is a natural complement to
computational thinking you know
computational thinking is this great
wonderful way of introducing
computational aspects to too
people who haven't explored it before
but I think design thinking is just as
fundamental to computational thing as
computational thinking I think the
studio instruction model is quite
interesting this idea of these group
critiques this sort of lab where
everyone gets together and works
together on things I tend in my even in
my hardware courses to be a sort of
lecture guy you know I'm trying to break
out of it but you know I lecture then
they go off and work but I think maybe
more of a more of a short introduction
followed by hands-on in the class is a
very interesting model so there you go
that's that's my that's my am I by pitch
for this kind of arts and engineering
stuff so thanks Paul for sticking around
if you know wants to see the videos we
can you know get them up on that so I
mean doing reading group let's say our
division instruments and also talk to
researchers and for interactive medium
so one thing they are interested is how
do you quantify so in my computer
science you have okay this is a
precision it's done number you can
compare but on the other hand how do you
quantify how do you define this is fun
this is good so I cost yeah I constantly
actually heard people just from maybe
the Technic technology side they say how
do you quantify how do you define how do
you quantify the artistic result you
mean yeah the computer art or something
yeah this is what is a very interesting
question it's it's you know when I first
started hanging out in the art
department it was it was a it was
something that I had to wrap my head
around this idea that when the
instructor gives grades and feedback to
the artists they don't just say
eighty-seven percent and ninety-two
percent you did great it's it's a very
organic very subjective very non
quantified way of evaluating things
and in the arts this even this notion
that you could quantify a piece of art
is just outside of their experience so
dust doesn't even come up a guy that
teaches the basic sculpture class that
involves welding gets a lot of
mechanical engineering students who want
to come over and sort of get better at
their welding and he says it drives him
absolutely this instructor e they drive
him absolutely nuts because he gives an
assignment and they come back and they
bring to his I this really crappy piece
of sculpture and they can't understand
why they didn't get an A and they say
look I fulfilled all of the requirements
it's made of metal it's got 17 different
welds on it it's got square corners and
acute angles and it's welded all of the
requirements were met how can I not get
an A and he says well because it's not
interesting because your ideas because
your concept because the way you built
it did not result in something that that
that we find interesting as a piece of
art so it's unquantifiable I don't know
how to I don't know how to start except
that the art world does this right they
have these design critiques where people
get in a room and they somehow come to a
consensus about whether you've succeeded
or not succeeded in making this piece of
art interesting so I don't know I can
certainly tell you how to quantify
whether it's fun because you know i can
tell you i had fun or I didn't have fun
but but whether it's a good piece of art
oh man that's a hard problem
today it's funny to have a microwave not
actually amplifying anything yeah I know
I was wondering about the experience in
this cross-disciplinary work with
students I run number of experiments
with both our students and union
students over the last decade and those
experiments were not actually very
successful from some point of view for
example I try to make our students and
your instance what together and they
kind of fall naturally into these roles
of the artist of being the clients of
the engineers so they they can it they
delegated the artistic decisions or
rationale write anything okay you want
this to work this okay I want to do it
right and that kind of happens all the
time so I try to separate them and have
like only artists students and
organizations and then they kind of work
in parallel universes without I never I
mean I've been trying to do this for 10
years already well I don't have any
magic bullet for that I mean I think
you're absolutely right it's hard
because it's very natural to fall into
these roles one of the things that we
did in the last iteration of the course
is that we required all of the students
to keep sketchbooks of their artistic
progress and we spent an entire lecture
on what is a sketchbook so that the art
so that the engineering students would
understand that it's not an engineering
notebook it's really a sketchbook it's
really a way of recording ideas it's a
way of just recording random
observations that may at some point
become useful and scribbling and doing
graphics and doing doodles and it's not
an engineering thing that you date every
day so that you can prove things for
patents it was a little bit successful
because it sort of forced the engineers
to think like artists in at least the
ten minutes a day they were drawing in
the sketchbook but but honestly there
were two things in we found two things
in this last one is that we had to sort
of meet with the team's regularly every
week to try and keep pushing on the
artists to build stuff and program and
keep pushing on the engineer
to contribute to the art and the other
thing that I found very interesting
which is slightly off topic but sort of
similar is that engineers understand how
to work in teams because they do it from
freshmen on they're all working in teams
and they're told that they're going to
work in teams for the rest of their life
so they sort of either become a team
player or not artists have no concept of
working in teams the idea of a
collaborative work of art even between
two artists is unusual enough that there
was actually a special issue of art news
just a couple months ago maybe is a
little longer than that six months ago
devoted to this novel idea of artistic
collaboration and so this this idea that
you can work in a team and still claim
ownership artistic ownership of this
piece was it was a sort of either a
revelation or something that they didn't
understand for the art sign so at the
same time if we were trying to get both
sides to experience being in the shoes
of the other and not falling into those
roles we also have this unanticipated
challenge of just getting the artists to
understand working in a team at all you
know for example one of the things that
I found very interesting is some of the
works in that gallery show i thought
we're really really interesting some
were sort of pedestrian but some are
really interesting but the artist didn't
feel enough personal connection with
them to actually show them as their
works anywhere else because they didn't
you know it was a collaborative piece it
wasn't there it wasn't their own
singular piece and so that's another
interesting challenge related to that
but no I don't have any silver bullets
for that other than just you know keep
on them and keep out of second slowest
and Adi when you wish talking about
community card you shown some pieces
that how they're connected likelike
Peter file works which is nothing moves
at all ah but it makes sound yeah so
that's kinetic or to my deposition
pretty much in need a keyboard my yeah I
guess my definition of my personal
feeling about kinetic art is that
strictly speaking kinetic would imply
movement and I'm willing to take a
slightly broader view of that
the I would like to call it computer on
but that's a whole different thing and I
don't want to go there but it really is
sort of computer-mediated part and so
the peter vogel peace with the circuit
and the speaker's was interactive with
the audience it was it was powered it
was sort of intentionally powered to
produce something and in this case it
was sound instead of movement so yes you
know you know very strict sense i guess
it wasn't kinetic because it didn't move
although if you really want to get
technical the voice coils we're moving
but Nellie would but but yeah I sort of
I sort of take these these well Jim
Campbell's another another good example
nothing really moves but you have a
moving image on this low resolution
screen but maybe we need to come up with
a better name because what I'm thinking
of is not necessarily only things that
move but things that involve either this
interactive component or that involve
some movement or even implied movement
like the movement on the screen for a
Campbell please so maybe there needs to
be another name besides kinetic art
maybe it's sort of transductive art or
something that's the oh I was in the
room
okay Dave did you have a question though
you were</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
