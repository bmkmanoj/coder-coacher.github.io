we're very fortunate to have Paul Dora
she's been with us all semester and will
be with us for another something
wonderful like that he's normally at
home in the Department of Informatics at
UC Irvine and he'll be talking to us
about a chapter from a forthcoming book
about the ways that software structures
experience it's gross statement of it
all right thank you yeah so it's really
it's it's some really nice to be able to
have this opportunity to talk so I've
been here for a couple of months at this
point his mentee said this is the I'm
doing my sabbatical in different places
this your legs and different sports and
so this is the last leg of my sabbatical
sometime about July first I have to go
home just a little moment of silence as
I think about that
um and most of what I've been doing
during that time is working on a book
manuscript and that has been a sort of
project has been brewing for a couple of
years and so what I want to do in the
talk today is give you a little bit of
an overview of what that project is and
then use one particular example from it
which is one of the one of the chapters
that focuses particularly on
spreadsheets to try to exemplify what
I'm what I'm doing in that and doing in
that work and the umbrella term that
I've been using for that work is the
materiality of information that's not
the title of the book but it is the
topic and so I feel I need to say a
little bit about what the materiality of
information might be because after all
the sort of that if there is if there
are two things that unify are sort of
like conception and discourse or about
sort of contemporary digital experience
the first thing is that it's blue
anytime you do any search for any of
these kinds of slides especially like
big data slides and I said it's all blue
not quite sure why well you know yeah I
said I didn't question of maybe maybe
that's in terms of future we haven't
gotten to yet that's a possibility as
well but it's very good but the second
thing is that it's immaterial right that
sort of funding
motion I've had the digital is all this
virtual immaterial stuff that we are
freed from the bones of the material
world in terms of how information can
move how objects can move we all know
that in a certain sense of course that's
not true a if I'm a software and digital
stuff we're entirely immaterial I would
be able to put as much of it on my phone
as I want to no that's simply not true
but the question is in what other kinds
of ways does the potential materiality
or the materiality of information affect
and shape what we do and how we
experience the digital world so that's
the reason that I've sort of been
interested in this topic of the
materiality of information but if you
sort of simply have that as an umbrella
there's a lot of different kinds of
things that that can mean and ways into
it we could look towards anthropology
material culture to gain a sort of
understanding of how it is that material
objects carry value for us they allow us
to enact social relations they have
meaning for us in the things that we can
do with them and in the ways in which
they express solidarity or position
ritual practices so forth they they mean
things to us you could look towards
geography say and think about the ways
in which information is spread out in
the world and not again uniformly but
there's information in certain places
and you could argue you know in the
early 21st century your proximity to
fiber optic cables is as important as
your proximity to the freeway system was
in the 20th century or the railway
system in the 19th I love this
photograph by the way I should always
acknowledge it's taken by Genevieve fell
somewhere in South Australia there are
many things to say about this photograph
it's unclear there's an informational
sign or a warning sign I always point
out to people be crazy swarthy tire
tracks on the other side of the road at
some has like no internet so again sort
of like thinking about that but that's
sort of like thinking about information
infrastructures we could think about the
kind of resource material resources and
other kinds of resources human
organizational economic that need to be
mustered and man
in order to produce digital experiences
that be another way to think about sort
of materiality x' or you could think
about the ways in which the material
shaping of information technology
produces certain kinds of clusters and
concentrations of power and control this
building one Wilshire in downtown Los
Angeles is one of the largest internet
packet exchanges in the United States
and of therefore in the world
thirty-five stories of server form and
and and network interconnects um I
actually like no there's almost no
people in this building and of the small
number of people who work in this
building several of them work for the
National Security Administration but but
but you know otherwise otherwise it okay
it's all computers and computers and
network switches I run through all these
because these are not what I'm going to
talk about when I want to talk about the
materiality of information instead my my
starting point is is a quote from Donald
shirin who was here at MIT who talks
about design as our reflexive
conversation with materials and one of
the questions you might want to ask then
if you believe that what we do with
digital stuff is design is to think
about what are the materials with which
we are having a reflexive conversation
when we design in the digital realm or
indeed what are the materials with which
we're having a reflexive conversation
when we as users engage with the digital
what is it that speaks back to us when
you take Shone's quote the sort of
notion of reflexive conversation what it
produces I think or what it evokes is
this iconic picture of I don't know
something like this the Potter with the
clay on the wheel attempting to produce
through their direct engagement with
materials some kind of amalgam of what
the materials will allow and what the
artistic vision supports so you want to
do something
and you sort of you push on the world
the world pushes back you discover
through the ways you push on the world
and it pushes back what it will accept
what it will do what his possibilities
are that's the notion of material and
material engagement I want to think
about in the digital I think the
programmers software designers and
indeed most of us have you as as users
of digital material digital systems have
an understanding that the work that
those digital systems push back on us
some things are easy some things are
hard some things fit naturally within
the structures the company that the
computer system will the programming
language or whatever it is offers other
things do not we need to sort of have a
conversation we need to push things
around in order to try to find what the
natural fit is between our conception
and the possibilities of the digital and
that's the sense in which I want to sort
of explore a question of the materiality
of information um people who study in
HCI in cognitive science are very
familiar with a whole series of examples
of doing these things not necessarily in
the domain of the digital one of course
is our experience with sort of into
Arabic numeral systems in comparison to
alternatives right it's very easy for me
to do a multiple complicated
multiplication using in the Arabic
numerals we teach small children to do
it after all because we have a
positional system we have structures
that allow us to reduce problems to
procedures there and therefore to be
able to carry out arithmetic operations
but when it comes to trying to do them
in non into Arabic systems and other
kinds of systems we discover that our
procedures no longer work the material
form of the representation itself shapes
what it is that we can do we can act how
we can act what we can do how easily we
can do it and so forth so
representational systems come with their
own material properties they are
repurposing in different ways they can
be broken down into different kinds of
pieces and reassembled some work has
gone on particularly in the area sort of
the psychology of programming languages
examining some of this with respect not
to mathematical notations but to
computational notations so people like
thomas green and alan blackwell
maryanne Petri have have written about
what they call the cognitive dimensions
of programming notations studying this
particularly in the content of how
people learn to program have they
learned to build systems and arguing
that the particular kinds of
representational systems at work when we
build computer systems that is
programming languages in their case are
produce by didn't of their their
representational properties different
kinds of errors in programs things that
are conceptually simple for us to talk
about adding a parameter to method call
or you know reorganizing that on the
layout of a data structure turn
themselves in different programming
languages into more or less complicated
tasks depending on the programming
language some languages allow things to
be expressed in any order some don't
some mean some require that a particular
operation will touch many different
lines of a programming of a program
whereas others will touch only one some
require particular forms of consistency
through the program and so forth and so
they actually start to try to tease out
the different kinds of properties the
notations have as things that we have to
sit in an editor and manipulate and
that's the sense in which I want to try
and think about these things as material
their material in the in the ways in
which the the concepts that we have in
our head have to be realized through an
engagement with the stuff that's on
that's on the screen so that's sort of a
broad focus that the bookwork is taking
and how it is I'm sort of
conceptualizing with this as as the
materiality of information but I want to
talk about to give it a little more meat
today perhaps um is one particular case
study that that gets developed in that
book and there's a case study that comes
from some ethnographic fieldwork that I
and colleagues were engaged in a couple
of years ago those of you here at MSR
have heard my whiteboard talk a few
weeks ago heard me mention this but we
did some research at NASA studying the
Cassini project which is
a spacecraft that's been flying since
2004 or it's been flying for longer than
that but since 2004 it has been flying
around Saturn the Saturn system and has
been extended several times so that it's
still there and next year next year the
plan is they will do the death spiral
into the planet because they're running
out of fuel but for most of so you know
you talk about like flying spacecraft
it's pretty cool but most of the time
people are it looks more like this it
looks less than the bridge of the
Starship Enterprise and more like this
and in particular what we noticed
multiple times during our fieldwork were
meetings that were constructed
specifically like this with a whole
bunch of people sitting around a room
facing a screen with like you know
something projected on it not entirely
unlike what we're doing today except
that what was projected on the screen
were not PowerPoint slides as usual but
spreadsheets and so people were using
spreadsheets as this organizational tool
within their meetings the spreadsheet
was the focus of attention the
spreadsheet was the thing that was
driving how the meeting was organized
not a standard a standard
slide presentation um now this is kind
of it was intriguing to us because you
know if you think about the structure of
that meeting you know people will face
in the screen the projector the computer
and the rest of it there are a bunch of
studies of those but they tend to be
studies of PowerPoint
they tend to be studies of people
standing in front of the room hard
blabbing to slides um last time I give
this talk somebody took a picture of me
as I had this slide up and I was
standing in their open pose actually
it's not quite the same way I think
opposite pose and so I think I should
have looked out that one but it gets us
a little too metal um so this PowerPoint
presentations and the structure of part
my presentations and how PowerPoint
structures interaction has been a topic
for a number of scholars including folk
um here in Cambridge so have on Darla's
Kowski and joanne yates published some
of the first work on the genres of
organizational communication that are
enabled
um or shaped by PowerPoint what
organizational communication looks like
when it's all presented in the form of
PowerPoint
not necessarily by the way powerpoint
documents that are ever actually
presented there's at least one large
organization I've worked with where
almost all internal communication takes
the form of a PowerPoint deck including
your perennial performance appraisal um
you know project reports and the rest of
it all take the form of PowerPoint so
it's not just necessarily then it's at
the front of the screen and and one of
one of under students Sarah Kaplan study
sort of the entwining of PowerPoint with
um with organizational strategy
processes and how it is the PowerPoint X
circulates and they there's the
granularity of objects and information a
PowerPoint that becomes the granularity
of which one can speak about
organizational strategy which when you
think about it is just a frightening
thing and then her Huber Knobloch has
got done a really interesting set of
sort of methodological studies of how it
of of what he calls PowerPoint events so
this is no it doesn't care about
PowerPoint itself and he doesn't care so
much about the slide when he cares about
is the event instead of people facing in
this direction a person standing at the
front of the room pointing at things
trying to like you know look at his
computer as well all that like how do
those things work how does the room have
to be organized and with consequences
however the slides organized how does
the diction and of the flow of discourse
depend upon you know bullet points and
things like this there's been a lot of
studies of PowerPoint but very few of of
as it turns out of spreadsheets those
that there have been of spreadsheets for
roughly into two categories um the most
common our studies of a spreadsheet
error and it's actually been a great
body of work going back for 30 years
on the kinds of errors people make in
spreadsheets
um these are studies that for a long
time were sort of relatively obscure and
nobody paid any attention to but you
know sometimes they they hit the front
pages of newspaper some of you might
have seen that debates that have been
going on and about whether it is that
austerity policies are justified by a I
cannot an academic paper which has a
spreadsheet bug in it that actually
missed a whole bunch of the data on
which the calculations were being done
and that actually showed that Astarte
policies had no effect at all
it's a debate the other set of studies
have been on not so much on the errors
that people make in spreadsheets but on
the ways spreadsheets work in
organizations as sort of a store of
memory I'm gonna come back to this a bit
a little bit later but the idea is you
know
spreadsheets document information
gathering and decision-making in
organizations in ways that we might for
instance want to go back to and revisit
it become an organizational memory but
they also may be an organizational
memory of how we did something so that
when we come to do it next time we go
back you know next time we're doing you
know making our decisions about what
summer interns we're going to admit or
next time we decide in my department
what graduate students were going to
make we kind of go back to last year's
spreadsheets to remind ourselves of the
structure clear out the spreadsheet and
start again
um so you know so that's the sort of the
second class of studies um but not so
many that look at what we were
discovering in in the work at NASA which
are what we're calling spreadsheet
events that is the sort of the occasions
of people coming together and again you
know and I just gave you some examples
these are things that we're all familiar
with you don't have to be flying a
spacecraft around around Saturn in order
to be familiar with the spreadsheet
event we live in them all the time there
are program committee meetings there
yeah general hiring okay hiring events
and so forth in this particular case
they were um in this particular case
there are a variety of group of moments
when a set of people is coming together
often to make fairly contentious
decisions the the starting point for us
was on this particular case where they
were running out of fuel and so they had
to make a series of decisions about what
site which of the science projects they
had to plan to do on a particular part
of I don't know the spacecraft was
passing by Enceladus or something so
when their next pass of Enceladus what
things they were going to do and not
everybody who's going to be able to get
there Arthur science into the mission
and so they came to go
in order to try to decide which parts of
what had been planned were still
possible under these more restrictive
circumstances amenadiel was meant to be
that all the spreadsheet cells would be
colored by the end of the meeting either
red for no and green for go on and they
discussed the first one and they can't
quite come to a decision so they decided
to color it sort of yellow and then they
get to the next one and the next one
well we still can't quite make a
decision but that it's less likely than
the last one so maybe we'll make it
Orange
um and they end up the meeting with
absolutely nothing is red and absolutely
nothing is green but everything is some
like bizarre indeterminate muddy shade
somewhere somewhere in between and and
we just became fascinated by how it was
that what Excel was able to do in terms
of for instance repeating colors which
is an interesting sort of part of the
process allowed to them to come up with
a logic that described what they what
they did particularly missing because of
course you can't actually sort by color
and Excel you can group things by color
we can't sort there was no way to say
these are better CI nude yeah you can
group but you can't be you can't sort um
that's why I said it very very carefully
for this crime
this audience so so let me I want to
talk about this and that question of
sort of colors for instance and the
kinds of things that can be done which
watch sort of cued us towards this
notion of thinking about in terms of
material constraints mature forms and
constraints that those forums offer and
that's what I want to try and talk about
and I want to talk about it in terms of
sort of three two or three was
originally to than and I added something
but I want to talk in terms of three
broad headings two of which are
structural which is not that's why it
doesn't the two sort of structural
things are sort of the grid in the
formula and then I want to talk about
trajectories so the idea of course the
grid and formula is being central to the
form and spreadsheets goes back to you
know the origin story of spreadsheets
that's the sort of essence behind
Brooklyn and Frankston sort of invention
which wasn't really an invention but
rather was a way to appropriate what it
was that Frankston had been learning at
Harvard Business School and to create
a structure whereby on the computer he
could do what it was that he saw his
accounting professors do in the center
of that was to be able to have a grid
that across which and within which data
would be represented and the important
thing about the grid is the grid is you
know unavoidable within the spreadsheet
a spreadsheet never begins blank it
always begins empty and I think that's
not actually an important distinction a
spreadsheet is something that you fill
up but the structure the idea that you
fill it up in a way that is organized in
a 2-dimensional grid is already given to
you there have been spreadsheets that
don't operate purely in this manner or
they sort of break things up a little
more and obviously there's you know
there's workbooks in the rest of it in
various other ways that you can go
beyond a simple grid but the grid is
fundamental and the grid is unavoidable
and what the grid does of course is that
it also requires one to commit to a
particular kind of granularity the grid
is not refactor able once you commit to
what a cell is going to be and then fill
out the rest of the cells in accordance
it's very hard for you to come back and
say oh that one thing I put in that cell
I want to make that be three cells now
or those four things that I put in
different kinds of places they should be
collapsed together one can manipulate
the grid in all sorts of ways one can
manipulate it you know in terms of rows
and columns with an add to lead reorder
the rest of it one generally can't
operate in terms of blocks although
again it kind of depends on the
particular feature that you want to try
and use but refactoring is is sort of is
not available to you and this turns out
in for instance the meetings that we
were looking at to be important it means
that once them things in the spreadsheet
and the spreadsheet is the thing that
drives the meeting there is no
opportunity if one wants to actually
have a successful meeting which by and
large people are committed to especially
when you've got a spacecraft flying
around at tens of thousands of there's
no opportunity for you to say let's do
this a different way you're already
committed to the structure that's there
we were already committed so that
granularity produces just by itself our
commitment to stability within the
within the process that we might sort of
think about that as well when we think
about those questions of how it is that
we go back to spreadsheets and reuse
them the other thing that the spread the
grid does within the context of these
kinds of meeting is that it produces a
structure of anticipation it shows us
what is going to happen
hey we proceeded by and large from top
to bottom or we proceeded downwards and
then upwards and then downwards again or
we proceeded from left to right repents
around but nonetheless what the
structure allows people to anticipate
what it says that's going to happen next
and of course the grid as we were saying
with respective colors the grid defines
and the granularity defines in what way
order can be changed and what things can
be reordered and what things can be
reprocessed so the grid just as an
element in itself creates is the basis
around which particular kinds of
spreadsheet forms come into being
obviously I can do those in different
ways and different spreadsheets going to
have different ones but the material
around which this stuff is as being
organized comes to us from from the grid
we found another tremendously important
part of grid operation I ran out at some
point of pictures of people who's
standing in front of our wines this is
where spec so this is obviously not a
spreadsheet but it looks kind of like a
spreadsheet so just go with me on this
the the other thing that was actually
critical in the particular group that we
were looking at was the way the grid
produces both alignment and separation
simultaneously explain what I mean by
that as I said the way this team was
organized you know there were different
teams doing different kinds of science
all with instruments that are bolted the
same spacecraft when the spacecraft was
originally designed it was a road
designed with a scan platform so the car
that was going to stick off from the
side it was going to have lots of
instruments mounted on my gimbal and it
would be very fluid and flexible and
easy to put easy to point different kind
of instruments at the planet or the
Rings or the moons as they as they as
they flew by it was going to be really
nice but these were value engineered out
of the design that is they ran out of
money and they had to do something
different what they did was they bolted
all the instruments directly to the
spacecraft that was a way to save money
but it produces then this effect that
the spacecraft has to be rotated or
tumbled in space in order to change what
instrument points in a particular kind
of place and fuel and reaction wheel
where are both very valuable commodities
here which means it's expensive to turn
the spacecraft in space what does that
mean that means that if your instrument
is pointed at the planet and I would
like to point my instrument in the
planet and my instrument is on the other
side of the spacecraft from yours it
happened you know there's going to be a
fight basically right it's going to be
an organizational struggle for me to
make the case that the value I'm going
to get by pointing my instrument at the
at the space at the planet and gathering
my data is worth the cost of the fuel
reaction wheel where and all the other
kinds of things in order to be able to
get that result there are something like
16 different instruments so there are 16
different instrument teams all of which
are doing different kinds of science
some of that science can be done quickly
some of it can be done slowly the
scientist don't necessarily publish in
the same place so they have all sorts of
fights about that gravitational team is
continually getting beaten up by other
people because they just need a lots and
lots and lots and lots and lots and lots
and lots of measurements over years
before they get one paper whereas other
guys are going I don't know I took a
picture of a supernova so yeah you know
and but that means that the super luffa
be older or the visual instrument people
are continually saying - for instance
the graph is symmetric people always
like no there's no point of wasting fuel
on your measurements because you guys
haven't done enough science so these are
the kinds of terms in which battle lines
are drawn and fights develop
spreadsheets play a really important
role and then the point moments when
these when the groups have to come
together to make decisions contentious
decisions about resource allocation for
resources like time fuel and reaction be
aware and this issue of alignment and
separation turned out from in our
observations to be very important a
spreadsheet again go with me pretend
it's about genius a spreadsheet is sets
the structure of the meeting and what
normally happens is it's circulated
amongst the various teams in advance of
the meeting each of whom fills out their
column here are the particular
properties of our observations of what
we want to do here's how much it'll take
here's how much time we need here's what
will the benefit and so forth everybody
fills that out separately and then it's
collated and comes in so everyone has
described their problems and what and
their desires in the same kind of way
alignment were brought into alignment my
problems are the same kind of problems
as your problems
they live alongside each other in the
spreadsheet such that we can talk about
them commencer ibly and yet we don't
smush them together in a way that would
eliminate the independence of my stuff
from your stuff I mean you could imagine
oh we'll just like combine these two
things because they're basically the
same or the instruments in the same
place no no no can't do that
um we need to be able to keep them
separate we need to be able to talk
about the distinctiveness of different
kinds of agendas and different kinds of
needs and I might need actually to be
able to extract my stuff and put it into
something else next time when we have
this my queen all we're going to have it
again because you know we're flying
around around we'll be back here um and
so um and so does keeping things
separated is actually really important
and that's what spreadsheets were doing
for these guys too they hadn't simply
smooshed everything together into a
PowerPoint presentation that said that's
what those guys want to do and that's
what these guys want to do the
spreadsheet showed the alignment between
different peoples practices but at the
same time maintained a sort of
independence for them in grids or the
grid is a key feature here in relating
sort of independent but related elements
in bringing them together and I think
this sort of balance between alignment
and separation is is key okay so so much
for the grid for the moment at least
let me talk a little bit about the
second serve component in this which is
the formula
so obviously the formula that is left
kinds of things that we put into
spreadsheets are like produce
calculations before and the formula is
the thing that breaks the grid it fits
within the grid but it produces more
than grid like structures formulae
contain mathematical operations or
textual operations and references to
other parts of the spreadsheet that sort
of take it from a two-dimensional
structure into something much more
complicated they also make it into
something that's much more dynamic and
one of the things that sort of
intriguing of course is the fact that
because spreadsheets deliberately tried
to treat primary data that is just
numbers that you entered or textual
elements that you enter and formulae
identically one of the things that sort
of comes to be an issue is how things
move back and forth between those two
that is how it is that my one might ever
know what the structure of the
spreadsheet is from moment to moment
because there's no way for you to look
at this spreadsheet and know what things
are our original data and what things
are the results of formula you can't
read off from the spreadsheet the
structure that produces it there's no
way to tell on that serve entirely there
totally an intentional feature sorry I'm
forgetting which one my next slide is so
even though I can see if I need to like
remember okay yes so there's no way that
you can even see you can there no way
that you can see it and this is of
course intentional that is you want in
the particular moment of coming together
to ignore the why of that what's on the
table one just focus a focus in the what
and yet if we think that those questions
of for instance separation alignment are
important then so two must be the
dynamics of what's going on how it came
to be there when it was produced how it
was put there who put it there and on
the basis of
what forms of decision-making it got to
be there and the one of the things that
becomes important here of course with
respect to that issue of dynamics there
are questions of sort of for instance
searchability one of the things that
characterizes digital documents digital
media in comparison to their paper
counterparts is this idea that they are
indexable searchable findable and yet if
something is in my spreadsheet not
because it's a piece of basic data but
because it's a drive data as the result
of a formula it's not available to
search processes certainly not outside
of the spreadsheet I can search over my
hard drive in order to find the
documents that have a particular number
in them if that number is not actually
in them if what's in them instead is a
symbolic description of how it is a
number would be introduced here that
would be produced as soon as I open up
the spreadsheet but when I just look at
what's on my hard drive it's not there
at all and this is I think this is
interesting when we start to think about
questions of organizational practice
around archiving now the organizational
prices around archiving is always kind
of an interesting one it's not an area
of specialization of mine and is
interesting because an actually now I
think about it I ought to know what this
is in Microsoft mind don't because of
course like organizational retention
policies often mean that archiving is
not about archiving but about deleting
things mandatorily deleting things but
but but when in in sort of you know the
places I go and the conference's I go to
people are fascinated by and concerned
about processes of moving large scale
document collections online um one of
the issues here is this one of search
ability
and yet search ability index ability
turn out not to be features of the
digital at all but be features of
particular kinds of digital materials
that don't necessarily spread themselves
uniformly through through the digital
world and which may not even as this
case of Malay so may not even be
uniformly distributed within a document
some of those cells are searchable and
some of those cells are not some of
those cells are going to be have shown
up on a nod your are going to be indexed
in the archive on my hard drive and some
are not and I don't know which I do on
the spreadsheet but people don't know
which and that matters in these cases
like the ones in the in the NASA where
the spreadsheet although it's organizing
indexing and anchoring a particular kind
of event is also going to be an archive
and as I said some of that one of the
areas of research that people have done
already on spreadsheets and
organizational science is on
spreadsheets PI's archives of our they
archive our decisions they also archive
our processes that is the spreadsheet is
our reminder of how we did things in the
past that we might want to do in the
future and in fact we certainly found in
the NASA case trajectory willie matric a
thing about spreadsheets
nobody produces the spreadsheet in the
meeting right you don't want to start
with a name to it occasionally you do
but these meetings you don't know you
wants to start with that empty grid and
fill it out in the meeting a spreadsheet
comes into the meeting and it moves out
of the meeting again it might move out
of the meeting into an archive it might
move out of the meeting into the minute
it might move out of the meeting to go
to the next stage of the process and may
move out of the meeting to go to another
set of people it might move out to the
meeting in order to circle back again
next time um but they circulate and they
move and because they circulate and they
move because they flow in and flow out
questions of what things are findable
archivable are now on record or not
actually matter a lot to the people who
are doing this who are doing this work
um sorry try to decide which way ran to
do a couple of things um one of the
things that certainly matters for
instance is this sort of like the
spreadsheet at various kinds of
historical moments and your ability to
be able to speak to particular versions
of it because again if they imagine
these things are not simply document
in the moment but documents that flow
then the temporal aspects of that are
really important and this question is a
set of how we reuse spreadsheets in
order to to re perform organizational
action comes to be entwined with
formulae as well after all nothing
that's on the spreadsheet has to be
produced by the result of a formula you
could just have especially in the
spreadsheets we're looking at at NASA
which don't contain complicated math by
any means
what's a complicated math at NASA none
of it was going on in these meetings not
much uh-huh but the idea the question is
then why is anything a formula well
something would only become a formula
because you thought it might change in
the future you want to produce a
particular kind of consistency when
other things change in the future later
on it's a way of future proofing the
consistency of the organizational
document so notions of you know the kind
of abstraction that goes on as soon as
you put a formula is already speaking to
an extent to this notion of trajectory
the notion of the way the spreadsheet is
embedded and organizational process and
created an organizational context that
gives it particular kinds of power and
meaning so I mean I've sort of been
hinting at some of this but one of the
ways to recognize the particular
materiality of spreadsheet forms and to
recognize how it is they become entwined
with organizational practice and what it
means for organizational practice is to
ask yourself the question what would
happen if instead of spreadsheet the
meeting was organized around another
similar kind of thing doesn't have to be
a spreadsheet could be a photograph
doesn't have to be a spreadsheet it
could be a whiteboard there's any number
of things it could be it could most
obviously for a star to be PowerPoint or
I can say PowerPoint I'm at Microsoft
generic but as I say in knoblauch's book
he only uses PowerPoint a capital P to
refer to the Microsoft Project in
PowerPoint with a small P to refer to
presentation software huh
these are actually keynote slides paying
you um but uh so it could be it could be
par par my it could be presentation
software
why would presentation software not do
the job for them well by and large
ProStart it's not malleable it doesn't
have the property of being able to be
reworked on-the-fly
in the in the room you know now I think
about there's this other interesting
feature with respect to PowerPoint and
other things which is what's on your
screen is not the same as what's on my
screen I can see my notes I can see
what's coming up next I can see a little
timer actually that distinction might
actually be important with respect to
the process of producing agreement and
alignment within a meeting actually just
earlier today as we were going for lunch
I suddenly thought damn I should have I
should I should be giving this
presentation in Excel it would be so
much I don't know what it would mean to
give it in Excel I'm gonna have to try
and figure that out before I next give
this talk but I should be getting it in
Excel now I could okay yeah nevermind I
could be doing it on the fly but when
those when in those meetings people do
make changes on the fly they do it in
our way to the screen is murdered and
and everyone is in alignment and
everyone is in agreement um they could
do things in a word processor for sure
you know those are malleable you know I
think they just don't manage the scale
obviously um and what's more if you did
things in the table and word processor
you would not have this notion of the
formula that produces consistency
produces embeds future Futurity we could
do things on a whiteboard obviously the
thing about the things about the
whiteboard is the whiteboard doesn't you
know the results from the whiteboard
don't feed in a negative meetings in
quite such a good way I can send around
images of what happened on a spread and
on a whiteboard but I can't go back
there so the next meeting is the result
of reprieve and so forth so visuality is
not enough here norm is malleability
though there is something important here
about the way it can be captured and
circulated moved and and removed sent
back are reworked and brought back into
the meeting so if we want malleability
then why not a database after all lots
of databases use a tabular structure
lots of databases look even like
spreadsheets in terms of their user
interfaces if they have them well I
think the problem with databases is
there
malleable and they don't have that
property of version particularity that
enabled what was going on in the meeting
to become an organizational mandate that
is I can't
generally point you at a database and
say here's the database that says what
we decided in that meeting because the
data is is this continually a fluid
thing other people can come in and
change it I can send you the slides and
those are definitely the slides and
everyone can look at them say that's
definitely the set of slides but or the
powerpoints or a spreadsheet that came
out of that meeting um but when I Finn
you a link to a database I can't version
the database generally and lock it and
say that's the database as of exactly
when we all walked out of the meeting
and it will not change or you can always
go back there no matter what else's
change the database is in many ways too
fluid even though what the spreadsheet
is capturing is often database ish the
database has a different series of
materiality 'z that make it not work for
this particular kind of context not
again they don't have lots of kinds of
databases and even I think this is
perhaps Jo for me the most revealing one
even some other kinds of spreadsheet
forms don't work for this group so for
instance I've been in lots of meetings
where what's on the screen well I should
so the first thing I want to do is go
back very quickly to look at slide so
here's an interesting thing there's a
spreadsheet on the screen and everybody
is also looking at a spreadsheet and I
think it's the same spreadsheet on their
laptops while nearly everybody but these
ones are also showing spreadsheets but
they're but we're looking at people are
looking at different parts of the
spreadsheet however because of the
structure of the meeting what Knobloch
calls the event there's only one person
who's able to make changes up here that
are collective group changes only the
person who's projecting their
spreadsheet at the front of the room now
I go to lots of meetings there are
spreadsheet events and no blog sense in
which the spreadsheet is just a Google
Doc or
I don't know what I what they Microsoft
equivalent is SharePoint or something I
don't know a shared online cloud-based
spreadsheet um and that doesn't work for
them either
because if this were a cloud-based
document these people could be doing all
sorts of down here all sorts of
things down here while that pert well
maybe in changing things in anticipation
of getting to their part on using like
the orca Mississippi use before it say
oh well maybe we should realign this do
something quite different maybe there
are like updating things on the bay that
we've already discussed whatever the
thing is the thing about the laptop
based spreadsheet and on their offline
spreadsheet is that it provides a
certain sort of point of control that
makes sure that there's only one
spreadsheet that is the object of record
and that everybody knows what that is
and everybody's in agreement with it if
the object of the meeting has produced
alignment and coordination then I need
the document form to have properties
that insist upon convergence convergence
of conversation convergence of
decision-making and convergence of
document and the online versions don't
do that the the movement of locus of
control or the distribution of locus of
control means that it's not well aligned
with what it is that they need to do so
so spreadsheets are you'll form one of
the there's a series of case studies
that around which this sort of the book
is organized and the broad question of
materiality of information is the sort
of central topic um and um and I think
you know as I said the beginning it's
like there's lots of ways into the
materiality of information and many of
the ways that talk about it sort of
focus on a contrast with the ineffable
and material untouchable stuff of the
virtual an attempt simply to say no the
digital is material look it has a
demands power a consumes natural
resources it has to be in a place and I
sort of want to try and go beyond
talking about materiality in
sort of general way and saying look it's
actually material to start to ask the
question what kinds of materiality does
it have what kinds of specific
properties characterize digital forums
digital representations in ways that
condition shape evoke produce restrict
constrain her actions properties like
their granularity properties like
robustness translucence portability
weight heft
you know dynamism and so forth and then
to be able to sort of identify those
within different kinds of
representational forms and draw out from
that through examples like this one with
um with scientists at NASA what the
relationship to practice might be how is
it that particular kinds of forms of
practice evolve and co-evolve with those
material with those material forms not
being entirely constrained by but but
springing her or by being shaped by and
recognizing to that then as designers we
are people who put those things back
into it back into the tools so there's a
series of cases that I sort of work
through I've given you the one on
spreadsheets
there's one on emulation there's one on
internet purchase two on internet
protocols there's one on SQL and NoSQL
databases and the property that these
cases turn out to have not by design I
should say although I'll claim it if I
have to UM but is that they sort of
operated different kinds of scales on
scales of action and scales of sort of
press goes of practice and scales of
reach and they also sort of enroll
different kinds of disciplines so that
stuff I've been talking about today um
speaks largely to sort of organizational
science and organizational ethnography
whereas this stuff on Internet Protocol
speaks a little more to like you know
network and telecoms governance and
policy and so forth so they tend to
operate at different kinds of scales and
I think that's that turns out for me to
be you know one of the the lessons of
this stuff is I
that kind of argument about materiality
z' has this power to operate across
scales as well as across different
different kinds of sort of disciplinary
boundaries but the scale one scale one
in particular and that scalar thing is
kind of a is for me kind of important so
over the last 10 ish years there has
emerged at some you know intersection of
computer science and information science
and critical social science and
humanities a sort of interest in in
software objects and software as texts
and in what has become sort of known as
software studies bringing sort of
critical analysis and critic analysis to
to digital objects in particular to to
software systems but the work there has
gone in many different directions some
of it explores the sort of the
rhetorical amplifications of software
and so I don't know there's a hope you
can buy whole books on people studying
poetry written in peril or pseudo
parable um
don't ever actually try to execute any
of the problem um whereas on the other
hand you know some people are sort of
reacted to that say well you know the
digital has actually sort of disappeared
from that if all your care about is like
you know the torch the tortured tortured
syntax of hash bang and AK signs we need
to sort of get back to the real things
and so then there's a whole sort of
counter movement within software studies
called platform studies with the the
your text of which I say it's a fabulous
book but there's you know a study a very
precise study of that the other timing
considerations in writing software for
the Atari 2600 VCS and how it is you
would have to like you to grapple with
the hardware in order to produce an
effective game and arguably that book
although published by MIT press and you
know written by written by digital media
scholars is more advanced documentation
of the Atari operation of the Atari VCS
than Atari ever gave to its developers
um
what I'm trying to do in this work is
find a sort of middle ground there to
turn questions of our
texture and representation into topics
for software studies to do it in a way
that doesn't sort of read the soft
software and technology as metaphorical
or the basis for metaphorical flights of
fancy but as something that we have to
sort of take seriously as something that
is sort of phenomenologically present to
many of us as we use computer systems
and and tousle and as you know to try to
find a sort of new point of leverage for
trying to trying to do this this work
and so hopefully I finish to give you
some kind of sense of that today but I
think we have some time for questions
my snarky comment and you like hold up
fingers so we know what stage we're at
for the first days of it if anyone
hasn't seen Peter Norvig PowerPoint
presentation of the Gettysburg Address
google it
second is I learned very recently that
Roman numerals can do fractions my semi
snarky comment is you're talking about
the muddy colors in an in an acid thing
I don't see that as as I see that as a
positive outcome of the meaning because
it's you know two minutes work to add a
column called priority number the colors
sort by that and you've got an ordered
list of you know what you need to do
okay so my question is from your talk I
infer that you actually think
spreadsheets are a good idea so correct
me if I'm wrong and also what would you
recommend to improve them um okay
see what order I go to take things let's
see I mean with respect to sort of the
second half of all of that um I also
think that the production of various
forms of muddiness was a positive
outcome in the in the meeting space
craft supplies there are no blood was
filled so you know to that extent and
decisions were made they so they sort of
did it it is actually entirely possible
that if the properties of the medium
that they were using had constrained
them purely to reds and greens the
outcome might have been much less
pleasant for all concerned may be just
as effective but much less pleasant and
pleasantness in a project that's lasted
many decades and will last many more is
important so I actually think that's
fine
but I am not so sure that if they had
then chosen to assign color numbers to
those to list them from one to ten and
then sort by them or whatever that it
would have been nearly as Pleasants not
quite the right word but it would have
been a lot more fractious I think what's
nice about the colors is that very
ambiguity that they provide that allows
for a certain amount of interoperation
and goodwill queries I think if it had
become one to ten there would be like no
that's not a six it's more of an eight
you know it's like a you know and you
started look and you know that they
would have gone to six and a half
you just know they were to contradict
that so um so I think I'm actually I
think that it's important what's
important here for me is actually the
ambiguity that the representation can
provide now of course in one sense is
absolutely unambitious it is a color
it's a precise set of like you know RGB
values or however it is that that excels
towards color um but at the same time
within the purpose of within the frame
meeting it would be it would have been
less effective and it remained because
it bit no at the ambiguity would have
was effective and that's why I don't
want to then sort of start to give
design recommendations for
the next generation of spreadsheets
because I think the point here is not
the spreadsheet by itself worked better
or worse the interesting thing is this
set of people evolved a way of working
that incorporated the constraints and
and properties of the medium that they
were using they would have managed
somehow to struggle through with other
kinds of things to I'm more interested
in how it is that the particular
constraint produced for them in that
moment a workable solution um
I mean other kinds of meetings
completely different strategies might
have to have been applied uh-huh we're
here as always so it's not to say that
this one is better or worse but I'm kind
of interested in that sort of inter
functioning of practice and form that
they either that example provides really
interesting to study the way that
startup culture is changing with the
introduction of slack movement from
email and shared online documents to
like this running shared conversation
yeah
and I've just experienced I think that's
right I so I think of course we've seen
a sort of a variety of I'm sort of like
historical historical moves there but oh
I used to park in John Seely Brown who's
the director of Park at the time used to
like argued way back you know the great
thing about email and organizations is
it's so informal and kids today you know
kids today um
encounter email as less dreadfully
formal way in which they interact with
institutions nobody ever actually sends
them an email except their professor the
you know or to tell them that they're
late paying their fees um and so yeah so
there's this these the interesting thing
then is like not simply the way that the
medium operates in itself but how it
operates in relationship to all the
other kinds of things and how we read it
as having certain kinds of
organizational or or other function so
yeah I hadn't actually thought of doing
this like stuff I don't know why I
haven't actually even heard of anybody
else doing it but it would be really
interesting to look at for sure
remember staff point of clarification
about this is that the way you talked
about spreadsheets is more as process
and as something a sort of a
collaborative live living document have
you also been looking at it as output so
something that another separate software
program spits out or sing about its
Excel file and and sort of the act of
that creation being somewhat in the
hands of the person executing that but
also in the hands of nope all right so
let's see so yes I have been talking
I've been talking about sort of process
in particular I you know on talking more
about these spreadsheet events rather
than spreadsheets and have it as the
spreadsheet event is shaped by but you
know is is entwined with in time with
representational form it's clear that
spreadsheets do a lot of other work
within organizations and some of the
work that I sort of like you know
briefly with my hands out in the talk
and I can point you to references
particularly by women called Elena
cacciatore has been studying sort of
documents or spreadsheets as as objects
that are you know archive do used reuse
and again a lot of this stuff that goes
along with sort of more fulfillments
work on the evolution of routines how it
is the spreadsheet server because as an
organizational memory and I think then
you'd start to see some of that stuff
the kind of thing things that also sort
of speak to where the spreadsheet cause
after the path after the meeting um the
idea that the spreadsheet is also
something of a universal form that it
can be output by planning tools that it
can be output by other kinds of things
is it sort of part of that question of
circulation one could say the same again
about PowerPoint and other kinds of
things but but it's not been something
I've been looking at because I have it's
like maybe using spreadsheets as an
example together the materiality is
rather than thinking about spreadsheets
in you talked about the spreadsheet file
that you send around which is not the
model of Google box our office 365 there
there seems to be some advantages to the
other model too which is that you know
you don't have to have someone who
receives all the spreadsheets and then
merges is together and then sends it
back in
can you talk about how you might combine
those without losing that that rigidity
that you actually want in a meeting like
that um well I mean again I think it's I
think it's really interesting because I
think you know the example you give of
why it would be advantageous to be able
to sort of do this stuff online is it
would save somebody the work of of
integrating and yet I'm pretty sure that
in a lot of organizational practices
somebody really really really want that
work not just the work but they would
like to be in control of it's like you
know there's a reason you might want to
volunteer to be described for all those
kinds of things I don't mean not in a
Machiavellian way I mean I mean you
might even say that there's some people
who are better at hearing in a fractious
meeting the different kinds of positions
that are expressed and and and being
able to then sort of do something that's
representative so I don't want to frame
that absolutely as work I have a feeling
that if people you know if if I if we
were having a series of meetings that
were anchored by an online document
office 365 or whatever that allows you
know simultaneous updates we would find
a different way of working it's not the
whole time thing would like fall to pcs
way to that we would have to work
differently they have a way of working
which is indexed by the properties and
constraints of the form that they are
using I have you know and and I think
you know there are certain things we
could sort of call out and point to and
say look here's how that features
playing into what they're doing and
here's where they're getting some
benefit from this and this is what
allows them to proceed unproblematically
at this moment because of it because of
this feature it's not to say that's the
only way they could do it because they
could certainly do it otherwise and and
I'm sure they have I'm sure they did
when you know they weren't all like I
mean again this is a project that
started at the 1980s I don't think they
were all coming around in the 1980s with
like Excel on their laptops and
presenting this stuff I'm investing and
he had the project has continued so I
think I think the relationship is
slightly different here between what
they're doing and
the other stuff the difference of trying
to do this with a database what about
something like Microsoft Access
that's a database right it seems a lot
more like Excel and we're making out
yeah yeah that's true
um this is still different I mean I
could you could imagine I could imagine
ways in which they could make use of
that I don't spend a lot of time using
access myself so I'm no I'm not speaking
from a position of deep deep knowledge
one could I can't you can imagine a
spreadsheet e ways of using databases
just as you can imagine database a ways
of using spreadsheets and some in some
ways they're closer together and in some
ways they're further apart at some
moments they're closer together
um maybe that would work for them and
that's just fine i it's not clear to me
I bet on the other hand I think one of
the things that Excel has that that
access doesn't is it's pretty much on
everybody's laptop I don't know I don't
have access on mine and you know it's
sort of it's more of a of a conventional
form it may go some of the things that
Merrill was saying about how it is that
spreadsheets inter function with other
kinds of applications and so forth um
but you're you're absolutely right when
I was saying database I was meaning more
you know I'd you know the online
database that stuck in you know this in
some place or even in fact you know
maybe some of the you know FileMaker II
kind of things which is more investor of
exercise place but I think it again this
tough I think it tends to be about and
and the stuff we were seeing tends to be
about fine detail within the structure
of the organizational document or the
digital document rather than Oh
spreadsheets generally do this and and
and database Easterner can do that um I
may have spoken more like spreadsheets
do this and databases do that but what I
want to sort of draw attention to are
this sort of way in which specific forms
were incorporated into a sort of an
evolving organizational practice for
these guys
databases like SAP maybe you're saying
that like Google Spreadsheets is here
that's a spreadsheet and access might
not be food even though it's a database
I think it's about identity conditions
um on on these things particularly as
file I mean and in this case it's not so
much about spreadsheets as about files
thing about a spreadsheet is you save it
to a file the file has a particular kind
of identity it sits on my hard drive
it's got a particular kind of name it
has particularly you know properties and
that allows me to call oh yes that is
the one that I had on the screen and so
yeah so it's it's you're here it's like
how their thing inter interacts with the
file system that might be there might be
more that's actually useful I want to
have you come back to why something like
a spreadsheet ends up in a place like
this as part of an event like this
because I feel like I'm hearing a couple
so like one read is the different
options have different formal structures
one works better for a certain practice
another one could be you know they've
been doing this since the 80s and the
thing was sitting there and the
institution a big partnership with
Microsoft and you know it's on their
going laptop you can imagine it kind of
slack related argument that says
something was rejected because this
looks better so it was taken up or or
maybe you're kind of like politics of
right someone want to hold on to the
position this tool lets them stay in
like the person who collates so like how
do you think about those that do you
think there's something that yeah I mean
I think that's a thing kits a great
question and I would love to have had
the opportunity to find out more about
that and actually if I talk with so
jennifer tezi did a lot of the was one
of the photographer's it was like work
on this project and she might have more
insight given her sort of long-term
relationship with
and science projects I would be
fascinated not where that comes from
more's there are once upon a time a
setting in which they sat with with with
printed out tables and and you know
waves them at each other and do you
think of this as something like
spreadsheets and other things have
formal qualities people take them up and
report people using despite um well I
mean I think it's I think there's always
going to be a bit of both of those right
sold so it certainly has to be the case
that this has to these people are not
using in general in this in these kinds
of meetings bespoke tools they have
tools for the job there is plenty of
like in all bespoke tools that design
pointing arrangements for the space
craft and things like that
but in these meetings you're running a
bog-standard
Windows laptop with all the standard
software on it and so it's going to be
something that first an its standard
stuff and so so obviously you need to
fit your task to to to to things that
are roughly roughly available available
to people um I mean one of the things
that you do find fascinating about this
in some ways is there is almost no of
all the things you would find in the
papers on the errors people make with
spreadsheets for example you're not
gonna find any of that going on here
there's no formulas these are basically
just lists and tables and in fact
they're often in many ways just slides
um they're just sliced we can edit and
put things and put things in boxes and
and so there's they're making so little
use of what we think of as the
spreadsheets properties but that's why
she wanted things that makes it
interesting
all that stuff all do you like you know
oh you can now play what if that is the
central part of advertising for visicalc
and like you know 1982 none of that in
here none of that none of that's
relevant um I actually myself was doing
a program committee meet years ago and
sat down with my with my co-chair and we
were just making a list and so naturally
she breaks out Excel on my list making
tool and it as it is for many people um
bounine already actually has a really
interest
paper from years ago thinking about the
questions of when and when people make
decisions to adopt special to dot
specialized tools versus using generic
things and it's like you know actually
sort of prepare appliance it's like why
yeah you could I just use my word
processor and then I think oh I print
things I've done to acetate and I think
that's one of the interesting things
here is like you know both these people
are clearly capable of building a
specialized thing about they do it
they're making very generic use of this
stuff but I think actually it's just
common availability is a very important
this very important part they don't need
a lot but then what's there does I think
start to sort of shape and push things
in different kinds of directions maybe
not in take it out to the hall where we
have delicious treats and you'll be
around to answer further questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
