their impact and influence please join
me in giving her a very warm welcome
thank you thank you I've been doing a
lot of thinking and research and writing
about the concept of thought leadership
for a number of years now and the first
thing I realize when I want to come and
talk about a topic like this is that I
start by saying that thought leaders are
not any different from you or me they do
not have any superpowers they do not
have any special secret sauce that the
rest of us can't discover so what I want
to do today is I want to start by
sharing you a couple of quick stories of
folks who became thought leaders in
their niche and I'll start with the
first one is a gentleman named Ron
Finley lon Finley lives in south central
LA and he's an artist and he calls
himself the gangsta gardener where I
think is a fabulous phrase and what he
did is he started this movement around
the world of fresh gardening in your
front yard in someone's backyard fresh
organic produce in a place where there
is no such thing south central ala is
one big strip mall after another and the
way it started was he had a strippa land
in front of his house and he thought why
don't I just grow something there and
he'd just grow something the way you and
I might grow something he started
planting fruit trees and he started
planning vegetable gardens and what
happened he got a letter in the mail
tear out the garden
right isn't that what happens for all of
us when we start making change people
put up their hand and say we don't do it
that way stop cut that out but he didn't
stop instead he started a petition and
he got 900 people to sign his petition
in a few weeks and he took it to the
City Council he got the City Council on
board and today he has gardens in the
all these different abandoned lots
around South Central he's got them in
homeless shelters he's got people
bringing their kids to grow gardens on
the weekends and why does he do this
because his theory is if you can get
kids to grow kale you can get kids to
eat kale now I'm not sure about you that
Polly wouldn't work when I was little
but it's a great theory and he has now
created a TED talk he is out telling
others in communities like his where
there is no fresh food how to create
against a gardener movement the next
person I'd like to share with you is
Nina Nassif Nina was working in a
company in Chicago called sandbox
sandbox invests the money from blue
cross and blue shield into startups in
the healthcare world now as we all know
healthcare is shifting and changing and
lots and lots of innovation will be
needed and what she was seeing is that
these startups would get started and
then they have a new product and they
couldn't find anywhere to test it and
yet here's these big companies who are
desperate for a novation so how could
she connect the two together she created
an incubator accelerator program called
health box healthbox is now scaled to
three cities this year will go to seven
she's got a venture fund she's got a
whole bunch of other programs now to
connect big companies to little
companies in a way that actually scales
innovation to really move health care
forward the third person is Vaughn tone
Quinlivan von Hong Quinlivan became a
change agent in a hundred-year-old
utility company so whenever we think
about change is hard just imagine trying
to make change at a hundred-year-old
utility company when she came in she got
a job working and HR and she was seeing
this big problem ahead they were almost
all the people who were in the line
positions were set to retire fifty
percent were set to retire the next five
to ten years and the new people coming
in did not look anything like California
all white males at the top of this
company and their line positions all
white males coming in because it was all
being done through relationships it was
all being done through brother brothers
and cousins and she thought this is not
okay we need to change it up she created
a program within her company called para
pathway which she then scaled across the
industry and the cross other utilities
outside of gas and electric she started
to get traction for her ideas she
testified in front of the US Senate she
got recognized by the White House and
then she was headhunted to run that same
type of program across the state she's
now the vice chancellor for Workforce
Development for the state of California
and the community college system these
are all people who started out one
program one initiative one idea and
scaled it they created change in one
area but when they first started did
they start thinking i'm going to create
the gangster Gardner movement he started
with one garden all of the people that
I'm going to talk about today they all
started with sort of one drop in the
pond one change one small impact at them
they scaled so when I want to talk to
you today is about this idea of what is
a thought leader and this is I got to
make this an engaging involving session
which is why I made you all move down
front because this is not about me sort
of sage from the stage with all the
answers I believe the answers to how we
can make change and become clot leaders
are here in this room so I want to
engage you and involve you with some
questions today and the first one I want
to ask is what is the thought leader so
you all came to the session you all
signed up come to a session I'm ready to
be a thought leader what do you think
yeah so vision is pretty critical being
able to see a future that you want to
bring about what else
yeah because it's one thing to have this
big vision but if you never get anyone
else on board with it if you never
engage anyone if you never enroll anyone
you can't inspire people with your ideas
not a lot of change is going to happen
what else an appetite for risk and I
think that is actually a very
interesting conversation because most of
them would tell you most of the people
that I interviewed most of my clients
they would tell you that that is the
piece that is the hardest they may have
a big vision they actually may be good
at inspiring but there's often that risk
factor because most times when you're a
thought leader or you're a change agent
you're doing something different than
has already been done has always been
done and now you're trying to enroll
people to do something in a new way and
that's risky it's risky for our careers
it's risky for just actually
implementing change in whatever
organization or whatever idea we want
what else what else is required I do
think that passion is the critical
component so when I was writing the book
the sort of the first chapter that I
wrote is really about this piece of
passion because if we can't find that
thought leadership does not happen
overnight you don't suddenly wake up one
day and you're not the go-to person in
your space it takes some effort it takes
some initiative it takes some
stick-to-itiveness so if you don't have
a passion around it it's not going to
happen that is kind of a a core and a
passion that is consistently moving you
forward is what it takes to actually
make will change creative end and thinks
outside the box thank you I agree with
that absolutely because it's not as easy
I would say to get people excited about
something that's kind of the same old
same old we've already been doing that
it is sometimes about stepping outside
now I'm going to I'm going to come back
to that point later because it's not
always about something completely new it
can actually be driving something
forward that's already in them in the
conversation so we'll cover that a
little bit later anybody else anything
else we want to add thank you
so having so what you're saying is not
just having this sort of oh we should go
this way but having some something to
back it up some data some research I
understand that and what I would say is
it starts I think with some expertise
people often ask me what's the
difference between an expert and a
thought leader and I believe expertise
is one of the core fundamental Reese
underlying underpinning necessities to
being a thought leader in any niche it's
not it's necessary but not sufficient I
think the difference and maybe this is a
little bit sassy but I think the
difference between a leader and a
thought leader and she's made expert and
I thought leader is an expert is all
about telling you how smart they are
whereas the thought leaders about
teaching you to be smarter they're all
about helping you to uncomplexed if I
the information and really get on board
with new ideas and see a future that
they see really getting that expertise
into your head lead by example and we
had a big conversation when I gave this
talk the last time about whether you
need to be a great manager to be a
thought leader and i'm not sure i could
get completely there but you do need to
be a great leader you don't always have
to be able to manage the initiative that
you're pushing forward but you do
actually have to be able to lead an
initiative that you're pushing forward
okay anyone else want to jump in before
we move on all right so here's my
definition it's changed thought leaders
are change agents who I believe inspire
which somebody covered absolutely they
have to be inspiring they have to be
innovators I have to be changing
something innovating something new they
actually then have to replicate and
scale and this is the piece that I think
most of us miss we think that doing it
here in one organization in one
community and one city one company is
sufficient but I really believe that
scaling what we're doing that we don't
have to do the scaling ourselves but
helping others to scale our ideas and
the way that we do that is by building
communities by building a set of
followers or joining an ecosystem where
people are moving ideas forward and
we're part of that and that is the way
we build sustainable change so these
that to me is my definition and I'm so
trying to recapture this phrase thought
leader because i think it's being
misused and and misappropriated in lots
of different places kind of become a
buzzword but if we can define it this
way i think we need more of these types
of people in the world would you agree I
believe that thought leadership begins
with the what if what do I mean by that
what if is that piece of somebody
mentioned very early and when I asked
the question it's that idea of a vision
but here's the problem with the word
vision when we're starting and we're
putting that first drop in the pond what
if feels that what it feels possible
vision feels impossible it feels as if I
don't have a vision of the future yet
but I do potentially have a question so
let's go back to some of the people i
mentioned earlier so thinking about ron
finley he said what if we could grow
vegetables in south central LA and
change the way food is both available
and the way kids get engaged with fruits
and vegetables in our city that's a what
if question that is not the same thing
as necessarily having this big vision of
where this gangster gardener movement
was going van ton-quinlivan what if we
change the way we engaged people to come
work at our company and actually invited
people who are veterans and folks from
disadvantaged communities to actually
get access to jobs in our company what
about Lina it was what if we could
connect big companies with small
companies in the healthcare world to
move healthcare innovation forward all
of those are what if and it's just a
much safer place so as you're doing your
own journey to thought leadership I want
you to imagine what is the what if
question you are answering there is so
many what if we could change the way my
company does this what if we could
change the way people adopted technology
in this arena there's a lot of what if
questions that Microsoft is answering
every day and you could be pushing that
those ideas out there in the world let
me tell you a little bit about my
background so I began my what if
question with a simple statistic the
statistic was less than 1% of the
venture capital Phi
dancing was going to women entrepreneurs
this was in 1993 and I started an
organization because of that statistic
the organization was called the forum
for women entrepreneurs we started our
second chapter here in Seattle then la
Orange County Colorado Texas and we were
really trying to move women starting
technology and life science companies to
gain them give them access to venture
capital that's my co-founder on the
screen Jennifer and Bill Robertson for
ten years we worked very diligently on
that somewhere around the sixth year I
got a phone call one day from an
organization on the East Coast I didn't
even know they existed I was running a
non-profit growing doing my own thing
and they called me one day and they said
hey we hear you're sort of the go-to
group for really moving this idea of
women and venture capital forward and
we'd like to create the first venture
capital conference for women now you all
know adventure capital conferences are
this is where you prepare and you get up
and you pitch your ideas in front of a
room full of investors at the time
there's only a few of these in the
United States and hardly any women in
fact most of the conference's like
venture one you'd see one out of 25 so
we thought what if we did one where it's
25 out of 25 well guess what the first
thing that happened is a lot of
naysayers and sadly the naysayers were
people that I thought would get on board
I sort of started collecting it's like
how many no's can I get before I get to
the day of the event because they were
piling on there's not enough women deals
we've seen all the women deals women
aren't ready you know whatever however
on the day of the event january twenty
seven two thousand we had 27 women
present within a few months 24 of them
had been funded so we knew we were onto
something and that has now grown into a
nationwide and actually now a global
conversation we've helped 550
entrepreneurs raised over six billion
dollars in capital when it programs all
of the u.s. in in israel in australia
and it continues to grow and we know
that those statistics need to change but
in 20 years to be honest my what if
question is still out there because we
are still somewhere between four and
nine percent of the bench or money going
to women entrepreneurs in this country I
am part of a much bigger conversation
but let me sell it show you the
celebratory moment this is the day we
went to nasdaq to
take our first company public on the
Nasdaq constant contact since then we've
had I robot we've had Invisalign we've
had sip car these have all been part of
our venture conference these are the
kinds of people that are changing the
world when I started when I picked up
that phone that day did I know I was
going to be leading a initiative that
was going to really change the America
no I was creating the first venture
conference I got on board with that and
I said yes to that but i did not realize
that I was part of leading a real change
in an entire conversation around women
and economic empowerment now what I do
is I work with other leaders I haven't
my own organization is any mention and I
work with leaders and all kinds of
different organizations who are really
trying to get more impact and influence
around their ideas and I codified some
of the things that I learned into this
book and the reason I did that is
because I just got so first of all I got
really excited about the idea about more
thought leaders in the world but second
I realized that I wish I'd had a book
like this when I first started the
organization in 1993 if somebody hand me
this book I would have gotten a lot
further a lot faster so what I wanted to
do today is talk a little bit about why
should you do this you all came to this
talk there must be some reason why you
think this might be a good idea so why
be a thought leader what do you think
what's in it for you because it has to
be something in it for us or we would
never bother you can't do it alone if
you can't leverage other people to do
what you think needs to be done your
input or your ability does not scale
scale absolutely scale thought
leadership is what allows scale to
happen because it's we're out sharing
our ideas and we're out influencing and
impacting and not saying it's all from a
stage it's there's lots and lots of ways
and we'll talk about some of those but
it is about scale absolutely along those
same lines to have higher impact on
something the more you can impact
to feel the greater internal reward
correct yeah it is personal reward
personal satisfaction I see so much more
engagement when people start to add this
to what they're doing and recognizing
that this is what actually gets them up
in the morning yes of course we all have
our to-do list but once we do something
that is actually impacting and
influencing we start getting followers
for ideas way more exciting way more
energizing why else would you do this
yeah so one thing that we know is if you
have a wet if question you can you can
start planting that seed in other people
and you can get them to move but often
they don't necessarily move the way you
want them to they don't move as fast
they don't move in the right you know
whatever so it will galvanize most of us
once we had that what if question that
becomes our own burning passion we want
to get on board to do something we want
to get others on board to help us do it
anybody else so I think it's for things
i think it is all about influence impact
it is often about income interestingly
enough and legacy leaving a legacy that
you're proud of but most important is
this piece and that is about career
insurance now we all buy health
insurance we all buy life insurance but
what if we had career insurance what do
I mean by that when I will work with
senior executives one of the things I
hear over and over especially in Silicon
Valley where I live is that change is
going to happen in your company your
boss is going to leave there's going to
be a merger your company's going to buy
another company all the things you
thought we're true or often no longer
true and if you are a recognized thought
leader if you are the go-to person in
your space now suddenly the phone is
calling you instead of you trying to
find that next opportunity people want
people who can influence who can
actually get people on board and
galvanize to move in a new direction
they want change agents they want people
with followers so I want to encourage
you to think about thought leadership as
a career insurance strategy now here's
what what thought leadership is not I do
not believe that it's about having it
her feet okay that's not the same thing
people call me up and they say oh I want
to be a thought leader should I start
tweeting like okay that's chapter six
out of seven chapters so yes of course
having your twitter feed is not a bad
thing but that is not thought leadership
in and of itself in fact it's also i'm
not selling and it's not marketing i
think that Ashley thought leadership
leads to sales and leads to people
wanting to get involved and engaged with
your company or your team or your
organization or your product but they
are not synonymous nor is it self
promotion a lot of people will hold
themselves back and I will say this
predominantly to my women friends in the
audience here because I think we often
got those messages that you don't want
to toot your horn you don't want to
speak up too much about what's your
great at because that's considered
self-promotion and we don't really like
that framework but I will invite you to
imagine and instead it is about making a
difference that that is actually what
allows change to happen if we focus on
that piece instead of focusing on being
a self-promoter great question thank you
hi sorry i hope i will no go ahead i
think it's an app moment to ask the
question so can you help me understand
the difference between thought
leadership and like strategic thinking
or leadership and also when does thought
leadership blur into actually getting
things done like executing other
thoughts or is it more like pie in the
sky high-level strategic thinking versus
actually pulling all the way through and
executing what that thought is I believe
that thought leadership is all about
execution that you are not telling
everyone how to go do things it is about
implementing a program a project a
product a service an initiative whatever
and then once you've learned the way to
make that happen getting other people on
board with that now then I want to
differentiate here just a little bit
what I don't believe is that the st.
that just because you created a great
product and I spent 10 years of my life
creating great products and shipping
them out the door that you're suddenly a
thought leader thought leadership is
often about moving your industry forward
it's often about moving a much broader
story forward so imagine let's go back
to the guy at the beginning the gangster
Gardner you know yes he created a garden
and yes he got a few people on board but
when he started to actually engage
people to understand the importance of
healthy food when you started to engage
people at understanding how important
was to get kids engaged with growing
food in order to understand the value of
healthy food that's when it's thought
leadership right because now you're
looking a little more broadly than just
hey look at me I'm fabulous my products
are great it is really more about moving
something a bigger change so imagine in
technology you know when cloud computing
came around this is not a this was not
an easily adaptable idea so you could
just talk about your new cloud computing
product and service or you could talk
about how cloud computing is going to
change the way we work that to me is the
difference here in how I think about
selling and marketing versus thought
leadership it's really engaging people
around a big idea and actually changing
an industry or changing the way things
have always been done that's that clear
you're welcome all right so if we think
about it as making a difference I think
that takes us out of our conversation
about the self-promotion and actually
focuses us where we need to focus so let
me tell you a little bit about three or
four quick stories because what i want
to do is talk about those first steps i
really don't want people go away
thinking thought leadership is for other
people thought leadership is for some as
i said superpowers but instead let's
talk really nitty gritty about what did
it take and what were these people
particularly good at and what are some
things you can do to become thought
leaders so going back to the example of
van ton-quinlivan what she would tell
you is that she actually became a
thought leader because she wanted more
influence she came to this country 11
years old speaking no English and
because of access to education she
changed her life went on to get two
masters degrees at a major university
and really now is having a major impact
in the world of influence in the world
in a way that she could not have had
without that access and she now wants to
provide that access to many many many
many millions behind her but here's how
she did it this woman never tweeted a
day in her life for the first five years
of her initiatives she did not enjoy a
lot of writing
so instead what she got good at was
convening so what she started with was
convening internal to her company so she
started to look at all the people
internal to her organization who were
working on the same problem turns out
across her company people were worried
about the fact that fifty percent of
their employees their major on the line
employees were going to be retiring in
the next few years and they were all
individually working on little pieces so
she convene a group of them over time
she realized those people don't have
enough power to change now she had to go
higher up she went to the senior vice
presidents then she actually went out in
the community and she brought in college
presidents from the community college
system who were working on workforce
programs she brought in the workforce
system people then she started convening
all the people across the industry
people with her job in other companies
so when you think about this convening
is a really effective strategy for
sharing best practices sharing new ideas
sharing initiative and getting people on
board with your initiatives all the
people that she put on her consortium
which was all these folks from all these
different companies eventually started
adopting her ideas or getting actually
hiring people from her programs that was
actually then those people would then
invite her to come and speak and they
would be they would jointly write op-eds
together so it all began with these
convenings so you're thinking about it
has anybody in this group has anybody
here done any convening within their
niche within their community or are you
part of convenience I've got to believe
having spent many years in tact that
that is a conversation that happens a
lot what do you do and what way are you
involved various
I found it over time people start coming
to you and asking for help yeah yeah so
it becomes it becomes a place where now
if you're the convener now everybody
knows you is that now you get lots more
opportunities so there's one of the sort
of it's like a secret strategy once you
can do that and you can start bringing
the right people to the table now people
know you is that now you're going to
have more opportunities so I want to
encourage you to imagine that at those
tables you can move things forward again
you may not be the only spokesperson and
you want to empower the other people at
that table and in fact you want to
empower a message that all of you can be
out sharing that is actually when things
start to change who else anyone else
used convening strategy or participate
in convening within their world no
question yeah so you don't want to be
thinking you have all the answers
thought leadership is also always about
listening it's about seeing what
resonates one of the people that I
interviewed in the book talked about
house she said you want to play the
small venues first what does she mean by
that she said you know this idea of
going as a comedian you don't go to the
go to the Grand Opera and try to get
laughs from 500 people you want to start
at a really small venue similarly with
all of us you know you smart you start
your ideas your what a future with a few
people and you test it and then it
starts to get bigger and bigger on that
feedback loop is what actually allows us
to know that we're on the right track
integrating other people's ideas okay
next story this is commander Zoe Dunning
so commanders are we done and began her
career in the Naval Academy she spent
many years in the military promoted a
number of times left the military went
into the reserves and went Business
School as she was graduating Business
School Clinton was coming into office
and what happened was that the new
initiative Don't Ask Don't Tell started
to become like widely accepted as the
new normal within the military Zoe
realized that the people like her as a
lesbian we're going to be immediately
shut down in a way that had never been
what she expected to be
part of her career she had always gone
to the military and stayed in the
military because of honor and because of
the way in which she was able to lead as
a transparent leader but now suddenly
she was being asked not to be
transparent not to share her truth she
made a decision to go to a rally knowing
full well that they would try to push
her out and within 24 hours of going to
that rally they immediately started
trying to transition her out but I'm
like every other person she actually won
the case against the military and she
was in fact the only openly gay person
to be allowed to stay in the military
for 17 years now imagine a
responsibility you are the only one that
can speak I mean it is really the only
one because if you speak you're out so
she began to recognize that she had an
opportunity she had a responsibility to
move a conversation forward she began to
testify in front of the Senate she began
to lobby she began to speak to him to
the media she really we came the front
and center spokesperson started a
non-profit to move forward and at the
end of that time there she is on the
Dyess with Obama when they repealed
Don't Ask Don't Tell she was one of 10
people invited that day because of all
the work that she did as the only one
that's her in brown air just to the left
of Obama now we don't all have that
opportunity to be the one but I do think
we are the one for our team for whatever
initiative we care about for whatever
we're moving forward and she would tell
you that her unique skill was being an
amplifier what do I mean by that most of
us do not have an idea that's going to
change the world I know maybe in
Microsoft I may be speaking out of
school maybe that's not sure but we can
amplify other ideas this initiative was
going forward and she really felt
strongly that it was not the right way
and she became the amplifier of that
message and she became the person who
was really the only one who could be the
amplifier of that message so i want to
invite you as you're thinking about
yourself in whatever you're doing that
you don't have to have the first idea
you don't have to have the original
first idea for whatever
you're working on you could be picking
up an idea van ton-quinlivan picked up
the idea for power pathways and the
biotech industry she brought it over to
the utility industry and then scaled it
and amplified it within her own industry
these are all strategies for folks as
thought leaders to imagine that you're
an amplifier of an idea Ron Finley did
not invent fresh gardens in your
backyard but he amplified that idea and
by joining the ecosystem joining with
all the other people who are moving
something forward you're far more
efficient and effective now let's talk
about Avinash Kaushik how many people
read the blog Occam's razor anyone in
here one person pretty impressive
blogger right so Avinash was actually in
charge of the team of one heading to it
when he first went out to speak about
how challenging it was to implement
search engine optimization this was
2005-2006 and he was on the front lines
trying to get his company to adopt
search engine optimization before
anybody was and he was having a heck of
a struggle he went out and he went to a
conference and he spoken to people came
up afterwards and they said hey you
should be blogging you've got a really
unique point of view and he went home he
thought there it's hundreds of blogs
there's too much already being said
about this but I'm going to I'm going to
listen to these guys I'm going to do
some homework so we tried to be
searching how to be a blogger all the
tenets of blogging and he began a blog
within six months of testing out that
blog he got an opportunity to write a
book and then a second book and the
today he has made a quarter of a million
dollars from his books alone and he and
his wife have donated every penny to
charity now what he tells me is he never
would have had the impact that he could
have had he never would have had the
influence he never would have had the
income if he had not stepped into that
conversation as a thought leader and
what he said over and over again was
that he focused on one thing uncomplexed
fi it's a word he coined because what he
realizes in all of us especially as
techie types we tend to work a lot in
acronyms I worked at Motorola for a
number of years I swear every single
conversation with another acronym and
demystifying
at uncomplexed to find that with what he
took on is his challenge his blog is all
about making it simple for everyone he
said yes the money has been nice but he
always wants to remind everyone that
what he really values is the love
letters he gets love letters from Borneo
to Boston every day in his mailbox he
gets love letters from people saying
thank you for you making this easy i
finally understand the career i want i
finally understand how to do this in my
company so i want to invite all of us as
we're thinking as technologists as
leaders that we are job as thought
leaders is to uncomplexed fi the complex
this is challenging for us because as
experts we tend to be in our head and we
tend to already know all the answers
tell me what's your question you said
this is a dialogue so you back jumpin
stupid what's the difference no isn't
really I like to spray so i thought i
would throw it up there simplify complex
ified demystify i think they're also the
synonyms any video sent question before
we move on so he would say that that and
adding value that's the other thing he
talked about a lot it's this idea of add
value every time you write he thinks to
himself am I going to be adding value to
the conversation it's not blogging for
the sake of blogging and he only blogs a
few times a week even now he then got a
job of course at Google they had hunted
him over there because they really liked
his following and they liked his ideas
and now he's the digital marketing
evangelist at Google legacy how many you
guys have heard of chip conley Chip
Kelly's one of the one of the CEOs I
most admire in America he ran a company
called choix de vivre the hospitality
company that started doing boutique
hotels in san francisco area each hotel
is very unique and he over time starting
at the age of 26 grew the largest
boutique hotel chain the second largest
boutique hotel chain in america and
along the way he learned a lot of
lessons his company went almost bankrupt
twice and he had many many many hours of
stress and pain as he was trying to put
this company back together each time and
he
came up with this framework and he would
tell you that the way to leave a legacy
is to create frameworks frameworks are
the the codification of what we know
this is a core value of thought
leadership most of us don't realize that
what we have is a well-defined roadmap
of how we did something we never sit
down and sort of piece it together like
how did we do this how could you do this
whatever it takes that word for word is
what other people need so being able to
create a framework to explain his
framework was all about how do we treat
our employees our customers and our
investors equally and how do we create a
heart centered company and he base this
on maslow's hierarchy of needs but he
really expanded it again everybody is
building on each other's ideas and that
he built a talk about and he built a
book around it and now his ideas are
being adopted in companies around the
world because he really understood that
this core framework was what it would
take to change the way we always do
things i think frameworks as an hour
another core fundamental it's one thing
to tell people a great idea it's another
thing to give them the framework or the
road map of the franchise manual
whatever to make change for themselves
so I want to leave with one idea because
I mean we don't have a few minutes
before we're going to take questions but
one of the things that I know about most
of us is that we have to start by being
discoverable for where we are today the
most important thing for all of these
great things you've already got going on
is for other people to know about them
now maybe you are all better than all
the other audience I've ever spoken to
and you're all completely googleable but
I have to tell you that most people I
look on their LinkedIn profile or I
google them and I might find one thing I
might find a little bio somewhere but
really does it tell me what their
expertise is does it have what they're
passionate about does it tell me about
the blogs are they've written or the or
are they even writing blogs has does it
tell me about the speaking topics that
they could speak about are they actually
putting front and center their expertise
and what they care about in a way that
is discoverable I think this is a really
critical first step and I want if ms you
do nothing else so my talk today I want
you to go home and Google yourself
excuse me how dare I I will be banned
from the campus forgiveness probably
want to do fools bottle want to do both
because and by the way probably a few
other things too right there's so many
ways in which we can be found and if
we're not searching that's why I really
want to think about it are you
discoverable and not just discoverable
online what about in the community
people know you two people in Microsoft
note oh she's the one who's great at x
oh he's the one you call for why that is
another way of being discoverable it's
that word of mouth it's that reputation
that we want to be building the more we
sit down and do our to-do list and focus
just on the things in front of us
instead of being out Tooting our horn a
bit I think the less effective we are
and the less effective our ideas are and
the less likely we are that our ideas
will be adopted so I want to invite you
to imagine discoverability is critical
to your success but it all begins here
it all begins with nurturing your inner
lion what do I mean by that isn't it
cute we all get up in the morning and we
look in the mirror and there are days we
look in the mirror we see the mighty
lion and we think we can accomplish and
achieve anything and then there are
other days where we see little tiny
kitten in the book I talk about one of
my clients shared this that to her it
was the itty bitty shitty committee that
was holding her back anybody got one of
those is right it's just so true though
we all have that little voice it says
you can't do that you're not that great
somebody's going to find out that you're
not that great whatever those stories
are the cultural stories the family
stories the social dynamics around us
the the people that hold us back
nurturing your inner lion means firing
the committee kind of every day saying
thank you but I'm not really listening
to you any longer and also surrounding
ourselves by those who champion us
surrounding ourselves by those who
believe in our ideas and want to get on
board and get excited by helping us move
forward so inviting your team that's a
great first step but thinking about who
outside your company who may be outside
your niche could be part of your
conversation that is nurturing that
inter lion and stretching so that every
day you're seeing the lion in the mirror
thought leadership is about being known
but it's also about being known for
making a difference as you're thinking
about your own thought leadership in the
coming year I hope you'll think about
that conversation and think to yourself
what is it I want to be known for that I
think it's the core question for all of
us as we're developing thought
leadership what do you want to be known
for so I'm going to be taking some
questions here I know one or two of you
is going to sneak out I get that but
stay and ask me questions because I love
having a conversation about this but I
invite you to be more discoverable this
year i invite you to be discoverable not
just for yourself but for the team that
you're on for the projects that you're
doing for the initiatives that you care
about for the ideas that you want to
make change around in your company and
your in your community in your industry
and if I can be of help to you I hope
you'll give me a call if people want to
leave me their email address i have a
whole series of worksheets now sort of
to help people move forward on their
thought leadership that go with book i'm
happy to send you those or drop me an
email Denise that thought leadership lab
calm I really believe that this is
important and the folks in this room are
the future thought leaders if you're not
already on the path today is the day to
start thank
so I invite questions please yes there's
common phrase about it's not what you
know it's who you know yeah so there's
actually two chapters in the book on
this conversation because i think it is
all about that we can't move our ideas
forward if there's nobody around us it
is that i mean the idea of moving an
idea forward is putting it out in the
world and the idea of creating that
followership that that ecosystem around
us so the first step in the book is that
passion piece the second step is really
around starting to test your ideas with
different folks sort of putting that
first drop in a pond with your inner
circle and then the next is areli around
activating your advocates which is how
can I get people with a big following to
get excited about my ideas how can I
amplify my ideas by connecting in with
with communities that are already
happening in my ecosystem so it is
absolutely that and then I think the
other half of what you're saying is how
can I make sure that people know this is
my niche how can I make sure that they
call me that is a critical component of
this so yes network your network is and
what the sad thing is just to take this
one step further I've had many people
20-year careers who have built a network
of only a hundred people that is not
going to serve you going forward I know
it's really easy to do the to-do list
it's really easy to work a hundred hours
a week on what we have in front of us
but if you are not connecting to people
in your industry you are not a
well-known person you are not the go-to
person and you are not going to be
having that career insurance that's
really critical because there's nothing
the guarantees the change isn't going to
happen in your industry tomorrow does it
always have to be about thought or ideas
or can it also be about qualities for
instance someone's known or workplace to
be a facilitator making things happen or
positively impact in influencing
everybody around them and getting things
achieved that way so I know your book is
about leading thoughts and ideas but
have you witnessed the other way around
when it's
or the other thing where it's more about
qualities and maybe indirect impact
you're having so here's how I would
differentiate what I would say is we all
need those kinds of skills right we need
the skills of bringing people together
in order to do thought leadership but in
what's in service of what so I always
think that if I am creating facilitating
engaging and enrolling people it's in
service of something am I wanting to
make my workplace work better am I
wanting to get an idea a group of people
about an idea together and then my
question would be could you create
thought leadership around that effort
either the efforts of the people in the
room or the skills that are necessary to
engage and enroll and commune and
convene people that I think people can
develop thought leadership around I mean
you could speak to people about here's
how to do it in here is how not to do it
here's what is working in our company
and here's what's not working here's
what really is changing collective
impact I mean this is one of the new
phrases and buzzwords in this world
collective impact so in the nonprofit
world what we're seeing is collective
impact is actually getting lots and lots
of nonprofits to work together people
are developing whole thought leadership
around that and it's really hard so the
more you're actually tackling something
that people are not good at naturally
something that you do have some talent
you're seeing some best practices you
have some ideas around then I do think
that so it's it's all about ideas anyway
right it is that is absolutely a
platform and if it's your skill set I
invite you to go for it because there's
not many people who are good at it
insight or suggestions would you have to
handle to handle those naysayers oh yeah
big roadblocks that you see when you you
just know you have a good idea but
people are like no you can't do it it
can't be done we already tried it get
back to what you're doing I mean any
insight on how to handle that yes and no
every situation is a little different so
it's not i'm not going to give you one
size fits all but i spent a lot of time
and one of my chapters talking about how
a couple of things on this topic because
it's kind of a core thing of change
change is all about overcoming naysayers
but one of the core things i learned was
some a woman who in a session I went to
call the op ed project anybody heard of
the opioid project a pet project org so
the opioid project was started by a
woman k ornstein who looked around and
said we if you look at the op-ed pages
of America they are almost all white
males over 50 and we need to shift that
so she started in and she across the
country teaching one day seminars to
focus on how do you write a good
argument how do you get a great op-ed
witten and the one thing I can't lie
came away from a lot of things from her
training but the one core thing that was
so fundamental that I'd never thought
about is we need the naysayers because
they actually tell us what we must
overcome in order to change people's
minds the research that she did in
op-eds over and over again is that
people she would say did this OP had
changed your mind and this up and change
your mind what makes you change your
mind and she did research research
research and what she learned is that if
we do not start by acknowledging the
other point of view we will never get
people on our side I mean I think it's
why some of the news stations don't they
don't work because they're always always
always talking their own point of view
and they're not recognizing and honoring
the other side so she uses a framework
around saying to be sure you may have
always thought this but here is why the
other point of view might be more
correct or newly correct or whatever
again not under grading or degrading
people who don't agree with you so the
may sailors are critical important the
second reason the naysayers are
important is because as they talk they
give you the clues to help get you on
board so we need to be listening to them
as having spent many of my ears in my
career working with entrepreneurs being
an entrepreneur myself many times over
those naysayers are really kind of gifts
there's no telling you how everybody
thinks the normal behavior that absolute
always been done that's the only way I'm
going to get to change people if I don't
know how they think I can't change their
point of view so I sort of started
collecting them and I kind of tell
people entrepreneurs you know you're
kind of more
successful the more knows you get as
long as you're listening it's not just
to collect nose and not to argue and not
to get defensive but it is about getting
that underlying knowledge that they're
sharing with you and if they're vehement
and passionate all the better those are
the people I really want to win over
because if I can win them over my gosh
the world is my oyster because now I can
get them out saying here's why I change
my mind and here's why I agree with her
so it's kind of its like a reframing of
know and i will also invite the other
side of that coin which is it doesn't
always work sometimes you just need to
leave them on the sidelines and keep
calling because there's always nice
aires thank you for your feedback i'm
fascinated about it i always have a
framework a legacy which I mean people
can understand and follow you being one
of them in your book I just flipped
through the pages you have a framework a
step-by-step guide so a common person
aspiring to be a talk later there are so
many frameworks around and so many books
and authors teaching you how to be a
leader at park later how do you kind of
realize yet another framework there
which one do you choose and do you have
time to kind of experiment each of them
and hey this works for me or this does
not work for me
if I have to make a pick how do I make a
pic and say okay this is the framework I
want to watch you and see if it was so
I'm going to answer that question a
little bit of an unusual way I'm gonna
tell you a little quick story I was uh
one of the things that's been out about
the book being out for the last few
weeks since I've had a lot of
opportunities to be interviewed about
the book and one of the places that I
was recently interviewed it's a place
called the leader lab and the leader lab
ldr lb is 98 David burkas and he I said
to him you know how do you pick your
guests it's a podcast he's on itunes and
he said oh he says I flip to the
footnotes like what do you mean he says
oh I always want to know who is it that
you based your knowledge on in order to
decide whether I'm going to trust you so
I would just want to invite you to
imagine that as you're looking at a
framework you want to see where did they
get this fun where did they base this on
where was it something that was tried
and true and they added to it for
example like chip calmly he pasted on
maslow's hierarchy of needs we've all
learned that in the seventh grade I mean
it's been around for years and then he
built on it and he added to it and he
used today's world built on that so I
actually always want to sort of vet the
sources vet who's already following that
framework if you know seven people I
respect or have already adopted that
that's the one I'm going to start with
now it may not work for me and I may
have to chuck it but if I can start
there I think that's a really
interesting way to judge and
interestingly enough it's also why we
need to be discoverable for our
communities and our connections because
people are judging us by who were
hanging out this they're judging us by
who we're basing our ideas on so
thinking about that too is that people
are doing that same vetting of us so the
more we can make it clear there's a
wonderful book that I read recently
called steal like an artist has anybody
seen this book really fun book and it's
all about how everything in the world is
based on something else there's no new
ideas they're all being especially in
Silicon Valley right now I feel like
it's 1999 all over again I'm waiting for
pets com to come back anyway the reality
is that we have sources and the more we
can build on trusted sources that are
well-researched and well relied on the
better
and steal liberally don't think you have
to come up with it all from scratch I
thought that was a really high made me
feel so much relieved we leave hearing
that who else okay sorry I have to have
the microphone has the poor folks and I
hope somebody online has a question I
know there's a bunch of them on there so
talking about that nurturing the lion
yeah no inner lion so for example when I
go to the gym or you know exercising
running you know I got a lot of ideas
like what I should be doing and not you
know but there is also to-do list when I
go home right yeah how do I make sure
that you know I kind of you know make
the wrong ball rolling for the ideas
that you know i got doing the same or
you know yeah really hard isn't it i
miss the hardest because that to-do list
is always there I'm always feeling
guilty because I have a to-do list so
what I learned for myself and I'm
certainly seen worked for many others
and I learned this from the startup
world it's called masterminding so it's
getting other people together on a
regular basis with a commitment that are
all working on something that is
non-competitive to minor and actually
have a committed time in which you're
going to work together so my mastermind
is to women leaders both of whom ones
written seven books ones written nine
books so I felt like as a brand new
author I needed people who are going to
be pushing me way outside my comfort
zone they're both been speakers for 30
years so I could learn a lot from them
but we had a we had a commitment of how
much time we would spend together that
we would always answer each other's
emails that the priority was to push
each other you know with love and care
but you need people in your life are
going to push you forward so imagining
it's a conversation once a month were
you getting together with people for a
Saturday afternoon or one evening a
month in which you now then you have to
prepare just like any meeting you know
getting it on the calendar a time when
I'm going to devote to my ideas or my
thought leadership I want to invite you
to imagine that there's people in this
room who would like to have a thought
leadership circle and you could all come
together around those ideas and say what
are we doing to push thought leadership
together what about in our own teams
what could we be doing on our teams to
push our ideas out what would that
change now it's on the two
list right because it's going to get
done if it's on the to-do list if it's
always just in our minds it doesn't
happen for that help oops wait I have to
get you the microphone since I've failed
that on the first ten people so this
group that you are a part of what women
very experienced yes were they personal
friends of yours one was I did not know
the other okay so I see what's in it for
you what's in it for them why would they
want me okay so here I said the same
thing what do they want with me here's
what's so funny technology interestingly
enough I'm the geek of the crowd so just
as little very small story is just
recently one of them has got invited to
do a webinar hey could you show me how
to do that I've never done a webinar
before I whipped up her PowerPoint
slides put that thing together right
that's one thing but the second thing is
that I'm always pushing them to think
how technology can change their business
how could they really be using all the
great technology out there in order to
get their voice heard so that I think is
just one way that I really changed the
conversation neither one of them is
technologist at all so I actually wanted
to mention that David burkas was here
earlier in the year he's fabulous is me
he taught me about how to create a
podcast so I'm gonna be doing podcasting
a perfect so his last name is be urk us
if anyone wants to look him up yeah
we're talking and my thing is I think
front and center on his page right now
my interview with him I just had one
question on the title of your book yes
he's ready to be a thought leader and
maybe I missed this earlier on we've
talked a lot and I love the way you talk
about how to actually do it but how do
you know when you're ready to be one how
do you self vet the quality of your
thought before you go out there and push
it forward okay great question and so I
was reading this book and I had this
wonderful seven step process and and I
realized oops what about that so I
actually added a pre chapter on this
topic because it's very important I have
a whole assessment in the book about
sort of where you are what you can check
off and what you still haven't done so
that's the first thing secondly there's
all these sort of characteristics that i
think are common among so i went as i
interviewed all these different thought
leaders i captured a lot of the common
characteristics and then some of the
traits and the behaviors of thought
leaders so if you aren't yet there
here's some things you
be doing today so for example one woman
I interview talked about be ready for
when you're not ready like okay that
seemed very odd to me like how can I be
very good for when I'm not ready well to
her being ready for when you're not
ready is being ready to be able to be
cognizant and confident of what's going
to come when somebody might just put a
microphone in your face at an event can
you talk about you have just a little
quick summary of what you're doing today
can you introduce yourself at a
networking event can you actually
confidently say I don't know I'll get
back to you or do you blaze into a shade
of red and and you know fumble all over
yourself so for my entire career I've
taken public speaking training I'm
constantly searching out other inspiring
speakers that I can learn from I take
improv classes I do all kinds of things
to be ready from when I'm not ready I've
taken media training started this like
years and years and years ago and I just
want to encourage all of us that those
are key components if you if you want to
do the speaking component of thought
leadership as I said it's not the only
way writers writing classes you know
there's lots of different ways in which
to be a better storyteller I think
storytelling is critical I think all of
us have thoughts but we're all that's so
good at creating them into stories in a
way that compels and inspires so that
would be another thing are we ready to
close up okay unless we have more
questions huh all right maybe I can take
one last question before we close anyone
have that last burning question okay
