you
hello everybody I'm here I'm pleased to
be able to introduce Miguel nusbaum he's
here visiting us from Chile where he's a
researcher at pontificia universidad
católica de Chile Miguel has been
working with us for Road oh no five to
ten years now developing innovative
education technologies he's worked a lot
in collaborative technologies and most
recently with working with our multi
mouse toolkit and creating something
that he calls one mouse per child and we
recently won a Lasser grant the South
American research and innovation grant
that we also contributed to and he's
here to talk about old work new work and
future directions so without further ado
Miguel thanks a lot down under hi it all
started 2006's contar I just mentioned
Rick mentioned me when I meant contado
in berkeley in a confident in order
first it was the first conference of ICT
where I discovered that they had made a
driver that allowed you to connect more
than one mouse to computer and so
they're a wonderful opportunity to lower
the cost of what we were already doing
in collective work with pocket pcs at a
time so what we did at the beginning was
porting the software we already
developed for doing small group color
collaborative learning with kids in one
computer and three mouse the idea
basically was does these kids could work
together inside the classroom so that
really transformed the classroom
experience in such a way that the kids
are the first actors in the classroom
those that really are working and the
teacher and mediator for those kids that
need it what we saw is that for this
type of activities the kids really
collaborate interact and coordinate the
work what we lost from what we have done
with pocket pcs wirelessly
interconnected is the eye contact
because
kids were looking to the screen and they
were not looking to each other as they
were doing before however for these
small kids they gained a lot because as
you will see here there they had a
common space where they were working on
before they had their own machines now
the machines were simulated by series
individual spaces so that they might kid
that had the blue mouse only could work
in his own space the blue one the red on
his own space the red one and so on and
there was a common space where the
construction of the solution was done
before this construction was done in the
virtual world where everyone had a piece
of this so this focused attention of the
kids and improved learning a what we're
doing now in the same direction with
doing work like this one where you
constructed idea here behind was that
you have two ordered objects the kids
add pieces of this object had to be
ordered in a sending way we do the same
type of activities now but for language
learning aradia was what happens to if
we add to one machine three phones we
stick speak with their microphones and
instead of having individual teach a
learning of languages we have a
collaborative learning of languages and
the idea he behind is the following each
kid as you saw in the film has a set of
objects in this case the yellow one has
the words day and party the red one our
birthday and they have to coordinate and
synchronize as they did with the number
so to build the correct phrase but
instead of clicking to the objects what
they do they have to speak so for
example the yellow one it touches the
button in the keyboard so the system say
it's your turn you have to talk and he
says they and if the system recognizes
that they were spoken adequately day is
accepted afterwards this guy says I one
now because they are and
says our are however it's not spoken
adequately and the system say did you
mean our what's important is that this
feedback is not only heard by the red
boy but also by the other two so the
other two heard how the red Boyz said
are and what the feedback was so they
saw a collaboration in the currency
ation between the guys so they're
collaborating not only how to construct
the words but also they're collaborating
and how to really speak the different
words what we found found out what's
very interesting video of a photograph
you see the three kids looking to the
screen a working together and here you
have the collaborative work and here you
have the individual work what we saw
here these are the differences between
the different groups this is the
collaborative one versus the control
group which was a teacher with no
technology here's the coloring one where
they both with technology one
collaborative and the other individual
and this is the individual versus the
regular teacher and what we saw that the
significant differences were mainly in
listening because there was a difference
between using a not using technology
compared with control and on the other
side there was a difference between the
collaborative with technology and
without tech news technology and without
technology so we saw that this an
improvement because the collaboration
really allowed the kids to pronounce
better the words so they learn to
pronounce better the words so there was
a real improvement on working
collaboratively in this one two three
environment hey I think I have again the
wrong presentation I am sorry by half
again the wrong presentation as before
yeah let me go again eh it's the same
problem had before exactly the same say
that cannot be I'm sorry about that ok
let's continue then a we ask ourselves
how can we introduce games into this
type of environment and we have done a
lot of work of in games but the most
interesting one is the usage of first
first person shooting in this type of
environment so how can you use such a
terrible game as doom for teaching kids
inside the classroom so what we did here
the kids have to order numbers and what
they do they have to move in a maze and
find the numbers they assigned to and
then they have to capture or kill it or
whatever let's say capture the numbers
once they know the corresponding
sequence so for example here of 23 here
you have 19 here you are five so the key
each kid owns a number and the kids have
to capture the rambles in the correct
sequence so it's the same ideas before
but instead of being just sequencing
number we have the idea of a
first-person shooting where the kids
have to find the numbers and then select
the corresponding numbers we had just
made the usability analysis of this game
we have an and experimental work yet but
we will begin this in a late March the
school year starts in march in chile
these are the photographs when you did
the first usability analysis then we
said how can we test how can we teach
science in such an environment and what
we did was Coulomb's law would you have
here and the addition of forces what you
have here is the three kids this is one
kid the second and the third one and
here you have the electric charges where
they can select if it's they how much
positive or how much negative the
charges and the aim is to move this
electric charge
considering their position which they
can move considering their positions and
move this charge two words this portal
the problem is that they have asteroids
here and they have to take care that the
charge don't collide with the
corresponding asteroid so what you do
here basically is you play with your
position and the amount of charge so
playing with the different forces until
you really move this asteroid here and
then different difficulty levels it
starts very simple and can get very very
complex and we did a comparison study to
see how important it was there immersion
in such a a game he it's important to
notice that there that they paid ago
legal rules are intrigued intrinsic to
the game rules because the game rules
are basic coulombs cool along so if you
really understand cooler lows Colome
laws you can solve the problem so to
really make this work you have to
understand cool applause here you have
the same rules but now you have a
narrative you have a story you have an
environment with where this occurs and
we want you to understand how important
the immersion aspect was in such a game
here of a movie where you see this book
this poised working on this game you
have two groups here free right oh I'm
sorry I shouldn't I shouldn't do that
I'm sorry about that date is so you see
how concentrated they are where they're
playing and they're really collaborating
Oh dad fine what's interesting is that
there were 30 kids and if i'm not wrong
three of them independently asked us
where they could download these games
and the games was Coulomb law so that
the gaming rules were Coulomb's law and
they really enjoyed it very much so the
numbers we got were the following what
was interesting is that we have the the
game where you have the spiritual world
and the narrative and the non fantasy
game and there was no such as this
statistical difference between both
numbers and there was no difference
between boys and girls at the end so
what we saw is that if the rules of the
game I real the pedagogical rules and
you can build the game with your
pedagogy girl rules you don't need
really a fantasy behind because the game
really merges with the pedagogy however
it's not so easy to bring up such a game
the trick is how can you build such type
of games yes that that's a game that
Vidal hondro everyone with your basement
condition where they didn't play a game
oh nice recommends no no we just
compared in this case we compare both of
them no not not idea was really to see
no I think no we didn't have a control
group there then comes the phones which
are already said then we move to 1 to 10
in 1 to 10 it gets a little more
complicated because now you need a
projector you need the computer and you
need the mouse the mouse better set and
you need also perhaps our experience and
that's a hint that if you're going to do
things like that i recommend the d-link
the d-link hub is for us the most
reliable hub if you're going to have 40
something mag mice you need a very
unique very reliable hubs because it's
very kind
% to find out where your problems are
and the dlink is very very reliable on
the other side you also have to do it in
such a way that you're sure that you
cables are not going to disconnect
because you're going to have trouble in
the middle of because the kids are going
to move and the cables kind of
disconnect so you have to have it wired
in a very intelligent way here's the 12
10 and the idea here is that the kids
really collaborate within them and with
the virtual world let me go here and
with the witcher world so that's really
important that's the collaboration
between the kids and the virtual world
and the idea here behind was to bring
world of warcraft into the classroom
that was really they our motivation
where the Warcraft was four years ago a
big big big issue it is not as much as
it is not us today as it was four years
ago but we studied what is really world
of warcraft and World War graph was
first a game where hundreds of thousands
of people interacted and work together
collaborated together and we said we
don't really need such massive
participation we really want only the
kids of the classroom to participate we
wanted multiplayer we wanted
collaborative and we definitely don't
want it online what it happens in the
same place co-located people so we
instead of having a multiplayer massive
multiplayer online game we transform it
in the classroom multiplayer potential
game and what we did we first did a game
for a again element easier for know Eric
Spanish for a Korean element easier for
the that they had a I'm so tired they
viveros the animals that only eat the
vegetables herbivores the herbivores eat
vegetables the cannibals in a reverse
and you have to have a any key liberal
in the system that's what's name of this
say the food chain their fortune the
biggest problem we had is that we
started with the food chain because it
was Buddhist in XNA
and it's a it's a big big it was a big
project with a lot of sale of quests
where each quest was a pedagogical
objective it was the first problem the
first system took us a year and the
second system another year but the
problem is that the food chain is
stitched only in 90 minutes in sixth
grade and they don't see it much more so
you make a huge effort for 90 minutes
and the teacher has to learn how to use
something for 90 minutes so you have to
think twice what type of software you're
going to do when you know how much
they're going to use it in school that's
our first learning the second learning
was that making such a such a game is
really not easy and this were their
rules that we came through from our
experience when we develop this game we
did this with jump class of n value and
its publishing computer education so I'm
not going through this but if somebody
wants just simply in mail and I will
send you the paper because they're
really good guys or how develop such a
game they together with that game we did
the electric charges game this was the
first version of the electric charges
game where you had nine kids working
together but really they were in group
of three so you have the group of reds
that's two of them and only the third
one the Greens this is 12 and is the
third one and the blue ones this is one
two and three so they had to move
between them they were charged so to
move the different charges each of them
had the charges is the green charge the
Red charge and the blue charge so there
were really three groups sharing one big
screen and what we discovered that it
was much more efficient to have the
groups each with its own small screen
than sharing this this big screen so if
you're going to have a big screen use it
for doing really a work where all of
them are collaborating as the one we did
with this classroom would you pay a
percentage a then we move to 12 49 you
want to 49 things get much more
we could hear you of an empty room with
the mouse already a already preset our
experience is that they setup is so high
that it's very desirable to have a
classroom which is a lab for the one
mouse per child because setting this up
is a huge a problem would be nice and we
were talking with Donald how to get rid
of the mice and with cameras it could be
a good idea to follow his this is work
was done in India you were one of the
schools you went there yeah this was
done in one of the schools in India this
is photographing Santiago this is a
photograph in Costa Rica we were late
November early December this is in
Brazil we were in September and this is
in India you might recognize these
children Kentaro skip gave us a school
and we were there a couple of times if
i'm not wrong doing some work with these
kids the things we did and this is a
film shoot in india where you see that
each child is working at their own pace
with their own nano window what do we do
in this nano window in this nano window
basically we allow each kid to work at
their own pace that means that you have
an intelligent tutoring system a
rule-based system that allows the kids
to work interactively with the system
and advance at their own needs and since
the system has persistence once the
lesson is finished the system saves the
state so that the next lesson the child
continues where he was here you have the
feedback for the teacher where the
teacher knows where the different kids
are and the feedback that each child
receives the following he did the dr
headed it wrong he finished one of the
rules this kid is sleeping that means
that for at least a minute he has done
anything and this kid is since deep
sleep that means that the last three
minutes he hasn't done anything so that
the teacher knows where he should
address his attention on the other side
is
teacher doesn't know the name of a kid
he just clicks here and the name of the
kids appear what we did we compared the
one more child with a system where we
use exactly the same engine but we we
did an interface for a netbook and
compared the netbook with the one must
be a child and we also did with paper
and pencil in 15 sessions or 45 minutes
each once a week and the results are
very interesting what you see here is
the percentage of students that achieved
a given level so you see for example
that a the kids that work with paper did
much more exercises than the kids that
were working with the netbook or their
interpersonal computer that one must be
child and why is this because these kids
cannot advance at their own pace these
kids advance at the pace of the feedback
that means that the system don't allow
us to continue to the nexus exercise if
they have not achieved really that level
while these kids are working with paper
and pencil and the problem with paper
and pencil is that you decide how good
you are there should be a teacher that
supervises it but this is just how many
exercises thing up yeah that's just how
many exercises that God and we were a
little afraid because we saw that these
kids were doing much faster and we saw
that we're learning much faster however
the learning was not so even the clip
the groups were formed randomly the
paper and pencil had a pretest much
higher but the improvement was much much
much lower in the three groups and
what's interesting that the
interpersonal computer and the netbook
were similar there was no significant
difference here so what happens here is
that we see that is for these kids there
was no real difference now what I'm
trying to do now for me the next step is
to show not in small scale but in a big
scale i would say 100 schools to show
that this type of thing allah really
makes a difference
because it's not only about the
technology as i'm going to show you
later it's about also how do you
transfer the technology so what we need
now is independent assessment and see
really how you can make this work in
hundred schools and how much do they
learn compared with a randomized
experiments in a real environment it's
not not now when school five schools
will have to go too much bigger number
of schools we have done this for a dairy
medics and for fractions here you have
for example a representation which is
number and have to construct the number
where the dimension which is more very
important and we didn't realize until
last year that what's really very
important here is that the children
construct the answer it's not a multiple
choice question but they really have to
construct it they cannot guess it so
there's no way of guessing they really
have to learn what the correct answer is
until they really get it and if they is
read read read length times the teacher
and explain them and they advance and
really get the point so you have a
number of station and a number solution
or a graphic representation a graphic
solution graphic representation number
solution or you can even have words so
you see that evens in such a small
screen you can get a lot of air of
different ways of doing things for
example you can tell you sitting in the
back and I don't think you are problems
in reading this and what we have seen
that the focus of attention of the kids
is really perfect you can see this
especially in the photographic of here
of Costa Rica look that the kids are
looking to different space different
spaces in the screen because each of
them are look into your own box yeah but
they're really focused the attention to
their own screen look up she's counting
and the last thing which were just now
finishing is we're doing decimals so you
have now for example a decimal
representation you can also have
graphics for example here which is
speaker the green or the gel so here p
is bigger equal or less so in this way
what we have achieved that we have mass
for first to sixth grade I wouldn't use
these for first graders I would start
with second gradients because i'm not
sure if you their first grades are
really mature for such a system and last
year we got a grant from microsoft and
lexia' where we introduced games and the
games we did i would say are not as
mature as i would say this is for really
doing a big scale i think we'd have to
do a second iteration they're doing a
second iteration this word more
entertainment games and real games where
we have air and more rules related to
what they had kids have to do here for
example they're building a bridge here
they have to collect chickens collect
fishes or they have to how you say touch
the problem here more than the games is
that their multiple choice type of
problems and we discovered that the kids
began to guess here we saw the real
importance of constructed the answer so
now we're doing a second generation
where we have different type of games
and they construct and the kids have to
construct the solution and we're going
to test this this this year here you see
how it looks like this is a for-real
photograph where you have the older kids
playing the different games then we saw
that with this type of infrastructure
you can have a super clicker which we
named the augmented clicker in the
Augmented clicker as in the clicker you
have a question and you have
alternatives but instead that the answer
corresponds to the whole classroom now
you can know exactly what each kid did
so in this case you know that this kid
was wrong this kid was right and you can
also have a whole complete view over the
whole classroom how
are doing so I would say this say
synchronous a interactive system which
much more detailed information as a
regular clicker with a very simple
infrastructure just one mouse per child
and then we have the super super clicker
which is an a synchronous clicker
because this is a sick this is a
synchronous that is all the children
have to work at the same pace and here's
Anna synchronous one where each child
works at its own pace what we give them
is a guide of a to guides of papers
sheets in one of the guides you have the
questions and in the other guide you
have the feedback so since the kids have
to work at their own pace we have two
states first the kid has to look to the
question so a answer he looks so they to
basically to the question with the
corresponding answer so she has to
answer the question and here he has to
first confirm that he is effectively in
question number one so he's in question
and went and we saying that the first
letter of the first air air word starts
with AE so he can choose different ones
until for example this is the first one
he or do or Q so he can select one and
if he's not right the system would say
hey take care this is not the right
question look to your right question so
we are sure that he's in question number
one so once he confirms that he's in
question number one he has to respond
when he responds so he is now he
confirmed and then he goes to response
and when he responds he can be right or
wrong and if he's wrong we give her
feedback and we send him to the
corresponding feedback and in the
feedback he also has to confirm for
example where's feedback he is feedback
feedback 53 he has to confirm that it
starts with a given word so that we know
that is reading the corresponding
feedback what's very interesting is that
what we saw is that the kids this is the
this is the time that
kids took four questions for reading
question and answers and this is the
time that the kids took for the feedback
look the cursed begin to separate after
six seconds and what we saw is is the
two tickets took more than six seconds
for reading the feedback 71 percent of
the answers were correct but if they
took less than six seconds thirty-seven
percent of the answers were correct that
means that the kids had really read the
feedback learned more than the other
ones and the feedback really helped the
kids to learn more then we said how can
we collaborate in a big big big
classroom because we started with
collaboration and we move into
interaction but we really wanted a
collaborative classroom how do we get a
collaborative classroom so what we did
here would you don't have 49 kids here
you have 20 kids here you have a double
entry table where you have in this case
the parts of a phrase and here you are
the different letters and each kid
belongs a letter for example they keep
this green drop of water is cheap so
where is he he belongs he owns cheap he
belongs this so look he belongs this
this should be an adjective that starts
with d e f is this right no this is not
right because it doesn't start with the
efforts that we see but here's somebody
that's telling him I want to exchange
your word with mine which is invention
so this guy wants to change this word
with this other world however cheap is
not the preposition so if they do the
exchange it would be wrong if they make
the exchange and is wrong they lose two
points if they make the change and is
right they win two points and you see it
here kids that have negative numbers and
kids left positive numbers so they
cannot make it changes if they have both
to be
sure and both have to agree if poss I
agree and they make this J for example
he agreed and now he accepts then they
would lose the points and what we saw
here that the kit they get this language
is called the silent collaboration
language wise silent collaboration
because looked at twenty kids here that
20 kids here and then another 20 kids
here these are looking to this projector
and the other one are looking to the
other projector and the kids are to
collaborate with Spears which are not
side by side and what happened that they
began to shout you see how his shouting
he's shouting someday hey I need your
word please give me her so this was a
little loud yeah so we said how can we
do something different which is not as
loud as that and this is the newest work
we have done I don't know if you note on
the young you note on the young he's a
researcher from Holland he sent me one
of his master students who were with us
and one of my PhD students and well we
did is the following now you have the
whole classroom and you divide the
screen by four so in this case you can
have nine or up to ten kids in one of
these squares so this is one group this
is another group and so on and the
teacher supervises all the groups what
they have to do they have to construct a
triangle with two sides that are the
same so initially the points are random
and each kid belongs appoint a vertex
and what they have here is a polygon
which is not a triangle so that it just
says you have to build a triangle how do
you build the triangle so the kids the
first time I have to find out that they
have to collapse the vertices and in the
ridge three vertices and then they have
a triangle and the feedback the
immediate feedback is this face his face
is not happy and this age is extremely
happy and it's finished we say okay so
the face begins to move you see how they
face is beginning to move at the time
that they're getting closer and closer
to the answer
so what they're doing they are
constructing collaboratively and really
collaboratively because each kid is
accountable of one of the vertex and
what one kid does a interferes not
interferes relates to the work of all
the group so what we saw is things like
for example that this kid says hey you
have to move and if he doesn't move he
goes here comes and begins to do
something like this over this same come
here come here come here so the kids
began to help each other in a silent way
and we really saw that hear the shouting
there was some shouting but much much
less than the other now I have a master
student where we want to see how we can
do this type of work but not only for
geometry which is its explicit that you
can do things like that but now for
language and also for mass and the last
topic is ok we have done so much
software pedagogue legal software
however teachers don't use this software
while we are there they use it but the
day we leave the school and left them
alone they stopped using it and we spear
Dylan Borg and Jeremy Rochelle air we
are working something that now we are
talking about orchestration and the idea
of orchestration comes from the
following this is deep problem behind
with the multi mouse we saw this
explicitly in not one classroom in not
in one city we've seen this energy teen
in brazil in costa rica in chile what
happens is that we are in fourth grade
for example and the teacher has to teach
a given subject because the curriculum
says he has to teach the subject however
if you look to the kids and you can see
exactly where the kids are you will see
that in one same classroom you have kids
that still don't know how to add numbers
with four digits you see kids that don't
know how to subtract numbers kids that
are beginning to multiply some kids now
know how to divide and very few kids are
close to where the teacher really is
but the ditchin don't care because the
teacher has to follow the curriculum so
the teacher is teaching to almost nobody
he's teaching what he has to teach and
he really doesn't care he cannot really
follow the pace of the other children so
what we say is that we have to support
these children while you're also lecture
so you have to orchestrate the classroom
in such a way that sometime you give it
for the kids to come closer to your to
your needs and while you teach this you
have to complement what you're teaching
with what you know your kids are so
castration is to give the teacher a
general strategy of how you're going to
follow the curricula how you going to
script each of the classrooms and how
you integrate conventional DJ resources
this is of course just a guide for the
teacher and the teacher will see how
it's going to use it however you really
structure the classroom in such a way
that a teacher has an idea on how to
improve what he's doing using technology
the way we orchestrate the glacier is
the following one we address the three
different moments of the classroom the
opening phase instructional face in the
closing phase and activities who give
them our first indication about how to
organize the students what type of
questions have to be asked the students
and the answers he can expect on how to
really react to these answers what
activities he should do and how really
the children should do these activities
a how to integrate the digital and non
digital resources how to do formative
assessment every moment so to know the
state of the kids and finally what's
very important how to schedule all this
so that a time assigned to each
activities respected so that he can
really do all this and the resources
that we give him we don't we not only
give him technology also giving paper
guides interactive guys for PowerPoint
presentations a with or without audio we
should
support in the usual or group work with
or without technological support
participatory interactive activities a
homework what we are doing now we
started justice we're going to studied
now we have the activities for the multi
for the one mass spec child for the
netbook and now we also have it for the
web and the idea is that the kids can do
homework and that this home where is
synchronized would do it at the
classroom so the system saves the state
and the system automatically give them
homework with some rules behind so that
he can advance much faster with this
homework so that's it that's what I've
done in the last couple of years so we
have a few people here in the room I I
suspect a lot of us are remote and I
don't know how to get your questions but
I open up a little bit of QA because we
have some time here
wants to ask some questions and we go
well yes so efficient about the what
you're looking at the the conditions of
the using like that for the for the math
problems that the the combined multi
mouse situation versus the head book
which was the paper pencil he saw the
market improvements between the
electronic versions in the paper one and
your concern in your observation was
that with the paper ones the students
will just kind of go along at their own
pace but they wouldn't really be
self-checking so I wonder is there
anything you can do with even with the
paper though to make it a little bit
more evaluative so like you know if like
maybe after they finish it if I turn it
over and look at the answer yes we did
this what we did this we did the paper
guide was made in such a way that they
had like 10 or 20 exercises and then
came automatically the answer guide so
that they'll have to look back and see
what were out wrong but the problem was
that they look it was wrong I was wrong
and we go forward it was wrong yeah I
didn't do it again so but the point here
that the teacher should be much more
active so the teacher should go to the
guy and see hey you have so many wrong
you should all do this again but the key
would say but I don't reveal that don't
have a place where to do it again yeah
but on the other side when it's
electronic if it's wrong it's wrong you
cannot go further and did you get it and
then the problems and the different kids
adjacent content were different enough
so that they couldn't copy
no there wasn't a copy because that
teacher looks hey you're copying you
shouldn't be copying that's something
the teachers know they shouldn't be
copying no that was not the problem the
problem was that when the feedback came
the kids knew that's wrong okay it's
wrong but what I do with you is wrong
and we say the teacher please because we
saw that problem I tell him between is
wrong please do it again and he just
said yes to it again but this was not
really mandatory
who knows you asked teachers why
to use
and Miguel can you repeat the question
yes if we are asking teachers why
they're not using the technology once we
leave yeah I would say a one of the
problems what this was the setup
definitely was the setup and the second
problem was the guidance what that's why
we are so concerned about the guidance
because when we were there we didn't go
all the weeks we went every two weeks
normally in this project the last one
and but we tell them what to do and
after we live that there was no guidance
so they felt very lonely and I would say
they're not confident enough with the
technology they feel that what happens
if they're not here who can help me so
that if that I don't use it nothing will
happen so better if it is cumbersome for
me not using it and that's why I think
that if we structure everything and that
will really help them to to show them
the way what to do what type of question
and everything is not it's really nicely
done because it's very important how you
present all this information cannot be
information overload it is very simple
so that it can really fast used all this
we believe that do you can make a
difference and this year we will have an
experiment where we will have teachers
with this orchestration and teacher
without discuss tration to see and let
them alone just with the castration and
see what happened so we really want to
see what happens with a good
orchestration and we investing a lot of
effort in doing a very good
orchestration envision a child I came in
a little late so I'm not mission in what
sense
where do you expect this to help and you
mentioned you just a way to go I i would
say i would say that two words the rich
world and the poor world in the rich
world where we are here for example i
watched yesterday SSRI and in SSRI they
have a very nice new machine which is as
big as this one with a projector it's a
computer that has a small projector that
can project something like this a
surface and with good light it's costly
and fifty dollars and each kid wishes on
mouse and since this computer and
project is so small you put it over
there over there table with a plain
piece of paper and you have a really big
Otis computer and since this is also
Wi-Fi the creature can know exactly
what's going on so I would say this is
for me as lucrative as you can get with
to today's technology I think this is a
very nice frame for doing small group
collaboration in the classroom and I
showed you here there's a lot of things
you can do with small group
collaboration with this training with
more than one must be child is the inter
personal computer yeah the Limburg name
distinct a personal computer because
this is one computer for all these kids
I would say I like personally think this
is more a knot of only affordable but
more versatile that versatile you say
versatile versatile than giving each kid
a tape a a tablet yeah because the
tablet is more cumbersome that did what
we saw with the pocket pcs they don't
really share the information in the
interpersonal computer they really share
the information and you can do almost
everything there of course the ped egg
roll design is not obvious you have to
really do a good instructional design
but you can do a lot of things there as
I showed you this presentation and then
comes the other word the poor word in
the poor the world of the poor i would
say i remember when i came to Kintaro
with the one two three
and say this is very nice but it doesn't
solve my problem you told me we need a
solution for 50 kids you remember when I
first visit during bangalore and so I
came the next year which they went to 49
and here today a computer you need not
more than a double core a double coil
with two weeks of memory cause today's
hundred fifty dollars and then you need
a projector a vga projector which goes
today is twenty fifty dollars so you
have seven hundred dollars and the mouse
and perhaps we could do even with
cameras but today with mouse the mouse
for 50 kids it's another and the haps
analysis Rihanna daughter so it's a
thousand dollars so it's not anymore
that they know the cost of technology
because the kids are not going to use it
the whole day so the kids will use it at
most once a day at most so a group of
kids can share this if they are inside
the lab so you make the day the cost per
kid is around one dollar per day p one
dollar a per kid per year so it's not
anymore the cost of the machines it's
now really how do you introduce
something like this in a school and that
the school really make a good usage of
it so we say that's the program the
problem is not the cost of technology
the problem is now how we change what's
going on inside the school you agree
with me there is also the cost of
and support which often ends up being
multiples of the hardware costs yeah but
the good thing it's only what's computer
I agree so there's some things but but
otherwise I think you know this is
certainly the way into having multiple
kids in right
and the other thing which is good is
this only one computer which the kids
are really not having touch with the
computer so the possibility of putting
viruses inside it's much much much more
smaller the factor of kids enjoying is
I would enjoin them insane classroom I
would say more than enjoyment what
really drives me is since 1995 when I
started working with technology in the
classroom is that I cannot believe that
in 2012 now I said this in 1995 kids off
today are completely passive in the
classroom because the teacher is the
main actor as Here I am the main actor
and you're completely passive and the
kids were in a generation where the kids
are really very interactive I'm very I'm
very graphic the classroom everything is
passive on words just words so we really
need to change this classroom to
classroom where the kid is the first
person actor and we need a teacher I
definitely do believed it in the teacher
I always have mentioned the teacher in
my presentation because the teacher is
the mediator the teacher is the one that
knows where to go and knows who to help
at each moment I need a teacher that's
very active in the classroom and moves
in the classroom to see where he can
really act and help those kids so I see
more than being happy inside the
classroom i would say being engaged in
the classroom engaging learning and of
course if we can do it those games why
not of course just so that i'm studying
how to introduce games but the point
here is the engagement that the child is
really responsible of his own learning
that's the main point because today the
kids are not responsible nobody makes
them accountable even more if we go back
here how can the kids be accountable of
the learning if he's teaching this and
he knows that all these kids didn't
understand anything of what he explained
however he has to teach it because the
system ask him to teach that and that
happens worldwide so one thing I imagine
system
let's assume that you showed 50 kids up
in the grid they're doing stuff and you
know system realized this this kids not
doing so well like multiplying large
number so it goes down you're
multiplying small numbers it's nothing
swimming that goes down to adding small
numbers and so forth do you worry at all
about the embarrassment maybe that a
child might feel because he's kind of up
there in front of all his peers can see
like oh that's that's this guy you know
and he's you know we are seeing that and
we were in three different we're in
urban and rural schools in Chile Brazil
and Costa Rica and we really didn't
notice that we work with small kids
third grade we have to work with older
kids but it hasn't been a problem no
cash in their own ass they don't I would
say if you look to this photograph is so
nice I don't think I hope it's not so
far away should come soon this is a
perfect picture yeah look how how they
look into the to the small screens you
see everyone is looking to a different
place because everybody's looking to
their own screen yeah she said she has
to have some support a little bit but
she's doing support
so um I just want to say one thing on
the question of the future vision just
from the perspective of MSR and the
potential that we see we talked to
Miguel I mean definitely the idea of
using cameras or connect ceiling-mounted
something where we could track students
hands and bring this at a lot less
invasive input into a multi law systems
is really exciting but as you mentioned
not here yet not here by the dessin
looks so far it's not so far I think
there's a lot of existing work around
tracking this kind of stuff that can be
done with simple machinery but that in
terms of the environment that the
platform I mean the way we envision this
is as it's one mass per child as a
platform where you can think of this
providing an ecosystem trying to build
up an ecosystem where a multiplicity of
partners can create little apps that fit
inside this form factor one on top of
another that use the same kinds of
iconography a common language of the
iconography plus the control sets so
that it's easy for teachers to to end
students to like just dive into this and
thinking about adaptive learning on an
even larger scale where students can be
working at different levels within the
current system but what if when a
student is finished with their work
inside of you know one topic they can
actually go to work in another topic or
even when talking about working with
teaching to the to the top end of the
class
no third or however the teachers sites
and strategize say they're teaching to
the middle third those students that are
ahead of the curve who've already
finished all their stuff they start to
get bored and start part of the
teacher's job is to try to keep them
occupied and you could give them
additional assignments or things like
that but you can even do something if
you think about games for learning what
if we just give them games not even
meaning to be educational games but but
simply as some kind of reward where you
can say that that they can those kids
can play a little you know a little
drops of inter or or farmville or
whatever the heck it is that it uses
them and it keeps them occupied and also
see acts as sort of an extrinsic
motivation and incentive for the other
kids to get finished up getting
sorry trap I would say the synchronous
days to find out games where the rules
of the game are intrinsic that I would
get roles this this is the secret that
they really this again very engaging
game but Coulomb's law who could believe
that the people want to play glomps law
you know if you never pay some little
skeptical about that claim because you
know if you think about first-person
shooter like it's based on physics but
you're not really learning physics by
playing the sugar you know like I mean
even though the mechanism of control is
cold slaw like they're learning that oh
if I moved this guy close to this that
he moves further away and with this one
and this other negative one that it gets
closer and things like that's an
alerting kind of how to control which is
fun and I would agree that they're
getting intuition you know for how how
the electrical fields are working but
but you know yeah you know yeah yeah it
it's not everything there yeah it's not
everything there of course that's why I
said you have to integrate its not only
the theater I said it you have to have
other resources to and then that at
the end I think there's other ways we
can grab this and we talked a lot about
brain games wrapping games
educational for educational experiences
but you can almost imagine a wrapping
education around a core game experience
with this you know for example if you
have say 20 students you have their
little one ounce per child context
around a shared window where they're
catching fish or building a castle or
engaging some cooperative play where
every time they complete one of their
little drill assignments it's filling in
this picture or filling in pictures of a
puzzle so you create that sort of magic
circle of gaming around something that
you don't have to worry about because I
agree with you transfer is a huge
question and with traditional
entertainment it is the problem but what
if we just have them work and we put the
game in a separate context so that the
two don't why do we have to blend them
together of it they have um thank you
everybody for coming out and I hope this
was entertaining and it might be just in
terms of our next steps you know we're
looking to try to help Miguel to scale
this thing out we want to go to a
hundred schools in Costa Rica okay next
year that's that's the at least the near
term goal so anyone out there watching
this if you think you can help let us
know and thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
