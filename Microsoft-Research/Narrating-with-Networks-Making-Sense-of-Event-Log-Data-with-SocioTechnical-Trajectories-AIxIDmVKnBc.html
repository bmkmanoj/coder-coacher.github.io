you
welcome everyone today we have Brian
Keegan he's a data scientist or never
scientist he's a postdoctoral researcher
in northeastern university with David
Lazar mr. David SR and he got his PhD in
northwestern university so he's gonna
talk about narrating with data today
Thank You Andres well thank you for
being here I'm excited to be here and
talk about some of my works is actually
the sort of first time I'm giving like
this version of the talk so hopefully
you guys won't begrudge me when you see
another version of this probably five
years from now as I refine it so this is
the outline my talk and we'll come back
this slide more and more but I want to
sort of give you a little context from
where I come from a network science for
good particular type of network science
that I do they go into sort of the event
log data that I like to work with and
how I kind of turn these into
socio-technical trajectories then I walk
through go through three different cases
and sort of at differing levels of
abstraction from very sort of find a
very sort of macro level of what we can
do with the socio-technical directory
approach and then we'll wrap up with the
discussion and so I differentiated on
that first slide between sort of network
science and network theory and so when
we think of network science we usually
think of someone like a professor
berrabah she here who was the mayor sort
of instrumental in sort of thinking
about how to be sort of model networks
and develop statistical models of
networks and they're very much concerned
with how examining the similarities
across different kinds of networks that
we look at biological or social
information networks we see very sort of
similar patterns in the topology in the
structure these networks their scale
free and have sort of various or skewed
degree distributions like that bottom
image there but these models that they
often sort of instrument coming from
sort of the physics side of things
usually assume that people are sort of
protons or proteins or particles and
they don't really start differentiate
between what it is that we're modeling
the interaction that we're modeling here
but they're very sort of interesting and
powerful models because you specify sort
of these these microscopic models like
how a single
behaves and how they sort of make
individual sort of choices you're able
is generate these very complex sort of
macroscopic sort of processes but this
whole sort of domain of network science
really ignores of a lot of the economic
and political implications of what these
network features mean what does it mean
you know for our society or for our
legal system or for how we allocate
resources to have something that is sort
of skewed in these sorts of ways we just
kind of they come from respected like
this is what it looks like let's try to
explain that the other side we have
someone like Professor benkler here who
also talks about networks but you talked
about networks in a very different way
in which how does sort of new
information technologies enable us to
sort of develop new forms of
organization new ways of knowledge
production and very much focused on
these questions of sort of what the
economic legal sort of political
implications of having a network
political economy what does it mean to
have a Wikipedia or Linux or something
where people are able to collaborate and
get in large ways to kind of create new
forms of knowledge new sorts of
artifacts I don't know if I'm allowed to
show the linux penguin here at Microsoft
but so but he also sort of very
concerned with nothing sort of
microscopic questions like how to node
make links to each other but these
macroscopic sort of concerns about what
does it mean to have like a polarized
blogosphere like this image from a lot
of damages work back in 2005 and but at
the same time like when he talks about
networks he doesn't talk about in the
same way that berrabah she would talk
about it where you know we're looking at
sort of the particular kinds of
structures and how these networks
similar different so banglar sort of
ignores these sorts of one of the
network features that generate these
kind of particular Wikipedia or Linux
our Wikipedia Linux similar or the peep
the way that they collaborate similar
what does that mean for them be similar
distantly and so beyond the sort of the
need that we need to reconcile the fact
they've got social scientists and
physicists kind of doing these different
sorts of things different methods you
know benkler on one hand you know they
don't really know don't speak to each
other often about what it is that these
networks they both talk about networks
they talk about that works in very
different ways so benkler talks about
like what does it he's really silent on
what does it mean for these different
sorts of collaborators how do they sort
of form into cohesion how do they
produce
this knowledge what are those structures
look like how are they different
berrabah she's really sort of quiet on
the fact that what does it mean for the
implications what are the outcomes of
these network processes what does it
mean for these networks to sort of what
is it that they kind of produce and so I
think we need to and what I'm going to
talk about here is how we're going to
sort of understand the structural
characteristics of self-organization in
a variety of ways and how we can develop
some methods that allows sort of compare
how do we do had we observe sort of
self-organization in sort of these
large-scale socio technical systems in
particularly sort of this idea of stigma
gene so this is sort of a theory from
biology we're sort of there's actors in
an environment and they don't sort of
their self organized and they coordinate
their work not by sort of directly
communicating with each other but
actually sort of modifying the
environment around them and then they
sort of incrementally build upon other
people's contributions behind them so so
you guys incremental contributions in
the shared information environment are
the ways that work is coordinated it's
not the sort of direct communication so
how do we sort of and so my assertion is
that we would see sort of similar sorts
of processes sigma g happening in these
socio technical systems it's not sort of
direct interactions what we want to look
for but rather sort of the processes of
modifying each other's work is what's
the sort of the opera relationship that
we should be examining here and so to do
that I want to sort of go over what an
event log is and what event logs are in
a variety of different sorts of systems
here and so on Wikipedia if you go to
any sort of Wikipedia article you can go
and click on the revision history you'll
get sort of a segment that will look
like this we've got a list of all the
different contributions that editors
maids in this case you've got editors
who are IP addresses or BOTS or a person
right here with a timestamp and they're
adding content or the removing content
you can compare the differences between
that and the previous version we could
do that and something like github but is
also event logs a sort of document all
the changes that have been made to a
particular code repository again got a
person making a change that you can look
at this or the difference between that
with a time stamp this particular kind
of action like an edit or commit on
reddit you've also got people who are
participating and kind of creating a
comment thread it sort of the co here
that allows us to sort of see you know
they emerges into so whole sort of
narrative of people interacting and
producing this one kind of sort of
knowledge artifact in a way that the
whole thread is something you can read
through but again they're sort of
modifying the previous person to the
thread with the timestamp and so forth
or even something like scratch or you
can go through and see whether or not
people sort of history of the changes
that have been making to the system as a
whole if they've been loving or
favoriting or liking something in an
online community like scratch so what
all these event logs we have these sorts
of activities that people take that they
make a commit they make a revision they
make a comment within a system and
there's records of that there's a case
that they're doing this to something
that it could be to a repository or a
particular code Bank B to a Wikipedia
article could beat to a discussion
thread and read it or something like
that we've got a record of a performer
like who is actually doing this could be
a user on red on a github it could be an
editor on wikipedia it could be a member
of an online community it could be a
human editor it could be a bot an
automated sort of entity then we also
have an order that we have sort of these
things happen in a sequence and this is
sort of really crucial and I'll explain
why in a second that these you can sort
basically these records in a way based
on time or in position or depth on a
thread and that this this time order is
actually can become very sort of
interesting is that if you do sort it
you take sort of it the Wikipedia
history log here we've got or github
we've got sort of people making commits
to a specific sort of Wikipedia article
for example and editor a made a
contribution at article X at time 1 01 @
x your 202 we see the sort of event log
sort of emerged and so this is sort of
the general abstract way that we can
look at an event log but I'll explain
why so this temporal ordering is
important in a second here this is what
sort of the socio-technical trajectory
is that the core sort of looking at
these relationships within these event
logs and so before I get to that I want
to talk about you know when we've looked
at sort of the scholarship has looked at
sort of the socio-technical systems
before they very much sort of focused on
you know these questions of
self-organization hierarchy that I'm
also interested in of open source
systems and so on so the huge sort of
literature on this but sort of the
relationship that they look at here
often this relationship like who works
on what articles so its user a so you've
got a note who's a user in another node
who's an artifact so user a might have a
relationship with an artifact user is
making a contribution or an edit or a
commit or something to artifact X like
that and then so you say well ok we can
mine that event log we can take all
these different relationships we can
create some beautiful picture like this
wow you've got the all these red nodes
there like articles on Wikipedia and the
blue nodes or the editors you're editing
them and you see like oh there's like
this complexity and heterogeneity and
you know there's some some clustering
down here and there's some other ones
are kind of isolated but you know
they're all sort of connected and you
can do all these sorts a really
interesting network analysis but if you
wanted to kind of zoom in and like look
at what did the collaboration look like
on one article is a great we can do it
across a bunch of articles that's really
interesting but what does it look like
on one article so if we go back to that
sort of event the article trajectory or
the sort of this individual sort of
history of contributions you know the
way that we do that sort of
traditionally is we'd say like okay at
time one like editor a made a
contribution to article x and the time
to be came along and made a contribution
at time three so you came along made a
contribution the time for a came back
and made another contribution so maybe
we make that line a little bit thicker
but it's unclear like the ordering what
you know we can't sort of discern what
the ordering is on the system and maybe
d comes and makes another contribution
and maybe a makes the six contribution
there at the end and so when this we see
we see the emergence of a structure but
what comes out of that for looking at
just a single artifact if you're looking
at just how a single Wikipedia article
or a single github repo is edited if we
do the sort of metric we like we get
networks that look like this where
you've got the Wikipedia article or
something at the center and then
everyone who edited it and there's no
sort of heterogeneity there's nothing
sort of interesting that's going on in
terms of who's editing water who's
working with whom right you know it's
just sort of very simple sort of story
so instead is if we sort of drawn this
other sort of literature about narrative
networks and sequence analysis and
process data and we're looking at the
sequencing of events right like the
interactions are like someone modifying
after someone else these processes of
things unfolding and taking turns and
all these sorts of this is rich sort of
literature
sequences and cycles and processes right
so if we instead look to these things
and ask a different kind of question of
who modifies whose work so it's not that
like a is editing article x but on
article x who's working with whom on
that and then we particular look at the
sequence of events that user B modifies
user aids version that you zerbies
editing immediately after user a so like
by implication user B is modifying user
A's state of the article instead so
those relationships begin to look like
this that you have this activist is
modifying Ken Devo so that at he had a
particular change a particular point in
time it may not have been editing you
know this particular set of phrases but
you know when he last touched the
article is what the article looked like
and this guy comes through and makes a
quick change like this stuff used to be
all caps and so he's going to go through
and say like actually kind of do it more
traditionally how we would write a
headline like that and so that so the
MOT the relationship here is that apt
Avaaz modifying so it can evolve like
only article for a brief point in time
like that's what the article look like
then this editor comes along and
modifies that stay the article modifying
what aptima had done before and if we
will get like github you can also see
that you know we've got people removing
some code and adding other types of code
like this and so when a previous person
to own this sort of article for however
what brief time some other person comes
along and modifies that state of the
article right so if we look at that and
sort of abstract sort of trajectory
approached we've the relationships all
of a sudden art that is editing X is
that a that be following a and sees
following be and then a is following see
these following it in a is following me
right so this is the sort of operate
sequence the relationship that we look
at but like you also have this repeated
sort of you've got the same editors
appearing or the same users appearing
over and over again so we can sort of
collapses down to a graph there's only
one kind of user so like a only appears
once and then be modifies A's version
and see modifies B's version that a
modified sees version and so we don't
have another a that goes back to a we
create the cycle all of a sudden that
the the narrative comes out of the fact
that we're not sort of
like modeling sort of each sort of point
in time that each individual edit button
editor owns a particular edit that edit
could come back to you or go go go away
from you but you sort of are represented
in the same way over time so the cycle
here we're like people it came back to a
decided to jump back into the
collaboration he wasn't happy with what
C had done or he was happy I wanted to
keep building on it and then D comes
along and wants to modify A's version
and a still doesn't like that so what we
begin to see out of the sequence all the
Sun is a much sort of Richard more
heterogeneous picture of heterogeneous
picture of this sort of collaboration
was not the simple star anymore you've
got sort of rich even from this toy
example much more sort of complex
network of merging and then if we
actually sort of applied the sort of
method to an article like Wikipedia in
particular breaking news article which
is something I'm very interested I have
these collaborations on wikipedia
articles about breaking news events are
different from other types of
collaborations on Wikipedia if we look
at sort of an individual article and we
use this sort of method we all of us in
heaven a network that looks like this
that's sure it's a hairball but it's
also much more complex and structured
heterogeneous I can't pronounce that
word today for some reason right but so
all of a summary of this network and
this is the article about the 2011
japanese earthquake and tsunami and so
the nodes here again are the editors as
before the relationships are f1 edit or
modified or previous editors version of
that article and so the nodes here are
sized how big they are is is how many
sort of other editors work they've
modified but we can begin to overlay
some more information on this right so
we're going to dive a little bit deeper
into this Japanese earthquake article so
this is the same image as before and so
I've only added this the coloring of the
nodes but this isn't any sort of new
information that we didn't already have
in the event log this isn't sort of new
independent observations what it is is
just that we're going to color the nodes
a bluer color if they edited the article
earlier and we're going to color the
nodes in a gradient towards like a
redder color if they join the
collaboration they started editing later
so it becomes really apparent is that
all of a sudden then the very sort of
early stage of this article these blue
editors working together when the
article
very young they're modifying each
other's work in the first sort of hours
or minutes after this this event occurs
you see this very sort of dense pattern
of work where they're sort of passing
the article around to each other and
it's this very sort of dense pattern you
have this sort of this very prominent
central person here is a blue editor he
or she joined this collaboration sort of
very early but then you also see this
sort of these red editors out here right
and so these these people have a very
different sort of pattern right so this
is sort of like this hairball dense
clustered highly sort of cooperative
sort of work but out here you've got
these sorts of strings which sort of
things get passed out and so they look
like these giant like orbits and this is
mainly just an artifact of the
visualization sort of algorithm that i
use to kind of spring embedding but by
implication what it means is that these
editors you know they this guy makes a
revision and this guy's modifying that
guy's version this person's want to find
that person's revision but the fact that
you have this sort of string we're like
they make a revision but then like no
one else all these other people have
made a revision we've contributed
something this article don't decide to
jump in and like modify this person's
version they leave it to some other
newcomer to come and modify that version
says something really sort of deep but
that's sort of the way does
collaborations unfolding that these
people have left the collaboration and
instead we've got sort of these new
people coming in and modifying it but
they can't be bothered to sort of
continued in the collaboration at a
later point in time because if they
continue to collaborate they move to the
center they would be working with other
people it be modifying other editors
work as well and so okay so we can sort
of look at sort of different features of
different things here so we have like
the first editors here so these are the
again the first editors who made the
earliest contributions to the articles
but they don't sort of persist like they
they work together very early on but
like as new editors came in and more
work is being done they're not here in
the center these editors left right they
edited at a very early stage and didn't
continue to sort of persist you got sort
of core group of editors for editing
very sort of intensively with each other
and another group of early editors like
I mentioned we got these sort of
peripheral editors who join much later
and are working together in a very diff
sort of way then you get this one sort
of highly central person who's making
contributions and then you also got some
other people out here who are sort of
highly central but like in a different
way and they're because they're
surrounded by different colors like this
blue purse is working with other blue
nodes here they're working with other
blue editors they're working with other
editors who join relatively early this
editor is modifying the work of other
editors who join much later and in fact
if you kind of zoom in and look at what
he was doing it's actually not a he or
she it's a robot who's just modifying
the work of vandals these are people
joined very late so he joined relatively
early because this greenish color but
then the only work he does and sort of
modifying other sort of vandals so he's
reverting the work of other vandals that
people come by and blank the page or say
you know that tsunami was awesome they
try to undo that sort of work
automatically but we can also sort of
color the nodes a different way and
again we're not introducing any new
information we we just we know like when
the editors started editing we know when
the sort of the last observation they
edited and so we can say when did they
sort of stop editing so when was the
last observation when they were editing
so again these bluer colors would
suggest that they joined early but they
also stopped at 18 earlier this person
joined early as before but this greenish
color says he stopped editing sort of it
at a medium stage but the you've also
got these editors here sort of who were
blue before but are now sort of red and
they're sort of like the core editors
use of people who joined very early and
are still editing much later up until
sort of the present day and so we begin
to see if see the sort of the emergency
social roles of people being custodians
of trying to maintain these articles
over time and we get out we can do other
sorts of layout algorithms here as well
but these attributes there's other
attributes that we can specify for these
networks right so that because we're
looking at these event logs that we know
like how much time is elapsed between
edits and that's sort of the Opera
lationship that we're looking at how
much time has gone on between these we
begin to say we can use that as another
attribute that we can bring in like so
these relationships of editor be
modifying deaded arrays work that's
editor be edited after editor a we can
also say that editor be edited some time
after edit
we can put on like a Latin see we can
also go in and say what was the size of
that difference of how much content
where they adding or removing we could
even look at her that the features of
the content so he was so the network as
we had it before if we wanted to kind of
just subset the data and just look at
what does this network look like when we
just look at relationships that are
happening very intensively very quickly
people modifying each other's work like
in less than 60 seconds then we again
sort of unpack the sort of this backbone
of work you know largely among the early
editors we also see it among this vandal
fighter here is has a sort of a very
distinctive pattern and sort of quickly
modify and other people's work we also
see that this very sort of sensual
person all of a sudden does have that
many strong ties anymore but we do see
very sort of strong ties out here that
these are sort of people who are editing
but very early on the articles history
but it's also one so the most intense
work was going on that people are trying
to like work together really quickly
they're modifying each other's work you
know like with less than 60 seconds
going by then we can also look at this
in a different way and say like let's
just look at the subset of the nodes
just like remove a bunch of nodes here
and only retain the nodes if those
editors have ever added it more than
who've ever added more than sort of 50
bytes like they've ever added more than
a sentence worth of content so again
these are all the editors who've ever
touched the page and ever made a change
to the page if we ask the question like
who's added more than like a sentence
worth of content all of a sudden network
becomes much more sparse right so the
work that all these people are doing
that these other sort of thousand others
were doing is incredibly sort of micro
sort of level work that they're changing
particular sort of commas or you know
they're doing stuff that's you know less
than 50 bytes of work and when you look
at just the work of people who've added
ever added more than 50 bytes of content
to this article you get a sort of very
different picture and a lot of sort of
very essential people that we'd saw
before don't appear there anymore we
still be sort of two central people here
we're going to explore them in a bit and
so so I pointed out those two sort of
people at the bottom and so just like I
did before is that we what we dove in
and we looked at the event log for a
Wikipedia article or we could do this
for any sort of artifact sort of event
log we can do the same for editors we
can do the same for users we
can say we can go in this case this is
my sort of edit history most recently
and so this is the history of all the
stuff that I've been doing most recently
and we can go back and look at all
10,000 edits that I've made to Wikipedia
but we can again sort of go through and
say like there's a relationship that I
went from editing the article that John
riedel's editing the article about this
wiki talk page and I did that after the
social network so I'm kind of jumping
around all these different topics but if
we kind of aggregate that up and look at
sort of the network of all these sort of
relationships what does that look like
so again if I'm the sort of performer X
and instead of making changes to these
different articles we can model at the
exact same way analogously that I
started editing at our clay that I jump
to particle B then C that maybe we went
back to a that I went to D and then i
went to a and all of a sudden we get
networks that look like this and so
there again these are sort of very
unusual some of these that these
features are sort of we don't usually
see you network so used to seeing these
sort of core periphery these complex
sort of hair balls and things like that
but we see what some of these editors we
see very sort of these different sorts
of patterns where you've got this person
was the sort of that Stewart that's sort
of very strong central person up there
so this user's name was flooded so we
can see where they started editing so
the initial at is that he ever made to
Wikipedia where's about the 2011 tucson
shooting again these nodes are articles
not editors anymore the relationship is
if they edited one article after another
so Jesus earliest edits are to this
other sort of breaking news event she's
adding this article about this breaking
news event and then you know that of it
sorted dies down he starts editing
articles about like mobile phones and so
he's kind of like off in the wilderness
he's often him with wilderness like
literally like editing articles of
Antarctica and then the 2011 so the
tucson shooting happened in january and
that earthquake and tsunami happened in
april so when this happens this event
happens in april this person all some
like lights back up he's really in the
thick of editing this article about this
earthquake and tsunami the article said
he's editing here i've colored in
different ways so the blue articles are
like the wikipedia articles that we see
so these like the front page sort or the
the articles that 99% of us read and
look at the pink articles are the things
that like the talk page where you
discussions about what we should do or
what we shouldn't do we've also got
these brown pages which are sort of more
sort of highly specialized pages of bad
sort of templates and sort of their
infrastructure pages then you've also
got sort of these turquoise pages which
are really a sort of the The Pinker ones
are sort of user talk pages so he's
talking to other users about what should
be done and then this light blue article
is actually the talk page for that
article so we see this he's jumping
around he's talking to other users about
what they should be doing he's jumping
to the article about the talk page
trying to get other people work in a
certain way he's jumping this other
article about how do we sort of like get
the number of deaths out and so on and
so this person engaged in the sort of
variation sort of patter behavior that
he did some breaking new stuff and
didn't and then did it then also became
very active and then did nothing else
after this then we could look at other
editors too so there were these two
other editors that we saw down here
right so one of them is sandpiper if we
do the same sort of method we look at
his history but he's done before we get
this network where he started off
editing hard articles about harry potter
and then he jumps up and starts editing
articles about the nuclear disaster in
the tsunami they start editing articles
about cutty sark which is this british
ship and also a kind of bad scotch all
right but what's interesting is that the
work that he was doing here on Harry
Potter doesn't seem to qualify mall to
edit articles about nuclear disasters or
tsunamis are things like that no Harry
Potter's on its surface nothing really
to do with a breaking news event but at
the same time Harry Potter is something
that's always in the news right it's
like people always kind of coming by
like you should put the spoilers in
there you know you know this article's
you know should have more stuff on
Hermione but not as much about Harry
whatever rights people want to use is
like a fan site or something like that
so the work that he does on the harry
potter site is like being the dispute
sort of arbitration stuff that you've
got all these sorts of light turquoise
blue articles so he's on the talk page
saying like guys stuff should be done
like we should be chill out you know
like this is the rules is how things
should get done and so he sort of brings
that expertise about like how do we sort
of like somebody that's always in the
news and very sort of prominent he
brings out expertise and starts editing
that on the sort of the nuclear disaster
and tsunami pages so relatable sort of
my great that expertise from one area
book a pd a-- to another and a sort of
flux
and the ability to do that really sort
of interesting sort of this the
socio-technical approach is able to sort
of illustrate that know these things to
have highly cluster and very distinct
for some editors but they still make
these transitions then you've got this
other sort of editor who's trajectories
are much more sort of incoherent and
sort of more hair Bali that we would see
then sort of a distinct of structures
before but we still see that there's
sort of some structure here that says
that here is his stuff that he's doing
on the Japanese article on the Japanese
articles and then a lot of has worked
before like on environmental
organizations international trade
agreements but again you see the sort of
migration of expertise where he's very
much an expert's or nuclear policy and
international trade agreements about
nuclear issues and bringing that to the
nuclear disaster as well and I mentioned
before that this blue collar was very
sort of important this is sort of my
favorite case here is that you've got
this one editor who only edits he
doesn't do any of the sort of the
background coordination stuff he just
wants to edit articles that are like
just the content of articles that's all
he cares about so after the tsunami yet
all these towns the cities that were
wiped out so he's editing all those
articles well all the work that he did
before was about like Japan and Japanese
poppins Japanese serial killers and
again nothing would seem to qualify an
editor who bought writes about Japanese
serial killers Japanese pop bands to
edit an article about a huge natural
disaster like this but for the fact that
he obviously someone who lives in Japan
it has allowance for cultural
familiarity with you know what are the
towns and one of the landmarks that we
need to update about this and so we see
again him migrating from this early sort
of work they resume before down to
migrating to the work on these effective
towns and landmarks there's ways that we
could lay this out again to show that
not only did he go from editing this
stuff to specialize in this for a while
but that we he actually went back to
doing what he was doing before and I
haven't shown that here and so this was
just a single case study coming back so
this is just a single case study about
so this this the editors and the single
sort of set of articles around this
Japanese earthquake and tsunami but if
we sort of begin to sort of look up
another sort of level we look at a whole
class of articles in this case we'll get
a class of articles about airline
disasters we can sort of if we do the
sort of method I just
I before if we look at there's these
different sources of airline crash
articles on Wikipedia if we look at
their particle trajectories their
artifacts ejector either like which
editors are modifying which other
editors work we can concede by sort of
visual inspection there's two very
distinct classes of networks that come
out of this right so on the top we have
these sort of characteristics so this is
what networks often look like with the
core periphery it's sort of like the
hairball so these are sort of the
hairball networks on top but the bottom
these are also networks but we'd never
see networks like this in sort of nature
or any sort of social system like this
but these are also networks that we see
Wikipedian and the distinction between
these articles is that these articles on
top were authored as breaking news
events that the event happen and within
like a few minutes of the event
happening people were jumping in and
trying to edit this article these were
articles about things that happen years
by years and years had passed so that
you know that this you know airline
crash happened like the nineteen
mid-1990s both of them and so obviously
there's no book the PD around and so ten
years went by before anyone got around
to writing these articles but as a
result we see that the structure these
collaborations are very different the
ways that we produce the knowledge about
these there's the same sort of content
is are both aircraft like airline crash
articles but the way that this knowledge
was produced was produced in very
different ways and we see those
structures very sort of clearly so we
can measure that with a variety of
different sorts of like network measures
that we could say we want to sort of
measure this hair baldness of the
networks right we want to say that this
one of the left is more of a hairball
than the one on the right so we can
operationalize that in like at least
four different ways there's many other
ways we can do it as well these are sort
of very easy to compute and easy to sort
of understand methods and so you say
that short diameter is like how wide is
the graph how many steps would you have
to go between sort of different hops to
say from one note to the other the
longest the shortest longest path so the
one on the left you have a shorter
diameter that these editors can just
jump from one to the other would be
relatively easy to get from one together
if you computed that statistic versus
this person you have to jump through
every single editor these are extremes
obviously but they're illustrative
because this wood has a very short one
the one on the right have a very long
diameter closest centrality would be a
measure of how close are nodes to each
other can they sort
reach many other nodes in a few steps
and if we measure that across we average
that across all in those the graph that
you know this one on the left the
editors are sort of more close to other
editors in general and the one on the
right these editors are relatively far
apart an average from other editors and
so the one on the left we expect to be
more closeness the 12 right there would
be less closeness between this is sort
of this interesting idea like brokering
that you kind of connect editors who are
other who'd otherwise be unconnected but
here we could think about between us not
as sort of this classic idea like
brokerage but instead is like a measure
like fragility that if you like took out
that node like with the graph suddenly
become disconnected in a average sort of
sense that on the graph on the left you
know there's sort of overall low between
us because there's no sort of single
central know that goes like a point of
failure versus the graph on the right
all every single node is a point of
failure you've got any one of them they
all have very high sort of between a
central t then finally clustering this
one is more clustering more of its
editors work with other editors who
themselves have edited with the one on
the right no one is editing with anyone
else except the person immediately
before them and so if we look at so we
do a statistical model and we ask are
these sort of breaking these articles
different in aggregate if we look across
this whole set of articles about airline
disasters we do see that depending on
how long it takes for that article will
be created we see that there's shorter
diameters there's more closeness there's
less between a some more clustering so
across all four features we find
evidence that in fact these breaking
news articles have more of this hairball
in this pattern that non-breaking
articles right so these breaking these
articles are in facts from structurally
different from non breaking these
articles and that's largely a function
of how much time it takes for those
articles to be created well then we also
have this idea that you know these
article these trajectories also capture
something about that the temporality of
these collaborations that you know if we
look at some of these editors you know
join start editing at a particular point
in time the collaboration is a
characteristic sort of pattern you like
and the early stages maybe it's highly
clustered and look something like this
where again these are editors who are
working with each other at a very sort
of early point in time but if we look at
sort of the collaboration much much
later
like this again is the the japanese
example that has perhaps a very
different sort of structure that that s
but even though it's the same article so
that the way that they're collaborating
on these articles made itself be
changing over time that as time goes on
they may look sort of highly clustered
and hair bali very early on but later on
it main facts or revert back to sort of
like how non-breaking articles are
edited so we can again sort of estimate
a model down here and say that you know
is it the case that the way that the
structure these collaborations at a
later point in time if we just subset
that data do those collaborations later
on look very different from those
collaboration sort of very early on in
fact that we do we see that they sort of
regress to the mean that they begin as
time goes on these breaking news
articles this this cluster enos of them
is only occurs in the immediate sort of
aftermath and sort of day zero through
seven but if we look sort of later on
these articles begin to get longer
diameters they begin to have less
clothes and it's begin it more between
us they begin have less clustering so
here we again sort of find evidence that
this way of collaborating by using sort
of trajectory method we find that this
way of collaborating is very sort of
unique the immediate aftermath of these
events that we see that that sort of
effect begins to go away as time goes on
and they begin to look more and more
like normal collaborations so these
differences actually do not persist over
time and so the sort of last case want
to talk about here is we talked about
like a single case about an article and
some of the editors who contributed to
it then we look this early class of like
all these articles about like airline
disasters if we begin to look at like a
set of like three thousand articles
about hurricanes we look at articles
about airline crashes we look about like
accidents industrial disasters and
wildfires and health outbreaks we look
like really broaden the scope to include
all these different kinds of articles on
Wikipedia we can ask as some other sorts
of questions and so we can begin to
imagine like we layer these trajectories
one on top of another so before we're
only looking at trajectories and like
within a single article so within the
Japanese earthquake disaster article for
example right but what if we said well
there's a set of editors who edit this
article well maybe some of them also
edit articles about airline crashes we
can like layer these sort of
trajectories one on top of each other
and like look at the union or the
intersect
of these and what does that sort of
trajectory look like and so we can say
that on one article may be editor a
works with you know modifies the work of
editor be not an article to editor a
modifies the work of article be but
these relationships pond article one and
article to both the qur'anic breaking
news articles and so we can say we can
complete these are the same editors
there can actually two different kinds
of relationships and we can collapse of
two different kinds of relationships
into a single relationship where there's
a weight they bet they work together in
two different articles but on those two
articles both of them or a hundred
percent of that work was done on
breaking these articles will give it
like a redder color and so we can color
these edges by different sorts of colors
to say like maybe the bluer ones are non
breaking articles so they work together
on a breaking news article in a
non-breaking article and so they still
work together to articles will give it a
different color because its a mix
different types of articles here and so
if we again run this across all three
thousand articles we get a nice picture
like this and so again these sort of
gray nodes here are the editors and
these are editors who interacted across
two or more articles and so this is the
sort of the zoomed in giant component of
this and so the redder colors that
connect some editors to other editors
mean that they interact a lot on
breaking news articles and if they have
a blue color that means they interact
exclusively on these non breaking
articles right and then we've got sort
of these colors that like green which
means they sort of interact on a mix of
like breaking and non-breaking articles
and so we see there is in fact like a
strong sort of core of editors here who
edit across many different sort of
breaking news articles they worked
exclusively together on breaking news
articles given the sort of red color and
then there's other editors you know who
appear to work together repeatedly but
on non breaking news articles and so on
but this this cluster down here sort of
really interesting and illustrative so
these are editors right we're working
together they've we've got records of
them modifying each other's work across
many different kinds of articles it's
extremely dentist almost as dense as we
would see up there but it's also removed
that they're not actually working with
those editors or modifying those editors
work they're modifying each other's work
across many different articles but not
necessarily modifying these other
editors work they kind of just work by
themselves and their
to be isolated but not completely but
it's also there's interesting color
right it's they're not working only on
breaky and they're not working only on
non breaking or there's some who work
only on breaking but there's a lot here
who work on like a mix almost a perfect
mix of Breaking and non-breaking so
these are editors who added stuff about
tropical cyclones so this is like a
really interesting sub-community on
wikipedia where wikipedia has used wiki
projects where people sort of get really
excited about editing articles about
military history or roads and bridges
and so there's a group of folks who just
like to edit or create articles but
every single hurricane and tropical
cyclone that's ever existed so they
write this in a very formalized like
standard way that this the storm
developed is a squall off the coast of
Africa and then moved off became like a
tropical depression but this kind of
barometric sort of characteristics and
so on so they just have this sort of
like almost like a perfect wave like
just writing these articles this copy
and pasting them almost and then filling
in just like what change for these
different articles and so we see is that
these people are editing they kind of
show up in my breaking news corp is
because obviously there's breaking news
articles these hurricanes are breaking
news articles often but these people are
also working together on because they
care about hurricanes they don't care
about breaking news articles so they're
also editing these other articles about
you know hurricanes that happened 50
years ago but they were working together
and so what this method is really
uncovered is by identifying these
trajectories overlap eating this way but
we've highlighted like a community of
practice and this is what we would call
like a community of practice in a very
sort of traditional way this people who
are like kind of jointly attending the
same sort of topic and there's ways sort
of join the community and indirect
boundaries that they're not sort of part
of the rest of the community engaged in
particular kind of work that they care
about that's differentiated and so on
and so these trajectories approach that
I've sort of proposed and sort of I
think that I try to demonstrate here it
has as we've gone from like this very
sort of abstract idea that there's sort
of these event logs where a sort of we
can see that someone edited after
someone else and we've arrived at this
place where all of a sudden that we can
begin to sort of uncover these sort of
really complex and interesting sort of
anomalies in this this data by using
this method
so I just want to wrap up here with the
discussion so that these event logs are
ways to sort of narrate changes to
artifacts Wikipedia articles or github
repositories and users over time right
these are the history of someone
becoming an identity or articles sort of
becoming more complex or something like
that right that we can go through and
look at in previous points in time of
what these articles are with these
artifacts what these user looked at and
are doing in previous points in time
these event logs are pervasive
throughout a lots of different socio
technical systems we see them and github
we see them Wikipedia we see them in
scratch we see them in reddit and so on
we can go through and find these data
almost everywhere and yet we don't sort
of realize the potential that we can
begin to build relationships out of
these right that if we look at these
sort of temporal adjacencies the fact
that I work immediately after Scott who
works immediately after Andreas all of a
sudden we can begin to start or say do
some really interesting things about
creating these trajectories that have
these really sort of complex interesting
behavior right that that they collapse
this sort of very large scale data into
this sort of nice sort of graphical
representation that we can then begin to
do sort of traditional sort of social
network analysis things on right and
that they capture this idea the stigma
gee that they're sort of we've got this
accumulation this gradual accumulation
of effort of individual contributions
create these sort of very emergent sort
of complex structures again like we're
not sort of looking at sort of content
level features that what we were working
on the same sentence or anything like
that which is the fact that I edit after
all andreas or something like that but
by aggregating these sorts of
interactions up together we could be
sort of very interesting and very
complex structures are non-trivial and
they reveal these sort of the patterns
within these trajectories begin to
highlights or the social and temporal
context of work right that it's it's we
see that in the community of practice
with the sort of the hurricane editors
we see that there's sort of more active
editors are not sort of deeply involved
in they join the article very early
right they have the blue editors they
joined very early and they stop editing
right there's sort of these interesting
sort of behaviors that we capture in
these contexts of work that people were
involved and motivated to work very
early but weren't in fact motivated to
sort of continue to work going forward
and that and so I think is most sort of
powerful
and this is probably hardest one to read
but that trajectories are also exposed
to irregularities and anomalies for sort
of like follow on qualitative analysis
that we see that this sort of the
regular pattern how these networks sort
of behave but then we see these
anomalies that there's people who are
like highly central like well what does
that mean like those editors were coming
from somewhere they had some work that
they had done before they had some work
that they were doing afterwards as well
so we only capture that in a single
snapshot but then we can begin to sort
of unpack that in a much more sort of
rich way where we see these anomalies
like the sort of group of editors we're
working together but weren't necessarily
working strongly with a lot of other
people on all these different breaking
news articles that's an incentive to
kind of dive in there and look deeply at
what's going on in there and so we were
able to sort of unpack from these
trajectories some of these sort of
interesting anomalous or structural
features that we can then begin to sort
of use to motivate sort of follow-on
sort of qualitative analysis and so I
think this approach the socio-technical
approach that I've discussed here this
is an interesting sort of like mixed
method sort of thing right that we can
both use it to sort of mine do it like
data mine now is extremely large scale
sort of databases that we have their
pervasive and all these different event
logs that we have but we can use that
sort of collapse that down to something
that's real relatively easier to
comprehend you can make a net marketa
that we can make begin to run through
the network analyses on that and then we
can begin to see there's the anomalies
that then we can use to motivate some
interesting qualitative analysis and
kind of tie these things all together
really understand the complexity of
these systems so with that I'll wrap up
and thank you guys for your attention
I'll take questions so if you're sort of
praying this whole entire thing as
collaboration between people right but
then the relation
looking at our proximity and time
so like you might an article that i have
previously edited and then i might never
go back to it are we really
collaborating on something it seems to
me that this is more about like
participation so like what distinguishes
breaking from non-marine articles is the
patterns of participation not
necessarily collaboration so right so
there's probably like the language i use
and i think that you know we can sort of
split hairs here a balance or
coordination collaboration and all these
sorts of things right but it's important
to sort of like separate those out
absolutely but what I think what one
thing I think you brought up though is
the fact that the fact that these
relationships are actually really
implicit that like in social network
analysis we often assume that like we
make an act of choice to email someone
to talk to someone like that's it like
sittin agentic like I decided to talk to
you but not someone else but in fact
what this method is sort of uncovering
or they started more implicit or like
unassuming ties I might be modifying an
article not know that it was your
version the article but and so that's
just maybe purely coincidence maybe
that's all we're capturing but if there
was sort of really all pure coincidence
then you would just sort of see these
random graphs or sort of nothing's
really happening but we're actually
seeing something very different where we
see that there's these patterns of
activity that there's like you're
engaging and then I'm engaged and then
the fact that you don't engage anymore
says something about how this
collaboration is working right that you
chose not to engage anymore you're not
sort of paying attention this anything
that this isn't something that you care
about potentially could be captures
something about do we pay attention to
each other sort of work as well right
and so I think that in the sort of very
micro level like a lot of this may just
be sort of coincidental sort of ties
right but I think that by sort of
there's lots of data here you begin to
mine that up you begin to see sort of
that beginning to wash away and so that
it might be like a baseline level like
randomness in this sort of approach but
begin to be see these sort of the
structures emerged they suggest there's
something very much non random and non
coincidental about these ties have you
so you started out very motivated
have you done anything with like the
whole set of network models like
relational Network relational events so
I haven't done anything like that so
that's sort of next approach here is
that so having just done the sort of
this admittedly just purely descriptive
sort of work here say like you can
create these kinds of networks using the
server approach that these sort of very
complex features but all of a sudden gun
networks now that look like networks
that we often see in other sorts of
context so now let's begin to sort of
bring in these other sort of
methodologies that we have and social
network analysis do statistical modeling
that we can look at what's the
likelihood of some people creating ties
with each other and so on how do these
things sort of evolved can we create
sort of like Markov chains like people
making decisions about when they sort of
jump in there and so on yeah I think I
think that respective could be really
interesting because
the sequence of ties is explicit in that
model versus this where you're you're
kind of obscuring the timing of the
engines not really just like four paths
are four times all right they're all
kind of in one thing together versus
that kind of framework where you think
about like not mean yes and network by
the set of nodes where edges occurred
screaming like overtime right so these
networks are sort of unique I don't have
a sort of the graph theoretical like
mathematical background to like explain
exactly what the right word would be but
like they're unique because like you can
actually follow a path on that network
which is the editing sequence you could
like block this graph and like show like
how that sort of who's touched it when
right so that creates some biases maybe
in terms of like what kind of ties can
or can't exist right but but there's
something people thought through like
how to model this as well so it's
exciting that
I totally dig the approach of getting
down into the action in the network to
bridge the bear bossy bang Claire gap
very cool and also sort of applaud you
and it's hard to scale that up right
because you're focused on sort of
individual level actions as cool you
were able to scale it up to lighten up
um I think it's the question then is
just coming back to the you know how
does it relate to van Claire's kind of
what's important in society and so I'm
just curious I don't know for your
thoughts on what do you think are the
tightest operationalization of this work
to this sort of banglar esque what's
important for society like is it about
we can understand how different networks
in terms of the sort of activity of the
editors enable societal level
self-reflection or efficiency or sort of
information spread or what are the I
don't know yeah does that make sense it
so that's one thing that was motivating
this maybe this is the right of that way
of getting to that was that so banglar
talks about so like these forms like
network sort of knowledge production
right but you know when we talk about
like it a single artifact like how that
was produced like we have no way to
start unpacking that so I think that
this is one way to begin to see that in
fact different knowledge artifacts are
producing very different sorts of ways
and sort of this complicates this idea
that like we just call a network that's
all sudden like we can just use that as
a framework to understand like these
things are all different that actually
within the sort of network form of like
knowledge production is actually sort of
really interesting sort of differences
and how those things are done so that if
you want to get into sort of these
societal level questions it's like you
can begin to sort of get it questions
maybe got efficiency like are there some
ways that you know it was the work
that's being done this sort of highly
clustered here really redundant and
maybe it is because we saw that like a
lot not a lot of like effort was only
minority of people who weren't doing
most of the heavy lifting we're actually
making like the biggest change these
articles in fact the work there was sort
of it captures that modularity and
granularity that he talks about a lot
right but to get to that question of
sort of those outcomes that we care
about I mean it might bear on sort of
how would we go about designing systems
or dividing designed to sort of feedback
mechanisms that sort of reward people
for assuming certain kinds of social
roles and these sorts of collaborations
to incentivize them to assume roles that
make them more sort of coordinate evora
interact with money two different kinds
of editors or highlighting the fact that
they're engaged in a particular way of
collaborating and not or maybe that's
problematic or that it's
in that and so getting back to a banker
question that you know we usually
provide that feedback like monetarily or
something like that but here we begin to
use like the mind the information mind
your history to say something about and
valorize that in a certain way to say
that you're engaged in a particular
pattern of collaboration that we know
that that leads to these particular
outcomes that maybe I differentiated it
on like breaking or non breaking but
maybe like some patterns collaboration
lead to very high quality articles or
low quality articles and we want to
replicate that maybe that's just a
feature of how we generate high-quality
knowledge artifacts that we see maybe
this hair Bali is just like why some
collaborations are successful or not
because we're part of a community that I
know that Andres is looking at what I'm
doing it I'm looking at what you're
doing is we feel like there's like the
work that I contributing is kind of
going off into the void but like other
people are going to sit down and modify
it as well so in all the sorts of ways I
think that we can this framework suggest
ways that we can both study different
ways of like how valuables sort of these
artifacts could be to get that outcome
question that there's differences may be
that these structures might predict
different kinds of outcomes may predict
different sort of quality of these
artifacts
don't put it to the Select again like
when you're one of the focuses of his
work is to come up with a design
patterns for operative systems on signle
versus because it from the specific set
of cases that you looked at of breaking
news what are the kinds of take-home
messages that you will give to say
wikipedia where to be really time to
just focus on breaking news that's right
as soon as a lot of challenges like
what's not about that's not about sound
but like where are the most important
kind of lesson is that you will get from
some of the mobility in doing for
breaking into shirt so I think that the
examples the editors that we looked at
their the people reading the articles
about your pan or the editors about
Harry Potter think that in traditional
sort of organizations you know the stuff
that benkler sort of critiques that in
traditional markets or hierarchies would
say like you're not allowed to do that
you should be able to translate that
expertise to someone else somewhere else
you would have to go through an
administrator you need an accreditation
you need someone to say like it's okay
for you go over and edit these kinds of
articles and so in this network sort of
way we could begin to see the sort of
the flows of this sort of expertise in
this new domains that you wouldn't
predict would be it and so well it's
hard then is like you might be able to
sort of create a recommender system to
say that like oh it looks like you're
you like editing talk pages a lot it
seems like you're a very good sort of a
discussant or sort of arbitrator or
something like that we're having like
problems here would you mind coming over
here and like helping out this
discussion thing and so there's there's
maybe a design lever around sort of how
do we do match sort of tasks to people
better by looking at these sort of
patterns of how they work before the
kinds of work that they engaged in
before so we could begin to sort of
