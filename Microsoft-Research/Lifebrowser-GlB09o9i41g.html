Microsoft Research our team has been
looking at how to use machine learning
to better reason about how people think
and to use inferences we can make about
people to enhance their lives in fact in
this case we will show your life browser
a system that learns to predict memory
landmarks the events of life that you
would consider important and to use
those landmarks to help you navigate
large stores in this case life browser
has 20 years of my activities including
my photos my search and browsing
activity my work to create content on
the desktop my appointments and the idea
is to actually let you navigate this big
timeline of events but in this case to
give you a volume control to let you see
more or less of everything down to the
most important things to help you
navigate that timeline and to expand it
where you want selectively let's help
you navigate to places you want to go I
can also do a search for example in this
case history museum and Triple A I were
involved in working with that museum and
in the right hand column here bring up
all the relevant documents on my desktop
you know and even open up an email for
example about our interactions there and
also see what away what was going on in
my life at the time personally so life
browser has automatically picked that
event to show me as a landmark event it
is composed I set of pictures and it
lets me also browse my work activity
associated with that event now the way
it works is behind the scenes there's a
machine learn model that reasons about
each dimension of information so for
example here is a model that was learned
from input from me about what makes a
landmark meeting and what's going on in
this model is every single appointment
and there are hundreds of meetings from
my exchange calendar is being scanned by
a bayesian probabilistic model as being
assigned a probability of being a
landmark from the users point of view so
life browser is a tool that uses machine
learning behind the scenes
in a way to make it easier to browse
large personal stores of information by
providing you with the important tick
marks of life as guideposts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
