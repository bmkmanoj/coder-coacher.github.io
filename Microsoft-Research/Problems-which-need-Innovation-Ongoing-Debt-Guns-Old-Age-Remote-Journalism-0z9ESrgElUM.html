hundreds of influential speakers from

lectures freely available
so what so on and again New York Times I
think we got a little for your
institution twice today now what are you
seeing in your travels what are you
hearing today and in our own session as
well because you're you're like taya
coming in at the end of the formation
seeing it all come together so what are
you seeing well unlike these amazing
women I am NOT an innovator myself but I
often report on people who are thinking
of fresh about things and I the great
privilege of what I do is getting to go
to all kinds of different places and and
in a way cross pollinate them and so
places like Nigeria excuse me places
like India and China Brazil I'm writing
a book right now about kind of back
waters of Texas so I spent a lot of time
there last year and when you sent me
this unexpected innovation theme I kind
of thought about it two ways where am I
seeing innovation in unexpected places
but also where am I seeing problems in
these travels where we actually ought to
expect innovation but people like the
people in this room can't be interested
in those problems and since we are in
this room I thought it'd be particularly
useful to talk about what are the kinds
of problems out there that I'm seeing in
places like the back waters of Texas or
Nigeria that could really use your
intellect and your skills but which
often fail to interest people like us so
one kind of overall observation first of
all which is that one of the things
that's great in the developing world
today that has happened fairly recently
is people like the people in this room
which I'm going to keep using as a
shorthand in India and China and Brazil
have become very interested in large
scale social problems in some ways
because governments tend to be super
functional in those countries so there's
very little hope that the government
will ever solve problems like that in
part because it's kind of eighty or
ninety percent of the people who have
very hard lives in those countries not
thirty or forty or fifty percent and so
on questions like how do people make how
to poor people make payments how do you
deal with the debt cycle how do you deal
with affordability of heart surgery you
actually have a lot more smart people
interested in those problems in poor
countries than you do here even though
we have an enormous poor population an
enormous population that struggles with
very hard lives so just to pick three
issues which all of your talents would
be very useful for we have an enormous
problem with people living on a
treadmill of debt in this country and
the only people who work on this problem
as far as I can tell a predatory people
maybe i'm wrong i don't know if anybody
in this room works on that problem great
BAM next go sorted on friends successful
what else you got we just solved dead
come on now katie london with a game
that was quite amazing i bet that was a
plant though I have to admit I hate it
when there's not one a lot of work this
is this gun conversation which the
country's having right now I may be very
naive about this but at some level the
entire conversations about can we get
fifty five percent to support an assault
weapons ban or 53 or 58 and it seems to
me if any of the kinds of technologies
that you all develop were applied to
guns maybe we could invent guns that
satisfy all the NRA s concerns about
people being able to use your guns but
couldn't be used by other people
couldn't be used in various situations
because of all kinds of different
technological things that are possible
today but again people like us tend not
to be very interested in how do you make
better rifles by the way that came up in
Hunger Games so if everybody's story in
that series like
very personalized weaponry fingerprint
trigger yeah so another area which
interests me a lot and again there's
some great work the MIT has a lab doing
this is old age and thinking about a
period that is only going to get longer
and longer as we advance technologically
we don't really know what to do with
this 20 30 40 it's kind of perhaps we 50
60 year period beyond the time we have a
very clear use for people on the time
people died and people are unhealthy we
don't know how to pay for this from a
governmental point of view people are
lonely we don't know how to make use of
this surplus of lonely people to maybe
help poor inner-city kids who don't have
enough parent time and I think there
could be a whole wave of innovation so
many of our social and particularly
fiscal problems are connected to
basically this problem of old age and
health but again you don't feel the kind
of energy around those the kinds of
people who I see solving that problem in
public are you know senators from
Wisconsin and I want to see people like
you thinking about how we reinvent old
age I think there's a lot of interesting
innovation which doesn't get thought of
as an innovation in the field of what I
do in writing I think there are a lot of
writers in particular who are trying to
push past the old boundaries of writing
about places for one place writing about
foreign countries for New York or for
London there's a lot more this was a bit
discuss in the Wikipedia conversation
there's a bit more of a movement towards
kind of reference point free writing and
narrative nonfiction books that kind of
write about a particular place so zoomed
in that it could be for the people in
that city could be for the people in
that country but it's it's it's not
extractive colonial writing anymore and
I actually think that's a I don't think
it's coming to newspapers as much as
it's mostly something happening in books
I actually think this is an enormously
important
frontier of innovation that particularly
newspapers need to figure out how do you
cover countries in a way that doesn't as
it so often has in the past make
everybody in that country feel exploited
and misunderstood the last thing I'll
mention which again doesn't fit the
normal definition of innovation but
Tricia and I've had some conversations
about this in developing countries in
particular there is a lot of very
exciting innovation and conversation
around what it means to be modern today
and a lot of kind of what i would call
post tom friedman post world is flat
thinking around modern modernity being a
complicated thing that is a more local
definition than the old definitions of
it's this much privatization and it's
this much share of foreign trade and
it's this percentage of urban population
and a lot of interesting thinking in
China in particular in my experience of
people saying you know maybe being
modern is allowing the full flourishing
of our people but rethinking pretty
basic things and the Chinese are
thinking rethinking things that we don't
like like democracy but achieving
results that many of us would envy with
their system that we loathe but also in
a variety of other places that I think
have gotten out of a kind of Cold War
paradigm of how do we become like a
successful society treating that as a
for granted and how do we invent our own
definition of a successful society Pam I
feel like no one should say anything I'm
so beautiful but I just ruined it by
saying that any reaction from you guys
to to those thoughts or other things
we're but we have about five minutes
left total just so everyone knows yeah
go ahead just I think on the violence
thing it's interesting I was talking to
someone last week who runs this really
amazing organization called cure
violence used to be called ceasefire and
um this guy is based out of Chicago he
started as an immunologist so he studied
infectious disease and you know working
in Africa on infectious disease on
things like TB and malaria he came back
to the states and he had this idea that
we were sort of talking about earlier
the US doesn't have any problems what am
I gonna do here they don't need doctors
and he looked at patterns of violence
and he realized that violence spreads in
the exact same patterns that infectious
disease spreads in and so then he went
about trying to treat violence in the
ways that people go about trying to
treat infectious disease and he
developed this intervention of people
called violence interrupters and these
are people that are sent to communities
to actually disrupt violence and they're
not the you know the police force which
would normally have that kind of role
because communities obviously don't
trust the police and they don't want to
get their folks in trouble and so this
is this new kind of citizen sector-based
innovation that i think is is incredible
and i think there are more and more
examples of these kinds of solutions
that haven't been democratized because
we don't know about them and there's not
a market and when I talk about social
entrepreneurship or try and write about
it my publishers tell me that my advance
will be lower if I do that because
that's not there's not a demand for it
or they don't think the markets queues
in that direction but I think people are
working on these things it just there
the infrastructure for democratizing a
lot of these kinds of solution does
don't exist
to the people were saying social
entrepreneurship is not important
there's a demand for it and yet we've
talked to several largest corporations
they're saying the most innovative
solutions are happening from the social
entrepreneurs and now from which all
entrepreneurs are from the ones at work
that we're more familiar with in this
room and that's a culture issue so what
kinds of things to me for institutions
what kinds of thinking do we need for so
many people in this room and
particularly journalists who are going
to be sending out these needs that these
elements that will be part of what I
think of as a cultural infrastructure to
support the changes that are already
happening and support them so that they
can spread I think that's amazing just
quickly and you know it's really about
when we were looking at those comment
feeds and saying oh how can I get
involved on this issue and that all you
the only opportunity you had was a
comment and so it's it's about how do we
actually create these ways of capturing
really cool experiments that we're doing
and sharing them and you know we used to
work at a show can we talked about a lot
about this ladder of engagement and how
you build people from interested readers
or enthusiast in to change makers and
what that looks like and it you need
more of this kind of infrastructure and
the tools where people can start solar
experiments in their backyard or those
kinds of things
we don't have gun makers here or
industrial people here at all really
freaked me out from the I dinner a over
you know a lot of masa people's work on
that so it probably comes out matter
scale right how do you scale this
meeting up to an effective level where
we can attract las diez differently with
different areas so we need like I was
like a CES for social but much more fun
it was more like comic-con CES but I
would think about it and that's that's a
part of it conference design but but I
think the problem goes beyond the
conference how many of us forget this
one gather because one gallon can't do
it all how many of us in the next 365
days we'll have dinner with NRA member
there are a lot of NRA members right
right but but it goes to something
larger in the country which is the
division but but for I think you all
don't necessarily realize how
extraordinary how extraordinarily your
talents differentiate you from 99
percent of the people in this society
who may have various feelings about this
but can't solve the problems in the way
you can and so the problems you guys
become interested in becomes very
significant for everybody else and I
mean it's one of the reasons to we have
a CTO the Obama campaign I mean my sense
is just culturally for the next long
time the Democrats are going to better
CTOs and the Republicans and that's just
because of the kind of people who want
to do that overwhelmingly in these
circles are Democrats and so how does
that apply to all kinds of issues
whether it's guns or or
debt or anything else I don't know that
I agree with you at all yes the idea
that somehow concern people who are
technically savvy and understand how to
build things and I'm saying social are
our overwhelmingly liberal or
progressive i think is absolute love you
look at if you look at for a long time
the fastest growing segment Amida as
always I'm a conservative side I think
that it doesn't take very long for
people to be able to to pull or pay and
there's many people are comfortable
being hired guns and they can be a
political in that way so I think that
that's a I think it's a bias was wire
circuit so much better blogging liberal
around for blogging lead after Iraq war
and it's worth noting that the Tea Party
has had considerably more effect the
American public an occupied in in
roughly in the same period people that
occupy existed the tea party game format
and hopefully more useful I talked to
hundreds and hundreds of engineers that
were hiring that type of engineers I
talked to maybe two Republicans and
maybe 25 to 30 ish libertarians and the
rest were Democrats so although I like
my gut is that that's absolutely true
that doesn't make sense that non
progressives when he works it's really
exams of tech my experience absolutely
does not demonstrate that and it
literally was it was everyone I talked
to was very excited about working for
Democrats and if we look at the
Republicans they barely could hire
engineers to come in they had to pay
them lots of money army the Republicans
and so that's something that I think
there is a difference there I don't know
if it I mean we could do a poll in the
room also what's happening the way I
would say let's defer further
conversation on this too drinks dinner
lines for the bathroom elevators subway
hand-holding because you want to touch
the subway itself is foul but there is
there some distinction on this topic
between engineers and people who use
social and people who direct movements
and apply the power of the tool to a
problem versus defining the tool and
those engineers are very unique breed of
human and distinct from people master
blogging as a platform that's applied to
getting a message out so I want to thank
all of y'all especially for coming in so
many of you into town thank you guys and
I think for me this is much more
beautiful than I thought we had some
really good sprinkles and stabbings and
disagreements on what innovation even is
much less where it can happen and I
think as long as we keep very wide lens
on both of those we can start to think
especially as a zalman floating on the
tail of the diamond about expanding the
application of both those terms thank
you
