hundreds of influential speakers from
around the world including leading
scientists renowned experts in
technology book authors and leading
academics and makes videos of these
lectures freely available
my great pleasure to introduce a
professor Nick Finster he nick is a
tenured associate professor at Georgia
Tech and he's been working on a lot of
trove interesting research problems
related to network systems including the
architecture protocol design security
management measurement anti-censorship
okay so too many of you nick is not a
stranger right but to properly introduce
him I downloaded his most recent CV
which is 43 pages long so I spend some
time studying how his CB and so Nick has
published nine journal papers 39 I
referred conference papers 27 workshop
papers and five best paper words and he
has he has received many through
prestigious awards including NSF
presidential early career award for
scientists and engineers um and yeah
like the usual things like now a career
word as sloan fellowship and IBM faculty
or whatnot okay so you might think that
oh must been out there for many years
but to give you a reference point he was
our chosen s this MIT Technology Review
top innovators under 35 in 2010 and so
to add a little bit of so a personal
touch Nick and I shared an office at MIT
for many years and seeing him Sir
working day and night weekend Rick days
I thought that you know I was the
biggest slacker in the world and now
after reading his CV today I feel the
same way okay so without further ado
Nick thanks thanks for the introduction
I didn't know any of those statistics uh
um great so hopefully I can I can teach
you some things today about about what i
call the battle for control of online
communication this work you'll see has
several facets and its joint work with
several of my students as well as some
other faculty members at Georgia Tech
who work in both areas of security and
and machine learning so we'll see it
we'll see you know where I'm where I
bring those elements of computer science
into the work that I do in various
portions of the talk and I'll try to
point those out as we go briefly before
I get into the technical part of the
talk I just want to talk to you sort of
broadly about what all those papers are
kind of about and the general approach I
take to my work so generally speaking I
try to pursue problems in an area that I
call network operations and security and
the the idea there is basically like how
do you design tools algorithms
techniques to help people run networks
better and in particular secure them
better make them perform better make
them easier to troubleshoot when things
go wrong etc and the flavor of work that
I that I tend to do basically draws
inspiration from for the problems from
domain knowledge so I like to basically
talk and sort of interact extensively
with people in the network operations
community and other other folks in the
trenches so for example for those of you
who are familiar with working networking
of course harder than North American
network operators group I talked with
operators there to to sort of identify
practical problems with hard underlying
questions there under other groups that
I tend to work with as well like the
message abuse working group as well as
campus network operators and so forth so
trying to basically spend some time with
people in the real world of networks to
try to understand what practical
problems exist that potentially have
some kind of hard underlying question
those problems tend to be pretty messy
in in in in practice of course so then
basically what what I aim to do with my
research is to try to abstract those
problems and model them in reduce them
in to problems that are easier for for
us to to understand model and i'll
present several examples of how we do
that
you know in the in the problems that
I'll discuss today then sort of you know
having come up with some kind of and
typically in trying to devise solutions
to these problems the work that I do I
basically try to dry out draw on a
number of techniques from from other
areas of computer science not just
networking so in particular as I
mentioned security is another area but
also machine learning as well and i'll
i'll describe that in a little bit more
detail having sort of come up with a
solution however i find it's not quite
the end of the story what I then try to
do with that solution is to try to
engage with with industry and transfer
transfer what we've come up with on
paper into practice in a number of ways
and in particular again I'll point out
in various aspects of the work where we
basically take in some of the algorithms
and features that I've identified in
various contexts and and worked with a
bunch of folks in industry to transfer
some of our findings into practice so
that's kind of the general approach I
take two problems in and sort of broadly
speaking there are a number of if you
sort of go to the trenches and sort of
figure out what you know ask what kind
of hard problems exist there are a
number of hard problems that that are
practical problems kind of hard
underlying questions that I've pursued
in particular this is the the one that
I'll focus on today which is like
there's this balance between how the
internets is has been designed to be
open and that that openness actually on
the flip side makes it makes it more
prone to two attacks of various kinds
and figuring out ways to sort of
appropriately balanced that is sort of
the general sort of high-level theme to
the talk they're a bunch of other
problems that I've worked on with with
with my students and if there's time
towards the end of the talk which you
know maybe there won't be I will I will
elaborate on some of those as well so
that's this is the hard question that I
want to focus on today and and I just
want to briefly point out some of the
areas that you'll see
in today's talk so I will spend my time
focusing a lot on spam filtering and and
message abuse and in that work we've
basically drawn on some techniques both
from from the theory community and and
machine learning community to develop
techniques to to sort of combat problems
in that area also I'll spend some time
talking about problems in
anti-censorship and maintaining
maintaining availability in the face of
adversaries who want to disrupt
communication and again have sort of
worked with with folks across areas in
that in that domain and I'll talk a
little bit about some more recent work
that we've been doing with propaganda
and and and and filtering so the I think
the the sort of powerful facets to this
line of work is that you know there are
a lot of adversaries out there who would
wish to sort of disrupt just disrupt
communication abuse the network for
their own purposes etc and we and the
good news here is that we can use tools
from various aspects of computer science
to in some sense level the playing field
okay so let me come back a little bit to
this to this bigger question like the
sort of tension between the openness of
the Internet design and how that
openness sort of makes it more
vulnerable to attack so first what do I
mean by openness well I think this quote
from the the director of the Media Lab
which is in the in the New York Times
not too long ago really defines sort of
the the the ethos of the internet design
which is to say that you know everyone
should be able to to to connect to
innovate to program without asking
animals permission right there's no
central control and the assets are
widely distributed there isn't one
particular owner right so that's good
there are many good things about that
right and the the positive aspect to
that is that this openness has catalyzed
a huge amount of innovation right so the
number of users on the internet is
growing the internet is expanding to you
know to many many different geographies
and of course we're seeing connect you
know the ability to connect from all
kinds of different devices the flip side
though so what I want to talk about in
this talk is is the flip side of that
coin which is uh which is how openness
facilitates abuse
manipulation she may not exist input
about color thinking of just the rise of
mobile platforms that is that is
essentially the pace of that is
fascinating and those platforms are by
traditional measures closed but they are
still being adopted a number of users
they are getting is humorous and in fact
just like jealous back home but you can
either you or the cell phone with these
reports you couldn't change them in any
way they did some face set of things the
adoption rates who are way better than
later not so quick ways the role of
openness here if those platforms are
novel I think specifically here like we
could think of openness as being in the
IP stack so in particular even though
you know many aspects of those platforms
remain closed if you're able to
implement an IP stack you can get that
you can get a device online and i think
that's that's that's really gets to
focus the the tension that's really what
i'm talking about here jerkles too hot
without an ID star
feature phones like regular dumb phones
okay they took off without my own
without I'm sure now I I don't I
wouldn't say that like this is a
necessary condition for for for growth
right i mean they're plenty of the
plenty of technologies and platforms
that have grown without being opened i
would say that in the case of the
internet though it's it's certainly
acted as a catalyst right now there are
there may be other things that have
caused the growth as well but certainly
I don't think you can argue that it that
has hurt good okay well but that so
that's not really what I want to talk
about today I really want to focus on
the flip side of this of the coin which
is that by virtue of the fact that the
internet is open and specifically to
what I was just mentioning the fact that
pretty much anyone with an IP stack can
connect and start to send traffic that
facilitates abuse manipulation of
different kinds and that's sort of the
central central question that I want to
focus on today I want to talk about this
this distension in the context of a
couple of problems and the first is
securing communication so in particular
I'll speak about message abuse so
depending on the statistics that you
choose to believe you know anywhere from
something like eighty to ninety five
percent of email traffic is spam well
not while you may not see it in your
inbox the network operators who are
running those services definitely do see
it and they have to do something about
it so that so that it doesn't end up in
your you know right in front of your
face so this remains this remains a you
know a sort of potential continual
vexing problem and I'll spend probably
the bigger balance of the talk talking
about things that we've done in that
area to sort of combat that the second
topic that I want to speak about is is a
you know on the flipside maintaining
openness how do how do we ensure or how
do we help parties communicate in the
face of organizations countries
governments etc who would wish to block
or disrupt that that
of that communication so you may or may
not know that something like 60
countries around the world controller
sensor internet communications in some
form so this is a this is a problem
that's that's fairly fairly pervasive
for for for citizens of many countries I
won't spend too much time on this last
topic but this is something that's
become a recent interest of minus in you
know sort of the term more subtle one of
the more subtle aspects or facets
information control is not just the
ability you know the decision to block
or permit a certain type of
communication but rather you know
there's there's the potential to say
manipulate what a particular user sees
when they go searching for a particular
thing when they read a particular you
know piece of content or news story or
blog posts etc and I will talk a little
bit about some more recent work that
we've been doing to try to help maintain
transparency that so that users can you
know hopefully become more aware of that
type of those types of manipulations
okay so let me jump into the first topic
of spam filtering so as I mentioned
already spam is certainly a nuisance
it's becoming less of a nuisance for us
because we hardly see it but just
because you don't you don't see it
doesn't mean it isn't there it still
remains about ninety five percent of all
email traffic and a lot you know
significant fraction of that traffic is
you know of that of that spam is coming
in forms that that you know a creative
forms you might say I'll explain in just
a little bit why that's that's relevant
to this to this particular talk um so
the other thing I guess it's this
relevant is that a lot of this spam is
coming from compromised machines or
networks of compromised machines
commonly called botnets and on one hand
that's a bit of a scourge but on the
other hand we're going to be able to use
that to our advantage when we talk about
how do we how do we sort of separate the
good from the bad here okay so the
general approach to the two to the
problem of spam is let's filter it right
this is sort of the obvious thing right
obviously you want to basically take the
unwanted traffic and tees it up
art from the bad stuff I'm sorry you
want to take the good stuff and tease it
apart from the bad stuff the question of
course what's that exactly and then the
question then is what what features best
differentiate the spam from from
legitimate mail there have been this is
not a new question right this has been
studied for you know you know since
essentially the advent of email and
there have been certainly there's a
large body work in various types of
approaches to this problem I'll talk
about a couple of existing approaches to
this problem and sort of where that
leaves you know why there's still some
room for improvement even even giving
these techniques on the first and I'll
go into this just briefly in the coming
slides is is content-based filtering so
you can you can for example design a
filter that looks at the content of a
message IE what's being said and try to
figure out based on what's in the
message whether or not this is something
that the user is going to want to see or
not the other thing you could do is you
could you know if there's a you know
mail server connecting to to your
receiving mail server you could look at
the IP address of the sender right and
try to put that on a blacklist right so
you could develop a reputation for that
IP address and say you know based on the
behavior of this IP address in the past
I think this is good or bad the approach
that we take an approach I'm going to
focus on in in this talk is it is
complementary and that's basically to
say well we can also look at features of
behavior right so we can basically say
you know not just what's being said or
or or you know what you know who's
sending it but how is the message being
sent in terms of you know what time of
day is you know what time of day is it
being sentient what is P is it coming
from you know what other kinds of
behavioral kinds of patterns can we see
just in the network traffic that stand
out the intuition here is that that spam
arson fundamentally act in ways that
differ from you or I act and we should
be able to can identify you know what
those features are and how they stand
out we can key off of those two design
to design to design filters as well so
let me first talk a little bit about the
the other two quick
talk about the other two approaches and
kind of where they leave leave some room
for improvement so content-based filters
as i mentioned look at what's being said
and one of the things to to real about
realize about that if you sort of talk
to the operator of a large mail service
provider for example folks we've talked
to include yahoo secure computing etc
what they will tell you is that there's
something like a hundred thousand
different ways of spelling viagra right
that's sort of just to illustrate the
point of you know how difficult this
type of thing can be right and how
asymmetric the attack is right so the
issue here and here's some examples of
other ways that spammers use content to
sort of turn the battle in their favor
right so they they can take a message
and embed it in a PDF or an Excel
spreadsheet or an image or even an mp3
right and on them on one side it's
fairly easy for a spammer to embed a
message in a new type of you know
carrier if you will on the flip side the
filter maintained errs have to design
ways to understand parse extract etc
from different types of contents so this
is certainly something that that email
service providers spent a lot of time
doing but it's something more it's it's
it's definitely an aspect where the the
the battle is a little bit tilted in the
spammers favor because paper due to due
to the fact that you know it's
relatively easy to evade these you know
content filter in comparison to sort of
updating the capabilities of that filter
the second approach as I mentioned is
you could you could take the IP address
at the center and you could try to put
that on to a you know a sign of
reputation to that IP address if you
were to look in your mail headers right
you would see something like what's
called a received mail header of course
like if this message is coming from a
spammer you'd see a string of these
things in the mail header and a lot of
them would be forged but at least one
would think I'll explain to you actually
in in a few slides why this is not
always the case but one would think that
in most cases this this IP address
that's making this completing a TCP
three-way handshake with you
is the is the IP address of you know
someone you think it is and if I could
you know if the recipients could keep
track of the behavior of any of those
you know those particular IP addresses
that are connecting to the server then
they can you know decide what you know
what they think of that particular IP
address is this a likely spammer or a
legitimate center now that actually
works pretty well there are there are
larger organizations that have have done
pretty well at maintaining these kind of
black lists but again this is a bit of a
cat and mouse game right and the the
challenge here is that the IP addresses
of email senders are never the same on
any any two given days shall we say when
we when we one of the experiments that
we did actually to study the behavior of
these senators is actually we set up
what's called a what we called a spam
spam trap or a spam honeypot if you will
it was a mail server with with several
domains that had no legitimate email
addresses so what what a what a typical
mail server would do is basically just
reject any attempts to send to
non-existent mail email addresses what
we did in this case was basically accept
any connection attempt right and said
okay thank you very much we will deliver
that fact we're delivering it to our
school but to no one in particular and
then and then gathering statistics on
who's talking to us when we did that
right we see we basically see that on
any given day there about ten percent of
these senators coming from IP addresses
that we hadn't seen in the past right so
that's sort of turned on on the black
hat side if you will though the bad side
of things right and their their possible
causes for for that type of thing
happening you know we can't necessarily
attribute the cause of the churn to any
one thing in particular but there are
you know malicious reasons for IP
addresses changing on any given day but
i'll take the question just a minute but
there are also good reasons why you
might see email from an IP address
you've never seen before so for example
the renumber re numbering of a mail
server or someone just decides to set up
a mail server you know that they you
know
you know on any particular day that they
hadn't been that they hadn't been
operating in the past right so they're
good reasons for IP addresses to
suddenly start sending mail as well so
you can't just say let's just blacklist
everything that's new and so coming back
to the to the sort of goal of openness
right you you know and and and the
desire to keep your false positives low
this becomes the the ephemerality of the
IP addresses also presents a problem if
you head whereas going because you can't
paint any fiber so the internet black
it's so college open correct exactly
exactly so so that's essentially where
where that this leaves some room for
improvement so you start up saying that
and it's true that most of us don't see
a lot of spam be because of gmail or
hotmail getting a good and doing these
approaches who actually does see the
snap and why are there mail servers
normally even these basic things which
would affect almost as bad then drive
this bad economy down so um these basic
things actually turn out to cut cut
about eighty percent of connection
attempts so you can basically take an IP
blacklist and still you know I guess I
not so well known fact is that
operational mail servers do drop about
eighty percent of the incoming
connections just based on things like IP
reputation there's so the dirty secret
behind what I'm what I'm presenting to
you here is actually that the games are
somewhat incremental right because
you're taking that eighty percent that's
already you know that you're taking the
twenty percent on which the early
decision hasn't been made and you're
basically trying to crank that up a bit
right so I think the answer to your
question is that yeah already this is
being done to quite some degree and
we're basically looking for other
features etc that can help us gain you
know additional advantage if no one's
moral is no one seeing the spam then
turn of the spam rates go down to zero
how do this is well the issue is that
actually there's still about twenty
percent of the connections that do you
know that do get accepted now of that
then content filters etc get applied
right so you're basically you may not be
seeing a there's some fraction of that
that uses do see it's actually quite
small right but then the other stuff
that you never see also presents a
problem as well because you've got to
store it right so so their operational
challenges as well like once you've
basically decided to accept a message
for delivery you got to do something
with it and the more you can basically
shave that down as well the better off
the operators of the service are as well
yeah maybe some people do click this
viagra step so maybe my step is not
correct so you know as long as those
people exist don't make it hard to
eliminate because some people do watch
me see right I think if no one we're
clicking on them then obviously then
obviously that would be the end of story
right but there has to be some small
fraction of people who are who are
actually buying the stuff yeah what was
the scale of the gathering here I mean
ten percent new every day is like among
cycle imagine said to hotmail and gmail
are saying that level of new IP
addresses hahaha how long was your time
window and I wanted to do to advertise
think these mail servers so this is like
so advertising is a tricky tricky thing
actually I mean we basically as it turns
out a lot of the a lot of the baiting
seems to come from who is scraping right
looking at newly registered domains
because we did actually put the domains
out there and that too not much effect
for a while actually basically oh so
what was the question the scale hello I
mean did it after plateau I mean all the
time until you okay so we did this over
the course of over the course of about
four months so yeah you're right that
eventually it's bound to plateau because
they're limited number of IP addresses
out there that your outdoor range right
yeah that was our platoon yeah Gino
yeah I mean eventually they'd have to
write because they're going to see a lot
more on any given day in fact maybe
their plateau after a day yeah okay so
so that's basically where where you know
where they say the artisan and where
there's some room for improvement so as
I mentioned this is this is essentially
the approach that we're taking and if
you're going to talk about use it like
looking at network level behavior to try
to try to do detection the obvious
question then is well what's different
about the spammers right so sounds nice
right intuitively spammers aren't like
us presumably they should behave
differently but what exactly is it about
them that looks different right and what
I'm going to talk about is sort of three
different ways that we've observed
spammers behaving differently from
legitimate senders and intuitively they
make sense and what I'm going to try to
do is sort of drill down into each of
these and show how we've taken these
kind of axioms if you will and derive
more more features more low-level
features and detection mechanisms based
on this intuition the first is what I
call agility and the idea here is that
spammers actually have to move to escape
detection right so if spammers always
sent from the same IP addresses send an
email from the same IP addresses if they
always hosted their pill sites and
phishing sites at the same URLs or the
same domains etc then eventually all
those places would end up on black lists
or shut down and things would work so
well so spammers actually have to move
around to escape detection right so on
the one hand that's kind of inconvenient
right because you create this
cat-and-mouse game where where you
continually have to you know with the
techniques I've already described you
continually have to update update
blacklist and so forth to keep up with
that but on the flip side what we can do
is actually recognize that the way that
spammers change where the you know where
they're doing things where they're
performing their activities differs from
the way that anything else on the
internet changes right so and I'm going
to basically use that that intuition to
show you some particular features that
really stand out into
the spammer behavior and the second is
that spammers just send mail in ways
that you and I don't right so just in
terms of the way that they send messages
to people look a lot different the other
sort of keys the last what sort of keys
off the idea that that that or sort of
the observation that spent a lot of spam
is coming from these botnets these
networks of compromised machines right
as a result of that what what we can see
is some coordination right that that
wooden Eric wouldn't otherwise pop out
from the groups of legitimate senders
the obvious thing here right in one of
the things that we studies is that
sending behavior actually exhibits some
coordination but i'll show you actually
another pretty cool and interesting
example of coordination that also popped
out as well where we get to that part of
the talk so i'm going to first talk
about agility in particular we'll talk
about how spammers have used various
internet protocols to move around then
i'll talk about how we you know
different aspects of spam or behavior
that look different from legitimate
senders and how we built supervised
learning classifiers on top of that to
helps you know help differentiate
spammer behavior from religion that of
legitimate senders and then i'll talk
about some of the behaviors that tend to
cluster well just to sort of wet your
appetite here I'll one of the one of the
coordination behavior is actually that
they were going to key off of is that
spammers actually send mail to
themselves so think about that for a
while and then all I'll come back to it
so let's first talk about agility so one
of the one of the things that we
observed and this comes back to the to
the data collection method that I spoke
about before right so basically we could
do is set up a spam honeypot if you will
a spam for up and see who's sending us
messages and the other thing we could do
is sort of join that with our view of
what the Internet routing table looks
like at any particular to any particular
point and then ask is there any kind of
is there any kind of correlation between
these two things that we observe so
here's something that we see and I'll
point these things out as as I walk
through this example so when we look at
the Internet routing table one of the
things that we that we that we saw
actually an advertisement for an IP
prefix that lasted only about 10 minutes
so for those of you who don't know what
BGP is by the way I should have just
mentioned it stands for border gateway
protocol and this is the the language
that ISPs used to talk to one another to
sort of advertise reach ability to a
range of IP addresses right so they can
say hey I know how to reach this range
of IP addresses please send your traffic
through me to get there okay so what we
see here between this red dot and the
blue dot so the red dot is an example of
an ISP saying come through me to reach
this set of IP addresses and the blue to
blue dot is like 10 minutes later you
see a retraction of that statement it's
called a withdrawal message and this is
already looking kind of weird right
because you see and a range of IP
addresses it's advertised for a very
short period of time when we run
networks typically we'd like to have our
network up for more than 10 minutes
right so already this is kind of looking
kind of a little bit strange then the
next thing we saw is if we sort of look
at what's happening in that range of IP
addresses in terms of who's trying to
talk to us it's not something kind of
interesting we saw in this case you know
five different you know in this
particular episode five different IP
addresses contained within that part of
the network that are talking to us like
sending a spam all right so this is
pretty strange right you have a
short-lived you know a network where the
reach ability is extremely short-lived
and then inside that 10-minute window
you see some activity right now that's
weird enough in and of itself but then
if I were to ask you if you were to
steal a region of IP address space would
you steal a big region or a small region
right and we thought really you know
probably steal a small region of IP
addresses because you know smaller and
be less likely to notice in fact
actually this behavior this particular
behavior we observed the opposite all
right so we actually saw this the
short-lived announcements popping up for
like huge regions of IP addresses / 8 or
about 12 56th of the entire Internet
address space was being advertised you
know this sort of short-lived way you're
thinking like what the
like isn't someone going to notice if
someone like steals one to 56 of the
internet well this is kind of brilliant
attack wise right because because the
way Internet routing works right we know
you know for those of you who know how
it works you know that it works on
what's called longest prefix match the
idea is that if if there's some network
that's advertising a more specific range
of addresses right then that's always
going to win right the the routers will
continue to forward to the guy who's
advertise the more specific space
meanwhile the attacker who's grab this
sort of you know you know less specific
space right suddenly got a huge chunk of
addresses that isn't likely to be
filtered because it's a big chunk right
you know short of prefixes tend not to
be filtered these things are actually
allocated right as well so it doesn't
look too fishy at least no fishy of them
then then then it might otherwise look
and they get a huge chunk of addresses
anything that's not being advertised by
you know some other existing network
suddenly basically they've owned right
so that that tends to be convenient
Decker sophisticated enough to look at
the beach should be table for brought
views or somewhere else and pick out
more specific address blogs that are not
being advertised and just advertise
though
um I think they probably could write I
mean it seems like seems like that that
might work one thing though like one
reason that might not work is sometimes
sometimes operators do set up their
filters to filter you know more specific
regions if they turn out to be shorter
right so that might be one reason why it
might not work but it's it's actually I
wouldn't say that it's you know I can't
say that it's not happening as well
right it may be happening as well it's a
good question ok so we most recently
looked at this last year as well so
there's still a significant fraction of
I'm so there's still significant number
of short-lived IP addresses that are
that are also sourcing attack traffic of
different kinds both spam and other
types of scans so I haven't looked at it
in last year but this is like behavior
persists up until about a year ago so
that's a trick that's a tricky question
actually touches a little bit on the
later part of the talk right I could
spend quite a bit of time talking about
the philosophy here right i mean obvious
thing to do is liked it is to sort of
design better filters or I'm sorry be
more vigilant about updating the filters
right of course we know that that's
tricky right but that would be kind of
the ideal situation now another thing
you could do is talk about something
like secure bgp right where you know you
can't actually advertise the prefix
without it actually being you know you
know signed and attributed to a
particular network I actually think that
there are some you no stones unturned
there as far as like the you know that
isn't necessarily a panacea right whose
then basically who's deciding who's
allowed to announce what I mean I think
that that doesn't necessarily solve
things you potentially create a
situation where things are less open so
I think the right answer which is
probably unattainable is
have operators you know be more vigilant
about about updating their filters but
maybe there's a better answer to that
that we just haven't thought of yet okay
so that's that's one example another
thing that I that I mentioned that I was
going to talk about was when swen
spammers send messages right they
obviously want someone to click on
something and buy buy something right in
order to do that they need to host a
site similar right they need to host the
website that's the canadian pharmacy or
the phishing site or what have you and
the the the way that the problem was
just hosting a site in any particular
place right is is that if you leave it
in that place for too long it you know
the the infrastructure will be
blacklisted and shut down right so what
attackers say about that or with it what
they do in response to that is actually
use the naming infrastructure to move
their infrastructure around so this is
this is a picture taken from from the
honeynet project and basically there are
two ways that this can be done one is
you could just use the DNS in sort of
the normal load balancing style way
right when when a when a client looks up
a particular domain right you can return
different IP addresses right you can for
that for so you can change the IP
address that's in the a record and
that's called sync often called single
flux it's kind of like a black hat load
balancing right now the problem with
that approach right is actually that you
know this thing right here the authority
authoritative name server for that
particular domain that isn't moving
around as well right so if I were to try
to you know identify what's going on
here and shut things down i could
blacklist this you know I could
blacklist this particular authoritative
name server with this but the attackers
do in response to that of course is then
just take this thing and move it onto a
botnet right and start moving this thing
around so you can no longer you know
blacklisted but you know put the IP
address of an authoritative name server
it's in the one hand that's kind of you
know inconvenient but on the other hand
you can imagine that there there are not
very many legitimately operated networks
that perform this you know this type of
behavior
so in particular that what we can do
then is look for cases where the
infrastructure in particular the IP
address of the you know this stuff up
here the IP address of the authoritative
name server is moving around right and
actually this is work that that jen and
i did with a with a student of mine
several years ago so what we did
actually in this case is we looked at
the domains coming into our spam trap
right and we repeatedly queried those
domains and we ask like how often is it
the case that the authoritative name
server for that domain is is is moving
around right so this is just one one
result from that study what we can see
here and this is basically a CDF of the
inter arrival time between the changes
at the you know of the authoritative
name servers and then hierarchy and you
can see for the you know for the for the
the red line is basically the domains
that are that are coming into our spam
trap you can see that in about half of
those cases the IP address of the
authoritative name servers changing
about once every six hours so not
something you'd expect to see on a
legitimate network and it as you can see
it differs quite a lot from from sort of
the legitimate domains so that's one one
type of DNS agility another of course is
that the attackers of course can't
continue to use the same domains right
because the domain name itself is also
going to end up on a blacklist
eventually too so they've got to
continually register new domains so
that's inconvenient but on that what we
can do on the on the flip side there is
look for what's different about you know
these new domains well to get you
thinking about that i can ask well what
happens when you register a domain who
looks it up typically nobody right when
you first register a domain and no one's
heard of it right no one's looking it up
except for maybe you what happens when a
when an attacker registers a new domain
well it might get enlisted as part of a
scam campaign right it might get you
know it might be used for botnet command
and control so there are things that are
looking it up so we can use that initial
look up behavior to provide kind of an
early reputation for for some of
is newly registered domains and that's
that's what we did so for this of course
you need special data if you will you
need a special vantage point so we did
this in collaboration with some folks
from verisign who have a nice I'm a nice
view of the recursive resolvers looking
up second-level domains in command net
so what we did here is we asked for
those newly registered domains who's
looking them up within the first within
the first week of registration and you
can see and by who I mean how many
distinct / 24 networks and you can see
in this case that in about forty percent
of the cases a forty percent of those
newly registered domains there's
something like several hundred unique /
24 networks or more looking it up almost
right away and that essentially never
almost never happens with these
legitimate legitimately register domains
okay so now I want to talk a little bit
about the second the second axiom which
is that spam the way that spammers
actually send mail differs from the way
that you and I tend to send mail um what
we eventually did in this part of the
work was was come up with a supervisor
classifier based on supervised learning
to distinguish spammers from legitimate
senders and the challenge here becomes
how do you identify the features that
the behavioral features that differ
between legitimate senders and spammers
what I'm going to do is to show you a
couple of highlights because there are a
bunch of features that tend to work well
a lot of them are kind of obvious and
boring rights for example one of the
things you can do is look at the ISP or
the a s of the sender right and that
tends to work pretty well but but I'll
focus on a couple of the ones that look
that dead are more interesting because
they tell us a little bit more about
about how you know how they provide a
little insight in terms of how Spanish
tend to behave so one of them was what
we did actually was take the source and
I should mention the data that we use
for this part of the study this was work
that we did in collaboration with McAfee
who has mail filtering appliances
deployed and something like eight
thousand different enterprise networks
these are globally globally distributed
so this is bias of course by where
they've got their you know their mail
filtering appliances distribute
but this is just to sort of also kind of
paint a picture of you know an example
of the of where the behavior may differ
so one of the things that we saw for
example is that about ninety percent of
the legitimate messages travel you know
you know in a relatively close proximity
if you look at the spam spam and
behavior actually it's significantly
more you know more evenly distributed
across distance another thing that we
looked at is and this comes back again
to the fact that spam is being sent from
compromised machines right we looked at
how email is being sent from different
regions of IP address space so again
sort of painting intuition here it's
it's fairly unlikely that you'd have a
network say / 24 network with 200
legitimate mail servers on it right
typically you'd expect you know you know
a handful at most right on the other
hand what we were seeing in the cases of
spam activity were these / 24 networks
or you know networks of such a size
where there'd be two hundred email
senders right in fairly close proximity
24 it makes sense when you think about
how spammers you know use the
infrastructure to operate right they
compromise a bunch of machines and then
they enlist them to start you know
launching these types of campaigns so
what we can do is actually a key off of
that behavior to to again sort of design
a feature a behavioral feature that
allows us to distinguish Spanish from
legitimate centers in particular what we
did in this case was to say when you see
a piece of email sent you know how far
apart how far away an IP address space
do you need to go before you see the K
next nearest senders right and then this
for a particular value of K you know the
smaller that IP address range that that
that space that IP space is the more
dense the more dense that sending
activity is and that's essentially what
we see here so having trouble
understanding the graph and with the
intuition that I've got assume that
hotmail and large companies have lots of
large companies and lots of outlet
servers and gmail and hotmail out lots
of IPs what is being sampled here okay
so basically the way to read this is
like so so yes so so the wait so the way
to read this is how far this is how far
out an IP address space do you need to
go right to to observe the K closest
email senders right so for example if I
take a particular IP address right of a
sender I can say the data is IP
addresses here right yeah I IP addresses
of senders so you could say for example
in the case of you know in the case of
spammers right to see the K closest you
know to see the K closest see mail
centers I need to go out you know I need
to capture sort of twenty thousand or so
IP address is surrounding that that that
IP address I've got to go basically two
orders in order of magnitude more for to
see ten email senders if I start from a
legitimate a legitimate Center your
question about webmail providers is an
interesting one I'd say that's the
exception rather than the rule right
there there are only a few of those and
they're a lot more you know there's a
lot more email senders who are not those
people because we're not talking about
volumes here we're talking about
activity mmm this is this is a meeting
this is a mean well why do I care about
me
because it's it I mean there's there's a
difference here that's clearly that's
this represented right yeah you can have
a very high mean but you can still have
a bottom ten percent that's a real
problem so if you have a lot of large
companies with a bunch of outdoor a
reasonable number they have ten outlook
servers but then as far as the ability
to use this as a heuristic goes down
dramatically so that's it I would posit
that the number of networks that like
the number of legitimately operated
networks that have more than you know
more than you know a handful of mail
servers for for several hundred IP
addresses is not that many I mean your
typical enterprise network which is
basically what we're looking at here
right because you remember the data set
we're looking at we're looking at and a
mail from enterprise networks I you know
where these spam filtering boxes have
been deployed we're not talking about
gmail or hotmail or yahoo in this case
right but if you look at sort of the
typical enterprise network or campus
network or what have you the type of
place that's likely to deploy a filter
of this type you're not going to have a
very dense you know you're not going to
have dense email sending activity take
the Georgia Tech campus for example I
you will not find a / 24 network on that
campus with 200 legitimate mail service
that's essentially the intuition we're
operating on here now till your question
about the mean you're very right there
are going to be outliers to this and
you've actually identified one of them
so in that is basically why in the
context of like designing a supervised a
supervised learning classifier you can't
rely on just one feature right so we
don't look at means when we design a
classifier we use this particular we use
this particular feature as an input
among many of the other features as well
right so obviously you're not going to
get it right every time just like in the
case of distance you're not going to get
that right every time either but the
point here is basically to point out a
general trend that is true a lot of the
time
higher than I expect that's kind of a
labeling problem or maybe the case that
there's you know a lot more a lot less
of one of those one of those categories
the weight of the late the data was
labeled was actually sort of post hoc
manual semi manual and we didn't do that
that was actually labels that were given
to us okay okay so so that was that
that's just a pain a picture of a couple
of features that we used we used a whole
bunch more that I don't have that I
don't have the time to talk about once
we put those into a supervised learning
classifier we the false positive rate we
get four four if we basically look at
the detection rate that something like
spamhaus gets we get about a four tenth
of one percent false positive rate which
is still a bit too high to be practical
most mail service providers like to see
about one tenth of one percent we can
play other games like white listing AS
is that you know for which we get the
most strong answer is it's etc and tuna
bunch of knobs to get that down to about
you know point one four percent so but
this is basically i'm giving a number
that's basically just taking the
features that we identified and turning
the crank we can actually do pretty well
the features that i showed you some of
those features that i showed you also
we're used by by mcafee who we worked
with in this particular product project
to you know in in the mail filter that
they use in practice okay so finally
just to talk about coordination a bit so
i'm glad you actually raised the point
of webmail actually because as you point
out this is actually totally changing
the game in particular as you as you
mentioned right that particular feature
that we talked about may not apply but
in general the types of features that we
studied in that work may may not apply
because a lot of them key off of IP
addresses so but in fact IP IP
blacklists not going to work either
right so um there's an interesting thing
that's going on right which is that now
we can no longer use IP addresses or
behave you know the types of behavior
that i mentioned well what can we use we
can use user input right we can use
those like you know
Marcus spam button right uh well so
what's the next step in in that game
right well so actually what we're seeing
now is that spammers are sending mail to
themselves and I think why are they
sending mail to themselves well it's
actually so that they can vote on their
own messages right so they send mail to
themselves and then they basically vote
not spam on the messages that they see
so this is this is some work that we did
with with yahoo in particular over about
the course of over the course of about
three months we saw about about a
million and a half not spam votes coming
from accounts that basically did nothing
except vote not spam on anything right
so there's there's a fair amount of this
activity going on but the other kind of
interesting thing about this is that it
doesn't take that much or it really
doesn't you know because the cost of a
false positive so high right anything
that basically gets a not spam boat is
is you know it really tweaks the weights
right so what we want to do of course is
try to detect those does those
fraudulent votes and what we can do
right is actually make some observations
about how those votes are being cast to
try to try to distinguish you know like
fraudulent not spam boats from from the
legitimate ones this actually draw some
inspiration from some work that's gone
on here in terms of detecting
compromised accounts through coordinated
activity in particular the bot graph
work is you know is is quite similar to
the observation that I'm about to point
out here but what we can do actually
take this voting problem and model it as
a bipartite graph where the in gray here
we have the IP addresses of spammers and
legitimate centers and there's our IP
addresses that are being voted on and
then we've got some user accounts that
are actually you know casting the votes
okay so what we can see with with you
know when we sort of create this this
graph of activity is a couple things pop
out one of course is that you know these
compromised accounts tend to cast a lot
more not spam votes than then like a
legitimate user typically would but the
other thing that really pops out is that
spammer IP addresses they actually tend
to receive not spam votes from
different compromised accounts over here
on the right side of the graph now
there's a circularity human right
because how do I know what's compromise
before I figure out that one of these
guys is being voted on from a bunch of
compromised accounts but you can break
that circularity of course by clustering
right we can basically look at you know
IP addresses over here that are being
voted on it we can say are there are
groups of IP addresses here that are
being voted on by a similar group of
user identities or user accounts on this
side right and basically we can we can
create a cluster based on the sort of
observing the similarity of voting
behavior there so that's effectively
what we did actually we applied sort of
a graph based clustering approach to
sort of tease apart the user identities
that vote in a similar fashion across
many different IP addresses now I'm the
approach that we start out with in the
same approach that bot graph uses in
their work to detect compromised
accounts is you can sort of build a que
neighborhood graph um the idea there is
basically you you figure out you figure
out instances of IP addresses for which
you know a particular user identity
votes in the same way at least K
different times right in the new
basically group group user identities
based on that value of K the problem
with that actually is that in is that it
can produce false positives right so if
you've got a group of good guys that are
all kind of voting in the same way and
then you've got a bunch of you've
identified some fraudulent voters here
and you've got maybe one account in the
good guys that has some strange voting
but you know strange behavior either
because it's coming through a proxy or
you know maybe it happens to be
compromised itself right something then
all of a sudden you basically take you
know this whole cluster of good guys and
you sort of lump it in with a with with
the bad guys so the the problem with
just sort of applying just a straight k
neighborhood clustering is that that
false pass it's hard to keep a handle on
the false positives what we can do to
approve improve that approach is
actually apply something called canopy
clustering and not i'm not an expert in
this area so i won't speak too much to
the details but if it can be clustering
allows you to do is
sort of a to its it allows you to apply
clustering in two stages you basically
create these you know you create these
large sort of larger groups of things to
cluster on and then you reapply kk
neighborhood clustering inside those
inside those things store called
canopies that actually allows things to
scale a lot better so that's important
here in this case where there's just a
lot of mail and a lot of senders but
also you can keep a better handle on
false positives so this is actually
something that we worked on with with
the folks at yahoo and this is something
actually they used to try to now detect
these these kind of fraudulent votes yes
symmetry by actually looking at the
messages and seeing whether they're spam
or just that not
you could do that actually I guess you
bring you so then effectively what
you're doing is bringing human in the
loop to sort of see odd you know yeah
for other techniques to analyze man true
yeah you could you could potentially do
that as well yeah that I think that's a
that's a totally reasonable approach
yeah you do have to look at content and
there's some cost to doing that but I
think that's probably doable or you
could use other thing you could
certainly do other things to look at a
spam score based on other you know
features a header or what have you the
problem with so you could look at
content I think that would probably work
okay the once you sort of get away from
content you get back into this massive
now like everyone's sending email from
gmail to gmail and hotmail to gmail and
hotmail yahoo and and so forth right so
a lot of the features that we typically
key on that relate to the IP address and
headers and stuff they no longer work so
you kind of you kind of have to dig into
content to really to really take the
approach that you're taking but I think
it's reasonable yeah so just a time
track actually I know that we have not
like a 90 minute slot but um so what how
do you want me to to sort of proceed I
mean I can finish in anywhere from three
minutes to 20 whatever you okay um what
else so what I'll do actually is I
wanted to spend a few minutes then
talking about this this this this other
this other problem which is maintaining
openness in particular enabling a sort
of facilitating communication in the
face of a sensor who would wish to sort
of disrupt that communication so this is
a problem of course it's that's sort of
enjoying increased prominence and I'll
sort of at a high level describe to you
what what the problem is of course Alice
wants to talk to Bob there's a sensor in
the middle who would either wish to
block that traffic or worse potentially
punish Alice for attempting to talk to
Bob but said I think that's where things
actually get a little bit different than
kind of the conventional types of
things that we've seen in this area
because not only do we want to allow
Alice talked about but we also want to
potentially conceal the fact that she's
trying to do so in the first place the
general approach to allowing this to
facilitating this communication to use
some kind of helper right where well
Allison Bob may not be allowed to talk
directly to one another Bob may be able
to communicate with some kind of helper
right and and maybe Alice can talk to
that helper as well right so the
communication between Alice and that
helpers somehow permitted the idea then
is basically to use this point of
indirection right to allow Alice and Bob
to send each other messages so the
challenge here right and this is sort of
a well-studied problem right the most
famous helper I think is is a mixed net
called tor right and but the challenge
there is that you know well when using
something like tor it's fairly easy to
hide what you're getting and sometimes
it's it can be easy to sort of break
through sensors using those techniques
if someone happens to be looking right
if the sensor happens to be looking at
that traffic it can be very hard to hide
that you're you that you're doing you
know that you're actually performing
that kind of activity right so one of
the things that we've been doing over
the years is actually try to try to
design communication techniques that
defeat censorship that are also deniable
right in other words that that disguise
the fact that alice is using this kind
of technique in the first place so what
I'm going to do is actually talk about a
particular a particular system that that
we've designed to to achieve that goal
um there are a number of things that we
want to achieve in the design of the
system one is of course we want to
thwart a disruption right we want to
make it difficult for the sensor to
disrupt the communication in order to do
that we use a combination of sort of
redundancy techniques and hiding the
other thing we want to do is make that
activity right the act of Alice fetching
that content our community over the Bob
we want to make that look innocuous
right and then we're going to steal some
techniques from distributed systems
finally what we want to do is if the
sensor is watching the communication
between Alice and Bob we actually want
to make it for less obvious that they're
talking to one another so what we want
to do is decouple you know the sending
and the receiving of the messages so in
the real world what this might look
like is you know I want to send you a
message but I know someone's watching
right and I want to make it not so
obvious that i'm sending you a message
so what I do is I you know put the
message in a paper bag under the bridge
and I you know I tell you to go look
there at some later point and pick it up
right so to someone who's observing mace
you know they may not notice any
correlation between who's dropping off
the message and he's picking it up so
with this system i'm going to just
briefly describe to you is essentially
paper bags under a bridge for web two
point O effectively what we do is use
user-generated content sites to allow
Alice and Bob to communicate with one
another so what bomb is going to do in
this case Bob is we'll just say that
he's a flickr user flickr itself may be
blocked that's fine i'm using flickr for
the sake of example and also because
it's what we we built our prototype on
but this could be any site that hosts
user-generated content so what bob is
going to do is take his message can
actually sort of embed it in some kind
of content right whether it might be an
image of video something like that he's
going to post it on a user-generated
content site alice is basically going to
retrieve that content right and to the
sensor this is going to look like
alice's looking at videos of cats or you
know be you know vacation photos or
something but when in fact which is
really interested in is that thing
that's hiding inside the cover so so let
me just describe to you in in just a
little bit of detail how that works and
then i'll dive in to a couple challenges
and then wrap up just probably probably
five or ten more minutes so bob was
going to take his message that he wants
to send to alice and let's assume
actually that there's some message
identifier that that either Alice and
Bob have agreed on or Alice already
knows so a message identifier might be
for example a URL right for the you know
the message that Bob's trying to put in
might be the webpage for corresponding
to that URL or if this is a particular
message that Bob wants to community
communicate to Alice the message ID is
something that they would have had to
agree on magically somehow out of band
so there's a bootstrapping step that I'm
that I'm hand waving around but let's
assume it there's an identifier
associated with that message well Bob is
going to take that message he's going to
take his cover trap
what in and in this case maybe say a
picture right it's going to embed the
message in that in that picture that
cover traffic is going to upload it to
some user-generated content site like
the drop site if you will analysis
basically just going to reverse this
process to to retrieve her message okay
so that's the that's the high level
picture right and there are few
challenges to making this work one is
figuring out how to embed the message
right which actually I'm going to I'm
going to sort of i'm going to skip over
because the the techniques that we use
here are fairly straightforward right we
want to basically do things in such a
way that it's hard for the sensor to
discover right and also hard to disrupt
so we can use sort of standard image
hiding techniques to make discovery
difficult and we can use sort of more
redundancy style technique redundancy
and racial coding techniques to make
disruption tough what I'm going to spend
a little bit of time on is is these
latter two challenges in particular how
does Bob figure out where he should put
this thing right like where you know
what what content should he put it in
where should he drop it so that Alice
can find it right what we want to do is
make the process of Alice fetching this
cover traffic deniable write something
that she would do anyway so that if the
sensor is watching right this would look
just just sort of normal ok so where to
embed this right well of course Alice
could go looking everywhere right you
could just download all the Flickr maybe
and look at every picture and see is my
message here is if they don't know it's
not there all this is not an option
right for a variety of reasons so Alice
and Bob somehow have to agree on some
subset of content without immediately
communicating with one another and
they've got to do this in as I mentioned
in a way such that when Alice does this
it's it's deniable so here's basically
how we do how we create that deniable
embedding what we do is we take these
these message identifier let's say a URL
right and we put this basically into
some ID space what we want to do then is
identify some kind of tasks right the
else would perform anyway right to pick
some things that she would do right look
at Bob's vacation photos or you know
watch videos of cats or you know look at
pictures of blue flowers or something we
put those on on in this ID space as well
and what we do then is we sort of map
the message identifier that corresponds
to that content
to the tasks that Alice who would need
to perform to retrieve the cover traffic
which contains that content so for
example these tasks might be something
like as i mentioned right search for
blue flowers or you know look at a
particular set of images or videos and
then by doing those particular things
which she's likely to do anyway right
then she's able to get the stuff that
she really cares about ok so as you
might have it so that's basically the
general idea as you might imagine this
does not perform you know super quickly
right this is this is basically good for
things like you know publishing an
article or sending a message I mean well
depending on how deniable you want this
to be and how aggressive alice is at
fetching all kinds of stuff or how
quickly she does this this can take on
the order of minutes for you know to
grab a you know a fairly small message
but but presumably that's good enough
for certain types of communication now
figuring out how to make this type of
communication more real-time and yet
still denials it remains an open
challenge I want to spend like a couple
minutes just closing up talking about
this this this last challenge yes bob is
the new something about Allison
Alice needs to know something about
where Bob is going to put these things
so the way that they do that is you can
kind of view this mapping of tasks to
identify this as like a dictionary of
sorts so Alec so the thing that they
both agree on which is where you know
the bootstrapping has to occur is that
common message identifier so Bob's going
to put stuff in a certain place based on
that and alice is going to fetch it
based on that yeah so that's that's sort
of the common language that they have to
speak on order for that to work ok so um
I just want to yes if they can pull
strap right under you the same mess of
mechanisms we just exchanged messages
presumably like the bootstrap mechanism
is going to be smaller than the message
itself but you're right i mean you
potentially need another mechanism to
pass that boots left information and if
yeah if you had a perfect bootstrapping
mechanism you wouldn't need such a
system in the first place but the idea
here would be that you might not need to
pass that over the network at all so for
example I could say hey the message ID
that I'm first let's say that we made in
person right in the dark alley or
something I say the message ID that I'm
going to first send you a message on is
like you know 129 right so so now we're
good right so based on that now you can
maybe fetch large you know bigger
messages I could even send you a new set
of message ids or even a new mapping
once we've got that initial boot strap
so that I think that's the that's the
trick there is sighs okay so just a
couple of minutes talking about this
this last challenge which um I'll just
pose like pose a position for you I
think we've seen in sort of recent times
a lot of governments essentially
restricting communications in various
ways for example we saw for example with
the you know Iranian elections a
blocking of Twitter etc we saw the
Egyptians you know completely shut down
the network I would pause it that as
governments gets more savvy about how to
use the network they're not going to
shut it down but rather use it to
manipulate the information that we see
right or the citizens see right because
why would you shut it down if you could
use it to sort of influence public
opinion or you know tilt the outcome in
your favor so I think basically what I
see as an ongoing challenge is
manipulation of content and I'm going to
talk just briefly for a couple minutes
about our sort of more benign version of
manipulation but something that I think
is still relevant and that's
personalization right so in the in the
best case right we're seeing you know
many many organizations take our
activities our preferences etc and use
that information to whittle down what we
see so if we search for shoes if we
search for books or networking or
whatever then our past behavior
activities etc dick
the types of things that that that were
that were likely to see based on those
interests now in the best case right
we're seeing things where you know we're
seeing results that potentially are
already tweaked towards things that we
already agree with her already you know
are already aligned with our own tastes
and interests and one can argue that
that's good right i mean there's
certainly positives to that but there is
a flip side to that as well which is
that we don't have control of it over
over how that's being done and we
actually don't even know sometimes what
you know what's you know what we're
missing so one of the things that I'm
looking at now is how to provide users
better visibility and control into how
that how that you know how that sort of
restriction or filtering is being done
if you will I'm going to just describe
this is very much work in progress i'm
going to just take like a minute or two
to describe kind of the low-hanging
fruit that we're doing here so we've
started off looking at search in
particular when you when you search your
question might be well one or other
people seeing when they search for the
same term right or you might actually
want to run the same query in different
ways maybe it's different personas or
something like that so we're starting
off with something very similar very
very simple which is to say take a query
right and then run it from different
geographies right as different users and
basically see what turns up what shows
up on the first page where you know
where does it show up what doesn't show
up when it doesn't appear can we explain
can we explain those things um okay so
I'm in a particular let's see if I had I
had were tool in here dan I used the
wrong slide well let's let's use the
arvind so you can um i was gonna pick on
ratul since he wasn't here but but uh so
i'll give you a different example so if
we search for arvind professor
University of Washington you'll
basically get a bunch of search results
right but what this chrome plugin that
we've built does is actually tell you
other things that you didn't see right
other other other other search results
that came up in a particular users top
10 depending on where that search was
run so right now we've basically built
this tool which is called bobble right
that allows you to basically see search
results from other kind
perspectives in particular in this we're
basically just focused on geography so
far with the tool but as we work on this
we're expanding it to look at sort of
you know how these queries differ based
on your past search history you know and
other types of context that you might
that you might imagine so ultimately so
this is basically just the first step
right because we're looking at how to
improve visibility ultimately that you
might imagine a tool where a user
actually provide some feedback or
control into the types of results they
see so an example of that might be I
might want to run a query as a
particular you know persona as a
particular group so for example the the
the results that I see when I search say
for example Seattle right I might want
the results to differ based on whether
I'm quitting as a you know food
connoisseur or marathon runner or
networking researcher or what-have-you I
might want to see you know see different
types of things so that's the type of
direction I see this this work going so
just in conclusion right I've talked
about how how different different
parties are vying for control of
information on the Internet in a variety
of different ways and I've spent
probably the majority of the time
talking about work that we've done to
combat message abuse but I've also
talked about other problems relating to
both censorship and and just more
recently looking at how different tools
and algorithms may ultimately be used to
manipulate the types of information that
we do or don't see and I'm working on
ways to sort of tilt the tilt the
balance back in the in the hands of the
user as well so thank you very much
something message filtering has been a
long history of you know just kind of
nice and patton boggs anything yet you
know particularly the content-based you
know filtering level stuff has you know
it seems to me retrain population to get
you know that we're about these are
grounds for optimism that there are
intrinsic things in the kind
approaches that you described that would
put you know that would give us tools
that are beyond the region they're
available to them yeah this is something
I think requires I mean it bears a
little bit more formal study but i would
say informally we'd like to look for
features that are more costly for
adversaries to adapt to right so if we
look at content for example it's fairly
fairly low cost to change the way that a
message gets encoded or embedded if we
look at network level features yeah
thinks it adversaries can still adapt
right in particular we look at the
behavioral features that that that I
showed right you could certainly send
spam from less dense you know you know
in a less dense way but presumably
there's I mean lurking behind that we
assume that there's some costs to
adaptation and on both sides right and
by to take that example in particular if
you were to say that you can only send
send spam from you know a certain number
of IP addresses within a range before
you sort of trip before you sort of trip
some detector then presumably if you
impose some kind of cost right either in
sort of redoute maybe in reduced volume
right certainly for a region of space um
I don't know how to model that cost I
think it would be a very interesting
problem to sort of try to figure out
okay now how can we actually model an
adversary on the on the flip side actual
I think there's like in the sensor side
as well you could ask the exact same
question I just like yes but how do we
know that the sensor isn't going to
adapt to try to detect the techniques
that that I showed and I think again
there's like a really interesting
question in trying to model the
capabilities of the adversary in theory
the ad like the detector in that case is
unbounded I could do just about anything
could look at the fact that you never
send mail it or you never c never browse
the web at 3am on sundays this is on the
economic motivation so it's harder
because you know state level
the guy's a serious probably willing to
go to greater lengths the scammer to get
a chance stuff done we must get done it
is it's a tough as potentially tougher
thing to model particularly if you think
if you if you view government is having
like unbounded resources to throw the
problem then it then it is certainly
trickier if we you could potentially do
the economic model if you talk about
instead of a you know a government with
potentially unbounded resources if you
talk about say folks who are interested
in drm for example like they have a
certain amount I mean their economics at
play in those kind of situations yeah
seemingly seemingly yeah yeah I think on
on either problem that you look at those
sort of like more work to be done in
terms of model modeling the adversary</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
