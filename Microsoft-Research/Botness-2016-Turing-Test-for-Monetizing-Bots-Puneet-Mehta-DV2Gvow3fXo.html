CEO of message darte I this talk is
called the Turing test for money so just
quickly about message I before we jump
into the talk so we are an AI platform
for conversational interfaces and
conversational commerce most of our
customers our fortune 500 companies ten
of the 14 hundred users at this point
and we were a facebook launched partner
for the messenger platform recently um
so the reason we are here is because
bots are here right science fiction
tells us one thing reality is something
else sorry Lily but you know jumping
right in as we get to what we would be
calling the Internet of gods we are
looking at it as two different problems
if you will look to different problem
sets one is around conversational
interfaces which is anything from you
know voice to text but there's also what
happens beyond that because the promise
of bots is not just that you can chat to
something and get an answer but really
what is it that it can do for you so the
Turing test you know this is the
official definition of the Turing test
is a test of a machines ability to
exhibit intelligent behavior so
essentially you can't tell whether
you're talking to a human or you're
talking to a machine but really when we
look at the first set of bots at least
what we have experience working with
some of the biggest brands out there is
that believability is even more
important than efficiency so what it
means is when a consumer is talking to a
bot do they believe that or do they
believe that part or can they have trust
in that part is very more important than
what that bot can do for the consumer so
if you unpack the Turing test further
what you see is there's unintelligent
human behavior you know a lot of
humankind does that then there's your
intelligent behavior and then there's
intelligent behavior which humans don't
perform right so today the Turing test
addresses kind of this overlap which is
more focused on believability
efficiency but going forward yes
essentially what we are working on and
what you know some of the top brands in
the world want from our platform is kind
of getting there and this is something
we are completely missing out on and
especially when we are doing new
interfaces for BOTS you know we try to
dump them down you know even statements
like oh do bots need AI every system in
the word build 12 months from now would
have AI in it most systems in the word
that you use already have some form of
AI in it I mean like wake up so again
you know we can talk about this till the
cows come home but messaging is
obviously eating other interfaces proof
of that smart car recently sold 388 cars
on v-chat that's a messaging app so
these people did not show up at
dealerships they did not talk to car
salespeople they were messaging and
buying twenty thousand dollar items on a
messaging app on the right side that
someone buying their daily cup of coffee
and then there's kind of everything in
between so what we are seeing happen in
the West now has already happened in
China except this is a human-powered
internet so all these bots that you see
on v-chat you know their tens of
thousands of people whose day job is to
write these messages back obviously if
this becomes our interface to life
that's not an efficient model that's
kind of where here comes in okay so what
have we learned from working with some
of the biggest brands in the world the
first thing is the importance of
crafting a conversation you know if you
think about this you unpack this problem
again there are two main elements to
this the first one is how intelligent
can I bought be so how much context
could it carry forward and how much in
real time could interpret what a
consumer is looking for but the second
thing is again around that believability
piece so the art part to this puzzle the
UX part to this puzzle is sometimes even
more important than the AI part to the
puzzle at least in today's word so when
you look at that what you would notice
is obviously they are BOTS that chat and
what's that do so it's somewhere in
between an interface and an API so the
interface has
is to create believability is to get the
information in the most efficient form
but at the end of the day you won't use
bots that do nothing for you right even
the bots that just chat with you and
give you content have to entertain you
in the best possible fashion the second
part to this entire puzzle is the way at
least this is our word view is going
forward you would have bots that
represent individuals on the internet
and bots that represent businesses or
brands on the internet and at some point
in the future these wats would chat with
each other and negotiate with each other
so my bot could talk to delta airlines
and united and JetBlue and say hey I'm
only going to talk to one of you give me
a ten percent discount and I won't chat
with anybody else but this offer stands
for the next ten minutes so that's the
negotiation tactic that humans practice
today but would wats do it probably in
the near future so that's where you draw
the line which is you know which parts
are representing individuals and which
parts are representing businesses and
then you know one thing that some of the
bigger brands are always thinking about
is around you know issues around data
privacy and what adds value so you have
created this concept of data hug is that
would you trust a bot with your identity
now ask you ask this question to
yourself as a consumer would you trust
about today with your identity know so
many people come up with the same answer
no you know it feels like giving too
much there would you trust support with
you wallet would you would you trust
about with your emotions
that's becoming the cheapest currency
these days but so what happened was you
know the first brand whatever on
facebook Messenger was built on our
platform by Sony Pictures so we ran an
experiment where we said if we wanted to
achieve all those three where people
give us about their identity trust the
bot with the wallet you know trust with
their emotions so goosebumps was 100
million dollar movie and the main
messenger ID had no Community Managers
behind it this was you know priests and
receive API this was last year and
consumers ended up having 10 minute long
conversations with it on an average the
longest conversation believe it or not
was two hours and some conversations
involved anything from people saying hey
you know my my kid has the soccer game
tomorrow would you come with us another
person saying I have a chemo appointment
day after tomorrow would you accompany
me there there's another person that
said would you accompany my family to
watch the movie goosebumps right so not
only were they buying tickets and buying
merchandise they were having these
amazing conversations where they let the
guard down so now that's one lens to
look at it right this was essentially an
experiment in conversational interfaces
but we are already trusting BOTS with
our identity with our wallets with our
emotions if you think about it website
and apps are BOTS as well they just
speak another language it's just
technology package in a different way
they talk in the form of clicks rather
than talking in the form of messages so
so how is this different now how is this
word different now so long story short
you're talking like a human we think
that's the biggest challenge with bots
you know all the NLP problems that we're
solving and you know making sure the
conversation feels human we think that's
a really really really small part of the
problem this is a fundamental
restructuring of the human machine
relationship that we are going through
and all those aspects that we mentioned
you know I we don't have answers to
those yet but we at least know what
questions to ask
especially as this becomes a mainstream
interface you know what commerce stay
the same maybe we don't have to go ask a
machine to make recommendations on which
you know shirt should i buy an extra
which shoes based on my last reference
maybe there's somebody watching out for
me to do that maybe somebody already
knows that I have a high end of intent
to travel to cons the week after next
and you know the book tickets for me so
they're all these things that are
happening and the main takeaway I would
say if you could have one takeaway from
the stock it would be that don't look at
BOTS and try to you know put it in some
sort of a structure that you already
know this is a fundamental restructuring
we are going through so don't compare it
to hey ABS behave in this way so we need
to have a bot store because there was an
app store or that when browsers came
into being you know people created
websites and the first generation of
websites had logins so now we need
logins so the main thought process here
is we have this opportunity to go
through that fundamental restructuring
really eliminate friction we have the
right tool sets now a eyes hair deep
learning is here and you know all of us
just everybody in this room we all
collectively have to do a great job at
making sure this becomes the interface
to life so this is how at least we are
solving the problem I won't bore you
with the details but if you have
questions I'm around we mostly use a
reinforcement learning a branch of deep
learning in order to create these
amazing conversational interfaces and
then like I said we are using a bunch of
different UX techniques in order to
solve the problem even if you look at
search that's kind of the easiest way to
think about a combination of UX and a I
typically when you do a Google search
you would expect an answer back what you
get back instead is a set of links
that's a UX solution to an AI problem
where you don't have enough for thur
resolution on the definiteness of the
answer you provide some options so that
the consumer can dig in so so that's an
example of how you x na i canna come
together but obviously within the in the
sense of conversation interfaces and
commerce it's a fairly different context
something that we are all working on and
discovering
so that's it would love to take any
questions or chat with you afterwards
but hope you enjoyed the Turing test for
money quite a few we are working on some
but that was the that was the first one
that we did
well I think the all the work you're
doing on the intelligence side is
hopefully causing the user to do the
least possible work because now you have
stateful bots that remember who you are
and they can potentially buy on your
behalf and do stuff on your behalf again
you know I think the natural language
part most people when they think about
AI for BOTS they think just natural
language processing and I think that's
just like a very small part of the
problem it's how you apply a I
holistically to this problem you know we
are applying it to self-driving cars
can't be applied to bots so so I think
it's a pretty much the same world if you
will but it's just too different takes
on the problem sure
so the question was how are we doing
human assisted stuff do these humans
step in a live fashion and are we
exposing that to the consumer so yes we
are we are doing human assisted AI most
of our customers are able to get to
about ninety percent without need for a
human and then for edge cases where the
AI is still learning a human steps in
most of the brands are telling the
consumer that as human has stepped in so
this full transparency there but the
goal really is that you know gradually I
learned is well enough where it starts
to perform better than the human that
stepped in thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
