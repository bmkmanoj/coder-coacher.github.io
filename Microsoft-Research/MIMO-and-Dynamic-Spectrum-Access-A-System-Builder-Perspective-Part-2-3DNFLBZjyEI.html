lectures freely available
you
I also welcome to the next part now I
guess is going to talk more about how to
select these users and how to get more
throughput sort of this manual so why
you just like change them Holly if it
because this capacity is really heavily
depend on the my mo channel structure to
eunice through that is why I see how
this 0 14 and us okay so basically we
consider about acts upon they have three
users okay ABC and we need to pick up to
users so while we consider about 0 14
decoding the basically we can consider
about it assuming the channel of a is in
this a vector pretender channel and this
vector present' the channel B so to the
decode the sick low of a yuli we did do
a projection is basically this little
forcing how the different does the
project to Z or circle of direction of
the channel B because it's a projection
actually there's a reduced of the signal
stress so this is our not because of
zero forcing decoding so so we cancel
the self interference actually paid a
price with prices reduce your signals
experience as a power and similarly if
you're decoding this be able to do the
same of rejection and reduce the lasik
low stress so now we can observe that
the angle of these two the angle of the
two channels okay really determine how
much loss you're going to have in your
up beauty okay so obviously they say I
saw a and the B and the bien se bien se
these two channels and more or so close
to each other the means they are a wider
angle
because in this to channel letter then
choosing this one you get a better
performance because of how last
reduction in the channel okay however if
we do a random selection okay then we do
not really control pick up which one we
just a random pic okay sometimes we're
going to pick up the good ones some time
we're going to pick the bad ways okay we
got your average and we see more
antennas actually have a more components
to pick okay if you random pic that more
likely we got this bad ones instead of a
gang all these good ones so this is the
performance comparison is not so this
are they saw what brought presents your
random selection just a random pic okay
and this this talk was basically
presents your strategic Lee pick the
best one okay now you can see if huge
difference between these two strategy
okay where's random selection basically
cannot make full use of your capacity
and they better even drop with small
antennas it's more antennas event me
pickups users simply just another work
so idea they will want to get this okay
we need to select this vast users
compounded in together that means their
channel and more so close to each other
then we do the decoding it do not have
this loss of signal strengths but
actually compute such optimal
combination with your mobile users it's
very hot okay this is actually the
compilation complexity to pick up the
because you need to exam all these
compilations of this mobile users okay
so there are some too many compilations
and you know because we will want to
exam this a channel capacity actually we
need to compute these channel universe
okay and this is a la linea operation so
it's not easy to find any appropriation
of them to do this now let's consider so
you say so okay fine this is complex
financial complexity but the impact case
not all exponential complexity algorithm
cannot be performed in reality right so
we first we need to consider how much
time we really to compute these channels
okay but i'd say the result is really
lucky because they're going to give a
you need affordable competition which is
only a minimal a small number of users
to pick up and with some medium-sized on
my whole system so this is number of
potential user you can you can choose
from okay and the h not individually
this circle means they die only two
antennas and these wines are going to
how eight internet video antennas he's
not really large scale is the medium
skill on my mo system so i can save net
content about eight antenna when you
have this life is sleepy number of users
is going to have niketown seconds to
compute just a neck oh this user to get
best one so nicely physically cannot do
this right so we need you to reduce this
competition away we cannot do this the
too much competition but when operates
way is that we can sense either okay if
we can because because they previously
they say is a compilation of however you
search and how much how each competition
you spend to compute a inverse of the
channel to get the capacity estimation
so why idea is that actually how you do
the overhead of comm channel universe so
the idea is actually quite interesting
and in previous summer on paper also
explore if we can't do something like
xpro region at oxide we only samho the
channel and they pick up a few sample
sub carriers and a dual-channel universe
and they use these channeling rules to
intuitive to to get approximate of later
by sub carriers okay so that's how I
side basic idea so we did a few
experiments I could have found that it
is not really good detail I if we pick
up one over to that means which we
remove half of the sub carriers and it
only compute the channel universe of
hablar con subcarriers we've got you
know stable environment regard to DB
loss ok because it's arrow in this
approximation both but it's ok to DB is
a ok sweetie be fun and the better now
if you're gonna kick up a while or five
sub canal then IDK as as much as 60 but
you raised a slightly movement okay then
it's become very very bad the problem
occurs this mud pass feeding okay so
make some very sharp transition between
one sub Karin and Nelson keep going
although you can see if some overhead
but I'm not suggesting that's the way to
go because if you do is another for a
little dose of harassing us because of
these are a proclamation so the better
way we think it is to reduce the search
space okay instead of doing like this
explains your search we want to do to
bound the search the competition such
company on the bounder so we come up
this as a branch and a bounding idea so
it's trying to search the tree offending
like a search in zachry depending the
tree of of the century so they come from
the root then I pick up the first a user
in the beamforming group okay
appear by user one each one and the exam
night and the spending level band if how
I started user one combined with you the
two and the user to with you the three
and this one's boss so you spend in a
tree to compute so if you spoil the
entire tree then again we just try every
like every combination of the mobile
users by the way you need to come or you
need to control this bound we actually
each time we own it's the next the top-k
groups okay so for example here we just
expand so you when you compute to you
see and found advanced decay okay then
we searched from the bass ke to stand
the next level okay so each time we
constrained a competition and to commit
a competition so it's all we've done
this competition to search the tree and
and there's some bad nodes simply we do
the pro as early stage so we do not
depend on that
this one oh yeah each one you just hang
out dated that means the essay now these
user is it is it yeah it comes in then
after we generate the trees actually we
do not discuss this result we save that
in a database ok now we do that we can
do them a progressive update so the idea
is that actually you do not need to
compute the group every time you
transmit a packet the update we update
this group rosanna is tree only when
some channel change okay but we know
that some this this channel we can
consider it as a constant that you
during the Channel Tunnel internal
coherence time so we need only get the
one update every channel co-head of time
then we just update this cheese so so if
the chick this tree or if some certain
user change only affects this portion of
the subtree that contains is using so we
just update this smaller portion of
trees Fernandez oh go save the you save
the whole competition so you know with
this K actually provide us a tuning nuke
is a tuning knob that can chill the
trade-off between how much computation
you spend on finding the optimal found
in a battle group and call suppity more
groups you can get right so it's
basically a trade-off between the summer
eight improvement and there's a they
complex see the computation complexity
you spend on that so accurately value is
that so they say suppressing huh and
this is this watch and a bounding algun
and over the best one they say so
optimal explain
they searched the whole compilation and
gaza pathway and we found that actually
a few kids you do not need to attend a
much keep much keys on a small number of
kids then we can pretty much close to
the optimal what so that means that we
need only to tune okay with seeing a
small wrench so we're actually William
element that so the p-type okay base on
the channel kohistan so so go here is
that we want to get the users in action
before the any channel so any you update
it's coming from okay we gotta do an
update we did up the trees okay so we
need to finish the treat a patient
before do updates come from okay the new
updated is coming from Ed's their co
hence Hunter leads the core is the time
of the user so actually we use that as a
competition Tumbo here is that the
computer in town boundaries just 13
milliseconds okay so actually we adapt
it based on this without give a common
case ha so actually we can almost of
track too they have this computation
finished the tree update below before
the deadline of course so that means
every 30 milliseconds we're going to
have a new update but the fixed of
course sometimes you just do not use the
time very well you'll spend that time
compute that sometimes you tella spend
too much time over that so it's not very
good
so so with that actually we can so say
okay this is the evaluation of the
really summary we can canvass this aw
greely Alden so this is a random so if
you just a random pick up views so he's
really that and agree to all of them
basically means with each time I just a
pick up the best group and drop the old
addressed okay it's a equivalent to k
equal to one kids now it's performing
the batter then greedy but is still far
away from the optimal so this this one
listen I auto sequence exclusive search
now find that this adaptive k stage so
you give you a little bit tunable on
there is how many competition we pay on
that actually trying to this this
optimal very close okay that means you
gave me little bit more options okay
then i can do method then you do not
give give only one option that operates
or three days around me one option but
if you need to be the more options stand
a little bit more computer on that now i
can do that goes through the optimist ah
so this is another picture to show the
same same result but that is different
the client okay so the conclusion is
using neck you they will say so adaptive
choose of the competition k is very
pragmatic close to the optimal user
selection
ok so now yes so I guess the summarizes
part so let's say there's a mime oh
we're talking about the scalable joanie
now I guess I give very quick here
uh-huh discussion on the u.s. connection
so basically that section actually from
a talk this afternoon on a NOS fogger
here actually we use to this users in
action why is the random selection ok so
r NS area is simple ok i'm in some sense
if you oprah vision your transmit
antennas it is you can scale but in
skill in a very low stop then you cannot
make full use of user or antenna very
simple so if you consider about i do not
want to add more complexity on that it's
still valid solution practice just a
waste of some capacity but ok ok if i
can make very cheap antennas ok the
property can sing coffee if i can make
the trade achieve Adina's i do not care
really the efficiency I can just
deployed very very antennas ok it's an
answer one way to think about this but
I'm aware if we they can tell us the
particle pencil deploy then we consider
more to make better use of the audience
and its antennas capacity then we laid
some of our research in Harlem to pick
up the right user compilation this is
with a group to transmit and it is
pretty much close to a day optimal and
there is a good be a good trade-off
between the complexity and are you
feeling ok yeah please in the context of
Wi-Fi he said that mine was just an
intellectual curiosity said the channel
bonding and the frame aggregation are
possibly more practical solutions than
my mom what do you think I think it to
some extent yes sure yeah i think this
essay I think from the practical point
view is that mostly we will just pick up
these most simple solutions let's solve
a existing big problems definitely I
think that is the right time we deploy a
every da we deploy it's a simple
technology not read a petition but the
problem is that actually already almost
achieve this thing right but the old
question of the research is for how we
push this day flood to that stage so how
this question is like how can we
increase the body's capacity what our
capacity by Lazar order of magnitudes I
think the my mole probably the way may
be the only way to go I think it's still
variable to to pushing this way
more I think that money really a memo
does is it gives you more reliability if
you're using one stream across many
spatial patterns right which you cannot
get with just a syllabary fundamental
that
she's here with one thing is physical
layer getting it good is good thing but
one of the things baskin was also
talking about what what about the higher
layers in the sense for example Mac is
not perfectly designed TCP does not so
all these things are there but that also
there's lot of research opportunity in
terms of figuring out what we should do
on the upper layers to make this work
better for example when user selection
is still lower level but how do we
improve them how do we sort of so there
is lot of research challenges there yeah
so I think that we still we still not go
to that vice or do the large mammal
system but we sit the research bureau
Ron he set a building block and we put
more knowledge on the physical layer
more knowledge on the management on the
mac and how they cheat epp here we're
going to happen I said well all these
issues have been solved then probably we
have the practice system that really
take off in the practical at production
network yeah the little hook at this
level I think the fire has seen the most
sort of explosive improvements and the
rest of the layers have been lagging
behind quite a lot that is true actually
yeah yeah um I think this is also a very
good question and I think they say a
different line of research picking on
that I think this is really the man will
have there are different challenges one
particular challenge actually I can sink
are actually I I have work on today's a
little bit which my students is that how
you sink rise the clock between all this
dish beauty yeah that's a really
challenging and for the my more if you
do not have a synchro closely a
synchronous o'clock is going to the
disaster when you have large number of
antennas yet you consider the spatial
correlation spatial coloration yagi
antenna elements and the channel yeah
yeah so I think this your selection is
particularly to address this problem
because I need to pick up the users that
the channel do not collect too much to
each other just pick up the better ones
so the idea is that so yy-you think
about why you pick up the users actually
make so we know that a 04 thing is not
capacity to achieve the decoding mime
okay we have some dirty paper but if you
consider a summation combined ways that
0 40 we could got a optimal solution
seen you know basically consider but you
have a large pool of user to select that
means you can always pick up this unit
the only have is also close channels
then you achieve your channel capacity
okay so naturally is you think that with
the user scenario plus zero force is can
be a capacity achieving my more
processing oh yeah
I think I messy the almost identical
they saw they now change because a high
that we depend on the edomah right in
high as an I think Thea don't have much
difference in knowing our way and you
can consider noise they can give you a
slight better performance of course but
they do not have fundamental change of
heart my no difference from what NASA
yeah yeah
take one
you your question is how to compute the
precoder based on the channel so it's a
real question yes yeah ah you mean if
you do not have this immediate feedback
from the channel state okay please okay
so you have a set of um yeah I saw you
so it says the question is that so so
instead of you confuse the precoder on
the fly you can have a few priests at
pre coders and you've just a pickup
we're big on yeah I said they saw i I
don't I don't do the detailed numerica
configuration you think they see I think
the skin you mentioned is you saw a lot
of that being talking about the standard
idea standards a think about how the
design is a pretty precoder and this was
what on I don't compare that but I think
that this could be so there's my
understanding some make me love you
cracked but mom is danny is a trade-off
between the complexity and the
performance so definitely if you have
the precharge channel state you can get
a better performance in terms of some
way to use a cup of capacity but it
definitely you need to will pay more
computation into doing that and adding
the complexity there is for example how
do you handle this reciprocity to make
they saw say I saw acquisition skill on
so so if you cannot do this maybe is too
heavy to do that now I'm a precoder may
be a good solution you can create the
capacity to peer based on baby no oh ha
look at me complexity so I think they
basically trade-off
yeah no question okay okay yeah you have
picture I don't know how you're going to
country consider ways ok so I'm perlier
I just 30 lakhs half an hour it's just
like little bit on the dynamic
special access so the motivation Easter
you know okay so commentary days
spectrums basically at the ready
allocation that's the standard by just a
cover the government okay and we know
that is efficient so some spa us some
spectrum basically fully utilized it's a
very congested and some portion of you
tell the organization of spectrum is
very low ok almost empty and also
currently the one is standard the usual
they have the fixed definition of your
channel it means by channel means on
central frequency and the Penguins ok so
this fix one is sick law is causing
efficient in efficient if this channel
is shared by his crib genius lee why is
on devices on what this means is it
gives the this figure gave the example
of that so so consider about the l2 30
other n channel okay so this has 40
members but this channel is I same pen
so its share between the Wi-Fi and
pathetic other videos not giggity ok
therapy is very level yeah repair video
so if there's only two video Zippy's
video here okay now how wanna pick up
the channel we cannot use a 40mm
christian or because it going to
interfere with the digby network and the
only way whiskering the standard we only
account i do this is no half of the 20
macarons channel but an app is this
portion is important on you
so it's a pretty not very fidget okay so
I DNA ready to have the Y pass the glow
to receive their channel to follow this
red mask okay instead of this one so
this will require dove quite a flexible
on mccadden to do this channel education
on the flight because it's a changing
over the time okay so what I'm going to
do this is basically nog nicest
non-contiguous or bien approach so so I
do this agency will at the end they say
I ID just fitting wide say channel the
whole channel which very very lad with
sub carrots okay so now we just a tease
just say you know have a number of this
sub carriers now if any inference occur
that just out for summer on in some sub
carriers but just turn off this sub
carriers okay there's more interference
I just like these sub carriers but do
not use its sub carriers now then we can
just use this group subcarriers for
communication it is the various
solutions and there are pretty much a
few designs on this but the dysuria
Snyder is quite compact that because we
have the fixed allocation of subcarriers
that's how to turn off certain
subcarriers is dynamic it's only I have
some in the fridge there then I need to
mark this this sub curious how are you
notify the end the other part that this
have you changed and the wires change
the net means the whole physically
structure going to change now how you
place this are a part of the subcarrier
can problem because some paw let me just
do you feel
if you omit you remove it is the pilot
subcarriers on what subcarrier please
you place now the pilot ok so it's
identical a means for each in the vision
behind her is can't like a tactical mode
of the physical layer so you lay the
combinational lot of physical comfort
division to do it so it is basically is
now really good to do that how you do
the preamble hard so I suppose so so
idea of the spectrum virtualization we
ask that question so can we really
separate the base there from the
spectral the video then that means the
structural you transmit over there is
there with dita please if we can do this
there we only other interface between
the baseband and the review frequency to
do this dynamic programming without
changing the physical layer design for
the basic idea so they are chipping do
not concede so I have a bit then then we
have a layer here to do this face this
sheep puter based on the baseband
modulation we just received is a receive
the shape of this baseline waveform to
so that it can fit into the real radio
frequency allocate dance ok on the other
hand when you receive that just collect
this band on the fly and do the inverse
operation compile with the symbols into
a base back now the baseband algo the
algorithm do not need to change ok it
just sent us a glow as you a contiguous
channel and receive from our community
chain the complexity of the real real
life and education has been
I by disease there so this mayor we call
that a spiritual emotional I gently so
it's actually be located as the Lea 0.5
why is because the physical layer is a
layer 1 okay it's a personally but it's
below the physical year and butter of
course it please abide the really analog
hard way so this data layer 0 so there's
a degree of mine so this is the whole
architecture here is that we have with
some spiritual manager that's just a
coordinated a channel education we
assume that it is a manager there and it
just a deal they say your video each
other allocates certain portion of the
certain portion of the band that we can
use to transmit okay then this
information going to propagate it to
these receiver filters then you're doing
this is remapping you get this across
from the fiscal year it feeds and
physically and we ship them to the real
allocation of the video it could have
multiple reduce okay or you can have
only one reduce that is a shared by
different physically okay so the key
here is how we can design a siglos
receiver function its goal is to we have
this flexibility to transport up through
the baseband signals to any location of
the eyes bent so the op and can be
contiguous or can be e non contiguous
pants okay so the principle is basically
physical layer or classic said
transparent we buy transparent means
that the physical a do not receive near
as although we'll just translate the
simplest we from the fiscal year point
of view that you not you cannot tell if
it had been transferred or not okay only
again see is a different channel it
could be a different channel but so so
that means the order signal processing
often nicor equalization and i think
you change okay let's say physically and
it's a simple and the dance Apple so
it's a Jason must be stated is very
simple so actually the operation is a
basically very simple on history the
first operation we call this a security
competition okay that means this
decomposition basically compa the sea
glow from the baseband to a couple of
signal components and this synchro
components as a group together and
change their bandwidth by adjusting
their something with okay can say that
about how you can stress the signal and
the compressors ago and the doing the
after doing that the each component may
shift to a different pair okay between
the shifting so then this output going
to fit on the reel I allocation on the
reverse process are going just going to
a rich it up to in the reverse so first
of your ship that from the iphone and I
frequency to the certain basement back
and adjust that according to the
physical layer specification and finally
the compile compose all this component
together and generate regenerate these
physical your skills as if they are
going to comes through
so the decomposition basically involve
at Ft based a security competition so
basically i take the comment to mean
sample of the baseband signal and do a
large point FFT that's basically
decouple that into a set of face frexing
components okay and the composition is a
Desilu the reverse operation Jessa put
this on common domain samples from the
subscripts and an app let it into a oh
sorry so we do it the composition then I
do a mapping okay imagine two different
because they want to have long
contiguous is just two met in too deep
in the potion of the allocation band
they do a iff I've inverse F of T to
generate the real time in the comment
domestic laws then this glows can be
used to transmit all the reverse part is
basically the day today the reversing is
that you do the n FF decomposition and
the pickup's the siglos component you
won't collect for the basement and
putting that we into em are ifft points
then you're going to generate the domain
come to me spectrum symbols for visa so
LT does a bit of this way so I sense it
LT also does a bit of this rate so
basically it moves the I now do you have
there is a Cinco the single care we are
a PMA yeah so these are pretty similar
mechanism so it's basically ideas yeah I
think the design is similar under the
similar inside yeah 30 cup of that into
multiple component and regroup that
under business sudden collision but if
of course the condition is different
manda panda bears are adjustment this is
a rigger simple so detailed Tim innovis
are familiar with this signal processing
is really the basically operations
natural just a great ok so the basically
I want to use them more rate I just
increase my
sampling increase sampling to reduce the
bandwidth or reduce the sampling rate to
increase the bandwidth the shifting okay
JP is all so simple because the in
virtual spectrum we always start from
zero base then but the physical special
it can be centralized data honey I've
time so I need to just remove that ship
that to a different portion of state
there is a central frequently so with
this with this operations actually so
actually we can do what is we can become
political and nap that in two different
bad okay then it's just which dance band
ways to match the physical layer
allocation now we ship to a video from
and central frequency then you can
really transmitted to their so but now
it even understand what is the recipient
okay but fundamentally we need to
consider about this is the fft
decomposition what's it really does okay
let's consider about this okay so
actually what it does is that we do is
the two like they consider what is
happened this the idea here so let's
consider this x is what we going to
transmit okay and it can take up whole
by supremacy okay so that's doing this
is at the FP or basically okay let's
consider the first hi that up potion is
x1 the lower portion is active okay now
it do a bishop is that we map this XY to
a higher frequency band and the xq2 a
norfolk in the back now we map this
signal to too long contiguous I've been
okay now this is going to transmit over
there and then the receiver will pick up
this portion this portion and
put that into the FFD compiler and again
why the wise they reconstructed a sickle
oh ok so the idea is that we leave y
equal to X ok so if this too why
equipment a hat and that means the order
will ship doesn't change it too much ok
that's it go so actually we can derive
that is that actually we found the Y is
some saying night disease it's not
exactly X but a combination of x1 and x2
these these two components and yeah so
this one basically no it's not exactly
acts but it acts plies a control channel
this edge you might have because they
represent the processing that they
channel the channels or propagation
channel ok but this party is not exactly
you just have this X prime one at frys
indeed a combination of 6x likes to ok
why a scat if this econ landings this
t0t0 ok yeah this depends on the t t0 is
safe on how safe is they on the time you
receive that one so that means if you
have is have a propagation delay
something come in a prolific until a two
to get the Psychlos so it's a t0 and
also the f h this is the central
focusing of the first half apart at a
lower part so that really means is that
what you receive is now exactly the acts
but a multipass version of Acts ok
marcos wrong part of version neck so if
it is required if you have a very
accurate time synchronization is t0 is
it is their clothes their means it's
where
closely sing cries on this portion this
part is very closely sink right this
just equal to eat because this term
becomes 0 become one ok this is it one
so they just acts ok so if there's the
arrow then it's called something else ok
cause like a multipass arrow ok but the
consider is it is a major I mean because
this part authentically goes through the
dip in the past because you've given the
pregnancy consider different paths so is
it with that so its nature to consider
that it so surprised ok but this if we
if there's an altar and yeah it's not I
mean it this error can be minimized if
you can't do it by return very precise
every time synchronization ok so so
that's raising implementation is
actually we implemented on Sora ok so so
he's pretty fancy system ah sorry not
here spend a little time on that so what
we did is actually we can share as a
Salem can share the video phone a result
too much both physically okay so have
they might go physically share the same
video from there ok the idea is that
actually we can do a claim map this DM a
buffer to different physical layer
buffer so actually the physical year
have this physical since the face of an
appt ok- physically return later the app
this app basically how was a virtual I
dispatcher it's this is written map to
it real I flapper okay but the sender
buffy is different okay if you because
it you cannot have a little might go
fight transmitted at cebit are at the
same time but it can't receive at the
same back there the transfer paper going
to pass to a demon here we should do the
mixing okay the job transmission and I
transmitting they only differ in the
fracas e I can just do the mix now we
schedule they receive and this
transmitted signal you man
and send out this mixed make the data
out so is this way where we enable
multiple physically to share the scene
I've hardware so these are quite a few
experience our applications while
application is that we can easily
support a wide space on networking based
on any existing fine negate with a lead
mg which has a ship that reshaped their
their width of the channel ways to
accommodate a different bandwidth
specification of TV channel so you as
these or six members in China it was
aight knackers ok you think up or
instead it and it can support contiguous
or non-con inspection bounty and this
now same way we actually can enable in
this video / transition and set another
slide is that the same video front-end
can be shared by multiple page then so
here we implemented several zigbee
applications each working on different
spectrum and can we see nigga p siglos
from a different channel some mechanism
okay so now i go over top of you the
evaluation on with what we're thinking
about say holidays single link or the
performance of the shipping how is
working on the DSA environment what is
computation requirement to get a receipt
with this receive of regions ah so
single link so actually we have within
this experiments basically we change the
bandwidth in structure the descender
change the bandwidth so side of um tiny
man first then go to can and go to i
don't know what's this forget so go to
can could we go seven something hoi for
cats though go do something lower and a
good and fine okay maybe 20
an aide and find something on this mat
now you say that actually you can adapt
read well with different multivision
great a ger even be you can just adapt
to the pan with you do not change the
physical if you just change the
operation that's a spectrum
routinization you and they say the
experiments on what we do is that
accurately Harley's transmission okay
they're better now wait decouple that
into two parts okay and leaving a whole
hippie thing okay so nothing this is a
long contiguous there to Lunken been
very enlarged at this clip on winchester
20 and 40 seconds which has increased
the band is this whole by five megahertz
now we say that so the stupid almost
keep consistence they have a slight
difference of leadership that but who is
each other keep countess so it's exactly
when it because of you do not lose any
bandwidth just an advocate a different
band so this is just a simple setup of a
dsl at work so the idea is like we have
a a 230 OMG here to transmit now giving
the transmission we have a zigbee
kicking it's a 20 seconds then it's a 40
seconds a 11 be a quickie then as some
fun time that you don't be justly so
let's say this point say zigbee just
going to end to the transmission and we
add okay the more bandwidth we didn't be
okay so consider this is all designed by
I mean instructive i/o controller so it
doesn't put have particular meaning here
might say I took control of just want to
do this okay then we the department is I
with how well can exactly executive
these bandwidth allocation okay so this
is a result which has applause the
throughput
who can get from ing here I mean be and
zigbee okay and I found that actually
they could be just a cat there pan and
continual have a constant disrepute and
N and Y 11g is not connect a funny is
that it's going to because we code the
20 members their lands it could be
kicking it just to avoid that but you
still use in knife 20 minutes so the
stupid doesn't change until this point
they take 11 be seen so it's occupy hot
of the pan ways there is a job to a half
of the rig okay and now it's continually
job at this point because the controller
it is fine to educate the mobile into
the 11 p and you don't be each other
keep on sees you do not this they do not
have any transmission is not there to
get hot and it can increase that
according to this language education so
it's all basically it's just a cat kept
on what the instruction that the
controller at occasions so one
particular is seeing some belong to
examine is that on because we do a lot
of PFP and say it's a low early so the
way on consider how much precision we
need to handle okay you saw because it's
basically teach the samples we need to
process so we try to say and for example
one particular scene with do it ASAP
they say is either p and how how many
point we need to support okay and the
ways are different inter command which
because what you want to do the integral
processing into gravity is that will
flow geography to increase the protein
speed this is a arrow ok income of TV
and a fundraiser in general actually the
arrow is pretty no but that later with
more base and the precision is very can
be improved a lot so we can cure that
always apathy and the shifting or this
signal processing probably just lead 32
of eight processing internal processing
to do all these transmissions so it's
not really a big deal if you consider
implement that in hardware so you see
integral is on SL YouTube page so pretty
much we can implement as well as smaller
in hard way okay so I just to conclude
that so we propose that this special
virtualized alia as a general way to
support spectrum programming for dynamic
spectrum network so it's provider a very
simple abstract to the fiscal year so
now in figure they do not need to
consider about the to the real education
the complex education of the video on
add a real band but the Islamic consider
but it's working on the virtual spectrum
nowadays continuously with the certain
bandwidth okay and this this ship it's
shipping is happening dynamically so you
can react very fast to the new
allocation and controlled by okay
kanchana and this also provides another
way interaction at the label rid of a
foundation this is a previously not
possible now with this mayor actually we
can do the video with graduation that
the enable might go physically to share
the seam video phone yet so nesa is prom
is implicit in a in either we can design
a wide bands video device and now you
can support multiple multiple physically
simultaneously it's naturally when we
have these two way video capability on
this valve and video that means you
virtually have different I you can
almost have it all of this fiscal year
Oh video happens
a single video from that ok so i think
i'm just a stop here it's just a summary
my lecture on talking about a lot of a
memo i think it as a very promising area
waka and also the spectrum which are
here nine different questions for each
then we have the band fixed or we have
an identification number like even like
in in cellular we really have banned
banned identification and even in dot11
we have two point four by five and now
if you choose and use a different
frequency yeah how does a new user like
now I am I starting in wireless client
how will it know that the AP is going to
send into this are yeah yeah made of
electrical happen how do we intimate i'm
going to use a different frequency band
yeah so i think the question is how we
can pick hard we have a different very
diverse band allocation how i can pick
up I think that's a yeah let's say is a
good question and I didn't talking touch
that in the talk I think in general i
think is kind of like how we allocate
this resource right so I mean and we
kind of have a different the criteria
and algorithm on that I think that size
it's a lot of research on going on this
but the point here is that probably we
need some controller in the land work
that make the decision for you okay
meaning particularly in why space we
have the concept known for their
database let's mark the usage so you can
using its database as a continuous or
you can register is usage and ask for
your chest I have I want to do some
networking start it just give me the
crackin structure saying that's it apart
instead then party that you have the
band but you're the band is shared by a
different reading right now this
probably much handled by Matt protocol
okay you have a good Matt put Bobo and
add
aankhon so I take an essay different
could be a different solutions different
situation yeah on one day we had one
keynote lecture by cosa chincoteague it
was about self interment interference
cancellation yeah where the receiver
like transmission and reception can be
done simultaneously what is that impact
on the DSA my PSA all has always been
designed by planning that yeah yeah yeah
just say you don't mention that if they
have they said two full duplex video
capability we can really in label this
video patronization so in actually in
label might go physical a year goes
through this over tonight in a year then
you share the same why abandon video
then they say so when see I I think you
have this way to transmit and receive
instead simultaneous a definite benefit
the portico tira ok so make you have a
better protocol design because not of it
stings eating dynamic inspection panel
access network is hallway make agreement
on which portion of the steps shown we
use right from sender receiver if we had
the a lot of complexity it's coming from
so the if I have the footage that we'd
already there I think that makes this
kind of protocol design much much easier
I I think that's him 111 possible impact
I think there are lots of different it's
an open research area I think at this
point i mean the lots of ways you can do
for example when he was mentioning
zigbee and why 11g and 11 they all work
together you could imagine that you are
transmitting and receiving at the same
time so on 11g you are receiving on 11
you're yeah that's not possible
full-duplex for example so any more
questions I had I had a question I so
let's say you you are operating on alone
G and you you have a 20 megahertz man
that that you think you're using yeah
and physically you're sending on five
yes right now they're only two ways of
doing that either you skip a bunch of
subcarriers but you make the subcarriers
rule in their ad by dilating time yeah
so I'm guessing you're dilating time
yeah now when you dial eight time
everything increases for example the
preamble leg I becomes four times yeah
now all these slots Wi-Fi slots yeah are
designed such that for example then the
nine microseconds is designed such there
right so you see the problem right yeah
how do you deal with I said I think they
are soaked here just like talking about
how you vote on the physically but they
consider of other magnets you actually
lead overly kind of which are nice and
sink a particular parameters to button
eyes is actually the thought so how you
treated a sampling time on so currently
depends on the implementation not if you
McAleer just a ghazal time from the
physical year then it's not a problem
because because the way you do they were
shipping it actually clock your physical
here and the Z the mac liam is Sinkin
are so I need do tamil to eating knock
up one solid in samples ok now you
recall the sample time so it's Duke host
the same career here the whole system
the seemeth treats here 9 100 samples
you kick right but to e we annotate I me
in fact they may they say this time a
stretch or compress but they doesn't
matter it for this yeah so where I was
going to was you also need to send out
the clock signal all the way to the
upper layers so you can call other you
can create different dilutions of the
clock yeah for every single I say it's
only propagated to the maknae not
yeah I guess but i'm not sure what will
happen in the face yeah maybe maybe for
the ttp maybe oh yeah sure neither team
they are clogged so you do not want a
tamil the tcp packet pretty mentally yes
sure any more questions yeah one of the
issue will be from the RF front-end
section because suppose I am receiving
eight not to 11g and there is a zigbee
is also going on but I by bands are non
contiguous i want to receive the whole
band but then the RF front-end design
will become really tough how are you
going to handle that give me i found out
what because you you have a wide dynamic
range to capture oh yeah oh yeah yeah
yeah yeah that's a that's all the way
very good question oh good good yeah um
yeah I think it's basically require high
dynamic it so this is that the question
is not so because you are have a
wideband video ok then you will need to
capture the different wall is sick loss
these signals may have very large
difference in the transmitter circuit
signals then yeah the video definitely
data could rent to capture so I need to
have substantive beat being the ADC so
do not miss they the other part are they
say they say no energy siglos which way
I did I think that there's all yeah so
the video design one way says basically
which other puter they could high
sensitivity videos and that's a problem
possibilities that we can apply to some
pewter back but if I know something I
basically I don't care I just can feel
that I'm like a programming good bad but
I don't know there's still very
difficult but that's all Oh mr. to bring
out there in general I'm in general why
ban dynamic special and it has its
challenges on the video design yeah but
they sell hard I mostly for my punto you
I rely on this hardcore about you guys
can't be videoed if I'm going through
that I think in your implementation you
had 20 megahertz I all we have for him
at 40 mega yes yeah it's a good question
because this LNA adjustment all the
sounds of things limited bits in the ADC
that are not I dia they are there then
on a part of you and I cannot give the
lane linebacker is that do I need a
piece of research it and get a few
peoples are looking all that I know a
few actually I collaborate a few norco
University in China they doin a ton of
the video stuff any more questions this
I ok so then every picture so actually
what I did is I visit my kind of mine my
style is nicer I've little guy is a
place I just go to the beam you need a
search and as such faith place and I
found the first picture that i think is
related in play so i got perfect here I
don't know where this yeah this is
content but you can go on Freddie yeah I
are there so I i I'm I'm trying to ask
you follow this picture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
