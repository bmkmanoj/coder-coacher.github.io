talk to you here Sheriff home thoughts
on how the world of online fashion has
evolved in the last four years or so i
co-founded a website called what book am
I was I I am one of three co-founders
and I'm the one who had absolutely no
prior knowledge of fashion or the
fashion world and as many intricacies so
this is what it looks like essentially
is a user-generated streetstyle
community where our users post
photographs of what they are wearing and
they then tag the items and brands that
are featured in their book it's similar
to sites or look like a similar to sites
like Reddit and hacker news where social
voting is what determines the front page
and you vote for a look that you find
particularly inspiring by clicking the
hype one so community hype not only is
sort of a currency by which the user is
kave each other karma and build and help
build each other's reputations but it's
also how the front page is community
curated but anyway I'm not here to talk
about look what too much but building
look butch has given me as you know a
very you know naive person was the
fashion it's give me a good like vantage
point from which to observe
okay so things are really simple when we
watch society because for me fashion
content online boiled down to top down
versus bottom-up and top-down content
and you have a usual suspects fashion
magazines you have their online
counterparts lifestyle com go so have
you no other host of other ones and you
know they all have their their soul
differences but generally what I saw you
know as a pattern was that they were all
about trends they're all about some
reason what celebrities are wearing
they're all about what you have to have
this season how you should wear things
beauty tips that you should follow to a
beautiful and there's just this
underlying you know this is what you
should consume this is what you know you
need to buy so swear it feels very
commercial and with bottom of fashioning
this is what really fascinated me
because even though super interested in
fashion I'll really interested in ways
that people were consuming things online
and you know the forum is kind of like
the quintessential web one point oh like
you know the first way that people
started to come together in groups and
talk to each other about interest in
other common interests and every single
fashion forum that I researched the
fashion spot happening to the biggest
one they all had a threat called what
are you wearing today and it was a
radiated to wait wait so every single
fashion form whether it was like an a
vintage forum or like a premium japanese
denim form like they all have we were
threats you know and so this was the
type of content
we wanted to focus on and streamline and
take quote and then you have this guy
named to support the sartorialist a case
about shooting you know made a new
living going around New York City taking
pictures of really cool people which in
really stylish actually got a book to
you about I was really I got a more of a
kick out of this other guy named mark on
from LA who went to parties he call
himself a clover snake and he went to
you bunch of mr. parties basically just
took pictures people getting drunk
wasted and it was really wrong with a
guy she gave people a new kind of
content to consume and and then you have
the rock and then you know back in two
thousand eight you really starts to the
rise of these really big fashion
bloggers susie bubble from the iron
kingdoms one biggest you know she has
great personal style she did this one
cost for she kind of did like seven days
of rainbow style where she dresses
monochromatic you know very very
creative talent but she also it wasn't
just personal style shoe she was also
very much caught up with fashion fashion
shows and latest trends and you know she
so she had post where she might comment
on the fact that at london fashion week
she saw like four girls wearing the same
red ribbon on her hair and she might you
know sheshe postulate that maybe this is
because of the lead character in gossip
grill and then she would go on and talk
about her own obsession with joining her
hair and you know she shows some of the
things that she made herself and she
then comment that you know she was more
inspired by natasha khan from bat for
lashes and Rambo and she know she's
going for a more you know she's not
really going for that neat girly
aesthetic so i mean bottom old-fashioned
was all about inspirations all about
creativity it's all about how you remix
different clothing pieces from different
sources and and come up with your own
original voice and social it's a
community you get instantaneous feedback
and
it it for me the underlying messages
that fashions are and when we built look
we wanted to focus on this we didn't
want to go to look like what we're calm
or go fug yourself calm you know we
wanted it to just be really minimal a
blank slate where the user generated
content really defined the culture and
you know the presentation of the
community so now you know fast forward
four years the fashion world luvs
bloggers you no longer is like I've been
hailed as the next big thing and there's
there's some really incredible success
stories that took place between then and
now fashion blogger is gracing the front
row of fashion shows Milan and Paris in
New York bryanboy prolific blogger from
the Philippines Kim friends with
designer Marc Jacobs who actually
created this bag and named it after
Brian boys so the bag is actually called
ostrich BD back and you know so his rise
to fame eventually you got signed by the
creative artists agency which also reps
likes with LeBron James and George
Clooney so bloggers are you know some
bloggers at least are now you know
top-tier it with celebrities fashion
toast rumi neely AKA fashion toast is
also another example signed by next
models and then you have tavi Gevinson
started blogging choose 11 join lookbook
and choose like 12 and it was like we
did know what to do because uh yeah we
didn't begin have a policy in place or
what we didn't have a protocol in place
for you know child with the COPE of the
Coppa compliance act child online
privacy protection so we need know what
to do but you know if we should like Dan
her like try to get like parental
consent but you know anyway like you
know once what's this caught on brands
all the sudden
wanted to work with lawyers every every
brand small small to big you know
upstart designers and big retailers they
all want to tap into this this side is
you know this wave of influence that
bloggers had so they started advertising
on blogs they started doing sponsored
posts but really what you saw was yeah
okay really what we saw was tons of
freebies getting same so all of a sudden
this blog that you read for their unique
authentic voice is you know they start
posting look square you know they're
getting sent free stuff and you know it
kind of dilutes kind of I lose the
integrity I guess and you know very
unbiased articles in fashionista.com you
know one of those top-down editorial
safe they start questioning the
editorial integrity of blogs and that's
actually the uh you know this is an
actual horrified blog year they use this
in the article so so you know some of
the comments from the article said you
know the bribery is become so obvious it
really lets you to charm I think that
the days of pureness of blogs is gone
you know it's very tragic stuff so you
know it is kind of so we're kind of like
at this place where it's like is fashion
art or Connors but you know to be honest
it's fashion has always been our and
commerce you know it's always been
something that is material and something
that is driven by consumption but it's
also something that's that's very
artistic and you know the old media kind
of used to just dictate the trends and
that was it but now it's like that's
just a starting point it's almost like
it's almost like
like though the judges give you the
ingredient but it's all about like what
kind of amazing creations they create
you know how they make that those things
their own so basically sponsored content
here today and you know I like seeing
like good examples and bad examples of
how brands and bloggers or content
producers have work together I think
there's a couple of ways that you know
the tubes and coaxes a top down and
bottom down coexist that Brenda bloggers
can't work together and preserve both
you know purity and an artistic
creativity but also be effective from
marketing standpoint small so the first
thing that is very important is that you
have to disclose and you have to you up
you have to you have to tell your
readers like what what products you're
getting for free or whether or not
you're going to pay the other thing is
that you know bloggers need to be
discerning about who they were you know
you should I don't think that the
bloggers should you know compromise
their voice by just working on anyone
that will probably be product or your
money so this is a this is one of our
users from Ireland very popular user she
actually wrote a blog post that was
called ode to my doc martens and she
wrote about how she had the same pair of
doc martens since she was 15 years old
and you know she said they are my dr
martens they're in my history when
comfort they have my love this is not a
sponsored post you know this is this is
genuine loyalty to brand and so you know
it's deadly dr. martens actually took
their first foray into online marking
his past fall 2011 and they worked with
us to promote their first in forever
campaign which was talking about like I
mean the tag ID was everybody remembers
their first paragon points but it's
really more about first personal
experiences that define your life on
your first heartbreak to your first love
and so they asked us to
to you know get our community involved
and so she was obviously one of the
first people that we reached out to you
and we reached out to a lot of a lot of
people and they created amazing content
you know and they are there this one's
really good like he's talking about his
first fight I got into some stupid
argument next thing I know we're 20
punches at each other and help our
feelings that we end up getting ice
cream afterwards it's just like it's
very uh you know it's UTC you can't make
this stuff up and and you can see the
all these looks got really good
reception a lot of interaction they're
talking about their first love or first
fashion show he ended up like spreading
these lows on our social media channels
and you know all the looks kind of have
a very distinct flavor I guess you know
a lot of different different styles and
then they ended up posting it posting
these looks on their got on the
documents Facebook page as well so it
kind of gave love to the users and you
know people really liked it so I just
showed you guys looks they're actually
more but these night Lopes got something
like 13,000 hype 800 Kanye's 136,000
views and that's not including use like
on our homepage just a little national
day they organically rise up on our
homepage people that actually clicked in
and do this side so because 150,000
interactions for nine books which you
know i think is a pretty successful
campaign and so i think the way the way
that you know we moved forward is that
bloggers have to be discerning they have
to be transparent and they have people
you have to you know you have to
continue to experiment continue to
develop your you know what makes what
makes you stand apart make sure
brands need to have a genuine message
you know not it's not just like it's not
just buy my stuff yeah and they need to
clean you actually be willing to like
the whole message because it's no longer
about like what they want it's just so
they look like little message and if you
want to share this fall so Indies using
that look book allows for new aesthetic
forms the otherwise wouldn't be publicly
visible or does it reinforce existing as
it's a cop-out answer but you know I
think it's both okay I mean obviously I
think that look book allows for styles
that you are going to see and magazines
you know it obviously allows for more
diverse in Alaska our user base is only
twenty five percent us and the rest of
it is like all over the world and we
have a really big vlogging English
speaking Asian countries like Indonesia
Oh beans and you know you definitely see
differences between you know polish
popular users Scandinavian popular users
and users who are from Brazil South
America but but you know they're
definitely like when you build a site
like maybe wine to sort of accommodate
all different styles but eventually a
culture emergence eventually the
community sort of embraces this is that
I can you know you can you can gloss
over and you can just dismiss and say
like all these looks of the same but I
don't know I think that's really sincere
yeah I love it where you thought or
where you think designers and all of it
but I think Marc Jacobs yeah it's it's
hard 7 in the beginning when we first
launched society actually allow
designers most books thought of
themselves but of people wearing their
creations we actually sort of
backtracked on that because we wanted to
sort of take a narrower we wanted to
just really focus on what you know
regular users you style but the you know
the long-term vision of the site is to
figure out a way to bring brands and
bring designers bring stores into the
fold of the community in a way that's
still you know respects what the
community is about but it's also
affected or you know designers so I
don't really know it's
reach out me too
we started out fashion bloggers and
those users that were posting in wayward
communities like that's obviously we'll
be throwing it first and then we
branched out to people on myspace who
are friends with Lo and then but but
there's definitely there's definitely a
good amount of users that are not
touching long as well but there's a lot
of times we start on this night and
start getting big on the site then we
decide to launch a blog where they can
put different types of clients and
they'd acquit not just pictures of
living rank also patience fire but we
don't do we actually don't do any more
thing ourselves it's completely bored
enough all right I'll tell me other
questions right now Greg's want to thank
any for a great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
