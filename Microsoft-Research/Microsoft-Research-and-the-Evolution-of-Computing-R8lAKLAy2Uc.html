let me show you a see if we've got this
there we go so
as han was just saying you know I i came
to Microsoft 21 years ago to start
microsoft research now the environment
that I came out of was a university
environment just like the environment
that you have you know I came from
Carnegie Mellon University and and
really that was where I learned to do
basic research that was the environment
in which I I built my career and so when
I came to Microsoft 21 years ago I came
with the mission of really creating a
basic basic research organization that
was like the environment that I had at
Carnegie Mellon I really wanted to
create the equivalent of a Carnegie
Mellon computer science department but
in the context of a software company in
the context of company like Microsoft
now in those days 21 years ago Microsoft
was a very small company I know for many
of you that may be hard to believe we
had just a few products we had a few
thousand employees and really it wasn't
the kind of company that you would
necessarily think would want to invest
in long term basic research but the
board of directors made an important
decision they decided that it was
important to invest in the future and
invest in the long term and that's when
they came to me and that's when I came
to Microsoft now as I said you might
goal was to create the kind of
environment that you have any university
but do it in the context of a company
and in the course of doing that very
early really the beginning of Microsoft
Research I adopted a mission statement
that I thought would lead the
organization you know through its
history to do just out so first and
foremost you see the first left hand
side of their of that slide that's the
first part of the mission statement in
the first part of Microsoft researches
mission statement is to expand the state
of the art in the areas that we're doing
research
and that's really not that different
than what you would be doing if you were
doing research in a university notice
there's nothing about that statement
that says anything about Microsoft what
that's really saying is that if we're
going to do basic research in an area we
want to make sure that we're pushing the
state of the art that we're advancing
the knowledge of mankind in that
particular field or that particular area
because if we're not able to do that
then ultimately I believe that we were
not going to be very valuable to
Microsoft we have to be at the cutting
edge now the second part of the mission
statement you see in the middle there
does relate to Microsoft it says that
when we have good ideas when we have
solutions to problems when we have new
technologies we work really hard to get
those into practice and to get those
into use and of course the best way for
us to do that is to work through our
product groups and to get those ideas
and technologies into Microsoft products
because those products go out to over a
billion people around the world now
ultimately the goal is really that last
one and that's to ensure that Microsoft
has a future so why would a company like
Microsoft invest in basic research when
it was very small it's because it
believed it was going to have a future
and it believed that that investment
would help it realize that future now
we've grown from basically just me you
know 20 21 years ago to now having
research labs all around the world in
fact more people work for Microsoft
Research outside the United States then
inside the United States if you look at
that map you see our research labs in
redmond washington Mountain View
California New England New York
cambridge england bangalore india
beijing china and you also see a number
of our advanced technology labs in egypt
in Israel Germany
so really we've grown and we've expanded
over the years and we've just continued
to to move forward as an organization
now I said earlier that microsoft made a
decision very early in its life to
invest in long-term basic research a lot
of people when they think about basic
research whether in the university or in
a company they look at it and they say
well why do you invest in it it costs a
lot of money it doesn't necessarily
produce immediate results you know if
you're doing research in a university
you're not necessarily producing
products you're not necessarily
producing immediate financial benefit
for anyone so why make those investments
the same thing is true for for a company
like Microsoft there are three answers
that I think people most often give and
while they're true in a way they're not
necessarily the whole truth some people
will say well I know why you invest in
basic research you're doing it because
you want to create intellectual property
you want to create technologies that are
going to go into your into your products
and that's certainly true I mean
Microsoft Research we create more
patents for Microsoft in any other part
of the company our patents are arguably
of more scientific value in fact the I
Triple E has rated Microsoft's patent
portfolios having the highest scientific
value in the field and the technologies
we create have a huge impact on our
project on our products so that's great
but I would argue that's not the main
reason you invest in basic research but
it's certainly a great benefit another
idea another thing that people suggest
is a reason for investing in basic
research is the second point which is
problem solving we have great people we
have really smart people just as you and
the university have great people it's
very smart people we really are good at
solving problems in fact i just love
solving problems you come with to me
with a problem you know i love just
figuring out what the
shoes are trying to find a solution
that's a lot of fun I've been trained to
do it I'm pretty good at it and the
people that we hire very good at it so
certainly that's a benefit to a company
like Microsoft and in university
environment you could say it's a benefit
to the to the society that you're able
to solve problems but again it's not the
the main reason I think that we do the
investment sometimes people say well
okay I know why you have an investment
in basic research you're a you know
you're you're a early warning system
right you you can see the future because
you see what's in the research labs and
so you can tell the company when there's
a new technology or something coming on
the horizon and we do that but none of
those things I think are really the
fundamental reason why you invest in
basic research they're all incredible
benefits but they're not the fundamental
reason the fundamental reason you invest
in basic research is really for survival
you know if you're a country or a
society you invest in basic research
because you believe it's going to be
important when there's going to be a
problem in the future to have the smart
people and the ideas and the
technologies that allows your society to
survive then if your Bush who helped to
create the National Science Foundation
in the United States he wrote a paper on
this subject people that really argued
that the United States should invest in
fundamental basic research this was
right after World War Two that we should
invest in basic research because if
there's a new war or a famine or a
disease then the country would have the
intellectual resources to survive that
well I think for a company like
Microsoft it's really the same thing you
know if there's a new competitor if
there's a new technology if there's a
change in the business climate then you
really want to have the people and the
technology and the ideas that will let
you change rapidly when change is
necessary that will let you adapt
to a new world when you have to adapt
quickly and I think it's a statement
about the the value that microsoft
research has brought to Microsoft that
Microsoft still exists today because the
Frank reality is that almost none of the
companies that were Microsoft Spears 21
years ago still exist they're almost all
gone and even the few that may still be
around don't do the same things anymore
they're not relevant so really it's
about survival and investments in basic
research are about survival whether
that's survival for a society or whether
it's survival for a company now
Microsoft Research in its 21 years has
had a tremendous impact on the company
many of the pieces of Microsoft that you
think of today originally came out of
microsoft research so what became the
digital media division of the company
and now is a important part of our
entertainment &amp;amp; devices business the
xbox and things of that sort our music
business that was something that was
created by me in Microsoft Research we
turned it into a product group and we
spun it out to our product organizations
in 1996 I started the first e-commerce
group in the company all the natural
language and speech technologies in
Windows and Office came out of microsoft
research so we have consistently created
the technologies that have helped to
drive the company forward and create
actually large parts of the company that
you see today you see on the screen just
a few of the products that we've had an
impact on really every product that you
get from Microsoft has had some
influence for microsoft research whether
that's in the technologies that that are
underlie the product whether it's in
some cases the product itself or whether
it's the technologies that are used to
create the product
now I'm going to show you a short video
to show off a very particular technology
that has come out of Microsoft Research
really come out of fundamental basic
research in program analysis and program
generation and that is now having a huge
impact in the most recent version of
microsoft office that's just now being
released so the technology is called
flash fill and I'll let the video speak
for itself I'm cement Galvani from
Microsoft Research Redmond I'm going to
tell you about a new feature in Excel
2013 called flash fill which had its
origins in Microsoft Research suppose
you have a collection of Social Security
numbers that you see in the first column
and you want to format them by inserting
hyphens as you see in the second column
if you have hundreds and thousands of
these rolls then doing it manually would
do very cumbersome a more principled way
to do this would be to write an excel
macro but if you are a non programmer
like most Excel users then you would be
stuck but now you can use the flash fill
feature to automate this task by just
the press of control e which is a
shortcut for flash fill the flash will
feature builds over our program
synthesis technology that can generalize
examples into programs so this is the
opposite of program verification
methodology that is used to generate
test cases from programs to expose bugs
in those programs and this has seen
decades of research but now program
synthesis does the rivers it takes test
cases or examples and generates programs
that are consistent with those examples
in fact we generate a huge number of
such programs but we have efficient data
structures and algorithms to compute and
represent such programs then we use the
machine learning technology to rank
these programs we take the highest
ranked program and run it on all the
rows in the spreadsheet to give the user
the output that they desire now in
general it might not be possible to
learn the users intent from just one
example as would be shown by the second
scenario where I have a bunch of medical
billing codes some of which are missing
a right bracket at the end by some of
which have a right bracket suppose my
goal is to clean this data by adding a
right bracket wherever it is missing
so if I give one example then flash will
generalizes it into a simplest program
which is to add a right bracket
everywhere maybe this is what the user
wanted but otherwise the user would
observe that row 62 row 10 are all
incorrect and the user can fix any one
of these flows so the moment I fix row
six then flash rule is able to fix other
similar roles accordingly flash will can
also be used to perform complicated
extraction tasks so consider this
worksheet that is lot of customer data
in the first column so suppose my goal
is to extract the constituent elements
all that I have to do is to give an
example in each column and hit control e
flash will can also synthesized programs
that have limited form of conditionals
and loops as is illustrated by this
scenario where I want to generate an
abbreviation if you want to learn more
about this technology then you can look
at our CSM research highlights paper you
can also use this feature yourself in
excel 2013 so what I find really
exciting about flash fill is that this
is really the first time that automatic
program synthesis is being distributed
out in a mass-market product we're
suddenly giving ordinary people the
ability to automatically create
effectively new programs that transform
their data simply by giving a few
examples this is fundamental basic
research being applied in a very simple
and easy-to-use way that anybody can
take advantage of and the consumer
preview of office 2013 is freely
available for download so I suggest if
you're interested in seeing how this
works download it it's just purely magic
to play with it now one of the the big
changes that's been going on in the
field of computer science in the last
few years comes from the fact that we
have built the world's largest database
systems huge data centers we're
collecting enormous amounts of
information and we're providing an
environment and where where processors
can access that
so this this new world is sometimes
referred to as the world of big data
where suddenly you have not just
terabytes of information available but
many many petabytes of information and
it's letting us think about new ways in
which we can solve the world's problems
for example you may want to collect all
the information from all the hospitals
and all the doctors to try to come up
with new understandings of the way in
which the you can provide a solution for
different diseases people are looking at
genetics and they're saying if we could
just collect all the genetic information
from a large population suddenly we can
tackle diseases like aids or hepatitis C
or malaria that we never had an ability
to do before or suddenly we can attack
the problem of personalized medicine we
can design medicines that work for
specific individuals and know that
they're going to be deadly for other
individuals now one of the projects we
have going on in Microsoft Research in
Cambridge is looking at the problem of
of the world's climate and the world's
ecology and we're using the notion of
big data to tackle that problem we're
collecting information that comes from
many different sources about the world's
climate and making it available for
scientists and researchers around the
world so I'm going to run a short video
to show you that the the name of the
system is called fetch climate I'm a
researcher up Microsoft Research
Cambridge I'm in the computational
ecology and environmental science group
the mission of that group is to carry
out computational science that should
let humanity manage natural resources
better as part of that research mission
we develop new software tools predictive
models in geographical information
services that should allow people to
carry out that kind of cutting-edge
research more widely today I'd like to
show you fetch climate which is an easy
a fast way for anyone to extract complex
information about the climate either
just with a few lines of code in a
program or even just through a browser
so here's our browser running fetch
climate i'm in redmond it microsoft
headquarters so i'm going to zoom in on
the area around redmond and i can just
really easily draw a square here to
populate a grid and hit fetch what's
happening is this is a silverlight
application which is communicating with
an agile service that service is looking
over a large number of large data sets
and it's choosing the best date of to
answer the query is then doing a whole
bunch of complex mathematical
calculations and sending the result back
to our application running in the
browser the answer of that query is now
being visualized on top of being Maps
via dynamic data display which is
another prototype tool that comes from
our group can see that interactivity we
hover the mouse over here we can see for
instance that the average temperature in
this place is about 2.8 degrees we can
download data so we just hit download we
get a choice of formats and we can see
all the information that we would need
from that query it's got different times
as well so we can do a query for a
fraction of the year or even a fraction
of the day and then we have the air
temperature data itself we have the
provenance so the data source that was
used to supply this information and we
even have an estimate of uncertainty
that uncertainty is something that the
experts find really hard to assign to
data that was a research project in its
own right and yet that's always supplied
every time with a fetch climate query
now we can pull the browser version we
can run multiple copies of fetch climate
at once and so I'm going to show you a
couple of examples of fetches that I did
earlier so here's one of wind speed over
the eastern US that's the kind of thing
that you might want to look at if you're
a energy company or the government
planning wind farms and in this fetch I
put a string of locations across Africa
and each of those locations I've
extracted 60 years worth of rainfall
data and we can just hover over one of
those points and see what's happening to
rainfall and unfortunately this looks
pretty worrying because it looks like
there's been a steady decline in
rainfall over the past 60 years the kind
of thing we probably all seen in the
headlines recently African droughts and
so on so thanks to fetch climate anyone
can get that kind of information really
easily it's live it's ready go and find
it
go and please tell us what you think so
again that I think the key point here is
that you know we are now able to provide
that kind of service to anyone to
individuals that want to learn about the
world the earth climate and the areas in
which they live and how the climate has
changed over the last few years over the
last 60 years of the last hundred years
but more importantly to scientists
because this kind of data is actually
very difficult for scientists to
accumulate themselves but we're able to
do that put the information in windows
azure and provide a simple interface for
people to be able to examine and look
out so that's a great application of big
data really helping to solve a problem
that really helps the world now the
theme of this conference is is this
notion of being able to compute
naturally and I know a number of you
have probably seen Xbox Kinect and
really Xbox the Kinect part of xbox was
really the first time that real-time 3d
computer vision was made available to
ordinary people in their homes and it
really transformed the way people
thought about the way they interacted
with computers now me and my family were
probably not surprisingly on the beta
for Kinect before it came out publicly
and I remember my two boys at the time
my young boys the time they were like
nine and ten I think and I remember the
first time they played with Kinect and
what was interesting to me and what got
me very excited about the product was
the fact that not only did they enjoy
playing the game using their whole body
to control the game but they actually
had more fun celebrating after they won
the game because when they jumped up and
down their character on the screen jump
dump it down and you could see that they
in their minds had made a connection
between themselves and their own
and the character on the screen and the
virtual body of that character and that
was very very powerful I knew at that
moment that we were going to have a
tremendous hit now what makes connect
work is really a lot of very exciting
new research in machine learning and
computer vision and that's a connect was
really a great example of Microsoft
researchers working extremely closely
with some of the tremendous people we
have on our product organization to
build a new kind of experience that
really change people's perceptions of
the relationship between a computer and
a human being the fact that the computer
now had senses like we did it could see
and could interact with us in kind of a
physical way that was new that changed
the way people thought and not just the
way people thought in the consumer
marketplace it changed the way research
is done researchers around the world
have adopted connect as a technology
that they can use to tackle new kinds of
user interface problems now conectas is
one kind of solution to the problem of
how do I interact with the computer
system in that case there's a remote
camera and there's you standing in front
of it and you're gesturing but what if
somehow the camera was part of you or it
was it was on your person and the system
was able to detect simpler personal
actions that you might take well some of
our researchers have been looking into
that problem and created a system called
digits and i'm going to show you that
video digits is a wrist-worn 3d hand
tracker for gestural interactions on the
move now I've mentioned before that you
know microsoft research has had has
grown to be a pretty large organization
we now have over 850 khd researchers
around the world and we are the number
one publisher of basic research in the
field of computer science but however
big we might be
we're still a tiny fraction of the
larger scientific and research community
and one of the things that has always
been part of our mission and something
that I instituted as part of Microsoft
Research in the very earliest days our
efforts to really reach out and work
with the broader academic community and
to support the create</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
