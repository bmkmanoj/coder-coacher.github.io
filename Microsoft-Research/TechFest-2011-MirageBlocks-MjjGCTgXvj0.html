researcher here at microsoft research
today i'll show you my newest demo
called mirage blocks mirage box is
really result of our research in spatial
augmented reality and we were
investigating in the way that you would
interact with free hand gestures in
space so this this particular demo
showcases how you can instantaneously
digitize or virtualize any physical
objects and then interact with it right
on your tabletop it's a single user demo
that means that you actually have to use
these 3d glasses that are just shutter
glasses the the main idea here is that
anything that you bring to the table is
instantaneously digitized in other words
you any physical object that you bring
up becomes virtually reflected on the
table so how does this look well if you
put your hands right in front you
actually see the reflection of the hands
right there you're seeing double images
but I'm seeing just a single
stereoscopic image in my eyes this
actually means when you when you put an
object down such as Ernie here Ernie is
a good friend of mine we can isn't
aeneus Lee capture it and how do we
capture well there's a little button
here on the side if you press that Ernie
becomes virtual so the physical
representation of Ernie we can move away
now the virtual representation behaves
just like any other virtual object would
so you can do all the things that you're
used to in CAD software like rotation
and movement you can also do things that
you cannot due to physical objects like
make the Ernie a lot bigger or you can
make the earning a lot smaller so you
can have a very little Ernie on the side
let me show you how you can use this to
actually build up virtual castle just
out of couple physical blocks so the
grid just shows you the ground plane and
this is a mirroring line so anything
over here is going to be mirrored on the
other side what this gives us is
opportunity to actually build up a
little castle couple blocks here and
let's start with this base and let's
capture them those are virtual
representation there now we can move
things down into the table things that
you actually cannot do with physical
objects but but virtually it's totally
fine and Braille the next level and what
if we move it down just a little bit
more maybe we can now build something
that
is not necessarily possible in real
world which is do things that gravity
would defeat but in here they work just
fine something like this and here you
have it you have a little castle object
that is just build up directly out of
physical box well this was Mirage blocks
demo and I hope you're starting to see
how we are researching this ways to
bring the physical and digital virtual
worlds together in a seamless manner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
