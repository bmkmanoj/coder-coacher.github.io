I am Michael Magali and I'm very happy
to to have the opportunity to introduce
Andrew yang today Andrew and I met a few
weeks ago or a month and a half ago down
in New Orleans where we were both at New
Orleans Entrepreneurship Week and Andrew
is the the CEO and founder of venture
for America as you know previously he
was the CEO of Manhattan gym at the the
GMAT prep course that he then sold to to
Kaplan
and had kind of a realization that what
he really wanted to do was to enable
entrepreneurship and to in order to do
that he began venture for America and I
think that it was Peter Drucker who said
the most entrepreneurial thing you can
do is start a university Andrews kind of
flipped that on its head and and and and
and said well actually what he's gonna
do is work to make American universities
more entrepreneurial or make the
graduates of those universities more
entrepreneurial and so so happy to have
him here today please welcome me in
giving Andrew a warm welcome thank you
so much for having me um how familiar
are you guys with venture for America
unlike so raise your hand really high if
you know everything about it and then
like like not at all if you know very
very little all right a lot of not so
much so venture for America as Michael
suggested a little bit is meant to
address this problem and it's a problem
I was talking with Tim about in the back
it's a problem that maybe some of you
have thought deeply about and some of
you have thought absolutely nothing
about it's that if you're a young smart
person the United States today the odds
of you becoming an investment banker
management consultant or like like I was
a corporate attorney the odds are pretty
high and if you want to do something
like startups or anything else then the
odds are actually a little bit low so
how many you guys have actually had a
thought like this at some point ever all
right a lot of you which is unsurprising
to me because you guys in
I represent industry an innovative
industry in the form of Microsoft so you
guys actually build you know incredibly
valuable tools that help other
businesses come into being so you guys
in my mind are over here on the extreme
left unlike a good end and then over on
the far right is what a number of people
are doing and it's not there's not a
knock on them because we all went to
school with them or we were them in some
cases I graduated from Brown anyone
aside from Michael and me graduate from
Brown no one disappointing so I
graduated from Brown in the mid 90s and
had no idea what to do and so I went to
law school I'm anyone do that good a lot
of a lot of dodged bullets in this room
so so I went to law school at Columbia
found Law School clarifies it's very
little about what you want to do and so
I became a corporate attorney in New
York doing banking and M&amp;amp;A transactions
at a firm called Davis Polk and Wardwell
and so I resemble this and so I
understood how this came about so just
to run through some of the numbers if
you graduated from Harvard in 2012 there
were generally speaking six default
paths for you financial services law
school management consulting medical
school and graduate school Teach for
America
Teach for America had 4% of 2012 Harvard
grads become corps members and about 14%
apply then after that you have
nonprofits government military media
arts sports communications industry and
I T is where you guys fall Microsoft and
then undecided traveling is 13% so I
joked that they went found themselves
then come back and apply to law school
or become management consultants so so
the the industry IT side if you were to
try and suss out how many Harvard grads
went to startups it's a sliver of a
sliver it would be like a subset of that
10% so how do you guys went to Harvard I
bet a few of you also none so first is
this surprising unsurprising familiar to
unfamiliar like shocking totally not
shocking see someone smiling what's your
name sir
oh it's that's thinking you Steven yeah
see you so yeah you were smiling because
this is totally what you expected or wow
that's incredible
Oh what's your son's name right oh yeah
yeah bride's a good guy no no what did
you raise your head so much so so
someone else someone who found this
stuff totally like unsurprising anyone
anyone yeah I graduated like a year ago
like today pretty much actually and I'd
say felt like 90% of my friends even
balance of Finance or management
consulting English struggle to think
about any other option that was
equivalent to something that would make
them successful after graduation so I'm
very familiar with this phenomenon and
you went to a Duke yes yeah anyone else
you just give me a show hands if you
said yes this is totally unsurprising
and you know you're there went through
this yourself forward no people are
going through it like the vast majority
of us and so it wasn't just me so in my
case I went to law school out of brown
but if you look at the other schools
like Duke or Cornell or Columbia or Penn
so it's not just a Harvard thing if you
look at any of the top schools
you see patterns among the top employers
and the paths that they take where these
six default paths really end up being
the paths of least resistance for
national university graduates around the
country I'm sure some of you guys went
to these schools I'm gonna stop with the
school thing though because all right so
now what does this mean regionally so if
you have a hyper concentration of smart
young people heading to banking law and
consulting where does what does that
mean they they move after college like
where did all your friends go it was a
Steven right yeah so New York's one
where else suit gun rally
San Francisco Boston Chicago would be 5
or 6 DC LA so they had the top four are
New York San Francisco Boston DC Chicago
and LA are five and six now if you look
at the rest of the country
you have a bunch of states with
difficulty generating new businesses and
creating jobs in those regions and
they're essentially non-overlapping with
the talent destinations with the
exception of California which is so
massive that can have big problems in
addition to having some pockets of
prosperity and so if you're a smart
young person from a state like let's say
Georgia and you went to Duke with Steven
the odds of you heading back to Georgia
and starting a business or working in a
growth company they are really really
low the odds of you becoming a banker
consultant or lawyer in New York or DC
very high and if you do this for a
couple of decades you end up with an
economic picture that looks something
like this
adventure of America we kind of joked
that smart people are doing six things
in six places they're becoming bankers
consultants lawyers doctors academics or
teachers in New York San Francisco
Boston DC Chicago LA so what do you guys
think of this picture first well is this
surprising we're you guys familiar with
this thoughts response yeah
yeah Atlanta does get a lot of talent
from the southeast part of the US and if
we were to look at the town in migration
numbers I think you're right it would
probably be like top 12 in the country
it's just the the yellow stars are
actually statewide job creation numbers
that's a good observation so this
picture one you know it's just numerical
I mean those are just where states don't
don't have as many employment
opportunities but I think there's a
picture we're all familiar with having
gone to a number of institutions that
funnel like with with Steven and Duke a
disproportionate number of graduates to
a select number of cities and I'm not
sure where Seattle Falls in terms of
this discussion I feel like you guys are
like like right after Chicago in LA at
least in my mind it's like and then it'd
be like Seattle and Austin would be like
the next level I guess it see some nods
there so I thought it was like this you
guys be like you know top three it's one
that was like this all the time so so
why is it then that so many young people
do the same handful of things like what
does this list list look like why is it
that so many of your classmates end up
becoming management consultants even
though they probably had no idea what
management consulting was when they
showed up on campus so factors so money
is certainly a big one but Teach for
America is shown that money isn't
necessarily the primary driver all the
time but money is certainly on this list
what else is on this list
prestige what's your name Aki Aki yeah
so prestige certainly there what else
keep going yeah game skills training get
experienced because most seniors and
college don't think of themselves as
ready they want to go to an environment
that's going to help make them ready
stability iris so iris said something
that many of you guys are agreeing with
which is that a lot of its influenced by
which companies spend time and money
recruiting and so that's certainly like
a huge factor clearly marked path easy
to find or apply to so it's prestige its
progress seeking the next level it's
opens doors keep options keep options
open so Stevens friends at Duke a lot of
them weren't making what they think of
as lifetime commitments they're saying
look I'll do this it'll look great on my
resume and then the world will be my
oyster and that's something that banks
and consulting firms obviously sell
pretty heavily money compensation
lifestyle gain skills training for the
next thing community make sure you don't
fall behind peers work with other smart
people and then there's this notion of
doing something that's good
pro-social like Teach for America though
this also applies to people who become
investment bankers and management
consultants because the thought process
is that they need to gain stature and
become a baller before they can really
do any good it's like God I will you
know make lots of money and then I'll go
back to the people with loaves of bread
from horseback so what do you guys think
of this list yeah so this has been
road-tested if you will on campuses
around the country and thousands of
young people and they all say thumbs up
this is why we do what we do and
certainly you know when I went to law
school I think it was some blend of
these factors so on the flip side who's
not getting the talent the the the
companies that are coming of age or
getting started in cities around the
country aren't really there at Durham to
compete first even in his classmates and
the structural impediments one as iris
said you're not being recruited because
the startup is not going to come on
campus six months in advance and start
trying to recruit dozens of people to
it's hard to find a suitable company if
you did decide to look you you're doing
it alone you have unclear prospects for
training advancement or sex
you have no network idea money or tech
proficiency you just don't think you're
ready and so for most young people they
say look I'd love to join a startup I'd
love to be an entrepreneur someday but
first I need to go learn about business
and then I can double back later down
the road after I've gained some skills
Stephen is this an accurate description
of those of your friends that might have
an interest in entrepreneurship that
came out of Duke yeah so these are the
structural problems and I'm gonna go on
a limb and say if we can help address
these issues then we can do these young
people a great service as well as
they're the country the economy if we
can balance the scales because what iris
was suggesting is a hundred percent
right about the resources being employed
recruiting our young people so Teach for
America has pointed the way and the
question I'm going to ask and hopefully
we can answer over the coming years is
what would happen if the same proportion
of talent that's currently heading to
Wall Street professional services
management consulting was instead going
to startups around the country to
Baltimore Cleveland Detroit New Orleans
Cincinnati Las Vegas Philadelphia to
startups in all these cities how long
would that take to impact the rate of
job growth and innovation nationwide
like if we just reformat the numbers and
say hey guess what this year 50% of
Harvard grads and you know Duke rads or
whomever tend to startups how long would
that take to have an impact
so I hear one year you said yeah thirty
years thirty years
yeah so the the over/under is somewhere
in that range I would guess say it's a
it's somewhere between one and thirty
you know so but one thing that no one
here doubts is that it would work like
we all know it would work and really
that the question is you know why don't
we just make it happen
and the reason why we don't make it
happen is in part as IRA said a resource
question so Teach for America had its
genesis 24 years ago and this past year
it had 50,000 now how many guys had
frenzy to teach of America first of all
a number of you and so I came you
graduate from Princeton last year yeah
so so how many of your friends are you
said you had a friend who's doing Teach
for America away you know in LA yeah
yeah so do you know anything about how
she got how she became aware of Teach
for America Wendy Kopp the founder into
our schools she's pretty famous on
campus and I think everyone was talking
about it on campus
I went came to applying for jobs and
what they were gonna do next that's more
sort of like word-of-mouth I would say
yeah so Teach for America is very well
established on campuses but Teach for
America also spent 38 million on
recruitment and selection in the last
year record so it's an expensive process
trying to recruit young people and for
that 38 million they got 50,000
applicants or 5,000 spots so that's how
you become the six default path for
young people's you spend tens of
millions I have friends who are in
financial services recruiting and they
say they spend in and out an analogous
amount on recruiting people at Duke and
other campuses nationwide so what's
going on right now is there's an arms
race like a stealth arms race for smart
people in this country where some sides
are fighting and some signs are not now
Microsoft is fighting because you guys
are enormous and you say hey we need
smart people so so let's go get them the
startups cannot really fight that fight
because they're out of the way they
don't have the resource don't have the
brand equity even if they went to campus
they would lose because they were like
hey I'm some company who never heard of
our
less money and higher risk like you know
who's into that and you know most people
would say you know that's okay Deloitte
has a giant display right next to you
like let me let me go talk to them which
is not a knock on anyone involved it's
just everyone's doing something very
rational so so to fast-forward a little
bit for me so I became a corporate
attorney in 99 and left in 2002 started
calm in the first bubble you guys
remember the first bubble were we guys
all know you guys were here during the
first bubble probably like awesome a few
of you so so the first bubble was
excellent wasn't it there's a good times
so so I started a calm at the age of 25
raised a couple hundred thousand dollars
and launched this site we got a lot of
press for in the New York Times USA
Today CNN and then the bubble burst and
then no one cared about my little calm
Nasdaq went from five thousand to two
thousand you know our investors were
worried about losing you know their
mainstream investments much less their
little angel investment in my company
and so my company crashed and burned I
was 26 I just lost people a quarter
million dollars I still owed a hundred
thousand in law school debt and my
parents were like what the heck happened
to you like you know didn't used to be
smart and and so I was trying to answer
that question and I said you know what I
tried to start a business it didn't work
out but I found that process much more
genuine and invigorating certainly than
being a corporate attorney was and so I
said I need to get better I need to get
stronger and so I'm going to ask you
guys what would you advise 26 year old
Andrew who had just started a company
and failed that wanted to get better at
that process of building a business what
would you say to that person to do do it
again so I felt like doing it again was
going to be tough because I just lost
these people as money and you know 2002
and no one want to invest in anything
and you know it's kind of broke so but
I'm with you like so so if you can't
start a company again what might you
advise or if you if I were to say to you
hey that's like a bridge too far for me
right now join a start-up which is what
I did so I became the vice president of
something or other at a tech company
there's rampant tail inflation and
startups you guys know that right
well if you didn't know that well now
you know so um so I
I found someone who was more experienced
than me and I knelt and said like please
accept my sword master and he said rise
and like knighted me and then and I
became his sidekick for four years so
that company raised five million dollars
and went to several million in revenue I
then became as Michael indicated the CEO
of a test prep company called Manhattan
GMAT which taught people how to do well
on the GMAT I believe in very obvious
names and so that company grew to become
number one in the US and I personally
taught the analyst classes at Goldman
Sachs McKinsey JP Morgan Morgan Stanley
and these other firms how to do well on
the GMAT so I joked that I went into
these incredible office buildings with
beautiful conference spaces and I was
like let's talk about triangles because
like you know whatever whatever the the
week was about I got you know it seemed
like a lot of overkill but that company
was acquired by a Catholic Sox of
Washington Post in 2009 and I was trying
to think of the problems that I'd seen
over the years and I might want to try
and address personally and the problem I
kept coming back to you was that those
analysts reminded me so much of myself
when I was at the law firm where they
done well in school they got the jobs
they thought that we're supposed to get
they were working hard but they didn't
really know what they were doing why
they were there they weren't very
engaged with their work and so they were
going to try and figure it out and leave
to do something else but they would take
the GMAT as like a safety safety hatch
or escape hatch if it didn't work out so
the the path would go 2 years analyst
program try and do something else find
it it's not a perfect fit go to business
school for two years load up with 100k
in debt have your choices constrained a
little bit and then go to to do
something else that that hopefully will
be a better fit and that's typically not
the last step because the post MBA
position the typical tenure actually
what do you guys think the typical
tenure is of a post MBA position like in
measured in years or months to years
that's right so so they do that for two
years and you know and then they they
try and figure out the next thing so I
saw that movie dozens or hundreds of
times I saw my own movie and my and
those of my law school classmates and I
was like wow what a weird five year
ringer we're putting so many of our
young smart people through like that
it's kind of unproductive
and at the same time I saw that Teach
for America had channeled so many young
smart people into education and saw that
that that transformed their lives in
many cases and so I thought wouldn't it
be great if there was a Teach for
America for startups and what do you
call that you call that venture for
America so I quit my job in 2011 to
start this nonprofit I put in 120 km I
own to start the organization and then
went without salary for a year while I
was going around recruiting people like
Brian and I think Stephens actually saw
me in that first college tour I was on
Dukes campus and he said that he was
only one in the room which is probably
right because like you know not that
many people showed up to that first
college tour but now Duke is our number
one feeder school where we had I want to
say something like 70 applicants from
Duke this past year we're gonna be one
of the top 20 employers out of Duke
alone this year so in 2011 I started the
organization the budget that year was
about two hundred thousand fast forward
to today our budgets 3.3 million and
we're growing quickly we had over a
thousand applicants this year so what we
do is we recruit top college graduates
from around the country we bring them to
training camp where we say look here's a
little bit about startups you become
best friends with each other they all
come to Providence Rhode Island and live
in a brown dorm so it's very exciting
those of you who are young like you know
you can maybe imagine what that's like
and then they work in startups for two
years we bring them back together for a
reunion have webinars for them and then
they get operating experience they work
in the trenches of a start-up in one of
these cities for two years at the end of
the two years we have a seed fund
waiting for them to invest in them if
they decide to start a business and the
angel investors in that seed fund
include Jeff Weiner the CEO of LinkedIn
and a number of other very prominent
businessmen and executives so how do you
guys would have considered a program
like this when you were coming out of
college a lot of you right so the point
is that we want to try and create
rational choices for our young people
like right now we're saying hey tear
your six menu items but in our heart of
hearts we hope you don't do any of these
six things we hope you do this weird off
menu thing that we're gonna hide and
make really difficult and and I'm here
to say that's really silly it's like a
very silly way to try and build a system
or an economy where what we should do is
we should
give them more diverse paths and diverse
visions of success and make it just a
principle of rational choice where if
someone's design designed to try and
build something that's what they should
do if someone's designed to be a
contract reader they should do that
instead but right now we're saying look
no matter what you're designed to do
here here the the paths in front of you
choose one that's all bit like that
movie divergent anyone see that movie
divergent it's alright wasn't that good
but it didn't remind me of this a little
bit so our mission is to revitalize
American cities and communities through
entrepreneurship to enable our best and
brightest to create new opportunities
for themselves and others and to restore
the culture of achievement to include
value creation and risk reward and the
common good and we can do these things
then we believe we can revive the
capacity of our top people to end up
building the engines of innovation and
prosperity for the future and it's all
just about where our talents going I
think you guys would agree that where
our talent goes is going to end up
determining the future 1 to 30 years
from now when we can all tell the future
as long as we know what our smart people
are doing so I'm going to stop there for
a second because I've been doing a lot
of talking on any questions or thoughts
yes so you put a very intriguing list
there about you know what the grads are
seeking as they leave college prestige
and so what's your message to counteract
all that that's that's a lot of it's a
lot of weight there what's your name
Phillip Phillip so Phillip what's
amazing is that Teach for America
provides all of these things if you look
at them with the possible exception of
actually with the exception of money so
Teach for America it's prestigious it's
clearly marked progress open doors gain
skills community training etc venture
for America checks every box on this
list including potentially money if you
stretch your time horizon a little bit
because if you believe in yourself and
think that you have what it takes to
start a successful company
then you'll defer some short-term
rewards and then maybe have a shot at
doing just that down the road so we
agree with you that these are very
compelling factors and we actually want
to provide them and if we provide them
then young people will
walk this path yeah yeah so we have
maybe we'll offer them a Microsoft
product if if all goes well here so
there we have two full-time programming
team members one of whom is an MBA from
MIT and his job is to just offer
professional development help the
fellows get stronger at what they want
to do we also have local resources in
place for the fellows where they'll meet
with business leaders in their
communities so it's there they get a
sense of the leadership in each city but
we have programming webinars online
licenses for various educational
resources and then we bring them back
together for training camp after their
first year yeah how do you choose your
target cities are there just the three
cities that you mentioned or let's see
if I have a map for you what's your name
II see
all right so Oh actually I'll come to
the map in a second what I'm gonna do
right now is just show you guys some
young idealistic smart people which may
or may not include Brian it's just sort
of arbitrary haha now this is just to
give you guys a sense as to who's in the
program I think Steve might even have
some friends I don't know if any your
friends are listed here
do you know Jacob Robinson yeah do you
like it yeah a winner so here are some
of the people that made it through our
selection process we have a three-stage
selection process this year we had over
a thousand applicants and about a
hundred spots so it's about a ten
percent acceptance rate we had a
computer science major from Princeton
who turned down SpaceX to joint venture
for America we're getting very very
smart young people it's you know so this
did your question before felt then here
are some of the people that are out
there right now working at startups
around the country so I don't know what
you think of when you see these faces
like what are the commonalities I just
think smart idealistic full of energy
and passion right yes you can get that
from these guys
plus a little bit of diversity thrown in
because we chose the faces and then
here's some of the fellows that are
coming out of the program so the first
class is graduating this year and these
guys are actually starting honest-to-god
businesses and I can't tell you how
excited I am about that because you know
we don't expect everyone in this program
to start a business that would be really
very high bar but I'm going to give some
shoutouts so Brian Rudolph graduates
from Emory moves to Detroit to work at
an e-commerce company and he started a
pasta company called bonza pasta that's
high-protein gluten-free pasta made of
chickpeas who finds that peeling or
appetizing so go to bonza pasta and just
sign up for you know their I do not but
but you can have a box same time I do
and if you just go into their website
set up port turn pro Brent Brent
Baltimore and Brian brochet co-founded a
company to help small businesses tell
their stories through video editing
that's distributed and one of the ways
they get the content is they give the
businesses GoPro cameras and say like
put these on your employees for a couple
of days and then they'll edit the
footage into a video for their website
castle which is Tim Dingman and a few
other guys weren't pictured so Castle is
a software platform for local landlords
what they these guys in Detroit they
bought a foreclosed mansion for nine
thousand dollars and then they went
around rehabbing it and while they were
doing that they figured out that there's
a disconnect between local landlords
that have fewer than 10 properties and
tenants that they just don't like or
trust each other like if you ask either
party said what's the problem they say
like you know those other like those
tenants aren't trustworthy and then the
tenants will say those landlords aren't
trustworthy so they're building a
communications platform between local
landlords and tenants that's then going
to build in reputational scores so that
if you're a local landlord that does
good stuff then you end up with like a
castle reputation and the maybe you can
even charge like you know four or five
percent more rent over time but in the
mean time it's a communications utility
so so these are the startups that our
fellows are just starting themselves
having been in these cities for a little
bit less than two years an additional
about 50% of the fellows are staying in
the
cities and working at other the startup
they've been out for last two years or
another startup so it's actually working
on the ground in the most important of
ways so one of the things I realized
very early on was that in order for
young people to find this an appealing
path it had to be someone that was
cooler than me so I managed to enlist
Tony Hsieh the CEO of Zappos Jeff Weiner
the CEO of LinkedIn Dan Gilbert the
founder of Quicken Loans so Dan's a
story unto himself
you guys know Dan Gilbert is or have a
sense of what he's doing so Dan
Gilbert's invested a billion dollars of
his personal wealth into downtown
Detroit and is now venture firm
America's biggest supporter in bringing
talented young people to work at his
startups in Detroit so he's speaking at
our summer celebration in June in New
York I guess you guys might not be in
New York next month but if you know
anyone please send them our way it's
gonna be really good party Dan Porter's
the former president of Teach for
America from the 90s he was the head of
a company called oMG pop that may draw
something that was acquired by Zynga I
want to say two years ago
Alisa Volkman was the co-founder Balcom
was acquired by Disney so we have some
real winning people associated with
venture for America in part because we
knew that young people wanted to learn
from experienced entrepreneurs and so
the team is very strong
Mike to rule owes a Duke grad and the
same fraternity as Stephen so it's one
reason why we're so strong at Duke we're
gonna get those brand numbers up so the
team is the team and so here's the city
question who has the city question
what's new I'm sorry Dean so we started
out in Providence Detroit New Orleans
Cincinnati in Las Vegas we expanded to
Baltimore Cleveland in Philadelphia and
this year we're expanding to San Antonio
st. Louis Columbus and Miami and Miami
has an unemployment rate of like 10.2
percent just you guys know so it's it's
a you know people think Miami it's like
more prosperous than it is probably at
least statistically so these are 12
cities were in and I'm sure you guys
have other thoughts as to where we could
or should be we're just going to keep
expanding each new city needs to have a
few things going for it one it needs to
have a robust set of startups for our
fellows to work at because another
premise of ours is that most of these
fellows need to have established
businesses to
with like having them start businesses
from day one would be a little bit
over-ambitious to leadership in that
city needs to be supportive and then
three there needs to be a financial
supporter for venture for America
because our costs for doing what we do
are about 35,000 per fellow over a two
year period which is about twelve
percent less than what Teach for America
spending right now on a per teacher
basis and they're at scale they've been
doing this twenty four years and we've
only been doing it for a few years so I
think we're relatively resource
efficient but we can probably even get
it a little bit tighter over time so to
go to a new city like San Antonio we
received a grant of five hundred
thousand from Graham Weston who is the
founder of Rackspace and now the CEO
again and so when we go to a new city
we're looking for a partner like that to
be able to provide a runway so we can
operate there for years because we know
to your point in the back it's going to
take many years for us to be able to
have a real impact that you send in a
initial group of twelve or fifteen or
twenty young people that's going to be
great
but really we need to have the
maturation period so that those young
people end up becoming managers leaders
founders and contributors in a
meaningful way so this hundred seven
fellows is from this past year and we
have another 104 fellows coming in for
training camp this year and they're
going to be on their cities by August of
this year so this number will go up to
about 210 or so yeah with your company
so we have three people who go and kick
the tires on a start-up that's in ours
and that like if you were to be in one
of our cities which city you want to be
in Seattle interesting hypothetical
there so so Seattle right now is not one
of our cities but let's say it was and
you just contact us and say hey I'm
Henry right I'm Henry with a really
interesting startup thing I could use
some young smart people and then we
would send someone to meet with you and
say what is the company who are you what
are your needs and then decide if it's a
fit if they decide it was a fit which in
your case probably would be honestly
because you seem cool and you're clearly
very smart to have the job you have
so we then put you in the mix where
right now for
100 fellows in this year's program there
are about 180 positions so it's
competitive on the part of the companies
we have a surplus of opportunities
relative to the fellows so you'd have to
go and compete and try and get a young
smart person that want to work with you
and that would be the process it's
pretty straightforward for the companies
we do turn down a lot of companies
because they're not growth oriented
enough for the management team doesn't
seem strong enough or the role isn't
appropriate but I'm sure none of those
things that apply sure right now we're
in these twelve cities and I dare say
that San Francisco is going to be maybe
the last city we ever like actually go
to open up but we have people graduating
each year and those people are often
going to gravitate to San Francisco or
New York or Seattle or these other
markets we actually already have three
or four fellows in San Francisco because
their company got acquired and moved to
San Francisco because they got into Y
Combinator and so they opened the San
Francisco office so things like that
happen and we're not very dogmatic it's
not like this thing where if you like
leave you know your city all of a sudden
like you know like we're upset at you if
the needs of the company make it
appropriate for you to wind up in any of
these cities obviously that's cool and
the other thing is two years is not
forever so let's say we have a hundred
fellows this year and then 50 of them
end up starting companies are staying in
their cities that's still on another 50
young people who are probably going to
want to work at startups in San
Francisco Seattle New York etc so you
can have them season for a couple of
years in their city and startup and then
try and hire them on the way out
just uh Francisco because that's their
that's where actually can get committed
more easily but they are not necessarily
connected to talent that could help them
so sometimes they can find your student
reproduce moving in there but they're
not from there they're just going there
because they don't have yeah and it's
something that we'd like to combat over
time is this notion that you must move
to like particular geography San
Francisco in particular if you want to
start a business of a certain type I
mean in order for the economy to grow
the way we all want it to people need to
be able to start businesses in cities
around the country and if we can open up
the talent pipeline for people who are
starting companies in all of these
cities and the ones that will follow I
mean it'll make a big difference because
in our experience companies need the
following three things they need capital
they need team and talent and then they
need product market fit and people talk
a lot about the first one which is just
like investment capital but the
entrepreneurs we talk to say team and
talent is actually the key driver and
that most of them have trouble accessing
that early on yeah so building on that
and thinking about the 30 year growth
scale what happens or how are you guys
setting a system up that would support
the growth the growth the growth of the
muscle was graduated appropriate they've
started a company assuming in that city
do you support their growth that
companies with the new companies grows
because it's I mean they're drawing from
a local talent pool right so yeah not
necessarily just you don't have a
pipeline of new grads coming in to feed
the new startup especially if they're
grow and growing they're gonna hire 25
15 hundred people whatever so what and
that's gonna really that's that's really
where it starts to affect the local
economy in a much more significant way
so what what's what do you have in place
for supporting that kind of growth so
I'm super excited for that phase and
we're just hitting that phase which is
fellow start companies and so our goal
is to help create a hundred thousand new
US jobs and a lot of that's gonna be
seeing
company succeed so I'm very happy to say
that the people who have been supporting
venture of America to date like Jeff and
Tony and Dan and UBS and and Barclays
and all those people are all hovering
there waiting for our guys and gals to
start companies they can come in and say
yes let's make this stuff happen and I'm
sure how many you guys in the room like
you yourselves personally would like to
help these these companies succeed like
you know these 24 year old start
companies like you guys all would right
so so I'm happy to say that everyone's
all waiting for it to happen and the
fellows are up for the challenge where
they're doing it but you're right that
that challenge is going to mushroom
quickly over time or if you look at the
math let's say 20% of our fellow start
businesses that means by two years from
now we'll have something like 35 to 40
businesses that we need to help support
and not all those businesses are going
to make it clearly when we all know the
statistics on this but we have to hit
make it so that enough of them succeed
and hire and thrive and hire more people
that we can start to have a real impact
like a pet peeve of mine is institutions
or programs that sort of have you for a
particular period of time then when it's
over they shake your hand and say like
best of luck you know and I hate to say
it but that resembles mostly
institutions I know that I deal with
people like for us venture for America
is much more than like this two-year
program we want to help you achieve your
goals for a long time to come
and I'm happy to say our supporters feel
the same way it's a big challenge though
no doubt about it I mean you know we're
looking at dozens eventually hundreds of
businesses ya know so so this year as an
example we have four teams you know six
fellows four teams and we have 150 k to
distribute among them provided by UBS
America's so they're all gonna get
something and then they have this angel
council of between five hundred thousand
a million to pitch to and that's going
to be up to the Angels how much they
want to invest so you're guaranteed very
little I mean our program is the real
world just like in the real world you're
guaranteed very little you know you have
to fight for it for us to but it's in
our interest to help them to extent we
can yeah
he says it seems the program focuses on
sourcing from elite schools there's a
lot of top of the media that question
for value of college are there clouds to
source strands high school first I'm
happy to say that we had applicants for
from a hundred and forty two schools
this past year and we have fellows from
schools that no one's ever physically
visited because of resource constraints
so we have fellows from University of
Oklahoma
Auburn there's one guy who was a marine
and served in Afghanistan and then
graduate from UC Santa Barbara and is
now working in Detroit so we know that
talents everywhere I mean certainly if
you have a limited amount of resources
you might start at certain schools but
we know that people are capable of great
things from all sorts of backgrounds to
the high school college question we've
drawn a line that we're taking college
graduates that's somewhat arbitrary but
it's just something that we decided to
to implement but there going to be
people in our opinion and you can see
from the nature this presentation people
are questioning college but in our
opinion most people probably are going
to graduate from most people have a
certain background are probably going to
graduate from college and they probably
should graduate from college in our mind
and that if there's a place we can
intervene it's actually in their options
after college graduation so let's see
that's the approach we're taking you
know I know Peter teal and and and
others are like trying to go earlier but
we think the crucial juncture is this
point after graduation
is there anything you do in your
marketing or your programming to get
people over any reluctance to go to some
people occasionally I hear you that two
years isn't forever but I know when I
was fresh out of school going to a great
place it's very high what's your name
yeah Kim so part of it is the self
selection process that if you apply to
venture for America you're not sure
where you're gonna wind up do you
graphically so you need to have a degree
of flexibility to throw your hat in the
ring
so by the time they get to us you know
they're they're not fixed on one
location and when they get into the
process they quickly have have a sense
of the fact that they're going to be
working at a real company and get very
focused on the specific roles and
companies that they're gonna be working
for and they become less less fixated on
what city is in so if they say it's like
hey just give me a great company I don't
care if it's Baltimore Philadelphia at
Columbus Las Vegas they just want to
find a great company with a team that
they mesh with and that's again the self
selection based upon the people that
came to us the other thing is that if
you were to move to a city and know that
you're going to go with like five to ten
of your new friends then it makes most
any environment much more hospitable a
number of the fellows are living with
people from the program or are living in
the same building or block and so if you
put it that hat on where you're like hey
I can go just about anywhere if I've got
six new friends and a bit of a network
then it makes them I think a little bit
more versatile that way it's a good time
it's like you know it's like two years
in a major American city or less major
American city but but - is it a in an
American city with like five new friends
I mean you know it's like an adventure
yeah so your recruitment season is like
the fall of central Bo's senior year yes
okay so a lot of like the places you
described where smart people go like the
goldman sachs with them akin to the
world they get their students
or their future employees locked in in
that post junior summer so how do you
kind of combat that so we actually are
going to start a selection day for
juniors where if they come in they can
get an offer spring of their junior year
for the the summer after graduation and
that's how we're going to sort of make
it even but it's a great question
the process that we described here does
begin very early where many juniors are
getting offers at the end of their
summer before their senior year and then
they take it so they can be set so we're
going to do the same thing sorry yeah
what about offering internships at these
same companies to juniors yeah we're
going to start looking at that as well
we want to go both upstream and
downstream so upstream would be summer
internships downstream would be phd's
unhappy lawyers or bankers or
consultants which there's no shortage
that want to head on and do something
else my brother's an academic and so how
do you guys are academics playing a
number of you or at least not academics
but like got a PhD of some kind I feel
like Wow Pastis so it does say Microsoft
Research in it all right so um so my
brother's an academic and I have a sense
that there's a little bit of
inefficiency going on there and so we'd
like to be able to offer options both up
and down over time know what does
venture for America ask in return it's a
great question so for a start-up to be
considered like Henry for example if
Henry were to say hey I'd like to hire a
fellow we say one you have to commit to
paying them a base salary of 38 K to
start subject to increases if they work
out so that's very reasonable but you
have to have at least two years of
runway for that because it's obviously
like a genuine early hire an employee so
that's like the easiest thing the next
is that they need to have a specific
role that's not fungible so you can't
have like five people doing the same job
and one of them's a fellow you have to
commit to sitting down with them once a
month as the founder
or very very senior executive so that
they get a sense of exposure to the
business and then you also have to
occasionally like let them go to things
like training Cambrian which is you know
it's within the confines of vacation but
you should know that there's some
programming that takes place that the
fellow is probably don't want to go to
that you should let them do you know
within reason and also you should invest
in their development such that you can
try and hire them after the program ends
because we're not that interested in
companies that are like hey this is a
two-year thing and that's that we're
looking for companies that want to try
and fit that person into their team long
term and so if a company falls short of
those things and the fellow is unhappy
then we can re-examine the fit which
happened a little bit more in the first
year or so and then the second year a
little bit less so and I think is is
continuing to improve as our
relationships with companies get better
and there's a firmer understanding so
yeah
like how are you actually are they just
doing that straight management and they
shoot so let me go back some profiles
you can see some different majors here
and here I'll use this because here's
your religion major so Jill Morrison
here started a backpack company in
college too so he's very enterprising
but we believe that talent is versatile
and can do lots of different things and
that if you're really good at one thing
you can probably learn to be good at
something else so the our fellows have
what we call adaptive excellence which
is just they demonstrate they're really
good at something and we can project
that they can learn other things so I'd
say 25% of the fellows or other
engineers or hard science graduates
where they studied like biochemistry or
Chemical Engineering or something like
that and then we have a host of social
science people like economics finance
etc and then a handful of humanities
people I'd say about 25% are like
Johanna or Joe so one of the
misconceptions we think is out there is
that you need to be a computer science
major to go into startups but startups
need as you guys know very accomplished
content creators marketers branding
people business development sales etc
and so what we do is we source for all
of those roles in these companies how
many you know it's a little bit like
what the consulting firms do because
like no one majored in consulting you
know what I mean
you did major in consulting people
probably be a little worried about you
okay so so the consulting firms trust
that if you are really smart and
hardworking and accomplished that you
can learn consulting and so we're we're
a little bit the same way yeah in the
back
some of the schools like the energy
Washington which probably is but do you
send on information to all of the Career
Counseling so we have a full time
recruitment team of three people we have
been in in most major publications at
this point but we also know that college
seniors aren't sitting there reading the
New York Times Wall Street Journal like
looking for stuff like us so we do try
and hit the ground at these campuses but
we'd love your help on this I mean I
think that our brand right now is still
building up our awareness is still
building up but if you know young smart
people you know among your nieces
nephews friends neighbors etc that you
think this resembles please have them
apply I mean you know the more talent we
get in the more of an impact we can have
so we're just getting started on that
front but we love we love University of
Washington since we love people from all
over yeah they could have been in the
workplace we say zero to three years so
it's senior in college up to a few years
out we had one guy Brent Baltimore who
was an investment banking analyst at
Credit Suisse for two years and then he
was also on the national champion rugby
team but that was in college and then he
was a credit to us banking analyst and
then left to join us after his aimless
program was over so he had two years
full so if you have people that resemble
that you can send them our way too so
what'd you guys think any like thoughts
or reactions to this is it awesome yeah
yeah oh my god you like it so like that
the plan here is to fix the country
really I know and if we get enough smart
people building cool companies
throughout the country we think that
this could be a game-changer especially
because we could change the nature of
people's choices is right now there's
zero weight or morality to going to be a
corporate lawyer
no one says hey that's like good or bad
that's just what achievement looks like
today but if you have different flavors
of achievement where you can say to a
younger version of me hey guess what
maybe that's not what you should be
doing maybe you should be doing this
other thing instead that it can have a
profound
I mean that's about the restore
restoration of the culture piece because
you know we need our best people trying
to solve problems we can't have people
trying to maneuver themselves close
enough to the geyser where you know some
of it like rains down on them I mean
that that's a bad place to be as a
country yeah what is five years from now
look like are you still around
I still around we got a question is that
oh my god what's the long term yeah I
agree
I was joking with Amy on the way in here
it's like in 30 years they'll like roll
me out like you know for special
occasions and I like points I'm like
wise in hand at someone like scare some
young person um it's been an incredible
three years I mean like knowing where we
were three years ago I mean we were like
me and a PowerPoint deck and and me and
Stephen and enduring I'm like looking at
each other um you know and now I'm
looking at all of you Plus whoever is
looking online so it it's been an
incredible run because everyone wants to
solve this problem you know so if in
five years the problem solved that would
be dynamite I have an instinct that the
problem will not be entirely solved in
five years and that the organization
will still be doing work and by five
years from now these guys would be five
years out in the field like having run
companies for five years I mean oh my
god like imagine what that does like
let's say their company gets to 20
people and then they're hiring people
from the program and then like you know
they look up to these role models I mean
the fact that we've done what we've done
when these guys are the tip of the spear
like it is encouraging in part because
it just gets much more like
self-reinforcing over time it's like if
you can go to Duke and say hey guess
what here's a Duke grad from you know
four years ago who's now CEO of a
company in you know Baltimore you're
like wait that's possible I can do that
it's like yeah you don't have to go to
McKinsey you know and and try and like
scheme your way out you can
you can do this and then maybe you can
be this guy I mean the fact that we've
done what we've done without even to
having that guy 2.2 or gal yeah nuts
really like the first fellows deserve a
lot of credit in part because you know
they're taking a real leap but as we
build a track record it's just gonna get
better their thoughts so where was I on
this ah yes so uh I wrote a book called
smart people should build things they're
available back then it's here so the
books about the ideas behind venture for
America and some of the things I went
into founding it so if you have an
interest in seeing how the organization
came to be where it is today
you know the book has that there are
some nice quotes about the book
- here's read the book alright Michael
and Amy so it you know if you want their
honest review after I'm not talking so
I'd love to them and ask them what they
think one of the things that book does
have is it has a breakdown of the six
paths and what it is that are smart
people are doing and it has like primary
research and all that stuff so those of
you who are into that stuff you know
it's like a little bit of a social
science entrepreneurship tome so my
contact information is andrew adventure
from america.org we're excited to work
with microsoft and all of you so the
three the big pillars of what we do you
can help with all of them one is
recruiting very smart young people to is
enlisting cool start-up companies around
the country and three is our own
organizational resources so we have
young people I'll give you guys a story
hopefully will make you mad and then you
guys will like you know want to do
something about that so my guy Tim
Dingman
he's an electrical engineer out of brown
and he wanted an engineer mentor how
many guys are engineers and I review
excellent so you want an engineer mentor
and and then I was like we need to get
you an engineer mentor and so we found a
guy at Google Scott Johnston who's like
I'll be his mentor so we have a host of
young people who all want like
experienced professional mentors and
resources and that could be many of you
here in this room where if you want to
take an enterprising 22 23 year old
who's trying to rebuild a country on
your wing please get in touch with us
we'd love that and so there are many
things that hopefully we can all do
together I know you you know you can
book talk and you're left with you know
now this new set of responsibilities but
this organization is very much a work in
progress I mean it's a living thing you
know what changes every every day and
every week and so if you think that what
we're doing is something that you like
to help with please just get in touch
with me and I'd love to hear from you so
I know we've already entered the Q&amp;amp;A
period but I guess we can officially do
so now yes it pains me greatly on
multiple levels we have one
international right now but that's sort
of an exception because most of the
startups don't have the resources to
address the visa documentation issue but
it's something that we'd love to help
change over time so we got one but we'd
like to have many many more yes we
haven't encountered that particular
situation yet and we want the person to
live and work here in one of these
cities to the extent possible because
that's going to be a big part of the
social experience another thing so I we
probably wouldn't want to have that
situation they can't express preferences
and we try to meet them because it's
just good for everyone if someone goes
where they want to go but in order to
get into the program they have to know
that there's some flexibility involved
because we may not be able to find you
know that company for them in that City
I joke sometimes that's like we can't
invent companies you know it means like
the companies that are in these cities
are what they are and you know it is a
fit great I'd say we satisfy preferences
a majority of the time and often when
they get into the interview process they
realized that their preferences might
not be as fixed they thought
iris gentlemen doubt about what your
long-term goal was 30-year plan this is
just more of some feedback as you grow
you might want to consider venture for
America veterans and doing the same
model for our people coming out of the
military or venture for America
mid-level people not necessarily right
out of university but in the mid group
that have been working but also yeah I'd
love all of those things I just want to
erase inefficiencies and I there are
tremendous and efficiencies around the
populations you just described we'd love
to do that
veterans mid-level more experienced etc
yeah we do you thought I'm expanding
internationally are you cool to us so so
some people have started venture for
Canada and venture for India with our
blessing I joke that we don't really
want to start venture for Earth it just
seems a little too grandiose and there's
enough to do here well one of my so my
personal motivation obviously I like
entrepreneurship in the rest of it but
I'm American my kids are gonna grow up
in this country I want to help this
country you know if other people want to
help their countries that's fantastic
but that's not really why I started
venture for America you know I feel very
indebted to this country because I'm a
you know I mean second generation like
relatively recent arrival and yeah I
just saw there was a problem and I
thought I might have a shot at
contributing to its solution so that's
just my personal motivation you know who
are like 30 years from now I'm sure
someone will succeed me and say Andrew
yang so short-sighted venture for
venture for Earth and then there'd be
this giant globe I'm gonna be like our
founder didn't have the vision that I
have now like I said
so think you could eventually figure out
how to bring it together without well we
try and help better for Canada venture
Pina I mean I'm very like supportive
it's just it part of its that I think
organizations do need to you know walk
before they can run and focus on what
they need to do and the u.s. there's so
much work to do here
I'm also much more familiar with the
setting here in the backdrop though
people in Europe have told me like in
England this is super pronounced than
that just replaced New York and San
Francisco with London and replaced
financing consulting with finance at
consulting so so they're so they're like
issues around the country I think there
are some universal truths here about
just the fact that resources influence
the flow of talent and that if those
market forces aren't somehow
