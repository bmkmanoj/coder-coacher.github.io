you
it's my pleasure to introduce professor
a shoe Sabharwal our God is beat up from
iit delhi and his PhD from ohio state
university he's a professor at rice
university currently and also fellow of
the I Triple E so what really amazes me
what our shoes you know he's a
researcher in information theory you
know as theoretical as you can get and
then probably frustrated by lack of
platforms he goes on to develop warp to
test his theoretical ideas and now you
find pretty much all the so-called
systems researchers universally adopt or
to test their ideas and that's you know
amazing and then what I find is he tells
me he gets more satisfaction when his
theoretical colleagues actually use the
platform because for a thin addition to
find the value in a system platform I
guess is even more valuable so with that
I'll let our show please give him a warm
welcome you have to be careful what you
say over lunch it gets repeated in the
introduction so I wanted to start by
thanking Microsoft's which was a great
when I was approached I immediately said
yes and and I gave it a few topics I so
I can talk about this I can talk about
that isn't going to talk about
experimental wireless and warp so turns
out the so we are actually done to two
hands on workshop in India few years ago
one in iit delhi and morning iit-madras
and they were very good two days you sit
and learn how to actually use war for
actual Wireless experiment design and
experimentation so we thought we could
just repeat it turns out that between
our last workshop and now the questions
rose in India have changed so bringing
any hardware in and out of the country
is quite hard so we had to innovate so
this led to an interesting problem and
so that's the end result this innovation
I am actually going to I have a very
vague topic you know all the other
topics I thought were very clear what
the topic would be about most of you
have no idea what I'm going to talk
about
all wireless systems have antennas what
is this thing or near and far and so my
objective today is kind of twofold I
want to actually be able to give it a
bit of sense that there is no distinct
there is no fight between theory and
experimental design or systems research
okay they are just in my opinion
dimensions of answering specific
questions and I'm hoping that that i can
give you guys some examples from my own
experience we're following both
approaches in some linear combination
was very useful to answer the question
we had at hand and then what we will do
with the lectures and workshops we would
like to use all the time to learn so in
my lectures I would only talk about
theory and in the experiments you would
actually do something which has will not
look any related to other than the top
topics and explore actually how do you
explore actual data you will actually
get data by using your browser's from a
set of work node sitting in Houston in
real time and you be able to actually
start analyzing some data and start to
actually get used to the idea of getting
real data and how to actually make sense
of it so with these two pieces I am
hoping that there is some appreciation
that there is a methodology to this
madness of research with different
people seem to have different flags that
theory flag this fact they actually
they're all in my mind just two ways of
doing research okay so with that lengthy
introduction I'm going to dive in so
lots of people i want to thank thing i
want to thank when everybody's paying
attention not at the end of it so of
course to microsoft research which in my
opinion doing great contribution to
research in india i hope everybody
everybody appreciates it so i want to
actually thank them again thank to mango
communication the folks who make war
part where now and they actually because
of this logistical challenge that we
couldn't bring kits we ended up building
this framework just for this workshop
called war cloud they actually built the
framework all the workshop materials
which you're going to use in there
is designed by them actually I haven't
even seen it myself that clearly and
they are actually the one hosting right
now so they're awake in Houston right
now while you guys are doing it they
will be available for support goes to
ISC faculty for all the support and then
Nitin and killed who were I don't know
whether they volunteered or they were
volunteered to serve as your tea is this
afternoon and tomorrow and so they are
actually the local experts here on the
workshop material so feel free to ask
them tons of questions they will be
there to support and thanks to all of
you for being a very active audience I
know you'd be asking a lot of questions
up front so with that I want to say a
few words before we dive into some
details if you look at the research in
Wireless especially or more broadly
communication over a noisy channel that
actually has very deep and very useful
theory so the key word is not deep the
keyword is useful theories an
information theory especially has
enjoyed a long period of success things
which have been shown by theory have
translated into actual products in fact
the first set of this theory to practice
translation was telephone line modems
there was a time and telephone line
modems continuously improved in speed
and they were all theoretical advances
in fact if you heard of named David for
know he was an MIT professor who also
had a company and was involved in doing
this research on both sides and
translating into products and then with
wireless that trend continued quite a
few concepts which are there in your
phones today actually have a theory
backing so the invert information theory
has been very good at has been modeling
noise in the channel and multi-user
aspects in a system you know how do we
share spectrum how do you share
resources on the to complement that is a
network theory which often is very
focused more on modeling traffic side of
things how traffic changes how do you
deliver traffic quality of service
constraints and how does it impact
resource sharing in that sense and so in
my opinion both have been highly
impactful so in in practice however
there is as Victor also pointed out
is often a gap between taking a
theoretical idea to practice this is
where I think systems research shines
and they often you know the thing is
that a lot of theory is is uses very
simple model and have to do so for
tractability of analysis as a result if
you have very complex systems they often
not easy or even possible to analyze so
then you left with two options either
you can simulate your whatever system
you're designing a new protocol or a new
architecture which allows you full
control completely repeatable so there
are some benefits of simulation but like
anything else your accuracy of the
results depends on the models you use in
your simulator okay and then of course
you can go to experiments where you can
quantify realizable gains but
experiments are often really complex to
actually decode so if I think most
people in systems struggle with being
able to explain in many cases why the
system works the way it works what is
the dominant bottleneck so I think good
systems papers are those which actually
not only build a system show gains but
also explain the why of those gains and
what was the bottleneck this is why part
is we're generally theory shines very
well so that's why in my opinion really
there are just three axes three tools as
a researcher you have either you do a
little bit of theory or simulations or
our experiments as a way to answer a
specific question so the the thing to
remember is a research question you are
trying to answer and these are your
tools at hand to answer them so that's
why I believe there should be all seen
in 11 light now the challenge with
wireless experiments how many of you
have some experience with wireless
experiments here let's say ten percent
okay so perhaps you guys can relate to
it you know if you're building any
wireless network experiment you have to
work with a physical layer a Mac layer
perhaps and they often if you're
actually changing something there you
often they have different design flows
you know they actually even things are
written different
which is so there is really generally no
single programming environment which
allows you to do so which makes the task
harder as a researcher you actually put
in a lot of effort before you have an
operational test bed then of course
there are complex interactions there are
all sorts of parameters set everywhere
you would have set thresholds and
parameters you have no idea how things
are actually getting impacted so and on
top of that wireless channels are not
repeatable okay so these are just the
things as in experimental is you would
have to deal with okay now there are
well known ways you can actually work
with these but some of the top part I
have to say that the community over last
decade has done a good job out of born
out of frustration there have been
several platforms which have been come
about so usrp is one I think you guys
most people know about us RP definitely
a very valuable platform low-cost and
easy to work with Sora from Microsoft
another one which uses a different
architecture again targeted towards
allowing rapid prototyping and then rice
warp is another another point in that
space of platforms which is available
for one to work with so I wanted to give
a little bit of history how that came
about i think is as a student is very
important receive what happened in the
back so before what happened actually we
failed a lot so again to reemphasize
victors point often is failure is when
you learn things that generally leaves
you potential success if you stick with
it so it before 2006 we actually had
tried many off the shell things and and
we have a you know a stock room full of
hardware we had bought which was not
useful for experiment after trying out
for years so in the end we decide we're
going to build our own and that's
actually a major undertaking as a
university we generally don't have the
expertise to build such complex hardware
anyway we got funded by national science
foundation in 2006 the first team I was
very fortunate to have very good
students who designed the version 1
hardware and too hard way they're both
actually got were sold for a while and
then I think what we did was important
for me
this Hardware really becomes useful so
imagine having a computer with no
operating system is used as this if this
is just paper weight so just being
having hardware is not the end of the
story is only the beginning of the story
for any useful platform so we actually
build full reference design a physical
layer with the mac layer on top build a
massive amount of documentation for
somebody to pick it up use it and then
lots of education material and in fact
we did 11 two day workshops which I
referred to several in us too in India
one in Egypt and one in Taiwan and then
also one in Germany ok so and now the
workshop material has matured that
actually we don't need to often hold it
online actual physical workshop people
can just download material online and do
it and the the perhaps the most crazy
thing we did was we actually distributed
80 kids 80 kids to five different
research groups from the University so
we have practically selling kits at cost
just to our friends you know somebody
called up can I can you give me three
kids then we'll ask who say we working
with they will manufacture student will
in spare time will test it put in the
box and then send it out ok that was
really crazy thing to do because we
thought we'll make ten extra kids from
friends that number became 80 80 in a
year or so at that point Patrick Murphy
who who is a founder of mango
communication was my PhD shouldn't
decide to take a leaf from PhD and say I
think it's time to start a company this
june university should not be doing it
so he took the hundred percent ownership
of company i decided to stay on the open
source side to continue growing the open
source aspect of it and then till
twenty-twelve he was essentially
manufacturing and shipping warped kids
and supporting all the users and then he
decided that he is going to do the
version 3 hardware which was released in
mid-2012 was cheaper better you know
smaller became quickly the most you know
widely adopted version of warp and then
this last year he they released a new
version of warp lab I'll talk what that
is and a fully operational open sourced
a 2 2 dot 11g design so you can download
this you can see the whole physical
layer Mac
and muck with it and it's completely
interoperable with commercial devices
okay now this is a plot i got from
patrick before coming here so now there
are around more than 800 watt nodes all
over the world around hundred and thirty
research groups you can see many
research groups actually have many work
notes with a build networks out of it
and then they increasingly every year we
see more and more papers that is using
warp to do their research so we actually
maintain a list on the website you can
go see how people in creative ways are
using a platform to do their research I
will actually mention the argos platform
little bit later which is nowadays what
with keeping us busy at rice and then
lots of full duplex experiments were
done on warp and there is a very nice
distributed and multi-user mimo paper
written mobicom paper using USC and
these are just some of them you know at
this stage there are like 100 50 60
papers written using a warp la folk I
said we actually build different design
flows so because physically requirements
are different from a clear requirements
so over the years as we needed something
for research we will build it and then
release it so this is how all of it came
about so what lab is what plus MATLAB so
if you know how to use matlab you can
actually use warp through from MATLAB
and that's very very powerful and very
heavily used design club it actually
quickly gets you two doing experiment
through MATLAB it's not real time system
but it allows you to try crazy ideas in
MATLAB with real channels and so it
allows you to send raw transmit and
receive waveforms and we actually
heavily uses power multi-antenna
multi-node experiments all on an
ethernet see at the same time we had
built a real-time physical layer around
10 megahertz OFDM physical layer which
has modes which are not found in any
commercial system so this was again to
promote research in in physical layers
which you cannot find in commercial
product so the first line is all the
things you find in commercial products
second is an example of something which
hasn't made it
any commercial product and we will talk
about it more morning a little bit these
are called cooperative physical layer
you two nodes distributed notes get
together to help each other at
physically at symbol level and then of
course the dot 11 design is available
for you to play with okay so that's a
quick overview of what warp is if I
recommend going to the website and
looking at it for more information what
we will try to achieve I'm as I said I'm
hoping that we can appreciate there is a
nice Theory experiments connection so as
a moving that I can give some exposure
to that but hopefully i will give some
examples where a theory inspired certain
practice and then vice versa will
practice inspired new theory and in my
opinion you know a successful research
program should try to address all
aspects of you know you should have
theory courses you should have courses
which might use a simulator like NS 0 NS
three or and then also have a you know
experiment courses which actually
promote experiments and as a student I
think you should not decide yourself to
say I'm a theoretician or experimental
you should just solve problems whatever
the right tools solve the problem is
okay so so as as i mentioned actually
have a theoretician by training
information theory you know will be Tara
tations are good at distracting things
and very simple model trying to get some
basic insight and that's the approach we
will follow for the lecture part and
what we will do is essentially start
with something very basic which I will
believe everybody in the room knows my
mo right is that correct anybody doesn't
know my know if I start with that
nobody's going to say no yeah so
everybody knows it right and then I will
actually go to a multi-user system where
I actually talked about in some new
theory results in a in context and the
impact will be clear hopefully with a
simple example i will give and this is
an example where you have all the
antennas on one node and then going two
antennas on different
that's where the near and fall comes
from and then I will go back in the
reverse direction tomorrow where you saw
how far antennas can collaborate with
each other that'll be the cooperate
environment come back to this full
duplex where near antennas become
interference to each other now as I said
both since we're short on time what I
will say in lectures will teach
something or inform something and then
the labs will inform something else
which are hopefully complementary to
what I'm doing the lectures and then I'm
hoping their bit discussions which will
help harmonize some of these ideas so
let's get started the mime apart is a
very quick overview so there is actually
no new concept other than what the
massive MIMO research which is going on
I will take only 34 slide for that and
then in the second part is where I will
introduce a new idea the new theory idea
which invert recently all right so
before the magma we will just talk about
what's the basics of wireless so that
everybody has the same terminology in
mind I think everybody knows here
wireless but so this will be a little
bit boring but hopefully you will have
the same notation and then quickly dive
into why multiple antennas help this is
again a refresher and then my sim mammal
ok so truly what is information transfer
information transfer is equivalent to
energy transfer if you can transfer
energy from one point to another that is
the fundamental way you actually
transfer information from one point to
another ok so how do we do so in
Wireless we actually have energy being
translated into electromagnetic waves
which is a part of which is what is
captured at the receiver where the
antennas convert electromagnetic waves
back to current ok so the the amount of
information transfer you can do is
directly related to amount of energy
transfer you can do ok so there is an
equivalent for us is essentially if you
are trying to hear somebody the closer
you are actually you have more energy
transfer from that person and then if
you are further away you actually have
less energy transfer that's why the
information rate content actually
reduces depending on the distance from
the speaker ok so
what we also immediately know from this
picture that the received energy is
always less than the transmitted energy
you can't get more than what was
transmitted so instead of looking at
actual energy and information what's
more interesting is to look at the rate
of energy transfer and information rate
how much sustained energy transfer you
can do so the parameters we actually
like to work with is energy per unit
time which is power and then information
with bits per unit time which is rate
are so those will be our two symbols we
will see in different forms that we
would like to work with how much energy
you can transmit per unit time and at
what is the rate you can transmit per
unit time ok and then a simplified model
really helps again actually completely
comes from electromagnetic theory where
this model comes from anyway you have a
received energy which is a function of
the transmitted signal so your received
antenna has gets a power of P sub R so
the amplitude square root of piece of
our and then it is being received at the
receiver where is some noise gets added
to the system mostly because of the
circuits analog circuits in the front
end okay the noise is not added by the
channel noise is actually a circuit
noise okay so with that simple model one
can ask this question if energy transfer
is ready to information transfer what is
the maximum amount of information wait
you can actually transfer at okay so if
i can transfer certain amount of energy
what is the maximum rate i can send it
at and that's the classic question is
the first question you start in
information theory class and in
information theory class you of course
go through a month-long derivation to
get to this formula but it it is the
maximum rate at which you can reliably
transfer information from one point to
another node and this formula the two
things which we talked about our part of
the formula this is the received power
that's the energy transfer rate and it
is directly related to and the sea which
is a maximum rate we can send that ok
that's the information transfer so now
we have licked information transferred
directly to energy transfer okay and
that's the famous channels channel
coding theorem this is for additive
white
gaussian noise channels so if you are an
engineer once you given this formula you
immediately ask how can i increase
capacity two options there are only two
variables P and Sigma square two options
you either increase the received power
or you decrease your circuit noise okay
how can you increase received power you
use a bigger antenna is equal to of
having bigger ears or you can have
directivity that's equivalent of holding
a horn and sending more directive
information energy in one direction okay
if I can have a directive and now and
align it towards you i can send i can
transfer more energy to you okay so but
we know that collecting more power
immediately translates into more
information transfer yeah everybody with
me so far yes the band with this yeah I
deliberately kept it to one hurts right
good point i should mention it in the
slides it yeah thank you
and then if you want to decrease
receiver noise where does the receiver
noise come from as I said from analog
front end that's essentially thermal
noise enjoy analog circuits or your
analog to digital converter adding
quantization noise okay you can improve
both often comes at a certain cost and
what why does reducing noise even at the
same power helps you transfer more
energy basically when you have noise
whatever you transfer is getting
prettier by noise if you have smaller
noise the perturbation is smaller allows
you at the receiver end to distinguish
between two signals better and oil that
allows you to pack things more more in
the same space so that's why you can
send more information okay okay so
that's the basic famous formula in
practice we all know Wireless doesn't
work that way that's the free space
design wireless when you actually send
any electromagnetic wave in practice you
will have reflections and in fact even
worse so that the environment changes
with time so either the reflectors or
the transmitter receiver are relatively
moving if we are all like bags of water
we are seventy percent outer body is I
think water so we actually are very good
reflectors and absorbers of energy so be
moving actually changes the wireless
signals from the AP so what that leads
to is a time varying multipath which is
the multipath signals changing leads to
this fading system so you ask me this is
what you will see that the received
power as a function of time is not
constant it will be varying because
something is moving in the environment
so either the transmitter is moving or
the receiver is moving and or then by
their reflectors along the way are
moving
it is a linear time varying system
because it follows yeah this follows
Maxwell's laws so it is always a linear
system yeah other unless you actually
remove you know diffraction diffraction
is not so but that's the typical model
we use linear time varying system yes
yeah that's like the most basic things
yeah and it's quite accurate
right absolutely you talk about like an
amplifier going yeah
the channel is still linear
time-invariant system this is the
wireless channel here what searchin was
talking about was what happens at the
transmitter receiver now you can choose
to include in the told channel then you
will get a nonlinear system or in this
case you're only quantifying what the
actual proposition from the antenna to
the other antenna is so energy leaving
from an energy getting received at the
end well this is what this model is
about well you write once you decide
that I'm going to make it digital to
digital model what was sent digitally
and what was received is really then you
have to deal with all those issues okay
now also this is virtually very
important I'm glad this question with us
so for self interference those are the
dominant effects okay and so actually
modeling them is an important thing that
is what you need to understand what
really happens in an actual system and
what are the dominant effects which
actually impact your performance however
for a transmission like this where you
are sending from one node to another
those are not the dominant effects your
your loss which is the loss due to
transmission movement of the environment
and the receiver noise those are
actually the dominant effect that's why
we actually ignore non-linearity than a
DC's okay so debris often is very first
thing you do is you don't model
everything you say what are the dominant
things which actually affect me then
they only model those that will give you
first order accurate answer then if you
decide you want to add you have to go
those you do have to quantify other
things then you will actually have a
more complex model okay
so what is this time varying model do
that you actually have because you're
getting more received power at one point
or less received power that's what this
y-axis is you can say more received
power is good because you can you know
we immediately saw that receiving more
power is good because we can get more
information at that time time instant
and then less is bad right it's kind of
to university too so so that's why we
label good channels and back channels in
a time varying system okay so we are our
received power because as becomes it has
a time varying nature to it and that's
why we have a we have a fading channel
models or signal models now where you
have a received signal which is has an
amplitude which is time varying times
whatever was sent and then you have a
noise component a more common way of
writing is to decouple the power part
with a multiplicative factor which
amounts for the fluctuations we had and
we will then write distributions
probabilistic distributions of how
statistically that multiplying factor
changes okay so this is an example of
Rayleigh fading which is commonly used
modeled for a lot of wireless
propagation okay so now we have to ask
same question so we ask the question
that if i gave you a model y equal to p
times x of t square root of p times x 30
what is the maximum information you can
transfer and that was a channel coding
channel capacity formula you can ask the
same question now you have a channel
which is not fixed channel itself is
changing with time what is the maximum
rate you can push through this okay
turns out they actually are now over the
time we have got multiple metrics for
quantifying capacity and the two
dominant is which are studied are
related to whether the traffic is delay
sensitive or not okay so if you talking
about boys traffic which is delay
sensitive then a model where you have to
send a packet and immediate you decode
it is a better model to worry about so
that that's where the notion of outage
pacity comes in that you have to send
information and being able to decode
within a certain deadline for that case
we define the notion of out this
capacity which is intuitively as follows
that if you're sending packets at a rate
are each of them quoted at a rate R and
then you're these packets are traveling
from the transmitter to receiver over a
time varying channel you may encounter
that one other packet goes through a
channel where the received power is not
sufficient to support that rate are
because the capacity at that moment is
actually lower than the rate itself and
the channel coding theorem goes both
ways he says is the best you can do and
if you try to do more than this you
can't send anything reliably that's the
powerful part of the chunk of the
converse okay so if you have a bad
channel it leads to the last packet so
that allows you to actually define this
notion see it in this term that if your
channel capacity itself is not time
varying and you can use the same formula
where now you have replaced you received
power with the power term the constant
and the the magnitude square of the
channel coefficient okay so what you're
talking about here is that now you have
channel coefficient which are changing
with time and then some channel
coefficients are bad the number is too
low gives you low capacity okay all
right so since we know the channel
capacity is time varying so the outage
capacity is defined as what the rate at
which you are sending these packets or
the generated which these packets are
encoded times probability how often your
capacity itself is greater than the rate
you are sending it them at encoding them
at okay so what's this is basically good
put in in different literature that you
sent a packet at rate R what's the
probability it will make it that the
channel will be good enough to support
it that means channel allows enough
energy power transfer for it to be able
to decode it ok you can rewrite this
probability of success of getting a
packet as 1 minus probability of failure
that is
your capacity drops below rate our and
that is often used phrase in the
cellular which is probability of outage
what's the outage how often you will
lose a package okay so your prog outage
capacity is directly related to what is
the success rate you have of being able
to send those packets across so actually
this afternoon you will do some
exercises very simple exercises which
will you will get this probability of
outage which will call frame error rate
or packet error rate in your exercises
but they will be actually quantifying
this number four different modulation
which is equivalent of sending at
different rates okay okay so one
question one could ask if you look at
this formula if your point should be
increase our or degrees are so let's say
we increase our so put somebody want to
comment on what happens to the outage
capacity if increase our this increases
what happens to this everybody know
understand why is that the case okay but
the product we do not know how it will
behave this is increasing this is
decreasing we do not know how the
product looks like sorry very good and
then if you decrease this decrease is
that increases that there is a sweet
spot and that sweet spot depends on the
distribution of H of T okay so
inequality will of course get you some
bound but you can actually find a sweet
spot in some cases you cannot solve this
that what is the rate you should choose
if you know a certain distribution of
your channel okay now as I said there
are two matrix which are used one is an
outage capacity the other one is ergodic
capacity which is good for delay
insensitive traffic okay so here is a
this is where she shines is to create a
mental models which are may not be
possible so here is let's say we have a
traffic which has no delay constraint
okay I have a bucket of bits infinite
bucket of bits
I need to transfer them from one point
to another reliably that means other
side candy code and decode them as the
same bits they are here and I know my
channel is changing over time I have no
constraint take forever you want but I
would like to get them across what is
the capacity in this system when you
have no decoding delay constraint ok
that is out in this case this is the
notion of regarding capacity in this
case you will actually not just force
yourself to decode after the end of
every block you send you will actually
send lots and lots of bits over large
long long time and eventually decode it
you know kind of wait forever and decode
at the end all the bits together turns
out that's the right thing to do and
then in that case your performance is
then determined by the average channel
characteristics is no longer determined
by what happens at each time moment in
outage capacity we are determined by
channel for this block or packet was bad
hence I lose it because I need to decode
it immediately in this case since you
can wait to decode you can recover some
of it later on is depends on how you
code the system ok so concepts inspired
by this regarding capacity actually use
in systems and a very reduced version of
it if you think about a RQ and others
are actually using and channel
variations in a certain way of course
they have feedback which is slightly
different from this model ok but i won't
go into that we will actually revisit
some of this tomorrow so let's go back
to our outage capacity ok so we have a
outage capacity which is rate where
times how often you can get the packet
through successfully and then C of T is
essentially did remember there is a
probability distribution over edge and
we have a term insight which is mod of
HT square so what we would like to do to
increase this capacity we have to
somehow change its distribution we have
to make this probability more favorable
more often you should get something
across ok and there is one way of doing
that is using multiple antennas
okay so how do how does that work out so
imagine now you have a receiver which
has multiple antennas and perhaps the
same environment and now you are getting
two signals at two different antennas
and in this case if these antennas are
sufficiently separated what has been
observed in practice that you would be
able to get channel variation over those
two antennas which looks statistically
uncorrelated okay that what's happening
at my aunt know when the channel goes
bad or good is not the same times are
not related to what's happening at this
next antenna on the same device so for
example your new smart phones iPhones
and galaxies most of them have two
antennas now receive antennas for
cellular systems okay and they are
essentially leveraging this principle
they are getting the same signal to do
antennas and leveraging it to get a
higher reliability and essentially
changing the distribution of that H okay
so why does if they are core
uncorrelated or independent in this case
you can show they are independent that
then the probability that both channels
are bad is probability that each of
these channels bad times square so that
the total probability you get a bad
channel aligned up is smaller than each
of those channels independently this is
equivalent of adding redundancy in Jenny
system if system fails with certain
probability you add a redundant
resonance into the system that the total
system failure is become epsilon square
right raid arrays work the same
principle okay all right so in fact you
can write this this is the most
complicated slide I have over two days
with one receive antennas we said the
probability of failure which is outage
so I am talking about outage probability
now not capacity with one receive
antenna your probability determines is
that the list log term is less than rate
R that means you send something and it
was less than your desired rate you can
turn this around and that that this H of
T squares is less than this threshold
which is inversely proportional to s and
not averages are not in the system so
snr is just PR over sigma square
when you have to receive antennas like I
described what you can show is that the
now just right formula for you is outage
probability is some of both random
variables h 1 T square plus s to T
squared less than 2 to the power R same
same for fish same threshold that is
same as norm of H okay so you can see
now your total in a left side has
actually increased so it will be less
often that you will be less than this
quantity so your outage probability will
go up or down down yeah alright so what
this does is that the received diversity
leads to power gain you essentially gain
power another way of looking at it is I
had one antenna I was getting certain
amount of power I put another antenna I
get more power okay and in this case
that power this directly translates into
higher mutual information or higher
capacity term where you have law 1 plus
norm H square of that same snr put
coefficient ok what's the way of
actually getting this reaching that term
is actually very simple if you have one
of the antennas receiving where the
channel coefficient is h1 other one
receiving with channel Kofi on h2 so the
received signals look like this I have
dropped teal here so y 1 is h1 x plus
noise y 2 is h2 x plus noise all you
need to do is take these things combined
it by multiplying this by h 1 conjugate
and this 2 y by h 2 conjugate add them
up that is a right combining way of
combining both the signals which leads
you to that power gain okay so that's
received diversity that is why i
received diversity helps everybody knew
this okay just a refresher as I said
transmit diversity is a dual of this so
instead of having to receive antennas
now I have to transmit antennas so to
think about that I was receiving now I
need to send a packet back so instead of
having to receive I have to transmit
antennas
transmit beamforming is a dual of
receive diversity which is just
described so instead of waiting the two
signals after you receive them you wait
the to transmit signals before you send
them so you will have h 1 conjugate of X
going from one it's the same signal but
you are waiting it differently and h 2
conjugate of X coming from this antenna
it goes through the two channels h1 and
h2 in this case and then you end up with
this is what you are actually sending
you end up with again norm square square
root of P R X plus noise at the receiver
okay so instead of in the receive
diversities you were combining them
after receiving them in transmitting
search you combine and then the channel
adds them up for you because you have
single Aunt Emma okay so that's what
channel is adding up signals for you
okay so this leads you to say mutual
information that's why I say it's a dual
you actually get the same mutual
information with transmit beamforming so
two antennas transmitting and two
antennas receiving H again lead to this
duality okay this is also called
beamforming you're essentially if you
look at the spatial pattern after you've
actually done this processing you will
find out that there is more energy being
directed at this antenna receive antenna
and less so in other direction okay the
360 degree integral always has to be the
same power so if you want to increase
power power in one direction you have to
steal from other directions that's what
beamforming essentially does okay and
there is called beamforming for obvious
reason it looks like a beam okay so
that's the refresher now where are we
going with all this so if you do you
guys know where dot11 ACA to dot 11ac
right how many of you know what's the
big differences between the previous
generation of dot11 and AC multi-user
MIMO yeah so that's that's again
something which was there was suggested
in theory many years ago we studied for
a while that if you and in the rear
in for studying there was as follows so
one could do my mo which have more
multiple transportation at the one end
the transmitting end and multiple
receiving end however with small
form-factor devices like phone to and
putting two antennas was already very
hard putting more is just not possible
okay so how do you use something which
has large number of and now your
infrastructure node and get multiplexing
gain out of it some are send more
information streams and multi-user MIMO
became is one common where one obviously
well not obvious one way of doing it is
to you assembly beam form to multiple
users simultaneously so instead of gin
is sending one data stream to one user
in one time slot in the same time slot
now you can send multiple data streams
to more users ok so in this case if you
can think of this system as multiple
antennas here on the transmitting end
and multiple antennas on the receiving
end it's just that those antennas they
want different devices but you are
actually using the same my mo concept
but thought differently you still have a
matrix which you need to work with of
channels which allows you to have to
send support such VI concept and a
common way of doing so if you want to
keep the receive processing simple is to
use a beam forming method multi the bee
pollen method called zero forcing what
that does it adds one more constraints
you want to send information in one
direction but you want to send no energy
which is intended for this user to any
of the other users because they not
interested in that energy in that data
stream so you want to zero force that
means you want to make sure that you
send zero information of this user do
any of the other users ok so you create
nulls that means you create such that
there is no energy being sent from this
data 32 any of these streams and that's
called zero forcing beamforming and we
know that if you have el antennas on the
infrastructure k users you can support a
minimum of l comma k data streams
simultaneously ok that is called
multiplexing gain the way to improve
multiplexing
jane is of course to increase L number
of antennas then you can support higher
number of K okay all right so that's
where the I think dot 11ac supports
maximum of eight antennas and LTE
example has at least in standards up to
a maximum of eight if I remember
correctly but most ltd deployments what
rigid deployment don't use more than two
or four I think only in some European
countries it is there as you thinking of
eight so we are kind of limited at less
than ten numbers in actual system what
if you had huge number of them perhaps
100 antennas ok so this zero forcing is
actually quite difficult to do
computationally turns out if you have a
very large number of antennas then a
very simple idea which is the transmit
beamforming used for one user which is
also called conjugate beam forming
becomes actually optimal you don't even
have to do zero force you can use the
same idea just cents a min same
beamforming idea for each user and then
just add them up and that was actually
proposed by this paper by Mars etta
which had load that the limit of it that
if you take this base station with
arbitrary number of antennas what can
you do ok all right so turns out that
this is a beautiful concept which has
tons of challenges one of them is as you
can imagine when you make something so
big you're more antennas that means you
have more channels to learn more users
again more channels to learn so you
essentially have order km channels to
learn remember in transmit beamforming
you need to know what the channel
coefficient is for you to wait it
correctly if this h1 h2 you need to h 1
conjugate h 2 conjugate you need to know
the channel that learning process
becomes problematic let's say if you
have a hundred antennas with 50 users
that's 500 channels you have to learn
and they are time varying right changing
with time but if it is possible to do so
then there are great gains available so
this is a paper written by folks at Rice
my colleague Lynn Jang and his student
merge data was some Bell Labs folks are
also involved which actually look at
this x
very mental results which looks at the
total capacity in bits per second per
Hertz and the number of base station
antennas and you can see there is a
increase continuous increase when you
are using zero forcing as a number of
antennas increasing even simpler
techniques like conjugate beam forming
does give you increased course less than
zero forcing but there is a value to
having more antennas ok so if you in
case you guys are wondering how did they
go up to 64 clay Shepard actually built
it so this is the version one of the
Argos array we have a trice this has 64
and nourish each of these are actually
driven by a watt bulb in the back so
this is a the scalable nature of warp
actually helped and then there are
actually for the first version they have
17 wat bolts driving these 64 antennas
17 board is I to be doing clock
synchronization among all of them so the
version 2 of this array architecture
actually now we have 96 antennas which
can scale to 144 what it allows us to do
is to ask and potentially answer what if
questions if you had so many antennas
could you what could you do with it you
may never see an actual access point
with so many antennas but it can
possibly be a useful tool to answer
questions which you may want to ask now
with move to higher frequencies more
antennas are also becoming quite viable
60 gigahertz hundred gigahertz the
wavelengths are smaller you can actually
already people are already packing
sixties and 4248 or 64 antennas in
arrays so this is where actually the
trend is going to be again some of the
hopefully some of the wisdom be gained
from here might be transferable as those
frequencies but those frequencies have
their own interest in challenges ok so
to support all this as again you know as
we were doing this research we found
there are certain other tools we need to
even do the research and those massive
MIMO tools are also available on what
dot rice or ed you that if you want to
do experimentation with large arrays
large could be a tent in a 1632 whatever
that number is then you can actually use
those tools which are now geared towards
large area systems
okay sure that problem is always there
yes yeah all amplifiers pretty much our
I have a non linear regime the ones
which are used in practice oh you mean
like 60 gigahertz an awesome yeah
absolutely they often also transmit very
small amounts of power they're not very
high power systems yeah okay so actually
with that I will there have been we're
done with the mime apart I realize I'm
any little bit slow but I wanted to
actually move to the next part if there
are no more questions which is the four
internal aspect so if you you don't
build a system which has only one user
you will have a system which has
multiple users so the question you can
ask is what's the best way of supporting
all these users again information theory
attack would be I would first have to
create a signal model what is the energy
transfer equation essentially a power
transfer equation in this case again we
can use Maxwell's to drive this you
actually get if you enter send two
signals they are linearly add up on the
antenna that is why you get is received
signal which is some channel modulate
channel x your own signal another
channel x a second second signal in
noise okay so in this case two signals
are being added up okay so that's what
the receiver sees the receiver has to
now make sense of data from the two
signals okay so you could actually say I
am going to send this a trait r 1 some
you know my rate trance information
transfer rate R 1 here information
transmitted we r 8 r 2 and then the
question to instead of asking what is
the highest rate you ask what are the
all possible best rate payers okay so
you will have rate pairs or were not
what are all these things are again
support turns out that is also very well
understood the for additive white
Gaussian noise Channel
region actually is a pentagon which
actually is driven by only three
inequalities that the best you can do on
our one is same as the capacity you
could get for a single link right this
is exactly the same formula 1 plus p h 1
squared over sigma square whatever you
could do best on r2 is the same thing
depending on where you see power you get
from user to and turns out that the sum
is now determined by the sum of the
total powers that such a little bit
counterintuitive it actually requires a
proof and it's not very straightforward
to immediately understand if you're not
used to the idea okay however you do see
that this now region is shows that there
is a resource coupling that if I want to
increase have a high rate for myself r2
has to go down why server is that if you
want to increase this are one has to
decrease that means we actually shared
the resource we have to now there will
be no resource sharing issue if this was
a square that means we could send both
had our maximum rate that doesn't happen
in this case ok so is what's very
interesting is so if you actually plot
another thing this is just time sharing
the time shading is that you use a
certain fraction of time and I use
certain fraction of time whenever we
send i sent you don't send anything
whenever you send something i don't send
anything that's time sharing what is the
time sharing capacity region is just
this triangle box but the capacity and i
just brought it out is bigger than the
triangle box okay so actually the
coordinate points tell us that you can
actually slip in more information
without backing out from the other user
not non-trivial not clear how you
actually do this okay but the best you
can do is actually better than time
sharing so there was a whole literature
on this to actually exploitation system
called multi-user detection in 90s there
was a Bay Area many people became I
Tripoli fellows writing paper on it or
become any members which actually
translate this into actual practical
system nokia's in Erickson spent tons of
money actually building it and it wasn't
with became it wasn't very practical
unfortunately when it have to implement
it but only recently in qualcomm
eventually showed it to user system
where two users can actually talk at the
same time however that did not become
part of LTE so so call come had to
shelve it but is possible to do in an
actual system with high mobility and all
those things okay so but I am going to
talk about different challenge so the if
you look at the pentagon region there is
a challenge to achieving this capacity
region okay we have 10 more minutes then
you guys can walk around and do your
workshops so this everybody wake up for
next 10 minutes all right so how do you
get this capacity region it actually
requires you to have a global knowledge
perfect knowledge of number of active
users that's how you can have to draw
this region and also you have to know
what this h1 and h2 are again you know
that knowledge channel knowledge now for
a to user system that seems like a
trivial thing to users I can measure
them however if you think about any
large network like cellular network or
even infrastructure dot11 network this
is just impossible for you to know all
the channels for all the links because
that's what you need to know to be able
to draw capacity regions like these they
will be of course even more dimension
right if there are 100 users this
capacity going to be 100 dimensional
okay too but to draw it or to write
about it you will actually have to know
all those 100 channels at one point okay
so though single entity in these systems
whether they are centralized or random
access actually has the full information
about the topology of the network or the
channels that's the reality the system
okay so question is how do decide rates
in this system okay so this actually
kind of a practical problem turns out in
information theory has never looked at
this problem which I was surprising so
this is where I think perhaps because I
word in mobicom community where
understood a lot of practical issues in
building systems one of them being that
you have to make distributed decisions
so around two thousand six or eight
beside asking what is the capacity of
making distributed decision okay so I
want information theoretic capacity that
I can do anything I want but I have to
make distributed decisions based on
local knowledge that question turned out
to be easy to pose but very difficult to
answer there were no tools actually
available for us to use and took us
several years of hit and trial in theory
now on paper to actually come to any
meaningful answers so I'm going to give
in 10 minutes overview of that
interesting answer we begin to find now
okay so first of all is in modeling how
do you model things so natural way of
modeling is this again completed derived
from what happens in protocol community
is that nodes often just have a local
view of the network I may only know one
half channels I may know to have
channels right depending on what
protocol i implement or for learning the
internet work I may have a certain half
knowledge of the network will call it a
local view of the network the thing is
that local views are mismatched what I
know about the rest of the network is
different from what my neighbor knows
because my neighbor knows the one or two
hops channeled information from me okay
so it immediately you can see this model
issue if I have to make any decision
about transmission and reception they
will be potentially different on
conflicting with what my neighbor decide
to do so lots of actually interesting
problems which happen in protocol design
are all because of mismatch of knowledge
you know even collisions are because of
mismatch of knowledge I should not if I
knew that you were going to send I
wouldn't have sent it right so but we
are asking not just in under any
circumstances if you could design any
physical layer any Mac layer as long as
you have distributed a local view what
should you do what is the optimal global
performance in information theoretic
sense when you only when you have to buy
a necessity to distribute allocation ok
so it took us a while as I said 23 years
of hit and trial but in 2009 I think
we're beginning to actually start to
in a game of the models first set of
questions and around in last few years
we actually had some interesting results
so I want to give one very basic
interesting result from that going back
to our example okay but here is an
example which is where the practical
constraints were always there in fact
their communities which have you know
done this research but the theory was
not there actually two to model those
practical constraints and and actually
to take it forward ok so it can go back
to this simple example what happens in
this simple example if each of the nose
nodes the transmitter only has one hop
knowledge one-half meaning transmitter
one only knows its own channel h1 and
transmitter to only knows is h2 channel
okay and I have to decide what rate I
should send that I don't know what the
other I know there is another user but I
don't know his channel hence I don't
know what capacity it can have and so on
so forth so what do you think will be
the one half capacity region if any of
you have take a guess I'm asking for a
lot but take a guess
yes is synchronized there good question
assume is synchronized in time
synchronized but that's all you have so
are you were going to say smile you
multiplexing the channels yes you're
right so if i understood you correctly i
think you're saying that the capacity
region is actually just again time
division so these are what you meant
okay it's a good idea to agree since the
answer is already on the board so so it
turns out that the full knowledge
capacity and is this Pentagon very
famous Pentagon is in textbooks but the
one hop knowledge capacity region and
that means you can design any coding
scheme them are you not restrict it to
anything it is not qualms or this or
that is just any coding scheme you can
have and then this is what the capacity
is it will turn out to be you can't beat
tdma okay question is why okay so we
look at a very intuitive answer to that
but this was actually just the warm-up
example in this paper so in the paper we
looked at an interference channel which
is a lot more complex than the user
channel ID drew and asked the same
question for those channel and actually
gave in examples of where we cannot be
completely derive the capacity region
for those system okay so what's
happening why is this turning out to be
optimal here so if you look from
transmitter one point of view you know
if to actual Pentagon depends on these
inequalities so if i say i haven't
transmitted one I want to draw the
Pentagon but actually it can't right it
doesn't know it knows its own rate which
is this inequality but it doesn't know
either of the two inequalities so the
Pentagon could look like this the
Pentagon could look like this and
they're going to look like this what
should you assume about the other guy
okay if it assumes the worst case
scenario turns out you should assume
that actually you know nothing so the
only thing you can actually really do is
a time division because that requires no
knowledge of the other channel I know
for sure that on this if I
just send for a fraction of time but
whatever I want to send I am NOT going
to collide with my other user in that
case I know exactly what the capacity of
the link is and I will be able to
reliably send information ok so this
tdma becomes the only approach and in
this case of course as I said we are
assuming no number of users with
assuming synchronization but what you
see is that partial information has
reduced the capacity region from
Pentagon to a triangle again and
actually many practical systems are tdma
their ship time-sharing system or you
can call them or fdma they're orthogonal
I systems only one user centered time so
they may be actually optimal close to
optimal till you change the information
infrastructure that means architecture
what information is available to whom
till you change that they are actually
opt nearly optimal or optimal in some
cases okay now I think you were bringing
out a very important point and i will
quickly it does that in practice you
have random or I was so the traffic is
bursty that means you may have time slot
one with these two guys have packets but
perhaps later in time these three people
these three nodes have packets so the
number of users is often changing over
time and that's why you don't actually
know how many users in the system who
have packet at any given time so then
you actually also need a method or have
to somehow pay a price for coordinating
who goes next even in a tdma system you
cannot decide upfront what fraction of
time i will have available okay so that
we have not modeled in theory so i do
not know the exact answer to that we
haven't found an easy way of modeling it
so it remains an open problem if you
don't have any coordination or the
number of users what is the information
theoretic capacity but if you look we
already have protocols they give dot11
trying to do this in a distributed
fashion so there is either you can do
polling or you can do a random access
where each terminal then uses a you know
random start time essentially randomizes
their start time and hopes
that only one of the nodes will win the
medium automatically divided giving us
schedule a tdma schedule okay now we
know that it's dot 11 is not a perfect
coordination at me you will see some
examples of that in your exercises today
but it's very simple highly scalable
protocol tons of literature and as I
said the exercises the afternoon will
allow you to explore dot level but you
can I do draw the capacity region of
dot11 actually it looks like this on the
same plot if this was the full knowledge
this is one-half knowledge this is a
distributed coordination okay
sports to make both these despite
interference
yeah it would be higher but rate less
course has implicitly slightly different
model if I if you're talking about the
same thing they actually have a feedback
from the receiver to transmitter is that
is not model this is zero feedback
system that's where the answers are
often very conservative the moment you
introduce feedback in the system you can
start to recover some of this back rate
list codes are stopping baseline stop
now and so you have at least one bit
feedback which will totally change and
feedback is also known to actually
change and increase multi-user capacity
regions it doesn't do it for single user
which it does it for networks for
multi-user okay right here good point so
if you know the distribution the answer
is different in this case it's actually
there is no distribution on this this is
a compound channel formulation and the
reason for saying that is that what is
the distribution in practice depend on
it you you know one way of modeling is
averages in our which is equivalent of
distance approximately right so if I'd
know nothing about the other user I
should not actually also know that
averages cenar so then I don't know
their distribution because that's the
parameter in the distribution that's
where the model is what is called a
compound channel which is like the
really the worst case scenario that's
why the answer is so pessimistic here
okay but if you think about it dot11
like systems are designed that way they
are essentially have no knowledge of
what the other guys links are right and
they of course solving the coordination
problem like how many are they of
competing but at the same time they have
to deal with lack of other people's
general knowledge sure
feedback but then this VCF in some sense
user feedback for collision avoidance
right
yeah the good point yeah so the thing is
that that feedback after I immediately I
said it you know it with some glad you
brought it up feedback is what what is
carried in the feedback i think is the
important thing so that feedback is only
for coordination the way DCF is
organized it doesn't tell you anything
about other guys channel strip unless
you can start to infer that and actually
encode it you will actually are still
only trying to get to tdma but you will
not be able to move beyond that the
perfect coordination is where you will
this is perfect coordination system okay
so actually I am a little bit over time
so i am just have a few notes for this
afternoon workshop so this is the war
club in case you are wondering how it
looks like so this is in mango
communication offices they have bunch of
tables with tons of nodes where
different configurations actually are
set up so that you can do different
experiments so they are actually
hardware different configurations but
your access to is through a browser your
handouts actually already tell you what
to do so all experiments are real time
that means use when you submit to
something that actually something will
happen on the ward board bunch of data
will be statistics will be collected and
sent it back to you through your browser
and their time multiplex among groups so
if more people submit experiment same
time the delay for you guys will
increase okay so this is a actually so I
wasn't sure whether it will be here or
not so I wasn't sure who the key is art
but your tears are sitting right here
maybe you can raise your hand so let's
listen and a kill they know all the
experiments quite well there are two
sets of labs you will do today my mo lab
is quite easy but that's just for you to
warm up so I think will take around 90
minutes to do it in 90 minutes you
should be able to run all the questions
and perhaps create a preliminary report
in Google Docs again instructions are
there the interference channel one takes
a little bit longer so we probably spend
whatever the remaining time today two
two two and a half hours
I think the groups are already decided
yeah so they have a group list perhaps
ago I already know it it will be good if
only one person is submitting
experiments from your group and other
perhaps are you know writing a Google
Doc report simultaneously I'm hoping
that everybody would write a report so
at least they can actually start to form
an answer key for answers for themselves
and so we will have each group will
actually generate two reports one today
and then another one tomorrow please use
you one of your accounts and then share
it with the account which is listed on
your handouts let's see so I think we
have said that the war cloud is actually
scheduled so only supports around 25
maybe maximum 30 accounts so please only
keep one browser login party ok so I
think that's it are there any other
questions based on what we have taught
so far or about the workshop or the
hands-on things all right
sounds good
oh you have a question the rap would
work with matlab so can we work with the
symlink also yeah so only my awesome
links so they actually the whole
physical layer is written in semi link
this is eric is a similar length file
but uses what is called ziling system
generated blocks so those are block
supplied by xilinx which are you know
you can actually have in similar links
but the warp lab itself is only through
MATLAB is probably you can write it to
simulate but I don't think anybody has
ever tried it as far as I know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
